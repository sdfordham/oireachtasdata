    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1319" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016120700002#A00200"><p>I remind members to ensure their mobile phones are switched off.  This is important as it causes serious problems for broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.</p> <p>  First, we will engage with Ms Helga Mizzi, Director General of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Malta.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Helga Mizzi to our meeting today.  She has travelled all the way from Malta to be with us and we are very grateful to her for the efforts she has made to be here today.  She is very welcome to Ireland.  The committee is continuing to work towards trying to understand the priorities and positions of our fellow European member states in all our preparations for the negotiations for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.  Malta is about to take on a big role in these discussions as it will take over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union on 1 January.  Most of our engagement with Ms Mizzi today will be about Brexit but she might also like to make a few comments about Malta's Presidency plans.  I note the warning to witnesses regarding privilege, which we all know.  I invite Ms Mizzi to make her opening remarks and I will then open the floor to questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helga Mizzi" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016120700002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the esteemed members of the committee.  I want to extend my gratitude for the invitation to me to address the committee on issues which feature front and centre on Malta's agenda, as well as on the EU&rsquo;s agenda, given they will naturally have a lasting impact on the Union and its citizens.  The timing of my visit to Dublin could not have been more opportune, given how our two Prime Ministers discussed many of the same issues we will be discussing today during Prime Minister Muscat's visit to Ireland on 28 November as part of a Presidency-related <i>tour des capitales</i>.  Our Prime Ministers discussed Brexit and a raft of other matters related to the EU and it came as no surprise to many to note how like-minded our two countries are and how we both seek out solutions which are practical and European, wherever possible.<br/><br/>This is the frame of mind with which we are approaching what promises to be a very challenging new year.  The first half of 2017 will not merely be the first EU Presidency led by Malta but it will also be the first time the EU will initiate negotiations for the withdrawal of a member state.  This is a convergence that has necessitated diligent and careful planning in Valletta.  Unsurprisingly, Brexit has taken up a good share of the bandwidth.<br/><br/>As committee members know, over the past four decades the UK has played an instrumental role within the EU, characterised by an important contribution towards shaping the Union's political thinking and strategies.  Now that Brexit looms large, the UK's withdrawal from a Union it helped to shape affects not just the UK but has repercussions for all of the member states of the EU 27, including Malta.  Over the years, the excellent ties, deeply-rooted in history, between Malta and the UK have fostered a relationship that transcends the political and economic spheres.  This is a bond that has developed even further during the past few decades through the enhancement of our bilateral relations, as well as our relations within regional and international fora, most notably within the EU and the Commonwealth.<br/><br/>Similar to Ireland, Malta is keen to preserve the four freedoms for Maltese citizens <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the UK as much as possible.  We are very conscious of the fact this is going to be a crucial issue, both for the UK and for the EU.  Above all, we do not see this as an issue of numbers of people but more as a matter of principle.  The bottom line is that there cannot be access to the Single Market without the freedom of movement of persons.  Malta is closely monitoring events in the run-up to the Brexit negotiations with a view to identifying the main areas of concern, not only for Malta but also for the EU as a whole, as well as the individual member states, with the aim of having priorities and redlines reflected in the European Council guidelines.  We will be closely looking at Brexit negotiations while also bearing in mind areas of mutual bilateral interest with the UK to, hopefully, pre-empt any negative ramifications that may cascade as a consequence of Brexit.<br/><br/>It remains to be seen how the negotiations with the UK will develop in practice because there can be no negotiations before notification.</p><p>After Article 50 is triggered, the potential impact the UK's withdrawal may have on the bilateral aspect of UK-Maltese ties will become clearer.  In this regard, Malta will try to ensure that bilateral agreements with the UK that were in existence prior to Malta's EU accession, will be kept and, if possible, reinforced in light of the developments resulting from our 12 years of EU membership.</p><p> An evident priority which Malta intends to safeguard as much as possible is the interest of Maltese nationals in the UK.  There is a five generations-strong Maltese community in the UK and we will do everything within our power to ensure that their interests are duly safeguarded.</p><p> During its tenure as President of the Council of the EU, Malta will lend its good offices wherever possible and fulfil a role which is definitely not new to us - that of being a constructive and honest broker.  While it would not be prudent to rush unduly, it is essential that the EU does not delay negotiations as this might lead to misinterpretation that could harm the EU's credibility.  Very importantly, people living both in the UK and in the EU 27 deserve to know where they will stand following Brexit and any consequences they may experience or changes they might need to undertake.</p><p> We need to start actively planning for a life beyond Brexit even though there are still a number of questions that need to be answered.  The one definite thing we can say with certainty even at this stage is that, ultimately, being outside the EU must be inferior to actual EU membership.  While the EU 27 should be kept involved and informed throughout the negotiation process, it is also crucial that Commissioner Barnier, as the Commission's chief negotiator, is afforded the time and space to enable him to fulfil his role.</p><p> The UK will still be a part of Europe, whether it is inside the EU or outside it.  As EU member states it will be essential that we maintain a common approach in regard to the challenges facing us and cooperate together in the interest of a Europe which is whole and free.</p><p> Recent events and the prevailing uncertainty in the international scenario have confirmed the importance of unity within the EU, which is key to safeguarding our common values and aspirations.  Brexit has undoubtedly underscored the increasingly urgent need to start a serious discussion on how to make the Union better and more efficient for all EU citizens.  We need to bridge the perceived gap between Brussels and the man on the street and we cannot lose sight of the fact that the EU was created for its citizens.  The role of parliamentarians such as yourselves is of course vital in this regard and I am happy to confirm that throughout Malta's six-month Presidency, regaining the EU citizens' trust will be a top priority.</p><p> In this vein, I will now take the opportunity to brief this esteemed committee on some of the major priorities throughout our Presidency.  Apart from Brexit, the Maltese Presidency will face a number of other challenges and opportunities.  Discussions on the new concept of Europe initiated in Bratislava will continue to be taken forward during our Presidency.  Within this context, Malta is currently in discussions with President Tusk's team and is making the necessary preparations in view of the summit which Malta will be hosting to discuss the future of Europe in February 2017.  The Malta summit will not be focussed entirely and exclusively on Brexit.</p><p> There is an EU agenda and the Union needs to give it due consideration and look ahead.  The Malta summit will therefore be an excellent opportunity for member states to gain some further traction on this new vision for Europe.  It will build on the Bratislava process and lay the groundwork for Rome.</p><p> The situation in our neighbourhood remains precarious with political instability in candidate countries, violence and socio-economic problems in the southern neighbourhood, and a volatile and unstable situation in the east.  The Middle East peace process, a dossier which is so close to Malta's heart as it is to Ireland's, remains moribund and seems to have stalled.  Within this context, Malta will be giving substantial attention to the European neighbourhood policy, which can play a vital role in improving the daily lives of people in the region.</p><p> Irregular migration has been one of the main and most obvious consequences of this turmoil.  Tackling this phenomenon in an effective manner requires a two-fold approach.  We need to identify and address the root causes of migration and then also act to prevent loss of life at sea whilst destroying the network of human smugglers and traffickers.  To this effect, on 8 and 9 February 2017, Malta will be hosting the Joint Valletta Action Plan senior officials' meeting, which will include the participation both of EU member states as well as African countries.  This meeting is expected to take stock of the progress made in the implementation of the Valletta action plan and should shed light on the way ahead for the Valletta mechanism.</p><p> Being an island, like Ireland, Malta will treat maritime affairs with a similar degree of importance, giving political guidance through an integrated maritime policy encompassing areas such as the marine environment, nautical tourism and the blue economy.  The Maltese Presidency will also be giving a great deal of attention to the internal market as the Union's greatest asset, along with the concept of social inclusion.</p><p> The security of our citizens is another key issue.  Over the past year, we have seen a worrying increase in terrorist attacks across Europe that are having a devastating effect on our citizens and our countries.  Despite setbacks in some quarters, enlargement remains the EU&rsquo;s most effective foreign policy tool in bringing about security, stability and good governance in the European neighbourhood.  Malta will ensure that the western Balkans remain at the very centre of the Union&rsquo;s work in this field, as it is in our interests to speed up integration so that the stability which our citizens enjoy continues to extend to the broader region.</p><p> In spite of the challenges I have alluded to, Malta remains hopeful that a bright future for the EU lies ahead.  There have been several occasions in the recent past which showed that seemingly unsurmountable challenges can, in fact, pave the way for new opportunities and avenues of co-operation.  The EU Global Strategy can prove to be one such example.  It is now up to us to move on with its implementation and translate words into action.  In today's very fitting framework, I would also like to mention that Malta shares Ireland's view that long-term plans on this front will need to keep in full view the specific security and defence characteristics of individual member states.</p><p> Having an ambitious European Union must necessitate a recognition that the importance of diplomacy, dialogue and confidence-building measures can never be undervalued.  It is in this spirit that Malta will be organising an event that brings together EU foreign ministers, Southern Partners and representatives from the Gulf Co-operation Council countries in April 2017.  The time is ripe for us to bolster our relationship and move towards an enhanced dialogue with our immediate neighbours and with our neighbours' neighbours.  It is our intention to provide an ideal forum for a constructive discussion on issues such as culture, education, youth and inter-faith dialogue in a more intimate and relaxed environment.</p><p> Allow me to conclude now by underlining the fact that as it prepares for one of the greatest challenges in its diplomatic history, Malta will look to Ireland as a steadfast, like-minded and reliable partner within the EU.  Ours is a relationship based on common values, shared histories and similar characteristics and approaches, which the committee can rest assured Malta will continue to carry forward as actively as it can.</p></speech>

Together with other members of the committee, I am glad to hear about the preparations Malta is making for the EU summit and the other meetings, as outlined.  Getting together and organising a work programme for the EU Presidency is important.  I now call on Senator Richmond to contribute to the discussion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1399" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016120700002#B00300"><p>I thank Ms Mizzi for her excellent address which is much appreciated.  I wish to pick up on a few issues by asking a couple of questions and making some points.  The first concerns Malta's forthcoming EU Presidency and I wish Ms Mizzi luck for what will be a very busy year, as I know that elections are scheduled for Malta in 2017.  She rightly mentioned Malta's efforts to rebuild civic trust in the EU, which is vitally important.</p><p>What are the Presidency's plans to reach out to the citizens of Europe?  When we held the Presidency in 2013 we had a number of very active civic dialogues, which worked well, but the key thing for us to do in order for us to try to re-promote the EU and address the populism of both the left and the right is to engage with citizens, refine the EU, be clear what the EU is about and take on board people's concerns.  We have talked about the concerns and people veering towards populism but now we must begin to act.</p><p> How does Ms Mizzi feel the Presidency will be able to drive the trade policies of the Union over the next six months?  TTIP, alas, is dead in the water with the election of Mr. Trump, in addition to considerable opposition here but especially on the Continent, but there are opportunities in Australia, New Zealand and with the Mercosur region and the Far East.  How can we prioritise those area and bring the trade deals on-stream?</p><p> I am sure a number of my colleagues will express the same concerns on Brexit as everyone who has come before the committee share, namely, the unique situation Ireland - North and South - face going into the negotiation process.  While we fully respect all the UK-Maltese arrangements prior to accession, there are a number of Anglo-Irish agreements that also need to be respected.  Our main hope is that we can both work together to avoid an overly hard Brexit.  I do not think it is in either country&rsquo;s interests.</p><p> I am in a very small minority in both Houses, and in society in general, in that I believe Ireland rejoining the Commonwealth would be a good thing.  I am aware that Malta is to take over the leadership of that body next year.  From her diplomatic experience could Ms Mizzi give us detail about how membership of the Commonwealth works for Malta, the opportunities that lie ahead and how a potential future application from Ireland would be received by Commonwealth members?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016120700002#C00200"><p>I bid Ms Mizzi a c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte, a hundred thousand welcomes.  Like other speakers I wish her every success in Malta&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU for the first six months of 2017.</p> <p>  We have had a number of guest speakers coming before the committee and prior to the Brexit vote some of us met with several British politicians who were for and against the issue.  Many of the politicians we have met are clearly of the understanding that the UK will get a very good deal from Brexit.  There is almost arrogance among some individuals who feel the world cannot do without the UK and that things would collapse without British involvement.  Former senior British Cabinet members still have a certain view of their country's place in the world.  Ms Mizzi indicated in her speech that the situation of the UK would not be better post-Brexit.  The position many countries in Europe are adopting is that the post-Brexit situation will not be a good thing for the people of the UK.</p> <p>  The biggest priority from our perspective is that there would not be a huge negative impact on the island of Ireland.  We see it as a disaster for the Irish people which might compound the divisions on the island of Ireland and impact on the Good Friday Agreement.  It will create uncertainty, fear and division and we are already seeing the outworkings of that.</p> <p>  Michel Barnier, the EU negotiator, said he has an understanding of the Irish situation because of his background as European Commissioner for Regional Policy at one stage and that he knows the unique circumstances of Ireland.  We share jurisdiction of a disputed border with the UK and Brexit could impact and cause difficulty in that regard.</p> <p>  Many of us are concerned about the impact of Brexit on people.  Any British withdrawal from membership of the EU implies huge challenges for the entire island.  Is the Government of Malta aware of the unique position of Ireland and the potential effect of Brexit on us compared to any other EU country?  Witnesses have come before the committee and spoken of the huge sympathy for Ireland in regard to Brexit.  Could Ms Mizzi expand on what such sympathy means?  We want to examine all options to allow the North to remain within the EU.  We will launch a policy document tomorrow on that issue.</p> <p>  Is there support in Malta for recognising Ireland&rsquo;s unique position?  Ms Mizzi is no doubt aware the EU proved itself capable of accommodating unique circumstances in respect of Cyprus and Greenland.  Denmark is an EU member state yet Greenland is outside the jurisdiction of the Union but it still receives European funding.  The EU also became an active persuader for the reunification of Germany.</p> <p>  Malta's neighbour, Cyprus, in the event of reunification will be fully integrated into the EU.  Seats in the EU Parliament are allocated on the basis of the entire population of Cyprus.  Does Ms Mizzi believe that such flexibility could be shown to Ireland given the inherent right of those born on the island of Ireland to Irish citizenship or British citizenship and by virtue of that right they are citizens of the European Union as well?  Would the Maltese Government be open to such a proposal?</p> <p>  Given the threat to the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process we believe there is a duty on all member states, but in particular the Irish Government as a member state of the European Union and a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement to support and safeguard the political constitution and legal integrity of the Agreement.  The EU has played a positive role in the peace process, especially with funding for reconciliation projects.  Does Ms Mizzi believe such positive political support will continue in the future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016120700002#C00300"><p>Ms Mizzi is very welcome to Dublin.  I thank her for her very informed presentation.  I am concerned about a number of issues.  I am aware there was a pre-EU bilateral agreement between Malta and the UK.  It has been a central plank of the 27 member states that there would be no bilateral negotiations with the UK.  I am not sure whether that is more about teaching the UK a lesson for being the naughty boy in class and leaving the EU without asking our permission or if it is a genuine attempt to act with a single European Union position dealing with an exiting country.  I would be interested to hear if bilateral discussions have taken place between the UK and Malta already or if Malta intends to engage in bilateral discussions.</p> <p>  I concur with what Senator Richmond said about bridging the gap with the ordinary man on the street.  With all due respect, politicians, both nationally and internationally, have been talking about that for generations, and it must be difficult to find those millions of people because the gap has not been bridged yet.  The gap has given rise to the sort of thing we are seeing right across Europe and the United States, namely, the rise of the extreme left and the extreme right and the message has been lost somewhere in the middle of it all.  That is something which greatly concerns me.</p> <p>  Defence is another issue that has been increasing in importance in Europe of late and I have some concerns about that.  The position of Ireland is very clear: we are a neutral country and that is underpinned in the Constitution.  We will not be involved in any European army or anything like it.  However, in the context of defence, defence of the citizen is something in which I have a particular interest.</p><p>Many of our thugs and criminals have moved to the Mediterranean, particularly to southern Spain, to operate from there.  Is Malta interested in pursuing that agenda where we would join police forces to make the forces much stronger than they are currently?  I know there is a lot of co-operation but maybe there is not enough.<br/><br/>Education is a problem for Ireland in particular because we have students moving between both jurisdictions.  Students from the North of Ireland study in the South and <i>vice versa</i>.  People move back and forth daily.  That will be a huge problem given the soundings that I heard from the chief negotiator yesterday where he sort of said that he understood the Irish position but he did not exactly break his heart showing that he was going to try to find a solution to the Irish Border.  One thing that is for certain is that the North of Ireland, if Brexit goes ahead, will be in another jurisdiction outside of the European Union and, regardless of whether we like it, there will be some form of Border, whether hard or soft.  I cannot see any way in which the UK which has exited would have an open border with the Republic of Ireland, nor can I see any way that the Republic of Ireland would accept a border down along the Irish Sea that would segregate the island of Ireland from the UK.  There would be a problem for the education sector, in particular for young people who travel across the two jurisdictions.  Quite a number of students from Ireland go to Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Gloucester.  There is significant crossing over and back in the education area.<br/><br/>In terms of the sympathy that people have for Ireland, sympathy only manifests itself when somebody produces a plan.  I believe it will fall to Malta to get the plan in place.  Tea and sympathy are no good in this situation.  We need a clear plan that will facilitate the unique Irish problem.  Malta, as an island nation that understands the UK and where UK residents have holidayed for quite a considerable period, as they have done here, understands the politics of this.  Ireland needs more than tea and sympathy.  We need a clear plan and Malta must put it in place.<br/><br/>In terms of the peace process, as my colleague has just adverted to, this island is recovering from a period of terrible turmoil and we now enjoy free movement to any part of the island.  People from the Republic of Ireland are only beginning to explore the North of Ireland, which is a beautiful part of the world.  It would be my deepest concern that people from the EU 26, who really do not know this island or understand the cultures that exist on this island, would make decisions without taking the time to come here and learn a little bit more about them.  I would be very anxious that Malta would constantly keep the Irish peace process on the agenda.  It took us the best part of 50 years to get it to where it is.  Let us not run the risk of losing it.  I thank the witness for her time and apologise for asking so many questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1393" speakername="Terry Leyden" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2016120700002#D00300"><p>I welcome the director general, Ms Mizzi, to Ireland.  I have visited Malta and know that it is a beautiful island.</p> <p>  Ms Mizzi mentioned in her contribution that there is a five generation strong Maltese community in Britain.  I know from my experience of visiting Malta that an enormous number of British people have retired to the island.  I do not know if Ms Mizzi has the numbers off hand or if she has an idea of the numbers involved.  I expect that Maltese people are entitled to British passports under the agreement.  Malta was very close to Britain and this relationship has continued.  When Brexit takes place and Britain leaves the EU, what arrangement will there be for Maltese people in terms of entitlement to a British passport?  Will Ms Mizzi indicate the position?  A substantial number of Irish people live in Britain and they have certain rights as far as passports are concerned.  Many British people have a right to an Irish passport.  My query is not about citizenship but about movement and travel.  I do not think the people who voted for Brexit were concerned about the British people who live in Europe or who have retired to various parts of Europe when it comes to funding and their rights.</p> <p>  Negotiations will take a long time and speculation is that they could take three or five years.  Malta is the first country to hold the Presidency following the Brexit vote.  I believe that Britain should not be left out of meetings as it is still a member of the European Union until the day a decision is made.  Article 50 is only the start of the negotiations.  It must be quite offensive to the British Government for it to be excluded from dinners organised by the European Union where 27 member states are invited to attend but not the British Prime Minister.  That is not a good way to start negotiations.  I suggest that goodwill should continue to be shown because we are going to work together, one way or the other, after Brexit.  The relationship should be maintained as long as possible.  As long as Britain contributes and pays into the EU, its political representatives are entitled to attend all meetings of the European Union.</p></speech>

I will start with the concept of citizens.  As most members have pointed out, there is a long way between theory and implementing this concept on the street and reaching out to the grassroots.  We see the Presidency as a possible tool to do just that.  Apart from obvious concerns, such as security and making citizens feel more secure, we are thinking of broadening the concept to other areas such as the Single Market where we would like to work in a concrete manner to substantiate the assistance given to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in most of our countries are the backbone of economies, especially in countries like ours that are not based on multinationals <i>per se</i>.  We will also do this through the concept of social inclusion.  We will work hard at having the EU being more inclusive in its approach, primarily but not exclusively on gender matters.  We think of these as grassroot issues that would, in one way or another, bring this monster or huge creation that is Brussels closer to the daily lives of citizens.<br/><br/>A valid point was made about free trade agreements.  It is where the EU has registered a lot of success.  It has managed to reach out to a lot of far-flung countries.  We are closely following the negotiations that are taking place close to our region of the southern Mediterranean but also in faraway countries like Singapore that have promising potential.  We would definitely not like to see a slowdown in momentum on that front.<br/><br/>In terms of the Commonwealth, Malta is the chair of the Commonwealth at present and a member of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, CMAG.  Malta hosted its second summit last November and its first summit in 2005.  In so far as benefits to Malta are concerned, and they do not necessarily apply to an Irish scenario, we have managed to come up with concrete proposals in terms of small state concerns <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>climate change.  We contributed to the climate change declaration that was adopted in Paris.  Malta adopted its own climate change declaration in November.  We have also contributed to a revitalisation of the Commonwealth institution.  We were very glad to host the summit only a few months back.<br/><br/>The Irish situation has formed part of the latest high level meetings at both prime ministerial and foreign ministers level.  We have heard the scenarios in great detail.</p><p>There is a growing understanding on the Maltese side of what the special agreement entails in terms of freedom of movement of persons.  It is important that it prevails and that it is not hindered.  I refer also to the very sensitive issue of the Good Friday Agreement.  In so far as the Maltese understanding of the scenario goes, we are going straight to the source.  Our Prime Minister was here only last week to hear the Irish concerns at the highest level.  The committee can rest assured that this is very high on the agenda within the Brexit framework.<br/><br/>With regard to unity among 27 member states, there have not been any bilateral negotiations with the United Kingdom.  As a Ministry, we are currently conducting an internal exercise with the United Kingdom that assesses the possible impacts, although we do not yet know what will be presented on the areas we deem to be of priority.  These concern social affairs, the health sector and education.  We have a number of tertiary level students pursuing their studies in the United Kingdom.  Other priorities concern passports and the diaspora element.  Right after the Brexit vote, we did hear some alarms sounding among other Community citizens in the United Kingdom.  I cannot say there are phenomenal changes in the way they have been living their lives since June but there is an element of concern, of course, including in respect of tuition and studies.  We will definitely be considering the interests of those in this category as a matter of priority.  The figure we have in our records is that 80,000 citizens of Maltese origin are living in the United Kingdom.  Of course, they all have a different history.  Every generation has a very distinct history but we will be considering the position of the rather sizeable community as a matter of priority in the next few months.<br/><br/>We have not been engaged in high level bilateral negotiations with the United Kingdom.  We are firm believers in the unity of the EU 27 and we do not believe there is any one country among the 27 that is currently questioning the concept.  We intend to take that forward in our Presidency.<br/><br/>On defence, the Irish concerns are currently very close to ours in this domain.  We have rather strict constitutional obligations back home that we tend to safeguard at every step and with every move forward taken in this respect.  As the committee knows, the global strategy launched in July focuses on soft security and hard security, but also defence.  We have no issue with the soft security and hard security aspects of that vision, which we support fully, but we will be monitoring developments concerning the strict defence aspects very closely to ensure the safeguards are in line with treaty obligations in terms of recognition of constitutional obligations of individual member states and to ensure a distinction is maintained between a close partner to the European Union, such as NATO, and the EU common security and defence policy, CSDP, operations themselves.  This is a very important dossier.  This development is relatively new, dating from July.  It came at a very sensitive moment for the European Union.  It was launched barely four or five days after the results of the Brexit referendum were known.  We are very hopeful about its success.<br/><br/>With regard to passports, I do not believe anything has changed thus far.  Those eligible to hold a Maltese passport by way of relation still have an automatic right to one.  I do not believe we will be encountering any major shifts in the present policy as it stands.  I refer to the general approach we are taking on diaspora matters.  There is a sizeable Maltese expatriate community in the United Kingdom.  Most would regard Malta as a place of retirement.  Malta has a large number of tourists from the United Kingdom and <i>vice versa</i>.  The United Kingdom is the most popular country among outgoing tourists.  The links on a people-to-people level are very visible and tangible.</p></speech>

The Single Market seems to work very well in the areas of agriculture and fisheries and in various other sectors.  Ms Mizzi cannot have missed - perhaps she did - the crowd outside the gates of Leinster House today protesting in respect of the drug Orkambi.  We had similar protests about other drugs designed to treat cancer.  It amazes me that an Irish citizen can go to Spain to purchase his entire drug requirement for a particular illness.  I am mindful of a character who went to Spain and bought his blood pressure tablets for the entire year for something like &euro;14 or &euro;15.  They would have cost &euro;1,000 in this country.  If the Single Market is really to get in touch with the man on the street, about whom we are talking, it should be able to negotiate a Single Market price for the purchase of drugs, for example.  This is a matter that is very close the hearts of citizens in this country today.  The drug Orkambi, which is for cystic fibrosis, costs &euro;150,000 per annum per patient.  I am sure that if one went to Spain or some other part of the European Union, one could purchase it much more cheaply.</p> <p>  When Malta assumes the Presidency, it should, if it wants to get close to the man on the street, negotiate with the massive drug companies a Single Market price that would apply right across the entire European Union, such that we would not have people going on what we now call the tablet holiday.  There are people who leave Ireland and go to Spain with their prescription in their pocket.  They buy their drugs for the year, have a week's holiday and return having saved money.  That is unbelievable.  There is not a family in Europe that does not have somebody who is dependent on drugs for some illness or other.  I am sorry for bringing this up but I believe it should be mentioned when talking about the Single Market.</p></speech>

I am assistant secretary in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners with responsibility for the south-west region.  I am joined by my colleagues, Anne Dullea, principal officer and district manager of Kerry tax district, and Paul Walsh, principal officer, and Clare Lucey, assistant principal officer, both of whom are from the Revenue Commissioners legislation service.</p> <p>  I propose to give an overview of the Revenue Commissioners recent examinations relating to the issue of patronage shares and their subsequent disposals as well as some background on the basis for the recent issue by the Revenue Commissioners of an inquiry letter to a certain group of taxpayers.  The Revenue Commissioners term these inquiries as "aspect queries" and this has been widely reported.  For clarity, I have attached at Appendix 1 a glossary of the terms from the code of practice for Revenue Commissioners audits and other compliance interventions.</p> <p>  I should also state my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality as provided for in section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Much of what I have to say is for illustrative purposes, to assist the committee in gaining an understanding of the broader issues giving rise to the committee&rsquo;s deliberations today.  I cannot identify any taxpayer or group of taxpayers, as provided for in section 851A.</p> <p>  Ireland has a self-assessment tax system.  It is a fundamental principle that returns filed by compliant taxpayers are accepted as the basis for computing tax liabilities.  When information comes to hand which suggests that returns submitted are not correct, the Revenue Commissioners will make appropriate inquiries.  These inquiries are intended to be in the form which is most efficient in terms of time and resources and which imposes least cost on the taxpayer, while addressing the perceived risk.  In this case the inquiries made were by way of aspect queries, which are not regarded as Revenue Commissioners audits and do not restrict a taxpayer&rsquo;s right to make an unprompted qualifying disclosure.  It is therefore important to highlight that by conducting the interventions in such a manner and affording taxpayers the benefits associated with making an unprompted qualifying disclosure, the Revenue Commissioners are ensuring that affected farmers are being treated in a fair and reasonable manner. </p> <p>  To give some background, early last year the Revenue Commissioners carried out various compliance interventions into the non-reporting by taxpayers of disposals and transfers of shares in the relevant co-operative.  Where no tax was paid or declared by the taxpayer, tax yield was generated from these interventions.  On a closer and more detailed examination by the Revenue Commissioners of the history of acquisition of co-operative shares, it was noted that certain shares were acquired in more recent periods, as patronage shares.  From a detailed examination of the rules of the co-operative and its financial statements, the Revenue Commissioners became aware that approximately 600,000 patronage shares were issued to members in the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 as a direct result of the trading relationship between the relevant farmer and the co-operative, or the purchaser nominated by the co-operative.  Accordingly, the basis on which patronage shares were issued means that the market value of the shares issued, after allowing a deduction for any amount paid for the shares, should be treated as a trading receipt of the relevant business of the farmer.</p> <p>  There has been no change in Revenue Commissioners policy relating to this issue.  It is well-established under general taxation principles that a person is taxable by reference to the value received for services rendered or product sold.  Predominantly, this value is generally received in the form of cash payments.  However, where value is provided in the form of non-monetary benefits, such as shares, the same principle applies.  I have provided some information charts at Appendix II and III, for illustrative purposes only, of the different views on the technical aspects of our inquiries and the process involved.</p> <p>  In this case, the patronage shares were received by suppliers of milk as a consequence of, and in proportion to, the quantity of milk supplied to the quantity of milk supplied to the co-operative or the nominated purchaser.  I understand that one co-operative share was issued for every 1,000 gallons of milk supplied.  For example, a farmer supplying 100,000 gallons of milk received 100 co-operative shares.  Our initial letters to the taxpayers concerned confined our inquiries to milk suppliers who have received the most shares during 2011, 2012 and 2013.  As the co-operative did not receive the full market price for the shares issued, the Revenue Commissioners view is that the true value of the shares received at par is correctly assessable as a trading receipt of the farmer's business and therefore assessable to income tax.</p><p>The shares essentially represent a form of payment received for the milk supplied by the farmers and, therefore, the value of the shares forms part of the trading income for the relevant years.</p><p> Arising from the initial inquiries into the disposal of co-operative shares, a database of valuations has been compiled by Revenue comprising the prices which were paid on disposals between unconnected third parties and, as such, the valuations used in the letter should represent the open market valuation of the shares during the relevant years.  While the co-operative shares are not quoted, the shares command a significant price when sold privately on the grey market.  The valuations used by Revenue in the letters are based on the average valuations for which the shares traded on the grey market over the relevant years.</p><p> Another factor in determining the share valuations as being greater than the par price paid for them is evidenced by the share interest paid by the co-operative in question.  All shareholders of the co-operative received share interest per share held during the past five years as follows: 2011, &euro;1.88; 2012, &euro;2.60; 2013, &euro;2.99; 2014, &euro;1.50; and 2015, &euro;2.  These share interest payments could not be expected from a share purchase value of &euro;1.25.  These types of dividends would be expected from a far greater share valuation if purchased on an open market.  For example, at an expected return on investment of 5% or 2.5%, a &euro;2 dividend would value the share at &euro;40 or &euro;80, respectively.</p><p> It should be noted that the letter which issued was an invitation to engage with Revenue as regards the tax position for the years 2011 to 2013, inclusive.  Revenue must pursue and collect any taxes owing but is cognisant of the fact that the tax implications arising may not have been fully understood by the relevant taxpayers and their advisers.  Early engagement will facilitate a discussion between the individuals concerned with a view to bringing this matter to an early and satisfactory conclusion, including, if necessary, agreeing a mutually satisfactory phased payment arrangement, where a liability exists.  I would add that Revenue is very much aware that 2016 has been an exacting year for farmers, particularly those in the dairying industry, but we are committed to finding an equitable solution to enable farmers to meet any outstanding liability.  The next steps in the particular cases contacted to date are as follows: where the income was included at a fair valuation in the trading accounts of the taxpayers concerned, we can conclude our inquiries quickly on engagement with the person concerned; where the income was not included in the trading account and the taxpayer does not agree the technical position, we will assess the under declared income to tax.  The taxpayers concerned may then appeal those assessments to the Tax Appeals Commission; where the income was not included in the trading account and the taxpayer does agree the technical position, we will assess the tax and work with the person to agree a payment arrangement; and where there is no engagement or no agreement, it is our intention to assess the estimated income under declaration for the taxpayers concerned.  The taxpayers concerned may then appeal those assessments to the Tax Appeals Commission.  Certain advisers both to shareholders and to the co-operative are of the view that a test case should be taken to verify the veracity of the Revenue technical position in this matter.</p><p> Revenue will facilitate this by raising the appropriate assessments in each case.  Once the assessments have been raised, any taxpayer who wishes to make an appeal against the assessment must submit a written notice of appeal within 30 days to the Tax Appeals Commission, TAC.  The Tax Appeals Commission, an entirely independent statutory body, has sole responsibility for accepting or refusing appeals.  Where the appeal has been accepted, the TAC will make the decision as to how the appeal is to be conducted.  Section 949E of the Taxes Consolidation Act provides an option for the appeal commissioners to consolidate appeals which raise common or related issues.  Alternatively, the appeals commissioners may decide to adopt procedures under section 949AN of the Taxes Consolidation Act which permits the Tax Appeals Commission to make a ruling on a case in line with a previous determination where the new case has a common fact or matter with the previous case.  In such cases, an initial test case would be heard and a stop placed on the remaining follower cases pending the determination of the test case.</p><p> I assure members that any taxpayer who engages with the process outlined in the earlier part of my statement and discharges a liability in accordance with the Revenue's view in the matter will not be disadvantaged in the event of a different outcome arising from any case before the Tax Appeals Commission.</p><p> I would be happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

I am based in Limerick where many farmers who supply to Kerry Co-operative received these letters out of the blue.  The first patronage shares were issued back in 1997, 19 years ago.  Yet, the issue has just come out of the blue.  The question now is, why?</p><p>I wish to raise a number of points that arise from the practicalities of the contents of these letters.  In Revenue's letter to suppliers, it states that to enable the recipient to avail of the opportunity to make a disclosure, the recipient should respond to Revenue with the computation of the tax together with the appropriate payment.  From Mr. Phelan's statement, it appears that Revenue is looking at a different type of payment.  Is he retracting what was stated in the letter sent to the farmers?  People were given 21 days in which to respond to the letter, which is grossly inadequate.  Would he consider extending it to 60 days, which was requested?  Pending the extension to 60 days, would Revenue put a stop on all interest and penalties arising because of the circumstances?  Is it possible that a test case could be heard within 60 days?  On the face of it, the question is whether the payments are considered income or capital.  I believe it is capital rather than income.</p><p>Under the co-operative society rules, Kerry Co-operative Creameries Limited is entitled to buy back the shares at par value, if it so wishes.  The witnesses are probably aware of the Supreme Court Case of Kerry Co-Op Creamery Ltd.<i>v</i>. An Bord Bainne Co-op Ltd, in which the Supreme Court found that the Kerry Co-op shares in An Bord Bainne should be replaced at par value.  This is about ensuring the ownership and success of the co-operative itself.  The Kerry suppliers supply their milk to the plc and not to the Kerry Co-operative Creamery Limited.  They were given an option on the basis that they were milk suppliers to buy shares in Kerry Co-operative Creamery but it was part of the process of planning to keep the co-operative under the control of the milk suppliers, which would be a natural thing.  The suppliers had to exercise that option within three months.  The suppliers paid the par value for the share, which was &pound;1, or &euro;1.25 in today's terms.  They appear to be totally unrelated transactions.  They were paid the market value for the milk by the plc.  This is a separate transaction.  If they sell the shares, they pay capital gains tax.  Under the reorganisation of share capital in section 532 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, all forms of property shall be assets for the purposes of the Capital Gains Tax Acts whether situated in the State or not, including options, debts and incorporeal property generally.  I believe this is an option.  The grey market to which Mr. Phelan referred is really special persons and that is not a normal market.  If they happen to sell the shares in that market, they are subject to capital gains tax.</p><p>Will Mr. Phelan address my first point on extending to 60 days the period during which people must revert to Revenue, which is fair and reasonable?</p><p>My understanding is that the Revenue would have informed the co-operative on Friday 18 November that letters would be issuing.  Farmers received the letters the following Monday and they were completely unannounced.  The representatives of the Revenue Commissioners have spoken about the fact that they know the financial difficulty the farmers are under.  With due respect, if they knew that, they would not be issuing letters looking for a commitment to pay.  In this case the Revenue is looking for &euro;24,500 from an individual.  He cannot pay.</p><p> With due respect, for the sake of fair play and allowing this matter to be looked at properly, will the Revenue extend the period that people have to go back to 60 days?  Will the Revenue suspend any interest and penalties arising?  Furthermore, in the interim period, will the Revenue allow the test case to go ahead in order that there is full clarity on the matter?  The problem is that we are dealing with people's lives, families and generations.  There are consequences for people.  Revenue could put people out of business with this.  I call on Mr. Phelan to deal with those points.</p></speech>

I will try to go through them.  Perhaps the Senator will remind me if I leave out anything.</p> <p>  The first question was why a letter came out of the blue.  For the past year or so we have been looking at the valuation of shares in the context of people disposing of them and paying capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax arising from the inheritance of shares.  It was only at that point that we became aware that there was a grey market in the shares.  It was only then that we really became aware that patronage shares were issued in respect of the supply of milk to the nominated purchaser.  In other words, we realised that the co-operative issued a share based on each 1,000 gallons delivered to Kerry plc, the nominated purchaser, in accordance with the rules.  In some ways, that explains why we are only going into it now.</p> <p>  Why did this happen out of the blue?  In Ireland we operate on the basis of full self-assessment in tax.  We accept all the returns and issue assessments based on the return that the taxpayer makes.  If there is an inquiry or a concern about the risk arising, any inquiry we make will naturally come out of the blue because we do not engage with people until such time as we have some issue to address.  In reality, we look at 5% or 6% of all returns by some form or inquiry.  They vary from this kind of inquiry to an aspect query, which is the easiest and cheapest form to comply with, up to an investigation.  These are outlined in the code of practice.</p> <p>  I wish to deal with some of the other points about the practicality of this and the 60 days for a test case.  We have no issue with a test case but it is a matter entirely for the Tax Appeals Commission.  A person cannot take a test case and have cases like it considered without raising an assessment, having those assessments appealed and allowing the Tax Appeals Commission to list one and carry on.  We have no issue about the technical point and we will facilitate that.</p> <p>  Senator O'Donnell made reference to the 60 day period.

He would clearly have no liability on increasing his amount by &euro;6,500.  Someone who was at the 20% rate of tax would have a liability, as would someone on a higher rate.</p></speech>

I am looking for 60 days based on the aspect query.  The Revenue is looking for people to come back in 21 days.  I believe the period should be extended on the grounds of fair play.  This is not about one individual.  Approximately 400 suppliers are involved and it potentially extends to other suppliers.</p> <p>  This matter requires a test case to be heard.  For the sake of practicality, the Revenue should extend the period for the aspect query for people to go back to 60 days rather than 21 days.  That is the first point.</p> <p>  The second point is that in that period, the Revenue should allow a test case to be heard.  Moreover, in that period the Revenue should, on the grounds of fair play, suspend any possible interest and penalties accruing on the under-declaration of income determined by the Revenue in these letters.  I am suggesting this should be done on the grounds of fair play.</p></speech>

Let me answer the question in the best way I can by going back to the letter.  There is an invitation to engage with us.  Anyone who comes forward and engages with us in accordance with the code of practice will be treated in exactly the same way, like any other intervention in respect of any other taxpayer.  We will allow the 60 days if anyone requests 60 days to engage with us.  There is absolutely no problem with that.</p></speech>

If there is a liability, interest is statutory.  Under the code of practice of Revenue audits and interventions, penalties have a statutory basis.  In some cases, there will be no penalty.</p></speech>

Mr. Phelan has agreed to the 60 days.  I respect that and I believe it will make a difference.  However, the Revenue must allow that the period must go hand-in-hand with a test case being heard.  Then, if a test case is heard and goes beyond 60 days, on the grounds of fair play that 60 days should be extended until the test case is heard.</p></speech>

However, I am keen to remind the Senator that the Tax Appeals Commission is a completely independent body.  To get to that stage we would have to raise assessments and allow people to appeal the assessments in order to get to the Tax Appeals Commission.  Once an appeal is proceeding everything stops until such time as it is heard.</p></speech>

I want one test case.  Will Revenue allow one test case to be heard?  Revenue should not raise assessments on the others 399 farmers.  Revenue should allow the test case to be heard until such time as farmers can go back to Revenue and reply while fully aware of the outcome of the test case.  That is fair play.</p></speech>

I can probably definitely give the Senator that commitment for the years 2012 and 2013.  However, the Senator will be aware that to protect the Exchequer there is such a thing as the four-year rule.  We have no doubt that in cases where something is omitted from a return, we can go back beyond the four-year rule.  To avoid any doubt on the matter, we intend to raise assessments for 2011 now.  We will of course allow the test cast to go ahead while these are under appeal.</p></speech>

With due respect, if I were to do that to the Revenue, Mr. Phelan would say it was sharp practice.  The Revenue is raising it on a year because it wants to get around the four-year rule.  I am sorry, but Mr. Phelan is wrong on this point.  The bottom line is that Revenue has put these out.  If it is down to pure revenue collection, it is wrong.  If the amount is due, that is fine.  At the moment, major livelihoods are at stake.</p><p>The Revenue Commissioners have agreed to the 60 days and to proceed to having a test case heard.  I hope that for the 2011 assessments the Revenue Commissioners will not muddy the waters by going after half the herd, so to speak.</p></speech>

This is a hot issue, particularly in County Kerry which I represent.  There are several issues which I wish to raise to tease out the issue and come to a satisfactory conclusion for the 400 people affected.</p> <p>  In his presentation, Mr. Charlie Phelan stated it was not a change of policy.  Patronage shares have been around for 20 years.  It is not that the Revenue was not aware of them.  They have been returned in tax returns by compliant tax farmers as long as they have had them.  They have never been requested to pay income tax on them.  They would see it is a change of policy.  Over time, shareholders have transferred patronage shares from family members, for example.  They have sought advice on the value of them and were given advice that they were to be treated at the value of &euro;1.27.  A compliant taxpayer got advice from the Revenue Commissioners, made his returns on that basis but then got this letter in the post.  That was very unexpected.</p> <p>  Is it not normal procedure to advise tax consultants and accountants that there is an issue which must be teased out so as to arrive at an agreed position?  I agree with Senator Kieran O'Donnell that this letter seems to have come out specifically to get the 2011 assessments.  Is that being fair?  Approximately 400 letters have gone out.  How many other patronage shareholders were not contacted?  When will they be contacted?  How many other patronage shareholders are there in every other co-operative?  I know the situation exists with Glanbia and Dairygold.  There is much broader issue at stake.  Under the Taxes Consolidation Act, taxpayers are to be treated equally.  Unless the Revenue Commissioners get everything out to all those affected in other co-operatives by the end of this year, I would argue the 400 farmers in question are not being treated equally.  They will come in under the 2011 assessment while the rest will not.</p> <p>  If the Revenue's assessment was 100% correct, then the 2011 shares are based on the 2010 milk yield.  Does that bring it outside the four-year rule?  That is another issue that needs to be teased out.</p> <p>  A stop should be put to this and the test case needs to be heard.  All taxes and penalties should be suspended until we get full clarification of this issue.  The letter the 400 farmers received stated, "To enable you to avail of the opportunity to make such a disclosure, please respond with your computation of the tax liability together with the appropriate payment".  To anybody that reads like a demand for payment.  It would be only fair after this meeting and everything has been clarified that each of the people involved is written to and informed of the decisions made to take the pressure off.  As was stated in the submission, it has been a difficult year.  People would have made financial decisions based on investments, not realising there was a &euro;20,000 or &euro;50,000 tax bill around their necks.  We are all human beings in business.  That is a difficult position to be in.  One makes an investment on the basis one has a certain income and ability to pay it back but is then hit with this.</p> <p>  At what level was the decision to pursue this made?  Was it at the very top or at regional or local level?  I would like to know why 400 people in Kerry seem to have received this treatment but no one else did.</p></speech>

It is a generally accepted principle that if one gets money for something, then that forms part of one's trading income and as such should be included in one's trading profit and loss account as sales.  If somebody gets something as well as money, then that should also be treated as income.</p> <p>  In fairness to the entire examination of the area, we were not aware of the patronage shares until recently.  This started from people valuing shares at par when they, say, transferred to them, sold by them or if they died, until we realised there was a grey market.  Some people would pay the CGT, capital gains tax, correctly on the grey market rate at which they sold them.  Others were putting the proper valuation when they inherited the shares.  It was only in the past 18 months that we discovered that the valuation around co-op shares, as distinct from the PLC shares, was an issue for us on the CGT and CAT, capital acquisitions tax, front.  Recently we realised that, in addition to getting paid for milk, farmers were also getting the option to buy patronage shares at a value of &euro;1.25.  In an area where there is a grey market, our technical view is that the value of the share that one is buying should be included in one's trading account.  I accept there is a difference in the technical view.</p> <p>  As regards the capital gains tax issue, if somebody has disposed of these shares and has paid capital gains tax, we will correct that.  There may even be repayments.  For example, if someone has a marginal tax rate of 20%, sold the shares and paid tax at 33%, clearly there is an overpayment and will fix that for them.</p></speech>

I contest the claim it has only come to Revenue's notice now.  That needs to be teased out in the test case.  If a person seeks advice from the Revenue, they have to accept that advice is accurate and accept it in good faith.  I am sure the person giving the advice gave it on good faith.</p> <p>  We are going back to the point of fairness.</p><p>Nobody here is trying to avoid paying tax.  All these people are tax compliant.  They make their submissions every year, seek their tax clearance certificates and pay what they are due to pay.  We are dealing with an honourable group of people who feel very let down by the system.  However, we will not agree on that type of thing today.  It is something that must be thrashed out in the fullness of time through the test case.</p></speech>

By and large, what is sent in to us is accepted as it is.  We engage in some inquiries relating to some transactions.  We do not give a rubber stamp to everything that is submitted and say it is perfect.  If we were to do that, we would have to examine every transaction included.  Self-assessment means self-assessment.  While one might say that we have accepted this stuff and we knew it all along, the fact is that this is the self-assessed tax people made and they put their valuations on it.  During 2015 and 2016 we started to look at those valuations and found some difficulties in that area.</p> <p>  I will turn to the points the Deputy raised in his initial questions.  He asked how many more farmers are affected.  We do not know the extent of the patronage shares issue.  We know it in the Kerry situation but we do not know it in the rest of the co-operative movement.  However, if there is an issue for other people this is an opportunity to come forward if there is a liability.  Perhaps if the technical case is heard as a test case it will put the technical point straight, once and for all, as to whether the Revenue Commissioners are correct or incorrect in this regard.  That is certainly an advantage of having the case heard.  In the case of Kerry, we understand that 3,400 people got patronage shares, as the Deputy mentioned.</p> <p>  As regards the value we put on the shares, when shares are transferred between unconnected parties, and I believe perhaps even between connected parties, they go through the board meeting to be authorised.  They also go through our stamping system to be stamped, so we have a database of the valuation that was paid for or put on the shares.</p> <p>  The other co-operatives have been mentioned.  As to the level in the Revenue Commissioners organisation where the decision was taken, every day Revenue Commissioners officials throughout the country will make decisions on various compliance activities.  We set out in our business plans every year the number of things we plan to do in the year.  I am not quite sure what the Deputy means in referring to whether it was taken locally or nationally, but I can assure him that the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners-----</p></speech>

No contact was made with all the other co-operative preference shareholders across the country.  Those who received the higher amount of shares were contacted and nobody else was.  Under the Taxes Consolidation Act everybody is to be treated fairly and I believe these people are not being treated fairly.  That point emphasises it.</p></speech>

We took the 400 who received the largest quantity of Kerry Co-Operative Creameries Limited shares.

As I explained, we only recently understood how this works and we intend to examine it throughout the shareholder base.  We do not believe we are confined to 2011 if there is a serious omission from the tax returns.  Based on the risk, we will assess the level of activity taking place with the other cases.  We certainly will not try to disadvantage anybody.  We will not look at one section of shareholders and not at the others.  I can assure the Deputy we will do that, and do it fairly, among all the taxpayers.</p></speech>

I represent County Limerick and a number of patronage shareholders have contacted me as well as Senator O'Donnell.  Obviously, as Kerry is a bordering constituency there would be some overlap.  I am here to articulate the concerns of farmers in rural Ireland who have been hit out of the blue with major tax bills.  It is their understanding that the Revenue Commissioners are looking for tax money straight away.  They are big bills.  We are talking about bills the size of the average industrial wage.  Farmers, particularly in my constituency, have been hit extremely hard by the price of milk since my election and even before that.  To have this arrive out of the blue before Christmas is causing panic in the agriculture sector.  To be honest, it is negative psychologically for farmers who are trying to pursue their career in such difficult circumstances.</p> <p>  The style of communication and the way it has been delivered are a problem.  That is the view of those on the ground.  As we have seen with the financial institutions when they have tried to call in loans, the issue is the style of communication, how it is articulated and how it is delivered in the letter, as Senator O'Donnell said with regard to fair play.  That is the first point.  Second, the perception is that they will be hit with the big bills straight away.  They wonder how they will keep their farms alive, given what they have gone through over the last 12 months.  Then there is the knock-on effect on rural Ireland.  How does one keep rural Ireland alive?  Agriculture is its backbone and sustains and maintains it.  That is what we are trying to deliver and progress.  If younger farmers, in particular, are hit with that, it is another psychological blow for them when they are trying to progress the industry and when we are trying to get more people back into sector.</p> <p>  I wish to follow up on the technical aspect of Senator O'Donnell's question.  Mr. Phelan said 60 days would be allowed under the aspect query if a farmer writes in to seek it.  That is my understanding.  I am not a tax consultant or an accountant.  Mr. Phelan also said that the assessment side could not be left while this is going on because it is a separate entity or it has separate decision making powers.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

If it is the case that we cannot get a straight answer to that, and I mean no disrespect to Mr. Phelan as he cannot answer the question, then that body should appear before the committee as well as the Revenue Commissioners to answer our questions.  We have joined-up questions that are relevant to two different bodies to which we need immediate answers.  I propose that in the interests of clarity.  Understandably, the committee will wish to discuss it but given the fact that we cannot get a straight answer on it today from the witnesses, I propose that any stakeholders involved in this and who are obliged to answer questions to the public be invited to sit together here so when we, as elected representatives, pose our questions they can be answered correctly by whatever body can answer them.  A number of questions posed today obviously need to be answered by other, separate bodies.  That is my suggestion.</p> <p>  Mr. Phelan mentioned that the Revenue Commissioners came across this 18 months ago.  Why was something not communicated to the farming organisations or the public that this might be coming down the tracks?  I understand Mr. Phelan's comment that they could not communicate it until they saw something in black and white.  However, given Mr. Phelan's experience and background on these issues, obviously he saw this coming down the tracks 18 months ago.  Why was there no communication to farmers or farming organisations that this might be an issue?  How do the Revenue Commissioners propose that co-operatives ensure that active farmers stay with co-operative shares?  The basis for this was keeping active farmers involved in co-operatives to keep them alive.  If the tax bill is imposed on the patronage shares in all circumstances, it means the active farmers cannot stay with these co-operatives.</p><p> Going back to what Senator O'Donnell said about penalties, will they be imposed, and if so, how?  What is the calculation in this regard?  Again, from speaking to the farmers, I understand it is a question of the tax bill, the penalties, the time, what is coming down the tracks and what is next.  As was mentioned earlier, these farmers are doing the right thing, making declarations, being upfront, trying to pay their taxes and trying to do the best they can to keep a business that is under pressure alive.  I would be grateful for responses to my comments.</p></speech>

If it wants a group of assessments to do a test case, we will facilitate that as much as we possibly can by getting it to that stage.</p> <p>  There are two real issues in the entire matter.  One is the technical element, that is, whether Revenue is right or wrong.  We do not take lightly the decision to treat shares purchased at a discount as a taxable income.  We think it is absolutely correct that the difference in the value should be added to one's trading profit and loss account.  We are certain that we are right in this regard.  In the event that we are wrong, the only way of getting a different opinion is through the Tax Appeals Commission.</p> <p>  The second issue Deputy Neville raised concerns the difficulties farmers face and the difficult year we have had.  We published a document concerning results in the farming sector.  We are well aware of the trends in farming.  It is quite a good document and concerns the position of farming within the overall structure in Ireland.  It is available on our website.  Our collector general's office, particularly during the recession, has got very good at making phased payment arrangements over a number of years and months for businesses.  Whatever people want, we can accommodate them.  I agree that the technical element may require a test case.  We have some agents who agree with our position and are considering making voluntary disclosures and paying the amount of tax due, albeit that if a test case is taken, they want the same treatment as would result from the test case.  We can guarantee this will happen for those who engage and get rid of this matter and we will certainly arrange the phased payment.  If we get over the technical matter, the difficulty with payment is not a problem for us in making long arrangements.</p> <p>  As I said earlier, the interest on penalties is statutory.  In many cases a penalty does not arise.  Our approach to this has been to minimise the penalties because the letters went out as aspect queries.  We did not try to carry out audits.  We tried to keep the penalty at the cheapest possible level under the code of practice.  Again, it is administratively easier for us to carry out bulk inquiries under the aspect query regime.  It is also very cost-effective for everybody concerned and eliminates or minimises the penalties in many cases.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.74" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1283" speakername="Michael Moynihan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120700002#F00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for allowing Members of the Oireachtas who are not members of the committee to contribute and I thank the Revenue Commissioners.</p> <p>  My colleagues have put the case very strongly.  This is a fundamental issue in the farming community and for the recipients of the 400 letters sent out in November.  There can be no disputing that the wording of the letter was very heavy-handed and there was no sense of fair play in the way the letter was dropped into their letter boxes that Monday morning.  I do not want the witnesses to comment on this because that is exactly how it is seen.</p> <p>  I wish to raise a few matters.  In the conclusion of Mr. Phelan's opening presentation he referred to the possibility that the test case may differ from what the Revenue Commissioners believe it to be.  Therefore, he has some doubt as to whether the test case may be different.  In response to Deputy Brassil's point, Mr. Phelan referred to the possibility that Revenue may be right or wrong.  This leads me to believe there is an issue that the Revenue Commissioners are not fully certain of their ground.  If this be the case, it has implications for what Senator Kieran O'Donnell requested, namely, having a test case fully tried before anything happens.  There should have been a test case and Revenue should have been 1000% certain of its ground before any letters were issued.  On two occasions this afternoon Mr. Phelan has alluded to the possibility of some doubt in this regard.  Why is it that in the case of a farmer who had these shares and sold them for a variety of reasons, this is sent through Revenue, which then collects the 33.33% capital gains tax and duly thanks the farmer?  Kerry shareholders sell their shares, the capital gains is collected, the tax clearance certificate is issued and, lo and behold, Revenue states it is looking into the matter.  One could say this has been going on for decades; it has certainly been going on for years.</p> <p>  I am led to believe that in a different circumstance, in which shares in a co-operative movement were sold and a test case taken to the Revenue Commissioners as to whether they should be taxed as income tax or capital gains, the Revenue Commissioners stated very clearly and definitively that they would have to be taxed as capital gains tax.  I understand there is an appeal case before the Revenue Commissioners to the effect of the opposite of what the witnesses are stating is now the case.  I understand an individual taxpayer has an appeal case stating that his shares, which he sold and on which he paid capital gains, should have been taken in as income tax.  However, Revenue in the first instance has refused the case so, as I understand it, the witnesses are completely contradicting what he so strongly defended or determined in another case.  I would like to know why this is the case.  As I and many of my colleagues know full well, a number of farmers are prepared to make an assessment and then takes it to the Tax Appeals Commission.  The question I put to the witnesses is if one person takes an assessment and then takes it to the Tax Appeals Commission, does the clock stop for every other farmer?  The Revenue Commissioners have been empowered and entrusted with a whole pile of rules and regulations since the inception of the State and have been applauded for what they have done in various circumstances.  Surely to God it behoves them, if there is a scintilla of doubt in their minds - I am in no doubt but that there is - to stop it until a test case determines what the position is.</p> <p>  The other point I put to the witnesses is that if a farmer gets his Kerry share, surely to God the income from that share only becomes an income the day he sells it.  It is a piece of paper until that date.  The Revenue Commissioners readily collects the 33.33% in capital gains prior to his selling it.  If for 2017, for argument's sake, the share price drops 20% or 10%, how can the Revenue Commissioners make a valuation of a share that may be 20% less the following year?  It does not make sense.  Not to bore the committee, but the first point is that there must be a test case.  The witnesses have alluded to the possibility that Revenue may be right or wrong and to the fact that if a different opinion comes out of the appeal case, the status quo remains.  Therefore, they have a doubt about it.  Why not put everything on hold until this is cleared up beyond doubt?</p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners would not engage lightly in trying to have a test case heard to verify something.</p><p>There are many cases around the barter position of goods, including a very old one involving gold in exchange for money.  That money is taxable.  I can provide some detail of the case law for treating these shares as income.  We do not need take a test case to verify that.  Let there be no doubt about it that the Revenue Commissioners are  fully convinced at the highest level in the organisation that this amount of income is subject to income tax.  </p><p> As regards, capital gains tax, CGT, there is no doubt that CGT is due on the sale of a share but the base price - the price at which it is deemed to have been acquired - and not the &euro;1.25 value must be included in the income tax returns.  As regards the specific case in question I will ask my colleague, Mr. Paul Walsh, to respond on the case law in that regard and to elaborate further on what I said.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.77" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Walsh" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120700002#G00200"><p>When this matter was raised the Revenue legislative service gave its advice to the south west region on the correct tax treatment.  We were satisfied that the value that the farmers received on the issuing of the shares gave rise to a income tax charge.  Farmers who settle with us on the basis of this advice will not be disadvantaged should a case go before the Tax Appeals Commission and a different result emerge.</p> <p>  We are satisfied there is tax due in this regard.  We have had meetings with the Institute of Taxation and other tax agents on the matter.  At no point has anybody come up with a technical analysis to the effect that this charge does not stand up or is not technically correct.  They have argued about the 60 days, 21 days, the interest, the penalties and so on but they have not engaged with us at any point to the effect that the tax technical position is incorrect.</p> <p>  In regard to the Deputy's question regarding the position regarding non-monetary benefit versus cash, I refer him to the UK case law in this regard which dates back to 1904.  It is well established that where a person gets value for providing a service that value must be assessed.  In the vast majority of cases, the value will be cash based but where a person gets other than cash - a non-monetary benefit - the non-monetary benefit must be taxed at the market value.  It has been established in recent times that shares have a value greater than the cost base and that is the value on which we seek to obtain income tax.  </p> <p>  In regard to capital gains tax, when the shares are ultimately sold CGT is the correct computation but the base cost will be the market value which the taxpayer has paid income tax on.  The difference between that market value and the ultimate sale price will then be subject to CGT.</p></speech>

Like most of the Deputies and Senators that have spoken here today I come from an area most affected by this issue which involves money owed by 400 or more farmers.  It strikes me as strange that this matter has become an issue after 19 years.  What happened in the intervening years that this liability was not detected?  Like my fellow elected representatives I am well acquainted with the value of the success of Kerry Co-operative to the local economy and the national economy.  It is makes a huge contribution nationally in terms of the number of people it employs and internationally in terms of its produce.  As I said, I cannot understand why this issue has come to the fore now.  I am not an accountant.  What we are speaking about is a loyalty share in return for every 1,000 gallons of milk produced.  A loyalty share is a share of loyalty to the economy, local and national.  I have difficulty understanding how a person, having not realised the value of that loyalty share, could be tax assessed on it and liable for penalties occurred over time.  I am unclear at this point as to whether the penalties will be applicable to the value of the share on date of acquisition or on the current value of the share.  It was stated earlier that Revenue will do everything it can to minimise penalties and so forth.  If Revenue is statutorily required to apply penalties how then can they be minimised?</p> <p>  I concur with the suggestion made by Senator Kieran O'Donnell and Deputy John Brassil in regard to the 60 day suspension until such time as a case can be determined.  It would be a recognition by Revenue of the value of Kerry Co-operative.  Again, the question for me is, why now?  Somebody telephoned my office this morning and said that there is a letter of comfort dating back a number of years, which is a political letter of comfort.  I would like a comment from the witnesses, if possible, on whether if a letter of comfort exists it is no longer applicable.  </p></speech>

That is based on the stamp documents on open market transactions.  They are the values we have taken as being the realistic value of the share received.  As regards the penalties, under the code of practice, and statutorily, the Revenue has powers to mitigate penalties in certain circumstances.  In some technical matters, there are no penalties at all.  The interest is a statutory amount, which the Revenue has no powers to mitigate.  I agree with the points made about a 60 day suspension.  We do not have any issue with that.  The real issue for us is the mechanism to allow the 60 days.  We have no problem with someone engaging with us.  We will have no collection action within the period provided for under the code of practice in respect of people who come forward and engage with us.  There are many terms around that code of practice, many of which have been included in the glossary at the back of the pack provided.</p> <p>  In regard to the letter of comfort, I am not aware of a letter of comfort having issued from the Revenue Commissioners.  Mr. Walsh, who has been working in that area for a lot longer than me, may like to comment on that but I am not aware of any such letter having issued from Revenue.</p></speech>

Mr. Phelan gave away a bit when he said the Revenue Commissioners only recently understood how this works.  The first thing that needs to be clarified is that the farmers from Kerry or anywhere else who supplied Kerry Co-op with milk and who got shares did no wrong.  They depended on professional people like the Revenue Commissioners and their accountants, who they paid dearly to present their accounts and to send them in to the Revenue Commissioners, year by year.  Clearly, something new must have happened.  There must have been some new inspectors, or some new operators, who saw something that the fellows before them did not see.  This is a new departure from what happened in the past.</p><p> As previous speakers have said, a test case must take place.  However, I would have wished that such a test case had taken place before the Revenue Commissioners sent these demanding letters to farmers, of whom there are more in Kerry than anywhere else.  I know many of them and, at present, they cannot sleep or eat.  It is coming up to Christmas and families are in disarray.  I repeat that the farmers did no wrong.  They went by the rules.  The accountants who represented them are professional people and knew what the Revenue Commissioners wanted, and they acceded to their rules.  Something new has happened.  However, if something new has happened, the farmers should only be liable from when the Revenue Commissioners recently understood this, whether that was in the past six or 12 months or, as the Revenue Commissioners believe, in the past 18 months.  Surely, however, they cannot make a tax law retrospective in order to hit these fellows, so to speak.  As committee members have said, these farmers have their books done and they know what they have to spend, even for Christmas.  Many do not have much because the price of milk did not give it them this year and the price of beef was just as bad, and if they were in north Kerry, they saved no grain.  Therefore, many of them are in a serious predicament.</p><p> I ask that a test case be taken first and that the Revenue Commissioners ease off with their letters and demands.  Some 400 farmers have received letters but there are more than 3,500 shareholders, and there are also the shareholders in other co-ops throughout the country.  We wonder why it was Kerry that was selected for this unfair attack at this time.  If a Bill has to go through the D&aacute;il to ensure the Revenue Commissioners do not apply the rules retrospectively on this issue, so be it.  Each representative in these Houses will have to unite to make sure no unfairness is being meted out to this group, whether it is 400 or 3,000 people.  It seems wrong when there were so many professional people involved besides the farmers.</p><p> I know farmers and I am a farmer myself, so I know what is involved.  Farmers do not have time to look around them.  Between calving cows and trying to provide fodder, there are so many different things to deal with, including safety.  People are often working on their own and are enduring a tough time.  In many cases, the farmer's wife has to go out separately to work to provide an income to put the food on the table.  As I see it, many of these farmers are only doing what was done in the past to hand down to their son, if they are lucky enough to have one.</p><p> I cannot see that it is fair that a farmer has to take tax out of his share at the start because the value of the shares is fluctuating every day.  They could be worth &euro;1 today and 70 cent tomorrow, but next week they might not be worth 30 cent.  As another speaker said, the day the shares are sold is like the day cattle are carried to the fair.  A farmer might think he will make &euro;500 and he will hear in the pub that he will make &euro;600 with no bother, but when he goes to Kenmare mart, the cattle might not make &euro;300.  That is how I see it.  The day the farmers sell the shares is the day they are liable because, as was said, they are only paper until that happens.</p><p> Farmers have paid their capital gains tax in the past.  I know some elderly people who will not get the old age pension because of the shares, so they have to cash them in to keep going, despite having paid their capital gains tax.  The farmers in Kerry did no wrong.  If the Revenue Commissioners only woke up to this a year or a year and a half ago, they should not be able to go back to 2011 to collect tax on something the farmers did not know they were responsible for declaring.</p></speech>

We were very surprised given that all of the farmers who had made submissions and sent in their accounts over the years are very compliant in making their tax returns.  We were most surprised that people had not included the extra value they got with their trading account and we are absolutely surprised that all of the professional people advising them, who are aware of the bonus shares and the way they were paid, did not include this because we are quite certain it is part of the trading income.  In fact, when we issued the letters, there was a need to issue a tax briefing because people were surprised themselves.  We found it to be absolutely surprising that this issue was not within the accounts.  It is not new at all, in our view, that it is a taxable amount of money.</p> <p>  I do not know what to say about it being a new departure.  We do not believe it is a new departure.  It is probably a very early stage of our examination of this entire matter, whether it is confined to the agricultural sector or involves other sectors.  However, where people get value along with their cash, it is subject to income tax, in our view.</p></speech>

That signifies to me that it is new to the Revenue Commissioners and it is certainly new to the farmers and the professional people, such as accountants and tax advisers.  They were not aware there was a liability even though they are professional people and had to go through the rigours to become accountants.  They have letters after their names and they are in touch with the Revenue Commissioners daily, but they, I and no one else can understand how it is only happening now.  If it is right, a test case will prove that, and so be it.  However, whatever happens in the test case, farmers should only be liable from that time.  That is my view, for what it is worth.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.92" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1318" speakername="Brendan Griffin" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120700002#H00400"><p>I thank the Chairman for allowing non-members of the committee to ask questions.  As he knows, I have been in touch with him in regard to requesting this meeting, and I appreciate the work of the committee in bringing the Revenue Commissioners before us.  I welcome the witnesses.  From the outset, I acknowledge the importance of the work of the Revenue Commissioners and thank the witnesses for coming before us.  They do not always have a popular job but someone has to do it.</p><p>I do not pretend to be an expert on taxation and this is quite a complex area.  I am working off the advice I am given from the Revenue Commissioners and from other advisers.  I can see the red book on taxation on the table before us.  It is like some sort of extended version of <i>War and Peace</i>, so it is a bit intimidating even to look at it.  I am only going on what I can decipher in terms of the information available to me.  However, I would concur with previous speakers on many of the points made.</p><p>In particular, my colleague, Senator Kieran O'Donnell, eloquently made the case for some leeway here, for scope to be given to those concerned on the time demands that have been put on them.  I will put it straight to the officials.  I cannot recall anything in my constituency in Kerry that has caused so much upset.  I have literally had grown men and couples crying in my office and sobbing over the phone about this, very distressed and very worried.  Particularly in the lead up to and throughout Christmas, constituents will be worried about this, wondering what will happen.  People already under enormous pressure are feeling a huge mental strain as a result of these letters having been issued.</p><p> Therefore, I reiterate the calls that have been made by numerous previous speakers to look at whether something can be done and whether a letter can issue to the original recipients at least to assure them that there is time being given, that this matter is being considered, and that test case would be allowed to take place.  That would give people some solace and at least ease some of the acute pressure that is on them, both financially and mentally.  I cannot say that it would remove it but it would be a help.  I call on the officials to do that as a matter of priority.  It is something that would be important to do because I cannot emphasise enough how distressed constituents are as a result of this, in all parts of Kerry and in surrounding areas.  That is something that I would first ask the officials to do as a priority.</p><p> Will the officials clarify further for me whether they envisage that there is potential liability they can pursue in respect of 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010?  Listening to some of the discourse today, that is something that I am quite worried about.</p><p> Deputy Brassil about 2011 shares being issued in respect of the 2010 milk production.  The officials might clarify whether that is outside of the four-year remit.  Perhaps I missed the answer, but they might repeat it.</p><p> In dealing with other Departments, for example, the Department of Social Protection, there is a general principle regarding a member of the public who has been advised one way or another such that the person does not avail or is not aware of an entitlement or is not able to apply for something.  Does a similar principle apply with Revenue?  If a person has advice or has something from Revenue that says one thing but later Revenue comes looking for a rebate or whatever else based on something different, does a person have the right to produce whatever evidence he or she has to say that he or she was informed or advised in a particular way on a particular date, and does that work in favour of the citizen?  The officials might advise me on the position there.</p><p> From speaking to advisers, my reading of this is along the lines of what Deputy Michael Moynihan was saying.  It seems there is virtual value and it is a virtual income that is being assessed here and it is not real until a benefit is derived from it.  It seems to go against all the principles of taxation that I am aware of.  It is quite a fundamental question.  In my view, if this principle holds, it is a fundamental change in our overall tax policy.  It means that there are many other things that all of a sudden are taxable or perhaps subject to back tax, which will be incredibly worrying for a significant number of people.</p><p> What is the overall amount due to Revenue in the Kerry Co-op issue in respect of the years we are talking about and what is the overall amount in other cases that the officials are not looking at currently?  Will they give us a rough idea of the figures involved?</p><p> What if taxpayers have a liability outstanding and it is found that they need to pay back money?  What are the implications, for example, for someone who might have applied for a college grant in respect of 2012 for his or her child to go to college, was over the threshold but, had this liability been paid at the time, would have been under it?  What are the implications for such issues, for medical cards and for other potential benefits that the citizen may have accrued?  What does it mean also for areas of tax offsets and for different other areas of taxation that they were not able to benefit from because of this matter not having been included?  If the officials could answer some of those questions, I would be grateful.</p></speech>

Our charter of rights would ensure that we give everybody as fair a deal as possible.  I remind the committee that right now we are running an advertising campaign to encourage taxpayers to ensure they claim their PAYE credits or tax credits before the end of the year in order that they do not fall out of the four-year time limit.  Certainly, if there is any benefit to be given to taxpayers, the Revenue appreciates the charter of rights and sticks to it rigidly.  I will ask Mr. Walsh to come back to the other bits.</p> <p>  On the technical bit about the virtual paper, etc., I do not want to rehash the argument about the virtuality of it but I understand what the committee members are saying.</p> <p>  The amount due to Revenue is not an easy sum to do because it depends on the individual circumstances.  Where somebody has no income in the year or a loss, if one adds some income to it, certainly it has no tax effects, but the committee members can do some of the mathematics on this.  It is in the public domain that there were 600,000 patronage shares issued in these three years and the mathematics of applying values to that are reasonably easy, but we could not put a tax figure on it because it depends on the circumstances of the taxpayers.</p></speech>

For example, it will not have any effect on a farmer who only got ten shares, who is milking 20 cows and who is even below the thresholds to pay income tax at all.</p> <p>  On the other point about the other benefits, such as medical cards, I do not know what effect it has on people for 2012 and I could not possibly answer that question for Deputy Griffin.  Clearly, it is something of interest as well to be dealt with.</p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Walsh to clarify the position of 2007 to 2010, inclusive, and whether the 2011 payment is for 2010.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.111" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Walsh" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120700002#J01900"><p>On Deputy Brassil's point, where he stated the shares were issued in 2011 but actually it relates to the 2010 milk supply and then it is proper to go back to 2010 and assess it in 2010, under the tax rules and principles, one is taxed when one receives the value.</p><p>Even though a person may have supplied the milk in 2010, he or she only got the value for that in 2011.  In the same way, if a person only got the value in 2012 or 2013, we could not go back and say the person should have paid tax in 2010 and look for the tax on the due date in 2010 and interest from 2010.  It is when a person received the value that he or she is assessed on the tax.  Even though it relates to the supply of milk in 2010, one got the value for that when the shares issued.</p><p> Deputy Michael Healy-Rae made the point about the valuations fluctuating.  They did fluctuate over the years in question.  In our letter to farmers we said these were the average values over the years in question.  They far exceeded the nominal value of &euro;1.27 that was paid for the share, and those were the values that were put into the letter.  The point has come up a few times that it was just paper that the farmers received and they had no value.  They clearly had a value.  We established that in recent years.  The shares were traded far and above their issue price.  One can debate what precise valuation will apply to each particular farmer.</p><p> That goes back then to the issue of a test case, which Revenue is quite willing to facilitate, but again that is a matter for the Tax Appeals Commission.  There are two issues for the commission.  One is the principle of whether there is an income tax liability having regard to the value of the shares when they were issued and the next part is what is the valuation.  While we may have a test case and we will be able to establish the principle in the test case, the valuation will depend on each farmer and the particular date when their shares were issued, so we might not have a resolution from a test case because there is the second element of the valuation to be determined as well.</p><p> A point has also been addressed on the penalties.  I accept Deputy Healy-Rae&rsquo;s point that the farmers have done no wrong.  Where the farmer has acted on professional advice and the professional advice was not to include the market price, then it would be very difficult for Revenue to establish fraud and neglect on behalf of a farmer.</p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners have written to 400 suppliers.  They have put their toe in the water and established the technical fact that is being pursued and then the amounts of money thereafter, but there are other co-ops and a previous speaker said they might have a similar type of share structure in place.  Out of regard for the co-op movement itself and the various companies that have developed, would it not have been better for Revenue to do a scoping exercise throughout the country and establish the extent to which this practice was going on and to alert the farmers, their representatives and the professionals to the fact that Revenue has now established that there are a certain number of individuals who have not been compliant with their tax?  If Revenue had come at the situation from that angle, people would have been informed of the manner in which Revenue was reaching its assessments rather than picking 400 and putting its toe in the water and being obliged to take a test case.</p> <p>  Mr. Phelan said the number of days can be extended to 60, but that is only if the taxpayer triggers engagement with Revenue.  What Senator Kieran O'Donnell wants is a suspension without engagement in order that those concerned can react to the letter, which appears to be a demand of payment.  Revenue must clarify the 60 day situation, whether it is on engagement or after engagement or if Revenue accedes to the wish of the committee that activity would be suspended for the 60 days.  I believe the letters to be letters of demand.</p> <p>  Another point made by speakers is that accountants and financial advisers have always engaged with Revenue.  Deputy Ferris was keen to point out that the issue has only now arisen.  Why has Revenue not engaged in the past with the accountants representing the farmers or the co-ops in order that a fuller picture could be established for the public in the situation?  That is the nub of the issue.  Why write to 400 farmers when Revenue should have clarified the full picture first, informed the co-op and the other businesses associated with the co-op and then assist the farmers and their professional representatives to understand that something was wrong?  Mr. Phelan said it came as a surprise to him and Revenue that the co-ops did not know.  If the professionals representing the farmers did not know, how in the name of God could Revenue expect the farmers to know?  Revenue is applying the tax law as laid out by this House in terms of its approach to collecting the money, but this is a very unusual set of circumstances and it is very unusual that professionals would not be aware of what has been described to us today and that they would not inform their clients.</p> <p>  The final point that needs to be clarified for members is that what Revenue is asking in terms of the Tax Appeals Commission, which is an independent body, is that it will require a number of cases to be adjudicated upon by Revenue, with a clear indication that there are followers.  It is not just one case.  Is it correct to say there has to be a number of cases and there has to be a clear line of sight saying there are followers and therefore there will be a test case?  Members asked the question but I think the answer is being misunderstood.  It is not that Revenue is allowing a test case.  Revenue is encouraging the taxpayers to take this course of action to lead to a return of a number of taxpayers and to lead thereafter to an independent adjudication from the Tax Appeals Commission.  Having listened to the witnesses from Revenue, it is not as straightforward as it might seem to members.  There is much that needs to be done by the taxpayer to trigger all sorts of things to answer the questions that have been posed to Revenue.  I am just setting out the situation for members and trying to clarify the confusion about some of the questions that have been answered in respect of the situation.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for being present to answer these very important questions.  The one thing that is very important for us as public representatives is to let Revenue know in a very ordinary and human way that the letters have struck the fear of God into honest-to-God farming families who did nothing out of the way.  By its own admission, Revenue said the farmers did not do anything fraudulently or on purpose.  They did not mean to do anything.  All they did was receive the piece of paper in the post, which has no value until it is traded.  If that were to happen, the farmers would gladly pay capital gains tax.  They know they would have an obligation to do so.</p><p>Why, therefore, in the name of God, would the Revenue Commissioners write to them in the manner they did, a couple of weeks before Christmas?  This is being inflicted on farmers.  As my brother, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, rightly stated, it does not matter at this stage whether a farmer has cows or sheep, is producing beef jor engaged in tillage.  The one thing every farmer has in common is that none of them is making money.  No one involved in the agriculture sector is making money; he or she is struggling along.  We have to ask, therefore, why Revenue thinks it should send these letters now.  Why were they not sent two or three years ago?  I have been listening closely to the delegates' answers.  </p><p> I raised this matter with the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il earlier today.  Perhaps the Revenue Commissioners' representatives might confirm that more letters will be issued to the same farmers claiming a specific amount of money.  As Deputy Brendan Griffin said, we appreciate the work done by the Revenue Commissioners.  Somebody has to do it, but Revenue does not comprise an enormous pool of people.  I know that senior people working with the Revenue Commissioners are raising their eyebrows at what has happened.  They are questioning it and asking whether the Revenue Commissioners are factually correct in what they have done.  They honestly believe they are not.  Therefore, there are people working with the Revenue Commissioners who are dubious about what has been done.  That is extremely worrying.  One can always say doctors differ and patients die, but what I have heard is serious.  </p><p> I am thinking of an excellent interview given by Mr. Se&aacute;n Brosnan, chairman of Kerry IFA and a sound individual, on the Agri-Time programme on Radio Kerry in which he talked about what exactly these patronage shares meant and how they worked.  He asked whether the people who had sent the letters a number of weeks ago knew what they were doing.  Did they understand the system?  I honestly doubt that they did.  My late father always said one should never blame a person for making a mistake provided they admitted to it.  If the Revenue Commissioners have made a mistake in this case, no person in Ireland would blame them if they were to say, "Yes, we made a mistake.  We were wrong.  We should not have done that."  In that case no one would crow at them.  We do not operate like that.  However, I question what Revenue has done and ask how right do the Revenue Commissioners think they were.  How do they think they would do in a test case and how would it stand up in court?  I am fearful about what this is doing in terms of people's state of mind at what is a critical time when they are trying to balance their budgets.  I know farmers who have paid their taxes but who had to borrow every penny to do so.  They are now trying to repay the banks, yet they have received these letters.</p><p> I honestly doubt that the people working with the Revenue Commissioners know what this is doing to the families involved who are sick with worry.  They are trying to figure out what they should do.  They are in a very bad way, which is why we are fighting for them here.  We want to tease out this issue to see if Revenue's representatives can answer us comprehensively on, first, how right they think they are and, second, if they think it will stand up in court.  Will they write again in the coming days?  If they will, it is only fair that they should let people know.  That information only came to light earlier today and has been made known to the Taoiseach, but no one from the Revenue Commissioners has told us publicly.  Revenue's representatives should understand the reasons we are so exercised about the matter.  I have to be parochial and talk about the situation in County Kerry.  I have not seen Deputies in the county come together and unite on any issue in such a way in a long time.  We all fully appreciate what this is doing to farm families who are being terrorised by the actions of the Revenue Commissioners.</p></speech>

I am sorry that I was late and I am trying to pick up on what has been said.  I will be forgiven, therefore, if I ask questions that have been answered already.  </p> <p>  I am anxious to know what is the basis for this taxation.  People are concerned to know what is the status of patronage, loyalty and bonus shares.  How are they valued by the Revenue Commissioners and on what basis are they being traded?  Am I right in saying they are not plc shares?  Are they a category of a co-op share?  If so, they are only paper shares until they are converted to plc shares.  It is my understanding that only plc shares can be traded in the stock market.</p> <p>  Revenue's representatives referred to a test case and said they would write another letter.  I am glad that they will do so.  Perhaps it might be possible for us to see a copy or draft of that letter for information.  The Chairman has said there are many other institutions and co-ops throughout the country.  Perhaps, therefore, there are other similar instances in which such categories of share have been issued and those involved have not received such letters.  Perhaps farmers in County Kerry are being treated as guinea pigs in this case.</p></speech>

There are spin-outs, but there has not been a spin-out since 2013.  Let us take traded shares and indicate how we apply a value.  The documents that were traded were stamped by the Revenue Commissioners.  We know the values that were applied in 2011, 2012 and 2013.  In the letters we applied these values where there was a possible under-declaration of income.  Shares are traded among people who are either connected or unconnected to each other, whereby I agree to buy yours or you agree to buy mine.  There is no evidence of a denial that trading has been taking place.</p></speech>

There is stamp duty applicable at different rates in the same way as it is applied to land transfers.  They are all taxed instruments and we take real values into account.  That is the traded element and it has to be agreed by the co-op that a transfer has taken place.  We have no evidence of it being denied.</p> <p>  On why we did not look at this issue for years, we are concerned that the number of omissions from income returns is significant.  I am concerned that committee members might ask if we should have been looking at it in earlier years, or what we should be doing about it.  I was asked about contact with the individuals concerned and the wider community, including representatives, the association and this committee.  Fundamentally, there is self-assessment, whereby one fills in a tax return and sends it electronically to the Revenue Commissioners.  One declares one's income for the year.

We do not want to write to somebody else stating that a taxpayer has an issue.  I have 30 years of  experience working in the Revenue Commissioners.  I have dealt with many thousands of audits in my time and settled many audits as an auditor over the years.  Therefore, I know and understand business, farming and the difficulties involved.  I am slightly concerned that the Deputy has said that employees of the Revenue Commissioners have told him that we are wrong.  I can assure the Deputy that we are quite certain that our technical interpretation of this matter is correct.  Therefore, I am very surprised by what the Deputy has said and I would like to engage with him in a discussion of those points.  </p> <p>  In terms of papers of assessment with Revenue-----  </p></speech>

Mr. Phelan has stated that Revenue is in the process of raising assessments.  The letter issued by Revenue was dated 18 November and is due a reply by Friday, 9 December.  We ask that Revenue writes to the 400 people involved stating that nothing will happen for 21 days plus 39 days.  I ask that Revenue does not raise assessments for the next 39 days, which is a fair request.  Furthermore, I ask Revenue to find a mechanism that allows a test case to take place prior to the lapse of the 39 days.  With due respect to Mr. Phelan, he is very good at his job and I mean that in the best possible way.  He has worked for the Revenue Commissioners for 30 years.  As I have limited time here I want us to leave here today knowing what Revenue will do.  Will the letter state that Revenue will raise no assessments for another 39 days thus giving people 60 days' grace?  Is that correct, Mr. Phelan?</p></speech>

I ask Revenue to facilitate that no assessment be raised until 60 days have elapsed.  As many as 21 days will have be used by next Friday, 9 December, and I ask for another 39 days.  Mr. Phelan has said Revenue wishes to work with us.  It is unfair and goes against the spirit of co-operation that Revenue will write to the 400 people and raise the assessments of 2011.  I urge Revenue writes to the people informing them that they have been allowed 60 days whereby no assessments will be raised in that time and that Revenue will seek a mechanism with Kerry Co-op and its advisers to facilitate either the tax appeals commissioners or some process within the Revenue Commissioners to carry out a test case.</p></speech>

Let us remember that the letter that we issued asked people to respond to us within 21 days.  In the normal course of events, under the code of practice, what we would expect is for somebody to come back and confirm whether he or she has an issue.  Let us say a person confirmed he or she has an issue and thus needs 60 days, the 60-day period does not start at the beginning but at the time the person confirms he wants to avail of the period in order to make a voluntary disclosure.</p></speech>

The letter basically tells people that to avail of the opportunity to make such a disclosure they should respond to Revenue with a computation of tax together with the appropriate payment, which is within the 21-day period.  What we seek today is straightforward.  We want Revenue to issue a letter before next Friday because people are petrified by the 21 days' notice.  We want Revenue to state that it will now facilitate 60 days thus allowing the 21 days gone but adding 39 days and it will allow for a test case to be heard before the 60-day period has elapsed.  We want Revenue to state that it will not raise the assessments.  Revenue has the power not to raise assessments.</p></speech>

I respect the fact that Mr. Phelan is a very experienced man.  We want this matter spelled out in plain simple language.  Mr. Phelan knows what we have asked for.  We want him to issue a letter to the 400 suppliers stating that Revenue will facilitate them with 60 days.  It is within Revenue's remit to do so under the code of practice, from what I can see.  I ask Revenue to state that it will not raise assessments until the test case has been heard and for the test case to be heard within the 60 days.  I ask that Revenue to engage with Kerry Co-op and its advisers to facilitate a test case being heard.  I am worried that Mr. Phelan will leave here today having told us that he will write to people but he will inform them that Revenue will raise assessments.  Raising assessments would totally defeat the purpose of what we have sought.</p></speech>

All we are asking is that when a test case is proposed and taken place surely be to God it is only right, fair, honest and proper to allow procedures to take place.  For Revenue to go terrorising people again is wrong.  Revenue went at this matter in the wrong way in the first instance.  With respect, instead of Revenue learning from its mistakes it proposes to put its shoe in this matter again in an improper fashion.  The point that has been made today by members has been made in an honest manner.  For God's sake, I ask Revenue to please allow the test case to go ahead and not to put its size nine shoes in it.  That is all that we ask.</p></speech>

In his opening statement, he stated that "I understand that one co-operative share was issued for every 1,000 gallons of milk supplied.  For example, a farmer supplying 100,000 gallons of milk received 100 co-operative shares."  That is factually incorrect.  They got shares based on their quota not on the amount of milk they produced.  If the 100,000 gallons that Mr. Phelan referred to was from a farmer who had a 50,000 quota, he got 50 shares.  That reinforces the point that these were loyalty shares paid to farmers for sticking with their co-op and reinvesting in them.  It was more a reward for staying than a payment.  That is a critical point.  It again points out the amount of information that was not there and is now coming to light.  I would like Mr. Phelan to take that on board.</p> <p>  We are getting an extension of time which is great.  I have no doubt that a test case will be taken which could take a month, six months or 18 months.  I do not know how long.  Mr. Phelan probably has a better indication than I do.  It could take a long period of time.  Farmers will be looking for tax clearance certificates in 2017 for 2016 because if they do not get a tax clearance certificate their payments for all sorts of things will not be made.  Can Mr. Phelan give a clear undertaking that this issue will be dealt with separately and tax clearance certificates will be issued to these farmers to allow them to continue their business because it is a big worry for them?  If this issue is in the ether somewhere and they are told they cannot be given one until the issue is sorted out, it is just opening another huge can of worms.  I would like clarification on that if Mr. Phelan can give it to me.</p> <p>  I will add to the debate on the value of the share and how the Revenue Commissioners came to assess it.  My information is that in the grey market, the number of shares traded amount to about 1% of Kerry Group shares.  It is very difficult to come to a valuation based on a 1% trading.  That will come into this debate down the road.  Given the point made by Deputy Moynihan, which is fairly critical, if there is a ruling from the Revenue which is contrary to the one the witnesses arrived at, all bets are off.  That needs to be locked down.  If there is a case whereby the Revenue has determined that capital gains is to be based on these shares and not income, a complete reversal of what this letter is looking for, then to me all bets are off.  The Revenue Commissioners should start 2017 with a clean sweep and outline the way it will be dealt with from 2017 onwards.  </p> <p>  Deputy Ferris mentioned a letter of comfort.  Does it exist?  If it does, it has severe implications.  Mr. Phelan said he has done many audits.  I reiterate the point that if advice was sought on the transfer of shares for inheritance purposes and clear advice was given by Revenue that the value of these was to be at &euro;1.27, it is hugely significant.  Mr. Phelan said he is surprised that practitioners did not bring it to the fore.  I argue that practitioners brought it to the fore, raised it, got a valuation and acted accordingly.  All that will be taken into account in the test case and whichever way it comes out, we will have to accept it.  I need to make those points.  I seek a direct answer on the tax clearance going forward because it is very important for farmers.</p></speech>

I also asked about the principle of a Department or agency giving advice to a citizen.  there is an issue that when it can be proven that advice was given on a matter of fact that it then stands up in the future that the advice cannot be taken back.  Was a letter of comfort issued in respect of this practice, not necessarily from Revenue but from any authority?</p> <p>  I am not in any way suggesting that this is what I want to see happening but was Mr. Phelan suggesting that following this we can go back and look at 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010?  Is that something Mr. Phelan is saying Revenue is intending to do?  That is bringing it to a whole new level.  Mr. Phelan has heard the concerns here and surely that will not be what will happen next year.</p></speech>

I would like clarity on how the value of the shares was calculated.  Has a discount factor been applied because of the lack of market value for the shares as they were traded on the grey market?  Kerry's board had to approve the sale.  If all the shares were on the open market at the same time, the value of the share would probably drop because there would be more supply.  Has that been taken account of in the calculations?  How has the value of the share been calculated?  I want clarification on that.</p> <p>  The second question is on the letter.  It is imperative that the style of communication is looked at when these letters go out.  To Mr. Phelan it is factual information because he has a tax background.  I have the utmost respect for that but I do not.  The style of communication and the language used has to be looked at.  The ultimatums that are perceived and the perception of the vocabulary in the letter frightens the daylights out of people.  The Revenue Commissioners should have a look at the style of communication.  </p> <p>  The second question is on the calculation.</p></speech>

I am asking that following the test case, if Revenue is found to be right, it only starts charging people tax from that point forward because it is wrong to be going backwards when nobody knew they were doing anything wrong, including their accountants and officials helping them submit their accounts.</p></speech>

We may not meet the Friday deadline for getting the letters out but we do our best.<br/><br/>On Deputy Brassil's question on the issuing of tax clearance certificates, that is the easy part of it.  We have automated the tax clearance certificate process and it is a simple operation.  One makes one's tax returns, pays one's tax and applies for a tax clearance certificate online and it is instantly given - that is the procedure.  As to how this issue will affect the issuing of a farmer's tax clearance certificate, if there is an assessment of a farmer's tax and he appeals it, that has no affect on the system, he will still get his tax clearance certificate.  That is no problem there, it will not affect the issuing of the farmer's tax clearance certificate.  That is the easiest aspect of it.  <br/><br/><i></i>Regarding the value of the 1% of shares traded and the discount that might be applied to shares, a very small percentage of the shares are traded, and Kerry Group plc's trade in shares does not represent a huge volume either but, nevertheless, there is a market.  We have taken the value from the stamped documents that came to us and we have used those average values in the letter.  Whether that is critically correct in each individual case, we are clearly not certain because it may depend, as Mr. Paul Walsh said, on the time of the year.<br/><br/>As regards a discount factor if all the shares came on the market today, interestingly, that was one of the arguments put forward in one of the old cases.  The argument was made that the individual could not trade his shares at that moment in time because if he did so, all the shares would be traded together and it would restrict the value, but in that case it was decided that the value was the value that was available rather than a discounted value due to some unforeseen circumstances.  I am interested in the Deputy's point about a ruling to the contrary.  I certainly could not countenance that an outside agency, or even a State agency, giving a ruling on a tax issue would not be a matter that the Revenue would normally view, but many of the things that people would say about Revenue would be authorised by Revenue, so I would not make a comment on that. </p></speech>

Whatever tax is due is based on the disposal price.</p> <p>  On Deputy Neville's point about the style of communication, as I said earlier, it is not easy to tell a taxpayer that he or she has an issue.  I agree with the Deputy that the style was pretty strong in its language but we believe it was an invitation to engage with a code of practice.  Perhaps the language dealing with an non-professional is a little different but if one brought that letter to one's accountant, it would be well understood by him and what engagement with the code of practice involved.  A code of practice is a set of rules but one would not include all those rules in a letter.  I take the Deputy's point about the style of communication and we will certainly improve on what we are going to say to these people, particularly bearing in mind the Christmas period.  We will put as much comfort as we can in what we will say.  We are aware of the issues in farming and concerned about the issues facing farmers.  We will fix that and I thank the Deputy for pointing that out.</p> <p>  The example I gave of 100,000 shares was a simple one.  The examples I gave were for illustrative purposes.  We are relying on the rules of the co-op, and they are contained in a  public document, which I pulled off the company's website.  It states 4,546.09 litres, which is 1,000 gallons.  That is where we took that figure from.  I accept that it refers to the quota.</p></speech>

Allowing sexual activity does not amount to consent in some circumstances&mdash; <blockquote> 	(a) a person does not consent to sexual activity just because he or she does not protest and/or offer physical resistance to the activity,<br /><br />(b) a person does not consent to sexual activity if he or she allows the activity because of&mdash; <blockquote> 	(i) force applied to him/her and/or to some other person(s),<br /><br />(ii) the threat (express or implied) of force being applied to him/her and/or some other person(s), or<br /><br />(iii) the fear of the application of force to him or her or some other person(s), and </blockquote>(c) in any of the cases in paragraph (a) above, it is immaterial whether it is the accused who applies force and/or threats of force against the complainant and/or other(s), or not,<br /><br />(d) a person does not consent to sexual activity if the activity occurs while he/she is asleep or otherwise unconscious,<br /><br />(e) a person does not consent to sexual activity if the activity occurs while he/she is so affected by alcohol and/or some other drugs(s) that he/she cannot consent or refuse to consent to the activity, whether or not that person took alcohol and/or some other drugs voluntarily,<br /><br />(f) a person does not consent to sexual activity if the activity occurs while he/she is so affected by a physical condition or impairment of such a nature and degree that he/she cannot consent or refuse to consent to the activity,<br /><br />(g) a person does not consent to sexual activity with another person if he/she allows the sexual activity because he/she is mistaken about the identity of that person,<br /><br />(h) a person does not consent to sexual activity if he or she allows the activity because he or she is mistaken about its nature and quality,<br /><br />(i) a person does not consent to sexual activity if that consent is expressed by the words and/or conduct of someone other than themselves,<br /><br />(j) a person does not consent to sexual activity if he/she expresses by word and/or conduct, a lack of agreement to engage in that activity,<br /><br />(k) a person does not consent to sexual activity if, having first consented to sexual activity, he/she expresses by words or conduct a lack of agreement to continue to engage in that activity,<br /><br />(l) this section does not limit the circumstances in which a person does not consent to sexual activity.&rdquo;. </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>The amendment relates to the definition of consent, the provision of which in the Bill many organisations dealing with victims of violence and sexual violence in particular have campaigned for and asked the Government to include.  The definition speaks very clearly and simply for itself.  This is a huge issue in society.  Increasingly we see in rape cases the use by the alleged perpetrator of the defence that the victim did not object for any number of reasons, whether because the victim may not have been in a position to object or may have been inebriated.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment because, again, it has been asked for and campaigned for by the relevant organisations, and the sexual offences Bill is the appropriate legislation for its inclusion.</p></speech>

It is an issue I have been considering and about which I have been concerned.  I have heard the voices of people who believe such a provision should be in the Bill.  I agree in principle with what Deputies Coppinger and O'Callaghan and others suggest, that is, that we should provide in statute for a definition of consent and clarify in a non-exhaustive list the circumstances under which consent to a sexual act cannot be or is not obtained.  It is a complex issue, and I think people recognise that.  There are strong arguments to rely on precedent in considering what to include in the Bill.  Some of the original advice I received was that the precedents were strong in this regard and would suffice rather than a definition.  There are issues with the definition and quite how it is done which must be very carefully considered.  We want to make sure that there are no unintended consequences and that we improve the situation and help the victim rather than make matters more complicated.  Having said that, it is absolutely my intention to table an amendment to this effect on Report Stage.  </p>  <p>               That will largely reflect what is contained in amendments Nos. 88 and 89.  I have gone to external legal experts on this to get further advice and I am also engaged in further consultation with the relevant stakeholders.  Once that is complete, I will introduce a definition of "consent" along the lines set out in this group of amendments as well as setting out the list of circumstances, which, if proven, would vitiate consent.  These will include, but not be limited to, the use or threat of force, unlawful detention, unconsciousness, including being asleep, intoxication, mistake and deceit.  It will be a non-exhaustive list because that is also important.  It will be necessary in the definition to set out clearly the sexual acts to which it will apply.  These will be offences under the Criminal Law (Rape) Acts of 1981 and 1990, which are rape, aggravated sexual assault and sexual assault.  It may be that the amendment should be inserted in those Acts using this legislation rather than as a stand-alone provision in this legislation.  I ask Deputies, on the understanding that we are doing detailed work to arrive at the best definition and to consider all the unintended consequences, to wait until Report Stage before taking a decision on how they will handle this, at which point I will table an amendment.</p></speech>

I appreciate that this issue is complex and complicated.  Like Deputy Coppinger, I have tried to define "consent" and it is difficult.  It is important that we acknowledge that a great deal of sexual activity in Ireland is accompanied by alcohol consumption and we have to be careful about how we draft a definition in order that we end up unintentionally criminalising many young people and others in respect of that.  We should await the Minister's proposed amendment on Report Stage because it is such a difficult and complicated area.  We can consider it then and there is no downside to us awaiting that.</p></speech>

There is a view that in legislation, in some ways, less is more and, for example, defining the sexual activity as being voluntary or a free choice is probably a better way rather than prescribing a list of activities because if there are ten activities, is the eleventh less important in circumstances that had not been envisaged?  There are nuances and we cannot be black and white about this definition.  I do not accept the amendments in their current form.  I would like a reference to the voluntary nature of this activity and I am not sure a list will work.  Perhaps its inclusion was a mistake, but we enjoyed subparagraph (h) where somebody does not consent to sexual activity because he or she was mistaken as to its quality.  There are many people who would probably have cause to think that they were involved in non-consensual behaviour.  There may be unintended consequences of our efforts.  I am happy to wait for the Minister's amendment but I would be a little reticent about a prescriptive list.</p></speech>

We have to work with the Minister to ensure this is done properly and carefully and that we do not jump to an amendment that would have unintended consequences.  I welcome the fact that the Minister will table an amendment on Report Stage that will reflect the comments of members.</p></speech>

That is the point of subparagraph (h).  I am willing to wait to see what the Minister produces as long as we have an opportunity to then amend it.  These definitions have been suggested by people who deal with rape victims; they were not drafted off the top of my head.  While we can have something loose, "voluntary" can also be misinterpreted.  Where victims and women, in particular, are concerned, there is a great deal of victim blaming rather than examination of the issues.  I do not favour something as loose as that.  Unfortunately, this needs to be clearly defined and I will wait to see what the Minister produces.</p></speech>

We are just getting our heads around this.  Our amendment touches on the same point.  The amendments are interrelated.</p>  <p>  The term "protected person" was a substantial topic of conversation in the community of people working with persons with disabilities.  Were we not to change the term, we would create a new category of person where there does not need to be one.  It is not a neutral term and further stigmatises people with a disabilities.  When we consider such issues, we should be cognisant of the fact that existing laws on sexual abuse, attack, rape and so on apply to everyone.  This section is creating a new category in respect of people with intellectual disabilities that is not fully reflective of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  We need to eliminate discrimination in that regard, but if we keep the term, we will not do that.</p>  <p>  Our amendment tries to limit the clause to only what is needed to provide protection against exploitation and abuse without unduly interfering with a person's right to have a relationship of his or her choice.  This is a human rights approach, which would be better.  It covers all citizens, including those with intellectual disabilities, who have the right to make choices just as everyone else does.  It is about trying to get a balance.  It is in that context that we are opposing the current section 20 and trying to replace it with our wording so as to address abuses of authority and exploitation.</p></speech>

Lest there be any doubt, our approach uses the language contained in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The convention reads: "States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social, educational and other measures to protect persons with disabilities," etc.  That is the language used throughout the convention.</p>  <p>  I will address each amendment in detail.  Amendment No. 6 largely replicates the existing provision contained in section 21, although it differs in two respects.  It substitutes the term "relevant person" for "protected person", which is also the wording used in some of the other amendments.  I will clarify why "protected person" is being used in section 21.  The group of persons whom this section is designed to protect are those who, by reason of a disability as described in subsection (7), lack the capacity to understand the nature or reasonably foreseeable consequences of the sexual act in question, cannot evaluate relevant information or cannot communicate his or her consent.  As a consequence, the person lacks capacity to consent to the act.  It is this lack of capacity and not the fact of the disability that gives the person in question the status of a protected person.</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 10, which I will table, will introduce a further offence that refers to a "relevant person".  "Protected person" should be retained in section 21 in order to avoid conflating the two provisions.  </p>  <p>               This gets technical, but I will go through the amendments to explain the approach we will take.  The second difference between what is proposed in amendment No. 6 and the provision in section 21 is that amendment No. 6 would remove section 21(3).  The offence under section 21 arises where the defendant knew or was reckless, and people will understand what we mean by this, as to whether the person was a protected person.  Subsection (3), which would be removed by the amendment, is a safeguard which provides that, in proceedings for an offence under the section, it shall be presumed the defendant knew or was reckless that the person was protected under the section.  The defendant can rebut the presumption by raising a reasonable doubt as to his or her knowledge or recklessness, but the closer the relationship between the two parties, the more difficult it will be to rebut the presumption.  This is an important safeguard in the protection of persons who lack the capacity to consent.</p> <p> Amendment No. 7 is similar to amendment No. 6 and the existing section 21 of the Bill.  It removes reference to disability in section 21.  The effect of the amendment would be that the offence would apply to all persons.  It overlaps with aspects of the amendments we discussed earlier relating to consent.  It would arguably cover unconsciousness or intoxication as well as incapacity by reason of a particular disability.  I am concerned a provision referring to a lack of capacity without clarifying what may give rise to that lack of capacity could be very broad and might lead us into the area of legal challenge.  I ask Deputy O'Brien to consider this aspect.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities imposes an obligation to put in place effective legislation to ensure instances of exploitation and abuse against persons with disabilities can be identified and prosecuted.  It would be preferable to make this clear.  What Deputy O'Brien has put in the amendment is perhaps overtly broad.</p> <p> Amendment No. 8 from Deputy Daly seeks to replace section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, which is the existing provision on the protection of impaired persons, which Part 3 will replace and repeal.  Amendment No. 8 would do so by seeking to replace section 21 of the Bill.  Amendment No. 104 replicates amendment No. 8, but rather than replace section 21 it would insert a new offence in the Bill in a new section 51.  In both amendments, an offence would occur where a person in a position of dependence and trust takes advantage of his or her position and induces or seduces a person to have sexual intercourse with him or her or commit any other sexual offence involving the person.  The proposals do not deal with situations outside the category of an offence arising from abuse by a person in a position of dependence and trust.  A person vulnerable to exploitation but who is being exploited by a neighbour should be afforded the protection of the provision.  To narrow it down in this way would withdraw potential protection from exploitation by other people.  The provision is quite wide and does not include any restrictions on a person who may fall within the category of a victim of this offence.</p> <p> With regard to the defence of consent in subsection (2) of the amendment, consent must be granted freely and in the absence of duress or coercion.  There is concern as to whether this defence could be successfully relied on in a situation where a person in a position of dependence and trust and taking advantage of this position effectively grooms a victim for the purpose of having sexual relations.  Depending on the form of act or activity involved, it may not amount to duress or coercion.  The Law Reform Commission, in its report on sexual offences and capacity to consent, frames an offence on the basis of capacity to consent.  The proposals in section 21 also adopt the approach of capacity to consent.  We consider that section 21, together with amendment No. 10, will provide the necessary protection to those who are vulnerable to abuse or exploitation.  I am concerned if we accept the approach set out in amendments Nos. 8 or 104 we would fail to fulfil the obligations under the UN convention, which I previously mentioned.</p> <p> To fully ensure the necessary protection from exploitation by persons with responsibility for the welfare, care or supervision of certain persons with a disability, amendment No. 10 will introduce a provision to create an offence of engaging in a sexual act with a relevant person.  For this purpose, a relevant person is a person who has disability which is of such a nature or degree as to severely restrict the ability of the person to guard against serious exploitation.  It is a functional test but not related to capacity to consent at a particular time or a particular act.  The aim of the offence is to ensure those persons with responsibility for the care and well-being of another do not take advantage of that person's ability to protect himself or herself from serious exploitation.  The intention is to avoid a breach of trust by those responsible for another person's care or welfare.  The relationship between a person in a position of authority and a person under his or her care may be such as to be open to exploitation.  This provision does not undermine the capacity of a person who may be defined as a relevant person from consenting to a sexual act but it simply puts responsibility on those in authority to maintain an appropriate relationship.  It deals with some of the issues that have been raised.</p></speech>

I know she stated it is to bring it in line with UN regulations, but in other legislation enacted by the Oireachtas we do not refer to protected persons.

It is very confusing.  I do not get the point made by the Minister.  There are good points in amendment No. 10.  Does it remove all references to "protected persons", which would be helpful?  We must get a balance.  The Minister said a position of dependence and trust would exclude a neighbour, but it would not exclude a neighbour in my read of it because it specifically states it is not limited to a list of people in a category.  I know some of the disability groups have found problematic the idea of a person in authority for the time being.  The question was asked as to what this means.  An emotional relationship gives authority to somebody.  It does not necessarily end when a contract of employment ends.  What does "for the time being" mean?  Somebody in a position of employment has a certain hold or connection over a person.  Deputy O'Brien believes amendment No. 9 would covers this point, but it is problematic with regard to the Minister's amendment No. 10.  I suppose I am not helping things, but it is very confusing.  There is a point about language with regard to respecting people with disabilities not just in terms of terminology, but actually regarding people having the right to have sex and to engage in a physical relationship with someone if they want to.  </p>  <p>               Obviously there are issues sometimes around capacity but if one looks at the definition here of "someone with an illness that is of a nature or degree as to severely restrict the ability of a person to guard themselves against exploitation", this is an arguable point with any citizen who is vulnerable.  It is about getting a balance and I am not sure we have it in any of these amendments and whether we should be drafting something that encompasses all of them on the next Stage.  I do not know. </p></speech>

It adds a new subsection to section 21, which I assume is an alternative to amendment No. 7, also proposed by Deputy O'Brien.  The amendment includes a declaration that a relevant person has capacity unless the contrary is shown.  I fully appreciate what the Deputy is trying to achieve here and I received legal advice on the need for such a provision as there is similar declaration in the Law Reform Commission, LRC, proposals.  The LRC proposals state that a person's lack of capacity may arise from a disability and therefore, the statement that a disability of itself does not give rise to a lack of capacity is required.  It is complicated and it is not that we have not considered it or looked at it carefully but the two categories are necessary because the protected person is defined here as one who lacks capacity and that is why we need to have the protected person definition included here and dealt with.  The relevant person is the person who is under supervision of care of the person in authority, and this distinction is to avoid exploitation by that person in authority.  I am advised that both categories are necessary.  It is to have the full protection for people in both sets of circumstances that we have dealt with it in the Bill in this way.  It is definitely in line with the UN convention.  We have considered the points being made by the Deputies and I have gone through each of them.  Amendment No. 10 is helpful.  It is to make sure that a person has the necessary protection and the amendment covers the engagement, by the person in authority, in a sexual act with the relevant person.  The person in that circumstance has the capacity but he or she is open to exploitation because of the dependent relationship.  One can imagine situations where that might occur; there is capacity but there is dependency.  This would protect and differentiate between the protected person who lacks capacity and the protected person who has capacity, and it is in order to protect both categories that we have the different definitions in the Bill.</p></speech>

It is a further point to be added on and amendment No. 7 would replace section 21 in the Bill, which would be a further elucidation on all of that.</p></speech>

If the Minister is saying that a protected person is somebody who lacks capacity, there is a whole range of circumstances where a person might lack capacity and not just because of a disability.  They may be absolutely off their face drunk or on drugs, or they might be unconscious.  There may be other situations where they do not have capacity.  In this legislation we are creating a special person who lacks capacity i.e. a person with disabilities.  I do not believe that is the direction in which the disability community wants to go.  Absolutely there is an argument for a protection because of a dependency and circumstances, but not to single these people out as being different and apart.  I am not going to labour this point forever but I would remain very uncomfortable with that.  The term "relevant person" would cover it, the relevant person being somebody who is in a dependency situation, which makes that person then different from the person who is drunk or temporarily lacking capacity.</p></speech>

The Deputy referred to consent for other people and that will be dealt with in the definition of consent that I will bring in.  Everybody who has looked at this, from the UN to the Law Reform Commission has said that there are particular protections that are necessary if a person has a disability and that is what we are attempting to achieve.  It is not an attempt to stigmatise or to suggest that people are different.  It recognises that there may be capacity issues and that we need to deal with those, both where there is a lack of ability to give consent and where the person, who we define as a relevant person,  is in a very dependent situation and who could therefore be at risk of lack of ability.  That is the intention and why it is done like this.  In section 21 there is a greater burden on the defendant around their knowing of capacity issues.  It is to deal with those situations.  It is necessary in the legislation and it is protective of people with disability without wanting to separate out unnecessarily, which is the Deputy's concern.</p></speech>

For example, with regard to the whole issue of disability I know that previous legislation that dealt with capacity and people with disabilities did not require the person to have had a diagnosis or a disability to have their capacity assessed.  In fact, it took the very functional approach to decision making rather than a status based approach.  This means that if one is assessing the capacity of a person with a disability other legislation did not look at the diagnosis or the label in order to assess capacity; it was a functional approach rather than a diagnosis.  How does this legislation fit in with other legislation considering that we have taken that approach in the past for people with a disability?  It was not based on a diagnosis, it was based on their ability to make decisions.</p></speech>

There are also a further 22 provisions in relation to prosecutions to say that no proceedings for an offence under this part shall be brought except by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  This is a sort of protection to the Deputy's point.  There is the issue of how the lack of capacity of the protected person be proven in court.  It would be proven the same way it is now, so that is not changed.  Evidence of the person's capacity could be shown through the victim's own testimony, the testimony of close family or others who know them - as has been the case - or by expert witnesses with knowledge of the particular disability or illness and the impact of such on the individual's capacity at the time the act took place.  It is not seeking to change any of that.  I am advised that it is very relevant in the context of criminal law provisions rather than the broader points made by the Deputy about other legislation.  It does not apply.</p></speech>

I absolutely accept what the Minister says but if the Minister were to examine it she would see that what I have read into the record is exactly the briefing the Chairman has received.

I ask members for their attention.  There is confusion here and some day they will be in a position like this and will have to take the guidance but I am not happy with it.  We have agreed amendment No. 5, the effect of that is that the new section replaces the former section 20.  We have already agreed that so that change has taken place in my view.  The proposition at this point, having changed the content of section 20 by the agreement to accept amendment No. 5, is that we are now looking at a new section 20 that reflects the content of amendment No. 5.  I am asking that the new section 20 stand part of the Bill.</p></speech>

We wanted to oppose this section because it relates to sexual acts with protected persons.  To us the terminology creates another category of person where there does not need to be one in the context of sexual acts.  There are already laws against sexual acts, abuse, rape and so on in order to prosecute somebody but this creates a new category.</p></speech>

I am not referring to sex workers but to those who organise it.  Section 9 of the 1993 Act reads:</p> <blockquote> 	A person who for gain--  	(<i>a</i>) controls or directs the activities of a prostitute in respect of prostitution,<br /><br />(<i>b</i>) organises prostitution by controlling or directing the activities of more than one prostitute for that purpose, or<br /><br />(<i>c</i>) compels or coerces a person to be a prostitute...  </blockquote>  <p>As such, I am talking about pimps and traffickers.  The current very small fine referred to in the Act is &pound;1,000.  It is a class D fine.  I suggest it is these people who should be pursued, not individual women or vulnerable persons engaged in sex work.  It should not be those who are compelled to work or who work in the sex industry but those who profiteer, coerce and direct trafficking.  It is bizarre that the T&aacute;naiste proposes to maintain a definition of &quot;loitering&quot; in the Bill, which just means the harassment of sex workers, while keeping the fines very low for those at the top.  Therefore, we should remove the other things on which others and I have amendments and which simply penalise those engaged in sex work.  It is a paltry fine.  We propose that it be raised in order that a convicted person would lose the profits they had gained from compelling people to engage in or organising prostitution.  It is about going after the people at the top rather than those on the ground.</p></speech>

It is a term of imprisonment of five years, but the fine has actually been increased to &euro;22,000 on conviction on indictment.  </p>  <p>  On amendment No. 13, I appreciate that Deputy Ruth Coppinger is seeking to introduce a tougher penalty for the offence of organising prostitution.  I agree with her, but a specific fine of &euro;1,000,000 would be out of step with the more recent approach to penalties for indictable offences.  The correct approach would be to simply state a fine, without specifying a maximum.  That is the usual approach adopted in legislation of this type.  However, I agree in principle with the introduction of tougher penalties for the organisers of prostitution and will certainly bring forward an amendment to that effect on Report Stage.  The Deputy might consider whether she is satisfied with the amendment I will propose.  However, I note that it would be out of line with the approach adopted in legislation to specify a maximum amount.  I will bring forward an amendment which the Deputy can consider.</p></speech>

However, the people at the top are being fined relatively paltry sums.  The women concerned should not have been fined.  The T&aacute;naiste says she will bring forward an amendment, but how severe will it be?  It is the case that it is only a five year term of imprisonment.  Some of the sentences that can be handed down for other offences include life imprisonment.  Does the T&aacute;naiste have an idea of what she will propose in her amendment?</p></speech>

That is the way one draws up legislation generally, rather than setting a maximum fine, as the Deputy proposes to do in her amendment with a maximum fine of &euro;1,000,000.  I will look at the term of imprisonment and the five year tariff.</p></speech>

Mandatory sentencing was provided for and the view was that we were going to get the big boys with that legislation, while those at the bottom, the partial victims or users, would escape.  However, that did not turn out to be the case.  It is the low-lying fruit and the ordinary people at the bottom in any illegal industry who are caught.  That is the problem with an approach that involves criminalisation.  Our experience in the courts shows how cases have been brought forward.  There was a case in County Donegal earlier in the week involving a number of Romanians, none of whom had been trafficked, but they were the ones who had been targeted, with their money.  In that scenario who would be liable under this provision?  Would it be the brother of one of the women whom the court said had not coerced any of the women but who was helping them and, perhaps, organising protection or whatever else?  The problem in bringing forward legislation such as this is the same as the one we encountered with sentences for drugs offences.  We might say we do not want ordinary, independent sex workers or those who organise together to be caught up in this, but on the basis of our legislative proposals, they will be.  The person who rents the apartment or provides security could suddenly be the one deemed to be organising prostitution.  We need to be very careful because of other provisions dealing with brothel-keeping and so on.  We should be clear that there is a great deal of legislation dealing with trafficking as a separate issue.</p></speech>

It is an area the Garda investigates.  The evidence in seeking a prosecution is difficult to produce, but using the Criminal Assets Bureau is an approach that can be taken in gathering evidence.  I agree with the Deputy that we need to target those who organise and are behind either prostitution or trafficking.  We have strong legislation to deal with it.  I met the Council of Europe yesterday on the issue of trafficking in Ireland, our approach to which it is examining.  I intend to make the penalties stronger in so far as I can without specifying a particular sum, in the way Deputy Ruth Coppinger has.  I take the points being made and will examine the matter to determine what are the strongest provisions we can include in the legislation to have the sanctions about which Deputy Ruth Coppinger is talking targeted at the appropriate people.  I agree with the points made.</p></speech>

It is a proposal to amend that Act to make it much more severe.  It defines the organising of prostitution.  It is very clear that it refers to a person who controls or directs, organises, compels or coerces.  </p>  <p>               There are later amendments that I and others have.  I support the idea that two women who might be working together and protecting each other should not be fined and should not face any criminal sanction but those at the top should be got.</p> <p> I accept what the T&aacute;naiste is saying about waiting to see, as long as I still have an ability to resubmit.</p></speech>

For instance, kidnapping people, trafficking people and holding people for any purposes against their will are already heinous crimes in legislation and CAB and those organisations can address them.  It is important to make that point.  I happen to share a view that confusing people consenting to purchase sex with some of those issues can divert resources from tackling some of the major offenders in that regard as well, but we will see what comes back.</p></speech>

Subsection (2) sets out the penalty.</p>  <p>  The provision in paragraph (c) of section 24 which this amendment proposes to delete increases the penalty in section 8(2) of the 1993 Act to one of a class D fine or imprisonment for up to six months or both.  The offence is intended to target the public nuisance that may be associated with loitering.  However, it only arises where a person fails to follow a direction of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to leave the area.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that section 8 only applies to those who loiter for the purpose of soliciting another person for the purpose of obtaining that person's services as a prostitute where a person ultimately is seeking to purchase sexual services.  The proposed penalty in paragraph (c) is in line with public order offences under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and paragraph (c) should be retained.</p></speech>

It is a badly-behaved phone.  I cannot work it.</p>  <p>  As I say, currently this is classified as brothel-keeping.  They can be penalised or a landlord can be penalised and the courts regularly hear cases where people are in that situation, having their hard-earned money taken from them, going before a court etc.</p>  <p>  The reason we think this is incredibly important is that it is a vital safety measure for those who are currently engaged in sex work.  It is much safer for sex workers to work in a familiar environment, such as their own home where they are in more control of the situation.  It is also preferable if they themselves can organise their own type of security, through a friend who perhaps would vet clients or be near by, or a couple of people working together, a co-worker etc.  This is a position which is supported by the World Health Organization, which calls for the decriminalisation of brothels.</p>  <p>  At present, a brothel is defined as two or more persons sharing a premises.  There is an urgent requirement to deal with this issue.  If we do not address it and decriminalise this, in effect, we are forcing sex workers to work alone without support, being in much greater danger and exposed more to violence.  That would be a backward step, particularly if the Bill criminalising the purchase of sex were to be passed.  That makes it even more dangerous in this regard.  Because of that measure, it is particularly pertinent to move these people forward now.  </p>  <p>               An analysis of convictions for brothel-keeping shows that 91% of the people convicted were sex workers.  Therefore, this issue must be addressed urgently from a safety point of view.</p></speech>

A recent report by Amnesty International examines the issue in Norway.  It is entitled, Norway: The human cost of 'crushing' the market: Criminalization of sex work in Norway.  It explores the effect of similar legislation introduced in Norway in 2009.  One of the results of that legislation is that sex workers now feel persecuted rather than protected by the police, limiting their right to equal access to justice.  The report finds, "As is the case in many countries, sex workers are at a high risk of violence and abuse in Norway".  However, rather than being a group with which the police prioritise building relationships to reduce their vulnerability and the risk to them, the report states many sex workers risk eviction, deportation, police surveillance and loss of livelihood if they report any incident of violence to the police.  According to Amnesty International, no other group in society receives this much police attention and must live with it.  Even though the workers concerned are not doing anything illegal, this attention is unwarranted, even by the offence with which their clients are charged, let alone by the fact that sex workers are not breaking the law.  If the police wish to catch the purchasers of sex, it is not feasible for it to watch everybody in the community whom it might suspect would like to purchase sex.  It will watch the sex workers; therefore, it will be more difficult for them to work in their premises where they feel more safe.  Before people who wish to purchase sex will be prepared to part with their money, they will insist on the sex worker going to their place which will not nearly be as safe and where the threat of violence and the likelihood that they will be treated badly will be far greater.  It just does not stack up.</p></speech>

I am not in favour of brothels operating without any action being taken.  We saw what happened in the case of Rachel Moran who was in a brothel in Dublin at 15 years of age.  Effectively, she was a child.  However, the amendment could be used as a defence where one or two women prostitutes or sex workers were operating by themselves.  The Minister has to accept that it would be safer than in other situations.</p></speech>

They would, in effect, decriminalise brothel-keeping.  I would have serious concern about this.  The reality is that very often trafficked women are in brothels.  Under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, a person who does any of the following is guilty of an offence:</p> <blockquote> 	&quot;(a) keeps or manages or acts or assists in the management of a brothel;<br /><br />(b) being the tenant, lessee, occupier or person in charge of a premises, knowingly permits such premises or any part thereof to be used as a brothel or for the purposes of habitual prostitution, or<br /><br />(c) being the lessor or landlord of any premises or the agent of such lessor or landlord... </blockquote>  <p>The Act is intended to target those who allow a premises to be used as a brothel or who manage a brothel.  It is also the case that for a premises to constitute a brothel, there must be more than one person engaging in prostitution.  If the intention is to allow women and-or men to work together but independently, as with a number of the amendments brought forward to the 1993 Act, the risk of exploitation is very high.  The effect of the amendments, in reality, would be to decriminalise brothels in certain circumstances.  I am concerned that decriminalisation of brothel-keeping would create a legal loophole that would be ripe for exploitation by the organised crime gangs involved in the trafficking and exploitation of women involved in prostitution.  Women would come under pressure to claim that they were working independently when that was not the case and the Garda would be limited in the actions it could take to close brothels and disrupt the activities of pimps and criminal gangs.  There is evidence from New Zealand that some women have been so used by pimps to establish businesses that appear legitimate but from which the organised gangs of the pimps profit.  Creating exemptions from existing criminal law is a clear signal to those who seek to exploit such exemptions and the opportunity it presents.  I do not wish to accept that scenario.  If there were to be amendments to the offences under the 1993 Act, very wide consultation would be required with law enforcement agencies and so forth.</p><p>I wish to make a number of broader points.  A study by the European Commission, probably its most recent, entitled, Study on the Gender Dimension of Trafficking in Human Beings, published this year, concludes that evidence of the harmful effects of the sex purchasing law in Sweden, the approach we are taking in the Bill, is very low.  The study makes the point that it is clear that prostitution, legal or not, is an underground activity and carries risks for all involved.  The new offence we are creating in the legislation is about targeting the demand which feeds both the trafficking and the exploitation of persons for the purposes of prostitution.  It is expected that, in time, this will reduce the number of young women and men involved in prostitution, which will result in an overall reduction in the levels of harm.  That is a valid aim.</p><p>In 2009 the Norwegian Government criminalised the purchase of sex.  It carried out an evaluation of the law and the findings of that study did not report any evidence of more violence against prostitutes after the ban on buying sex had entered into force.  An important point is that young men in Norway have changed their attitudes towards the purchase of sex in this way.  Interviews with police forces indicate that the law has had a normative effect on people's behaviour.  Obviously, there are issues relating to accurate data, but despite the lack of accurate data for the size of the market for prostitution either before or after 2010, estimates of the current market show a decline in the demand for prostitution after the introduction of the law.</p><p>On the amendments, many people who are taking this route suggest New Zealand is the model we should follow.  That country had an amendment similar to the ones being proposed today.  There has been huge concern in New Zealand that the model it adopted, similar to the one proposed in the amendments, has potentially been open to abuse by those intent on profiting from the prostitution of others.  The danger lies in having unregulated brothels, without proper measures being in place to identify or tackle the human rights abuses that can take place in the sex industry.  In New Zealand researchers have noted that even when genuinely independent women involved in prostitution have sought to avail of this type of model, it has not been entirely effective.  The women concerned have not been in a position to have a premises, for example, and even if they wanted to do so, they could not afford to set up their own businesses.  There is the problem of criminal gangs abusing them and that is precisely what has happened.</p><p>There is much evidence to show that decriminalising brothels in this way, which is what thee amendments would do, is not the way forward.  </p>  <p>               I do not know if the Minister read the legal opinion of Michael Lynn SC on the matter.  He argued that this legislation will violate the human rights of sex workers.  According to him:</p><blockquote>	Human rights are universal and sex workers are entitled to have their human rights equally with others.  The fact they engage in work that many people do not approve of does not mean their rights are negated and in order to protect the rights of sex workers, decriminalisation is the best approach. </blockquote> <p>A big problem for us in trying to ascertain the best way to move forward is that we have not listened to sex workers.  The former Minister, Alan Shatter, won his case because Sean Guerin did not give him a voice.  He was wrong not to listen to him and hear what he had to say.  Likewise, the Government should listen to, and at least entertain, the opinions of sex workers.  They are at the coal face and it beggars belief that we have not listened to what they have to say.  I assure the Minister that if she were to listen to them, they would be open about telling her that they would like to be able to work with other females for protection because that is a safer environment.  Working with another woman or two rather than alone has to be safer and they argue that they should be allowed to work in small groups.  It is not outrageous to argue that by criminalising the purchase of sex, more sex workers will be driven into the hands of pimps.  They will be less safe and they will feel less secure.  They will need security and he is called a pimp.  We are going in the wrong direction.</p></speech>

She will find no opposition to any legislation she brings forward to eradicate trafficking and to protect women and men who are being trafficked and exploited, but there are sex workers who will continue to be involved in the industry and by not allowing them to work in pairs or groups, the Minister is endangering their safety.  She has a responsibility to all individuals.  If these amendments are not acceptable, what measures will she take on Report Stage to address the issue of sex workers and their safety?</p></speech>

The lack of evidence in respect of these matters has been commented on in all jurisdictions.  Claims about alleged successes or magic wand solutions in Sweden and Norway have not stood up to scrutiny and there are serious concerns about the lack of evidence initially being to the detriment of being able to analyse progress.  If the research is not done at the beginning, no one can say how successful anything is.  Other changes happened in Sweden and while street prostitution changed, there was nothing to indicate that it had not been diverted into other areas such as the Internet.  The best Sweden could claim was that prostitution had not increased.</p>  <p>  Deputy Wallace referred to Norway and the thorough research undertaken there by Amnesty International.  One of their pilot studies highlighted serious harassment of sex workers in their place of work, which was largely their homes or their premises.  The amendment is trying to decriminalise the activity where one or more women work together and the Minister said they might be unable to afford a premises but, in many instances, they are using their homes.  By criminalising the activity, we face the prospect of forcing these people into homelessness.  A landlord could evict them and that is dangerous and harmful in the current climate here.  It has been deemed to be harmful by many organisations, including the Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women, Anti-Slavery International, the International Labour Organization and the World Health Organization.</p>  <p>  The House of Commons produced its half yearly review earlier this week, which was an impressive document.  The recommendation in this area is that at the earliest opportunity the Home Office should amend existing legislation in order that soliciting would no longer be an offence and brothel keeping provisions would allow sex workers to share premises without losing the ability to prosecute those who control or exploit sex workers.  That is the nuance or the fine line we are trying to address.  When a capable, rational adult women is engaged in a practice with another capable adult woman or man for the provision of sexual services and they give evidence that they are not being coerced by anybody, that has to have a certain status.  Deputy Wallace is correct that we have not listened to the people who are engaged in this activity.  In the context of introducing legislation to criminalise the purchase of sex, if we do not make this provision, then we will make prostitution even more dangerous than it is now.</p>  <p>  Deputy Coppinger's points are not appropriate with regard to this important issue.  Sex with a 14 year old or 15 year old child is absolutely unlawful in any circumstance under existing legislation.  Saying she agreed to it or she was working in the industry is no defence whatsoever.  The Deputy is conflating issues that are not related.  Amendment No. 16 enables the prosecution of sex workers but allows them to use this as a defence and is not adequate.  This is about harm reduction.  I acknowledge the Minister has said her goal in this area is to reduce harm.  Concentrating on demand will not tackle many of the issues around sex work, including the gender dimension, class, race and so on.  By tackling demand, the Minister is not addressing those inequalities and is ignoring the experiences of sex workers who have not been consulted on this.  All the evidence points to the wrong people being caught up in this and that is what this is about.  More than 90% of these cases prosecuted in Ireland are taken against sex workers.  They are not taken against pimps, organised crime lords and so on.  It is one or two people working together, many of whom are not Irish.  Some came to Ireland to engage in sex work but more did not.  We are not helping them by failing to address this issue.</p>  <p>  The House of Commons report places huge emphasis on research and evidence and that is sorely lacking in policy making in this jurisdiction.  We need to conduct better research.  Many good examples and experience show this protection needs to be in place.</p></speech>

Nobody else is involved, an issue the Minister said would arise if this provision was introduced.</p>  <p> I am not a member of the committee and, therefore, I do not know which groups of sex workers were invited in, but I hope there was engagement.  There are different views among sex workers.  </p>  <p>               Some sex workers who may have a choice in the matter have a certain viewpoint but they would be a minority view, in my opinion.  Other people involved in sex work, the majority of whom are women, are there because they are poor, because of their race and background or, in many cases, due to having an addiction.  </p> <p> The point I made about brothels is that there are 15-year old children in brothels.  I did not mean that this was the only issue that existed.  The Minister should consider the amendment.  Our amendment seeks to ensure that one woman does not profit from the proceeds generated by or the work of another women and, therefore, it should be accepted.</p></speech>

All of the different arguments were put forward to the committee.  The committee made clear recommendations.  We have based the legislation on the key points that were made by the committee.</p>  <p>  I met the association of sex workers.  I listened to its members, talked to them and heard their point of view.  I also met sex workers who, as Deputy Coppinger has said, completely and totally support the legislation.  They told me that they have experienced extraordinary exploitation in Ireland and would have welcomed a route out of prostitution at a much earlier stage.  The Deputy rightly made the point that many of the women who are in prostitution are there because of addiction and poverty.  The vast majority of sex workers in Ireland at present are organised by criminal gangs.  That is the reality of the industry.  Let us be clear about that on this committee.</p>  <p>  I want to address the points made about the human rights of sex workers but I shall first make a point about the industry as a whole.  Regardless of whether one takes the approach of this legislation, for those who are involved in the industry - because of its very nature, the core assumptions around it and the core ways women are treated in it - there is a huge amount of violence.  In fact, evidence shows that whether one takes the approach I recommend here, or the opposite, there is not much difference in the levels of violence people experience.  In New Zealand, where there has been decriminalisation, it appears that adverse incidents, including violence, continue to be experienced by those in the sex industry.  There is conflicting evidence on whether violence is reported more often since decriminalisation but there has been and continues to be a marked reluctance among sex workers to follow through on complaints.  That is the reality of the industry the Deputy is talking about.  I absolutely accept the point, and I discussed this matter yesterday with the Council of Europe, that one needs to do whatever one can, in terms of services, to provide exit routes for women who have been caught up in the industry unwillingly.</p>  <p>  Deputy Wallace raised a point about human rights.  He asked whether the criminalisation of the purchase of sex violates the human rights of sex workers.  That is effectively what the Deputy said.  I do not believe that it does.  I understand the concerns that have been raised about the potential impact of criminalisation on the purchase of sex on the safety and health of sex workers.  The measures that I have proposed target demand for sexual services and thereby aim to reduce the overall number of persons involved in prostitution.  This approach has been brought in by quite a number of countries recently and in Northern Ireland just some time ago.  </p>  <p>  The seller of sexual services is not criminalised in recognition of the fact that the seller, as I have said, is often a vulnerable person.  There is evidence that the numbers involved in prostitution is far lower in Sweden compared with nearby countries with full decriminalisation.  The Netherlands is estimated to have around nine times the rate of prostitution as Sweden and Germany is estimated to have around 30 to 40 times the rate.  There is no conclusive evidence that the Swedish approach has an adverse effect on the safety and health of sex workers.</p>  <p>  I should note the Department and I are supporting organisations such as Ruhama that work with women. Ireland offers free confidential health care services.  There is no reason to believe that the extent to which these services are currently accessed by those providing sexual services would be reduced by this proposal.  Support services are provided to sex workers who wish to exit prostitution or to people currently involved in the industry by organisations such as Ruhama.  Many years ago I was one of the first people to support funding for Ruhama because of its important outreach work.</p>  <p>  I am happy to put into the Bill provision for a review of the legislation.  I envisage a short period before reporting back on how it was working and what were the figures.  There is a need to offer additional supports to women and men who wish to exit prostitution.  I will not go into the details of the funding but an increased amount of funding has been given to the organisations that work in this area like Ruhama and the south inner city local drugs task force.  The committee should note there was a 10% increase in funding in 2016 and I will outline more facts for members.  Ruhama's annual report of 2015 showed that 301 women were given support and assistance and 228 women were given care and case management.  It is important to note that out of the 228 women, as many as 94 women were identified as victims of sex trafficking by Ruhama.  Trying to bring people to justice in terms of trafficking, as we have already discussed, is extremely difficult.  Ruhama also supported women through a programme of street outreach.  As many as 103 women accessed services for the first time in 2015 and 27 of them were suspected victims of sex trafficking.  Sex trafficking is very real in Ireland right across the country.  It is interesting to note that out of the 228 women that Ruhama helped, 37 were from different countries.  Many women have been brought into the country and in the vast majority of cases criminal gangs have trafficked them here for prostitution.  That is the backdrop to the legislation.</p>  <p>  The amendments proposed do not address the situation where a person is forced to engage in sexual acts for his or her own profit.  I must say the person is being exploited and used as a front for somebody else.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.383" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2016120700002#N00900"><p>Trafficking is a separate area.  We are adamant there should be greater enforcement to prevent trafficking.  We are discussing a separate area today.  This legislation will not address the problems of trafficking.  We need stronger enforcement of existing laws to ensure trafficking is diminished.  We are arguing about what is happening here and there and obviously do not agree.  There have been many interpretations of what happens elsewhere.</p>  <p>  The Northern Ireland Minister of Justice commissioned independent research from Queen's University that dismissed the Swedish model and found agreement among sex workers and the PSNI that criminalising the purchase of sex would drive prostitution underground, endanger the lives and health of sex workers, including a significant male transgender minority, increase the involvement of organised crime, increase the social stigma of sex workers and divert police resources away from sex-trafficking investigations.  </p>  <p>               Did the T&aacute;naiste or her Department consider commissioning independent research in the Republic of Ireland at any stage?  Surely it would have been interesting to see what could have been learned from it?  The argument cannot be made that we would not learn anything from it.  We have been speaking with many of the sex workers and we are getting a very different view to what the T&aacute;naiste is presenting in respect of what is happening.  They are adamant that this will make their work less secure.</p> <p> There are plenty of people involved with prostitution who would prefer to make a living from doing something else.  There are some who are happy to make a living at it but some would like to get out.  How much direct help are we giving them?  The T&aacute;naiste has argued they are being helped by the money being given to Ruhama but I suggest that we give money to the people involved, many of whom are single parents.  They need direct help and perhaps we should think about how best to help them with funding of one kind or another, particularly if they would like to get out of the industry and make a living somewhere else.  I do not know of any direct help that they are getting but it should certainly be considered.  Unfortunately, the authorities in Northern Ireland did not accept the recommendations of their own independent commission investigation, going against the Minister for Justice there, who was opposed to criminalising the purchase of sex.  The Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, was against it as well but, sadly, the Northern Ireland Executive decided to go against advice and went down a different route.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.385" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2016120700002#O00200"><p>The T&aacute;naiste is right and there is no doubt that sex work is incredibly dangerous and violent.  The purpose of this amendment is to make it less so, to be honest.  It deals with a deficit that currently exists.  There is the very valid objective of trying to catch those who exploit people through prostitution by running brothels etc.  The law, as it stands, has an unforeseen or unintended consequence because the people who pick up the pieces and are being penalised are the very victims that we say we are trying to protect.  We are trying to address that deficit in these amendments.  It would help to go after the big boys.  Currently, the policing resources, etc., are diverted into areas dealing with issues where two people are working together who may not be doing any harm or annoying anybody.  Rather than the Garda having to deal with that under brothel-keeping, it would be simple for people to say they are working together.  This is particularly pertinent against the backdrop of criminalising the purchase of sex.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste has indicated that there is no evidence that women have been harmed in Sweden or Norway by this measure.  Equally, there has been no indication that it has worked.  These are complex issues and there are good arguments to say that because of the lack of data or research done at the start, any comparisons being made now are fundamentally flawed.  In Norway there is a sizable body of academics that disputes the claims of that country's Government and there is a very valid argument put forward that demand has not been reduced but rather that it has been displaced and put somewhere a little more hidden and, sadly, much more dangerous.</p>  <p>  If the T&aacute;naiste is going to push through the criminalisation of the purchase of sex, which she has the numbers to do, as an absolute minimum this protection must be put in place.  Against the backdrop of criminalising that activity, it will be much more dangerous for sex workers.  The power will transfer to the buyer.  There will be less time to negotiate, perform checks, use condoms, etc., because of the fear of being caught.  Deputy Wallace made the point earlier that the buyer will be found through the seller, so people will be harassed in that way.  We must reduce that pressure, which will inevitably come about.  The Minister mentioned Ruhama but there are significant numbers of organisations and people at the coalface who would take a very different view, including social workers, HIV and AIDS activists and so on, and who would point to the evidence in countries like Sweden where people got less protection and help.  The people there did not access the outreach programmes and there was a "moralistic" intervention put in place, with individuals being encouraged to leave the industry.  I am all in favour of people getting help to get out if that is their wish.  However, I do not favour people passing judgments on the way others live their lives and using that to coerce them or prevent them from accessing help.  This has occurred with those trying to access condoms and outreach support against the backdrop of criminalisation and is not the way forward.</p>  <p>  The only academic study carried out on this island that interviewed sex workers in a comprehensive way was done by Queen's University in Belfast.  The information from that was incredibly enlightening with regard to people involved with prostitution.  As in much of Europe, many of the people engaged with sex work were not born in this country.  Many would say they came to the country voluntarily to sell sex, although the study indicated that some were encouraged to come here but did not get the money they were told they would get.  That is a different issue from trafficking.  Trafficking has no place in this discussion.  There is, rightly, strong legislation to deal with rape, kidnapping, sex with minors, holding somebody against his or her will, trafficking and other issues.  The Garda has indicated that using its resources for tracking down people who have agreed between them to have sex in exchange for monetary benefit or whatever is a diversion from targeting some of the key offenders.  This is a protective measure that is necessary against the backdrop of what is being proposed elsewhere in the Bill.</p></speech>

That is the evidence we have about prostitution in Ireland.  Many of the women from international locations are not coming here of their own accord, generally speaking.  It is part of organised activity.</p>  <p>  There are also public policy issues that we must consider, including cultural and attitudinal changes to prostitution.  I have already quoted the research from Norway indicating how attitudes have changed and how alterations to legislation have made Norway a less attractive country for prostitution-based trafficking.  I accept the points made by Deputies about the differences in trafficking and prostitution, and as Deputy Clare Daly states, some women may be involved independently.  There are attitudinal and cultural linkages nonetheless, as well as public policy points to be made on the broader approach.</p>  <p>  A recent European Commission report, from which I have already quoted, concluded that the purchase of sexual services approach is extremely helpful in combatting trafficking.  It is very important to consider that and it confirms previous conclusions by the European Parliament and Council of Europe.  Deputies have quoted the survey from Northern Ireland but politicians there knew about that survey and took the decision to go along the route I am recommending in the legislation.  </p>  <p>               That was an online survey.  I take its reliability for what it is, but I make the point that it was an online survey and one has to be aware of that.</p> <p> To return to the amendments, my own belief is that women would still come under pressure to claim they were working independently when that was not the case and that garda&iacute; would be limited in the actions they could take to close brothels and disrupt the activities of criminal gangs.  I repeat the point that I have made: creating exemptions in the way the Deputy is proposing from existing criminal law would be a clear signal to those who would seek to exploit such exemptions and the opportunity it would present.  I do not believe that is a scenario that we should accept.</p> <p> In terms of reviewing the legislation, I could table an amendment to examine the consequences of this.  The Deputy asked about research.  Let us remember that there were, as I have said, 800 submissions to the justice committee.  There was a huge amount of work done by members of all parties.  There was cross-party agreement on the recommendations on the way forward for prostitution.  That was a committee of this House with cross-party representation that received almost 30 oral submissions and 800 submissions in total.  It produced a carefully-drafted report with a unanimous recommendation from all parties that we should move in this direction.</p> <p> I absolutely take the point about support services and exit strategies for people who would want to leave the industry.  There is a strong lobby by the Sex Workers Alliance Ireland.  I know that Deputies have been very heavily lobbied.  Perhaps some of the other people who are exploited by this situation do not have such a strong voice.  We need to listen and be concerned about other voices that are perhaps somewhat more silent than the lobbying that has been conducted by one particular perspective on this debate.  I have no wish to make the situation more dangerous; of course I have not.  The evidence from other countries points to the dangers of this industry in the first place and the risks that it poses to all of those involved in it, apart from the criminal gangs that exploit it.</p></speech>

If we do not delete it, a sex worker could be tried for loitering in a public place.  This new offence could be used to target sex workers.  We are seeking to ensure this measure is not included in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, as proposed in section 25 of this Bill.</p></speech>

There is widespread agreement that this section should be deleted because it is not beneficial to anybody.  If we are serious about the so-called Swedish model, which I do not think is what we are providing for in this Bill in any case, it is wrong for us to maintain the harassment and prosecution of individual women.  I understood that the Minister was considering the removal of this section.  Perhaps she can clarify the matter.</p></speech>

I had a very detailed discussion with representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on it.

I do not have any objections to the section being opposed.</p></speech>

We need to leave an appropriate time go by.  The normal review period for legislation is longer.  I recognise that there are very different views in this regard.

Indeed, we propose that a review should take place every two years thereafter.  It is absolutely vital for an ongoing review mechanism to be built into this legislation, particularly in light of its potential impact on behaviour changes.  Is the Minister looking at that type of thing or at something bland?  I do not mean that in a derogatory way.  I think a more specified type of review would be necessary.</p></speech>

I agree that we do not just want a mechanical review after five years.  I suggest there should be a review in two years.

If I can design the review in a more useful way so that it can examine precisely the impact of the legislation, I will do that.  I will accept the two-year timeframe that has been recommended.

These are vital amendments because the T&aacute;naiste is introducing serious legislation to criminalise the purchase of sex, which is a controversial measure.  Certainly, the situation will not improve for those involved in sex work unless this legislation is accompanied by measures to assist sex workers in getting out of prostitution.  Earlier, the T&aacute;naiste referred to the Swedish model.  This is not the Swedish model; it is nothing near it.  If people are to be assisted in getting out of sex work and prostitution, then all these things are necessary.  The areas covered in the proposed report include education, language training, financial assistance, housing, health care, social welfare, rehabilitation services and addiction treatment.  Obviously, this affects migrants.  A considerable number of sex workers are migrants.  They are unable to get out unless they have regular employment status and are free to look for other work.  The Bill makes a mockery of introducing the criminalisation of the purchase of sex unless the Government accompanies it by serious social measures to enable people to get out of prostitution and sex work.</p><p>Amendment No. 23 is somewhat different.  Amendment No. 23 is designed to allow sex workers to report traffickers or organisers of prostitution - in other words, people who coerce them into sex work.  It calls on the Minister for Justice and Equality to make available additional procedures and supports to protect people who report major traffickers and organisers of prostitution and to assist them to regularise their status in the country if they do so.  We could envisage scenarios whereby women would be driven underground unless these measures are put in place.  The criminalising of the purchase of sex could make things more dangerous unless these people are assisted to get out of prostitution.  The major defect in the Bill is the lack of social measures to help to reduce the numbers involved in prostitution and sex work.</p></speech>

However, I suggest that the extensive reporting provisions are not suitable to be put into legislation in this manner.  For example, amendment No. 22 would require the Minister to report on a remarkably wide range of areas, including education, language training, financial, housing, health care, social welfare and rehabilitation services that should be provided by the State to support and assist sex workers to exit prostitution.  I have already made the point that I believe these services need to be in place and that we must develop ways of achieving precisely that.  The anti-human trafficking unit in the Department undertakes extensive work with the Garda and NGOs.  We have taken this approach to support people in this situation.  There is no doubt we have more to do.  However, there are many elements to what we are doing and we are on the right track in terms of supporting people and offering the supports that are needed.</p>  <p>  These amendments refer to the needs of migrants in respect of regularising their immigration status.  We need practices and procedures for women who have been trafficked such that they are dealt with appropriately once they are identified.  Often, they come within the immigration area and seek regularisation.  A particular approach is taken with regard to women who have been identified.  Usually, this applies to women although we are seeing men being exploited and trafficked for economic reasons as well.  Particular procedures and practices are in place to give the best supports to people who find themselves in these situations.  In particular, they are identified within the immigration process.  Many of these issues are outside the scope of the Bill.  In some ways, they are for consideration across all Departments of the Government.</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 23 provides that an extensive report would be required to be made in respect of the protection and assistance of sex workers who report trafficking, organisers of prostitution and so on.  Numerous departmental issues arise in terms of interpretation and implementation.  It would be difficult to accept the amendment.  Many of the areas subject to report are outside the scope of the legislation and are cross-departmental in nature.  However, there may be other ways to address this issue.  This is something the justice committee might decide to examine.  For example, a report could be commissioned on these issues.  Further work could be done in consultation with the appropriate stakeholders and with relevant support.  Certainly, that is something I would call on my Department to support.  I have no difficulty with that.  However, given the extraordinarily broad nature and scope of these amendments I cannot accept them.</p></speech>

I would find it difficult to support a Bill that criminalises the purchase of sex but does not accompany it with any of the other measures that are necessary to assist people to get out of sex work or situations where they are being coerced, forced or compelled and have little choice due to a range of factors.  The amendment is broad-ranging because there is a broad range of reasons why women end up in sex work and prostitution.</p>  <p>  What is being done here is really ham-fisted.  Other countries have introduced the criminalisation of the purchase of sex but they have accompanied it with social measures.  They are linked.  By contrast, the T&aacute;naiste is introducing the criminalisation of the purchase of sex but she is not accompanying it with any of those things.  It strikes me that this country has a bad record of dealing with women, women in poverty and this issue in particular.  It will amount to a continuation of that record if the T&aacute;naiste does not include measures to assist people to exit prostitution.</p></speech>

Let us examine it more closely.  </p>  <p>               In the drafting of the amendment the Deputy is referring to the needs of migrants.  That is extraordinarily broad and this is not the legislation on which it should impact.  I have given the example of women who are trafficked and outlined the particular approach that needs to be taken to them from the point of view of immigration history and how they should be supported.  I have spoken quite a bit about exit supports; therefore, from that perspective I agree with the Deputy absolutely.  However, I am making the point that it does not need to be included in this legislation and certainly not in the way he proposes.  It is too broad and inappropriate for inclusion in this legislation.  I do not mean that the issue is not an appropriate one with which to deal in the context of introducing legislation.  I am absolutely clear that organisations working with women who find themselves in this situation need support.  I have increased the funding for them in the past two years in recognition of the very issues the Deputy has outlined.  I have also said I see no problem in doing further work on them.  However, I do not believe the vehicle for this is the legislative mechanism suggested by him.  The issue, of course, is very real and accompanies the legislation in terms of my practical approach to and funding for those who are supporting the women involved and understanding the issue further, bringing stakeholders together and producing a report on precisely how the supports could be developed.  However, the precise drafting of the proposal is extraordinarily broad and, as such, I cannot accept it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.453" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2016120700002#S00300"><p>I am surprised from a procedural point of view that the amendments were allowed while ours were not.  I have no problem with the amendments and want to discuss them, but I note that technical point  It strikes me as strange in circumstances where the amendments are incredibly vague and aspirational without specific times or targets being set, whereas ours were not like that.  Nevertheless, they were ruled out of order.  I am happy to discuss the amendments because they highlight the one-sided nature of the debate on these issues and constitute an expos&eacute; of the Bill's shortcomings.</p>  <p>  Much of the debate on the move to criminalise the purchase of sex has been moralistic and judgmental, with little attempt to understand from where prostitution comes.  The idea is that all sex work is discriminatory against women, violent and harmful to society and that if we outlaw it, it will be reduced or go away and that everything will be great.  In reality, it is a very complex field.  There is no doubt that gender discrimination is a contributory factor, but social exclusion, poverty, racism and such issues are equally contributory factors.  If we are serious about limiting the harm caused, improving the lot of sex workers and giving them an out, we have to address all the reasons they become involved in sex work.  In concentrating too much on certain issues we are denying the narrative of thousands of sex workers worldwide who argue that they have made a choice.  It might not be a great one and many of them see that it might not be the best one, but if they had other options, they would make another choice.  However, concentrating on criminalisation will not help them.</p>  <p>  If we are serious about tackling this issue, we will need to concentrate on migration issues, education, employment issues and all the rest, but they are matters of social and political policy and, sadly, the direction of the Government is away from this.  Many of the organisations at the coalface which deal with these groups, including HIV Ireland and Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, are fully opposed to the criminalisation of the purchase of sex.  The Minister said she had been lobbied strongly by the Sex Workers Alliance, but that is like lobbying David and Goliath.  Sex workers have had to fight to organise themselves to have their voices heard against the monolithic viewpoint that the criminalisation of the purchase of sex will cure all ills.  Many views have changed since the legislation was originally mooted and many of the organisations which had initially signed up to Turn off the Red Light have actually changed their views and pulled their support from the criminalisation of the purchase of sex in the light of evidence.  Criminalisation will not address any of the reasons that cause people to engage in prostitution.  All of the other factors whereby people are compelled or trafficked into it are illegal.  There is no forum, but it exposes the fact that the game in town was not really about this.  It will not help people to exit prostitution either.</p></speech>

I fully understand her disappointment in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.455" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2016120700002#S00500"><p>I do not believe the debate is one-sided.  I agree absolutely that we must look at the broader issues.  There is no doubt about this.  However, the issue is what can we realistically include in legislation as opposed to what is part of broader social policy issues that need to be addressed.  I do not accept Deputy Clare Daly's characterisation of the Government as being uninterested in social issues.  In fact, it is very difficult to invest in infrastructure if one does not have an economy that will support it.  We have to address the factors that impact on prostitution and part of addressing the pull factor is looking at criminalising the demand which would undermine the market for prostitution.  I have not heard her talking about it, but the Deputy needs to examine the market and demand for prostitution.  I will not reopen the debate, but there is a great deal of evidence I can cite and which the committee examined in a very comprehensive way which suggests this is a positive way forward.  I accept that it is a complex issue and that there are different arguments, but in terms of what we have seen in other countries and the increasing number of countries that have moved in this direction, there are guidelines in place for how we should approach the issue which is complex and in respect of which there are many factors.  Of course, the question as to why women end up in prostitution involves a great many factors.  Most people who study the issue agree that they include poverty.  Certainly, the evidence suggests that for many of the women about whom the Deputy was speaking who work on their own, there are serious issues of addiction for which they need help.  It is to feed that habit that they engage in prostitution.  I agree with the Deputy that helping them is about providing services for them to receive treatment for their drug addiction.  I agree that we need to address all of the other factors that leave women susceptible to exploitation through prostitution, whether it be addiction, lack of employment or another reason.  Support services need to be targeted and we have to prioritise the provision of supports.  I agree with Deputy Ruth Coppinger that this goes hand in hand with the legislation, but I cannot accept the amendments.</p></speech>

Other countries are realising criminalisation of a lot of things does not work.  The so-called "war on drugs" has been an abysmal failure.  The points raised in the amendments address the core of the problems better.  </p>  <p>               Rather than hitting people with sledges or putting them in prison, it would be far more fruitful in time to examine from where the problem is coming and deal with the social issues behind it.  In her defence the Minister said she did not have an economy to do everything that could have been done during the past six years, but we will not get into that debate today.  When austerity measures wer used to help to deal with the banking collapse - it cost the State a fortune - choices were made.  It was not the case that there were no choices.</p></speech>

It concerns helping women who have been arrested but who have clearly been trafficked, deceived or forced into sex work.  Something must be introduced to at least give an incentive to the women concerned to try to target the traffickers.  The Minister did not refer to this issue, although she did refer to education.  We cannot deal with it using legal measures.  We must change sexist attitudes and the idea that it is okay to purchase sex, an idea that is being promoted.  I have later amendments that I can move on Report Stage on sexist attitudes in society and education in schools on these matters.  We must assist those who have clearly been trafficked.  This does not apply to all but some sex workers.</p></speech>

She is right and it is good to hear it being said, given that it is the reality.  There will be specific sections in new legislation to protect victims of trafficking when giving evidence.  The Department of Justice and Equality has provided a guide to procedures for victims of human trafficking.  There is a lot of contact with the section in my Department dealing with human trafficking and the Garda to ensure we provide the best protections for women found to be involved in prostitution but who are victims of human trafficking, which is the point the Deputy made.  There is a very proactive approach to protecting them, in the first instance, and then supporting them.  The new legislation will introduce new measures to support them when giving evidence which can be very dangerous for them.</p></speech>

It is instructive to note that the legislation refers to the Punishment of Incest Act 1908 which provided for a maximum sentence of three to seven years, yet, 109 years later, we are inserting a penalty of imprisonment for life.  There could be a situation where two people were involved in a sexual act and they were both committing different sexual and criminal offences.  The section need to be re-examined and I will support Deputy Jonathan O'Brien if it is put to a vote.</p></speech>

This gender anomaly was upheld as recently as 2012 when the Supreme Court dismissed a challenge to section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 which provided that only a female child under the age of 17 years was not guilty of an offence.  The Chief Justice noted previous case law which held that the Oireachtas was entitled, on public policy grounds, to protect under-age females from the risk of pregnancy as a female carried a greater burden from the act, emotionally, physically and psychologically, should she become pregnant.  The issue was put before the Supreme Court and this was the view in 2012.  We will re-examine both sections.</p></speech>

I am slightly worried about this matter and I ask that the T&aacute;naiste consider it.  Perhaps the line &quot;In criminal proceedings for a sexual offence&quot; should refer to &quot;an offence under the 1908 Act&quot; because I am conscious that section 30 deals mainly with that Act.

The first amendment extends the presumptive prohibition on a personal cross-examination by an accused of a witness up to the age of 14 years to all witnesses under 18 years of age, which is also in line with the provisions to be introduced by means of section 35 relating to evidence from behind a screen and the removal of wigs and gowns when a person under 18 years of age is giving evidence in court.  This provision will apply to witnesses up to the age of 18 years who are giving evidence in proceedings covered by Part lll of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992, those being, proceedings relating to a sexual offence, an offence involving violence or the threat of violence to a person, an offence under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 or a trafficking offence under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008.</p><p>Amendment No. 28 will provide a discretionary power to the court to prohibit the personal cross-examination by the accused of adult complainants unless it is in the interests of justice to do so.  This section is limited to proceedings involving sexual offences and to complainants only.  Such an amendment has been requested by those who represent victims of sexual offences and has also been called for by Members across the House.  As such, I am happy to table these amendments.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.535" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2016120700002#V00400"><p>I move amendment No. 32:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 24, line 36, to delete &ldquo;relevant record&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;counselling record&rdquo;. </blockquote>  <p>It is more straightforward than it looks.  These are amendments to section 38 of the Bill which introduces a new section 19A into the Criminal Evidence Act 1992, providing for the disclosure of third party records for the purpose of criminal proceedings involving sexual offences.  There has been a lot of demand for these issues to be dealt with in legislation and a lot of relevant points were made by those involved in counselling, psychotherapy and so on.  All the Government amendments, excluding amendment No. 34, substitute the term &quot;counselling record&quot; for &quot;relevant record&quot; in each place where it occurs in section 38.  The amendments are included on the advice of the Attorney General on the basis that the use of the term &quot;relevant record&quot; to describe what, in fact, are counselling records causes confusion in the context of relevance.  If the record is called a &quot;relevant record&quot; from the outset it is confusing for the court to be asked to determine the relevance of the record to an issue at trial for the purposes of deciding whether or not it should be disclosed.</p><p>Amendment No. 34 is a technical amendment.  A sexual offence is currently defined in section 38(1) by reference to section 3 of the Sex Offenders Act.  Section 3 includes all offences in the Schedule to the 2001 Act with a number of exceptions, some of which relate to the length of sentence imposed on the offender.  These exemptions are not appropriate to the definition of sexual offence in the context of disclosure of records and the proposed amendment defines sexual offence in terms of the Schedule to the 2001 Act only, which is the appropriate way to do it.</p><p>May I speak to Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment?</p></speech>

The issue of the probative or evidential value of the record is a matter best determined by the court at the pre-trial hearing.  The probative value of the record is a factor to be taken into account by the court in determining whether the record should be disclosed as set out in subsection (9)(b) of the section.</p></speech>

Competence to testify in law is a matter for capacity and age and I agree with those who raised concerns regarding this aspect of subsection (3), and who felt that counselling records were not relevant to either capacity or age.</p><p>Amendment No. 38 deletes subsection (4) from the proposed section 19A.  This is the list of assertions which may not be sufficient to establish that a record is relevant to an issue at trial.  The aim of the provision is to prevent spurious or without-foundation disclosure applications being made.  However, it became apparent from a number of submissions received by myself and my Department, from amendments proposed to this Bill and from discussions with interested groups that this provision was a cause of confusion.  In particular, difficulties in the operability of the subsection were identified.  I also got legal advice and that raised concerns that the wording of the subsection could cause difficulty.  Advices also found that the provision would add little to the protection of the complainant and they recommend that the subsection should be removed.  It is therefore proposed to delete subsection (4).  I acknowledge that Deputies O'Callaghan and O'Brien have also proposed the deletion of subsection (4).</p><p>Amendment No. 40 is a consequential renumbering on foot of the deletion of subsection (4).  Amendment No. 42 is to subsection (5).  That subsection requires the accused to notify the complainant, and the person in possession and control of the records, of his or her intention to make an application for the disclosure of the record.  The amendment adds the prosecutor to the persons who must be notified by the accused.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 44, 46, 50, 53, 55 and 57 are just renumbering amendments, following the changes and cross-references on foot of the deletion.</p><p>Amendment No. 58, proposed by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, would amend section 19A(9) which sets out the factors to be taken into account by a court in determining whether the record should be disclosed.  The amendment would require the court to take into consideration that not one or more of the factors asserted shall be sufficient to establish whether the contents of the record should be disclosed.  These are not factors which are asserted as being definitive.  They are rather factors for the court to take into account when determining the disclosure of the record.  They are intended to balance the competing rights of the accused, the complainant and the public interest.  They include factors relating to the expectation of privacy, including that of the complainant, and public interest concerns.  Equally, one of the factors is the probative value of the record.  The question is whether the Deputy would consider that a court which determines that a record has probative value should then not disclose the record.  These are matters for the court and whether one or more factors should cause the court to decide on the disclosure or otherwise of a particular record is for the court to determine in the context of the hearing for disclosure.  I would be interested in the Deputy's views on that.</p></speech>

I think that will be welcomed.  The amendment that is being proposed by Deputies Jim O'Callaghan and Jonathan O'Brien provides similarly.  Amendment No. 59 is consequential to amendment No. 60.  Amendment No. 62 substitutes subsection 10, now number 9, in the list of amendments.  Some of the other amendments are consequential amendments to the changes that are being made.  In particular, amendments Nos. 63, 64 and 66 are consequential amendments to the deletion of section 38(4) by amendment No. 38.  Amendment No. 75 adds to the list of conditions which a court may include in an order made for disclosure under subsection 10.  Currently subsection 12 prevents a record disclosed under the section from being used in other proceedings.  The aim of the provision is to prevent an accused from using a record disclosed to him or her in any other proceedings.  However, as currently drafted, it may have the unintended effect of preventing the complainant or a third party to whom the record relates from using the record, for example in a civil trial.  It is proposed to address the risk by deleting subsection 12 and inserting a similar restriction into the conditions which a court may impose when ordering the disclosure of the records.  This is the approach that has been taken by the Law Reform Commission in its  proposals and it would allow the court to be more particular in specifying the limits on the further use of the record in question.  I think it does address  the various concerns of those who tabled these amendments.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the point that Deputy O'Callaghan is seeking to address in amendment No. 76.  I am aware that this is a point that had been raised in a number of submissions, however, any breach of a court's order would already be subject to rules of contempt and criminal offence is not required.  On a technical point on Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment, while creating a criminal offence, it does not provide for a penalty for that offence.</p>  <p>  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien's amendment No. 77 is in the wrong place in the Bill.</p></speech>

It is provided for in circumstances where the prosecutor has in his or her possession or has knowledge of counselling records which he or she believes should be disclosed to avoid a real risk of an unfair trial.  Legal advice has recommended a mechanism to be put in place to ensure that the prosecutor may make an application for disclosure should the accused fail to do so.

An offence under section 2 of the Punishment of Incest Act 1908 (incest by females of or over seventeen).&quot;.&quot;. </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>We have had some discussion on this already.  Section 28 of the Bill will amend section 2 of the Punishment of Incest Act 1908 by substituting the assisting offence of incest by females of or over 17.  The main purpose of this section is to bring the penalty for incest by a female into line with the penalty for incest by males, which is up to life imprisonment.  The offence of incest by a female carries a maximum penalty of seven years' imprisonment.  Part 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2010 permits the Director of Public Prosecutions, in the event of an acquittal for a scheduled offence, to seek a retrial order where new and compelling evidence becomes available.  In the main, the specified offences carry a mandatory or maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  As an offence with a penalty of up to life imprisonment, the offence of incest by a male under section 1, as I noted, goes back to 1908 and is listed as the relevant offence for the purpose of part 2 of the 2010 Act.  Given the penalty for the offence of incest by a female is brought into line with that committed by a male via the Bill under consideration, this amendment will include section 2 of the 1908 Act in the list of scheduled offences in the 2010 Act.  We have already discussed it.  I will look at the details of the provisions and come back on Report Stage.  It is to include the section of 1908 Act.</p></speech>

Schedule 1 to that Act lists the offences against children regarding which it would be an offence under the Act to withhold information.  The amendments to Schedule 1 propose adding a number of the new offences created under this Bill to this.  Section 2 of the 2012 Act lists the offences against vulnerable persons regarding which it would be an offence under the Act to withhold information.  The offence under section 21 of engaging in a sexual act with a protected person and the offence under section 22 with regard to persons in authority, which I will introduce by way of amendment, are to be added to that Schedule.</p></speech>

This relates to the Schedule to the Taxi Regulation Act.  I remind members that a conviction for an offence listed in Part 1 of the Schedule gives rise to mandatory life disqualification from holding a taxi licence.  A conviction for an offence listed in Part 2 of the Schedule gives rise to mandatory disqualification for a specified period.  The effect of the amendment is that a person convicted of an offence of engaging in a sexual act with a protected person, under section 21, will be disqualified for life from holding a taxi licence and that a person convicted of certain other offences created by the Bill will be disqualified for a certain period.  It is to bring the legislation into line with the Bill.</p></speech>

An offence under section 3A of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences)Act 2006 (offence by person in authority).&rdquo;, </blockquote>(ii) in paragraph 10, by the substitution of the following for subparagraph (b): <blockquote> 	&ldquo;(b) section 4 (allowing child to be used for child pornography);<br /><br />(c) section 4A (organising etc. child prostitution or production of child pornography);<br /><br />(d) section 5A (participation of child in pornographic performance).&rdquo;,<br /><br />and </blockquote>(iii) by the insertion of the following paragraph:<br /><br />&ldquo;14. An offence under any of the following provisions of the <i>Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2016</i>: <blockquote> 	(a) <i>section 4 </i>(invitation etc. to sexual touching);<br /><br />(b) <i>section 5 </i>(sexual activity in presence of child);<br /><br />(c) <i>section 6 </i>(causing child to watch sexual activity);<br /><br />(d) <i>section 8 </i>(use of information and communication technology to facilitate sexual exploitation of child).&rdquo;.&rdquo;. </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>Again, this involves consequential changes to other Acts, consequent on the offences that have been created in the Bill.  This makes various changes to the Children First Act on foot of the other provisions of the Bill.  The Act imposes certain obligations on those working with children to protect them from harm, which includes sexual abuse.  The intention of the amendments is to bring some of the child-related offences created by the Bill within the definition of sexual abuse and that is done by adding references to Schedule 3 of that Act.  The first part of the amendment deletes paragraphs (b) and (c) from the definition of sexual abuse.  The definition of sexual abuse of a child currently has three components, namely, an offence against the child, specified in Schedule 3; exposure of the child to pornography and; sexual activity in the presence of a child.  Since the conduct targeted in paragraphs (b) and (c) is the subject of new offences in sections 5 and 6 of the Bill, there is no longer a need for the paragraphs.</p></speech>

An offence referred to in&mdash; <blockquote> 	(a) paragraph 8 of Part 2 (defilement of child under the age of 17 years), or<br /><br />(b) paragraph 23, 24 or 25 of Part 2 in so far as it relates to an offence referred to in subparagraph (a), </blockquote>committed prior to the commencement of <i>section 17 </i>of the <i>Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2016 </i>shall not be a sexual offence for the purposes of Part 2 of this Act if the person who is convicted of the offence was at the date of the commission of the offence, not more than 24 months older than the child with whom he or she engaged or attempted to engage in a sexual act within the meaning of section 1 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006.&rdquo;. </blockquote>(b) in Part 2&mdash; <blockquote> 	(i) in paragraph 17&mdash; <blockquote> 	(I) by the insertion of the following subparagraph after subparagraph (b): <blockquote> 	&ldquo;(ba) section 4A (organising etc. child prostitution or production of child pornography);&rdquo;, </blockquote>(II) by the insertion of the following subparagraph after subparagraph (c): <blockquote> 	&ldquo;(ca) section 5A (participation of child in pornographic performance);&rdquo;, </blockquote> </blockquote>and <blockquote> 	(ii) by the insertion of the following paragraph after paragraph 22:<br /><br />&ldquo;22A. An offence under any of the following provisions of the <i>Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2016</i>: <blockquote> 	(a) <i>section 3 </i>(obtaining, providing etc. a child for purpose of sexual exploitation),<br /><br />(b) <i>section 4 </i>(invitation etc. to sexual touching),<br /><br />(c) <i>section 5 </i>(sexual activity in presence of child),<br /><br />(d) <i>section 6 </i>(causing child to watch sexual activity),<br /><br />(e) <i>section 7 </i>(meeting child for purpose of sexual exploitation),<br /><br />(f) <i>section 8 </i>(use of information and communication technology to facilitate sexual exploitation of child),<br /><br />(g) <i>section 21 </i>(sexual act with protected person),<br /><br />(h) <i>section 22 </i>(offence against relevant person by person in authority).&rdquo;.&rdquo;. </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>Again, the amendment is consequential.  It makes changes to the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act 2016.  The Act limits the effect of certain criminal convictions by allowing them to be effectively spent after a specified period.  Some sexual offences listed in Part 2 of Schedule 1 are excluded from that Act, so that a conviction for one of those sexual offences will not be considered as spent for the purposes of that Act.  Paragraph (b) of the amendment will add some of the offences being created by the Bill to Part 2 of Schedule 1 of that Act and Part 1 of that Act effectively lists the circumstances under which certain sexual offences may not constitute a sexual offence for the purposes of the Act.</p><p>Currently, that applies where there is a difference of less than two years between the victim and the perpetrator in respect of the offence of engaging in a sexual act with a child under 17.  Section 17 amends that offence to add the defence of proximity of age.  A defendant will be able to rely on that defence where he or she is less than two years older than the child, is not a person in authority and there is no aspect of exploitation or intimidation.  For that reason it is considered appropriate that the offence under section 3 should not avail of an additional proximity of age exemption for the purpose of a spent conviction, but the exemption is to be retained for the purpose of an offence committed before the Bill is enacted.  That is the purpose of paragraph (a).</p></speech>

All the work and attention that was paid was markedly impressive.  Each member has made an important contribution that does not end here on Committee Stage.  The Minister has taken on board the debate and, hopefully, it will be reflected in her approach on Report Stage.</p>  <p>  I do not know all our guests in the Visitors Gallery.  They are all very welcome, including those who have been here before.  I commend all those who have been proactive in addressing the legislation going back over time.  While I do not want to single out any one group, given that a number of groups have participated, I am mindful of some engagements I have had with people and I thank them for their work.</p></speech>

I am very pleased we have been able to work through so many of the issues.  Much has been accepted without any contrary views and I will return with further amendments on Report Stage regarding a number of issues.  I note the view a number of people have taken regarding the language we have used.  We have spent months working on it and there is quite a bit of disagreement among disability groups on how to approach this.  It is very difficult to draft and a huge amount of legal advice has been sought and it is being done with very careful consideration.  I am sure Deputies appreciate this.</p></speech>

This is a large project for the committee, which ultimately will see us engaging with 49 witness groups from across the State.  We greatly appreciate the input of all delegates who come before the committee.  Our witnesses today are Mr. Justin Moran, head of advocacy and communications at Age Action Ireland; Ms Patricia Bourke, head of training and professional standards, and Ms Linda Thorpe, both representing Mental Health Ireland; and Mr. John-Mark McCafferty, head of social justice, and Mr. Kieran Stafford, both from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise the witnesses that their opening statements and any documents they have submitted to the committee will be published on our website after the meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>We have deliberated on all the different elements that are required for sustaining rural communities.  We are now considering stream 5, which is concerned with caring for the elderly and disadvantaged in rural areas.  I invite Mr. Moran to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

According to the 2011 census, almost 230,000 people over the age of 65 are living in what the Central Statistics Office classifies as rural areas and small towns.  Age Action Ireland members and older people in rural areas who use our services tell us about the impact of cuts to public services in their communities.  Many of the issues they highlight fall under five themes, namely, transport, communications, health care, income and security.  I will focus on these five areas in turn in my presentation.</p> <p>  Rural public transport is vital for older people to access work, education, leisure, medical and social services.  In many places, there is no direct transport to hospitals serving rural areas, leaving older people to pay for taxis to attend appointments.  For people living in Baltinglass, County Wicklow, for example, there is no direct link with the local hospital in Naas and the cost of a taxi is &euro;30 each way.  Where rural transport is available, the service is based on the needs of those commuting to work, which leaves older people with long waits for a return bus.  In some cases, the service operates only once or twice a week.  The purpose of the rural transport programme is to provide a quality community-based public transport system in rural areas.  We are not convinced the funding and commitment are there to meet that objective.  Recent reports that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann routes are under threat and there are doubts about the sustainability of the Bus &Eacute;ireann expressway service have compounded those concerns.  As more than one older person has observed to us, the travel pass is not worth much if there are no buses or trains on which to use it.  I urge the committee to examine progress in delivering actions set out in the national positive aging strategy more than three years ago to provide elderly-friendly rural transport and better public transport links to health facilities.</p> <p>  The lack of public transport means many older people in rural areas rely on their cars and face rapidly rising motor insurance costs.  We ask members to consider the recommendation by their colleagues in the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, following their hearings on the motor insurance industry, that the Minister conduct an analysis of the impact of substantial insurance premia increases on rural communities.</p><p>The second issue is communications.  More than 200 post offices have been closed by An Post since 2007, with serious consequences for many rural communities.  In the west Galway village of Cleggan, for instance, the local post office closed in September 2015, leaving Cleggan's 260 residents having to travel 3 km to Claddaghduff for postal services.  As a local resident explained, pensioners and people with disabilities are struggling to collect their benefits.  The closure of post offices, in tandem with determined efforts by the banking sector to close or restrict branches while pushing customers online, has eroded older people's control over their finances.  In turn, this has made them more reliant on family members to conduct their business, making them vulnerable to financial abuse, which is the second most commonly reported form of elder abuse.  We support the call by the Irish Postmasters Union to this committee for a five-year plan to develop the post office network and the services it provides.<br/><br/>Digital literacy is now a necessity for accessing information, managing one's finances and maintaining contact with family and friends.  On an annual basis, Age Action Ireland provides one-to-one computer training to some 3,500 older people across the country.  Accessing digital information is a particular challenge for older people as half of those aged 60 to 74 - more than 260,000 people - have never used the Internet.  Among those aged 75 and over, the figure is negligible at only 3%.  For those living in rural communities the challenge is greater again as a lack of comprehensive quality broadband creates further barriers to getting online.  We have had people do our training courses who are unable to use their home computers because they do not have access to quality broadband.  Older people in rural areas can experience isolation and loneliness, particularly as younger generations move away.  A quality rural broadband service would enable them to remain connected. <br/><br/>The third area of concern is health care.  Access to health care is of critical importance to older people, who are more likely to suffer from chronic illnesses and are the most frequent users of GP services.  The <i>Irish Independent</i>reported earlier this year that almost 5,000 people in rural areas do not have access to a permanent GP.  A 2015 report by the Irish College of General Practitioners noted:</p><blockquote>A rural-urban divide which mirrors the existing private-public divide is emerging.  Seven per cent of rural patients live within walking distance of their GP compared to 89 per cent of urban dwellers.</blockquote><p>This touches on some of the rural transport issues to which I referred.  Older people in rural areas find it particularly challenging to access home care supports because home help staff are not paid for transit time between calls.  This can make it difficult to obtain home help services, especially where the practitioner must travel a long way to provide a half an hour of care to different clients.<br/><br/>The fourth challenge that arises relates to income.  Older people in rural areas have smaller incomes and greater expenses compared with their urban counterparts.  In its 2013 Survey on Income and Living Conditions, the CSO found that older people in rural areas consistently had a higher at risk of poverty rate than those living in urban areas, by as much as ten percentage points.  Research undertaken by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice shows that older people living in rural areas also face higher costs, with much of the difference in expenditure relating to the need to run a car because of the lack of an adequate public transport network.  The CSO confirms that older people living in rural areas have much lower incomes than those living in urban areas, as well as higher costs.  In addition, they are more dependent on social transfers and less likely to have occupational pensions.<br/><br/>Finally, security issues continue to be one of the top issues of concern for older people who contact our information service.  Committee members will be aware of the recent report in the <i>Irish Daily Mail</i>on the CSO figures which show that assaults on victims over the age of 65 have more than doubled since 2006.  The closure of 100 Garda stations in 2013, the majority of which were in rural areas, has added to feelings of isolation among older people, many of whom took reassurance from the physical presence of a local station.  While the likelihood of someone being a victim of crime is often overstated, the fear of crime is a real and damaging phenomenon to the mental health of many older people.  <br/><br/>I thank committee members for their time.</p></speech>

Mental Health Ireland is a national voluntary organisation, established in 1966 as the Mental Health Association of Ireland.  Mental Health Ireland promotes positive mental health and well-being to individuals and communities through our network of 92 affiliated mental health associations and a team of area development officers who work on a regional basis throughout the country.  We deliver awareness-raising initiatives and targeted education services such as the Mind your Mental Health programme.  We are committed to providing peer support and recovery initiatives.  &Aacute;ras Foll&aacute;in peer support centre in Nenagh and Get Together Inishowen are just two examples of grassroots recovery initiatives that are very much in line with A Vision for Change.  Mental Health Ireland is engaged in many cross-sectoral partnerships, which is in keeping with our emphasis on a flexibility of approach rather than a one size fits all model.  We work with the National Concert Hall, for example, on the Music in Mind programme.  Another example is the Woodlands for Health project, on which we work in partnership with Coillte, the Health Service Executive and Wicklow mental health services.</p> <p>  To echo what Mr. Moran said, Ireland is changing rapidly, with huge advances in technology, medicine and communications in recent years.  People are struggling to keep up with the speed of modern living and the increasing complexity of family situations.  Ethnic minority groups face particular challenges.  As we all are aware, the country is facing a housing and homelessness crisis.  All of these issues have an impact on people's health.  On a global level, country boundaries are becoming virtual and communication via social media is instant.  People are expected to be able to multi-task as the norm.  The health of individuals, communities and society as a whole is determined by the overall determinants of health, which include physical, social, emotional, mental, sexual and spiritual health, in addition to such factors as childhood experience, financial stability, a sense of security, suitability and security of tenure, and levels of social inclusion and belonging.</p> <p>  With regard to older age, people's experience of aging tends to be health-dependent.  While advances in medicine have resulted in life expectancy in Ireland rising by 19.45 years to 84.5 years, advancing age brings, for many, an increased likelihood of diminished health, loss of independence or fear of same and limited mobility.  Many older people suffer from bereavement, social isolation and exclusion, and a loss of purpose and usefulness.  The World Health Organization noted in 2013 that older people are at significant risk of depression.  In addition, many older people are struggling with changed roles.  Due to family constraints, large numbers find themselves assuming child care responsibilities in later life.  While it is wonderful that life expectancy has increased, we as a society have a responsibility to safeguard the dignity of older people and ensure they have a good quality of life and a sense of purpose, meaning, usefulness and belonging.  We need to examine the value we place on our aging population and their life experience.  For too many retired people, life is a case of killing time.  We must develop intergenerational initiatives that foster learning, understanding and a greater integration between youth and older age.  We need to provide ongoing support to enable people to live well and with confidence, security and dignity in their own homes.  That is very much in keeping with goals 2 and 3 of the Department of Health's 2013 national positive aging strategy.</p> <p>  We work with a number of disadvantaged groups around the country, including those representing new communities, Travellers, people in direct provision, minority groups, people on lower incomes, carers, the homeless, people with disabilities, the unemployed and people suffering due to addiction and mental illness problems.  It is important to emphasise the importance of having a sense of hope, purpose, meaning and belonging, particularly for vulnerable people.  In the case of direct provision, people are spending years in the system, unsure of their status and future and without permission no work or engage in pursuits that offer meaningful use of their time.  These are profound factors that impact on people's health, including their mental health.  There is an absence of even simple things such as a means to cook meals for the family.  Together with the loss of cultural connections and the depletion of social and family roles, the impact on people in direct provision cannot be underestimated.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the vast range of services and networks in operation to assist vulnerable people, many of which we work with through various community initiatives.  No single agency has all the answers but there is a need for greater joined-up thinking and consistency in regard to the types of services available nationally.  The level of service should not be location-dependent.  We need a whole-of-population approach to health and recovery and a designated funding stream to support the development and resourcing of peer initiatives in line with a Vision for Change.</p><p>We need greater understanding of the interconnectedness of the range of health determinants and  their implications for service provision.  We need to look at a clear pathways approach from prevention and early intervention through to specialist services, that is people getting into services and also coming back out of them.  People tend to get stuck in services that are not necessarily suited for their needs.  We need a flexible and creating approach that recognises that one size does not fit all.  There is also a need to ensure that the amount of time that people, both individuals and families, spend in homelessness and direct provision is kept to an absolute minimum.  </p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for their attention and time.</p></speech>

As all members know, the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul exists to fight poverty and all forms of social exclusion.  Established in 1844, we are the largest voluntary, charitable organisation in Ireland with over 11,000 volunteer members operating on an all-Ireland basis, working in both urban and rural areas, and assisting both younger and older people and helping families and individuals alike.</p> <p>  On the ground, our focus is on a practical approach to dealing with poverty, alleviating its effects on households through working primarily in person-to-person contact by a unique system of visitation to peoples&rsquo; homes.  It is through this privileged position of visiting people, hearing their stories and helping where appropriate that our members earn the credibility that the society enjoys.  It is this unique position that enables us to work for social justice in a respected and effective manner, advocating for the creation of a more just, caring nation.  In addition to providing direct assistance to those in need, we provide a wide range of services caring for people who are homeless, providing social housing, and operating other social support activities.  Alongside our home visitation work, the society seeks to empower people to access education, training, adequate incomes and quality, affordable public services.</p> <p>  I will now hand over to my colleague, Mr. John-Mark McCafferty. </p></speech>

We acknowledge that there is some overlap between these two groups, but note that many older people do not necessarily experience disadvantage, and that many people experiencing disadvantage are not older people.  For both older people and lower income households generally in rural areas, transport to health or hospital appointments is important and therefore the cost and availability of rural transport services are key in our experience, as is the need for more energy efficient housing.  Higher living costs associated with rural life, as evidenced by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, such as car transport is a big cost concern for many households in rural areas is also a shared concern.  Mr. Justin Moran also mentioned other items, which include the cost of food and clothing relative to the cost of these in urban areas, energy, household goods and social inclusion aspects.  A meticulous study has been done by our Vincentian colleagues in the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, which we draw from on a regular basis.</p> <p>  Some of the other themes emerging in our work with older people in rural areas are as follows: &lsquo;Seniors Alert&rsquo; pendant alarm systems, formerly &lsquo;community supports for older people&rsquo; works well.  We administer many of those schemes in local communities.  Being able to grow older at home through the receipt of adequate services and supports, for example, meals on wheels, home help and the provision of more independent advocates for older people is welcome.  We are very aware of the experience of lone parents, especially in cases where they have additional caring responsibilities, and the higher incidence of poverty among lone parents and children.  There is also the impact of increased rents on rural housing markets adjacent to large towns and cities.  Our members are concerned about access to education, training and employment, including adequate third level grant rates.  Our members are concerned that more students appear to be falling into the lower adjacent grant rate as the distance criteria change.</p> <p>  Some of the policy solutions to the above issues relate to investment in quality, comprehensive public services which are free or affordable at the point of delivery.  These require significant and sustained Exchequer resources, which require robust and dependable revenue streams.  In our 2017 pre-budget submission, we have called for enhanced delivery of social housing, the provision of early childhood care and education and sustained and increased energy retrofitting of homes.  Adequate incomes, both in work and out of work, are also vital for low income groups.  Lastly, better physical planning and more integrated communities and services are required to achieve sustainable and resilient rural communities. </p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and members for inviting the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to offer its on-the-ground experience.</p></speech>

It is very important to know the age group we are talking about because sometimes there is an impression that all people over 60 years and older are <i>cr&oacute;ili,</i>non-active or whatever.  That is not my experience of rural Ireland. </p><p>Coming from an urban background and with all my family living in urban areas, I moved to a rural area.  I have the choice now but I would rather get old in a rural rather than an urban area.  It is very important that we do not fall into the trap of painting some of the problems that apply across older people as being uniquely rural problems.  I would find better social integration because people tend to remain in the area where they always lived so that one's neighbours tend to be the same neighbours as one had 20 or 30 years ago.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses comment on that.  My experience is that in certain circumstances there is even more loneliness in urban areas.  I am always concerned when questions on loneliness are put to older people living in urban or rural areas.  By definition a person who has lost a partner, be they a widows or widowers is lonely.  No matter how good their life is they are lonely because the most important person in their life has gone or family members are living abroad.  I believe that rural areas are a good place to live but one faces many challenges that could be dealt with.  To what extent is the migration of younger people, particularly those in the 20 to 50 age group out of rural areas because of lack of job opportunity creating unnecessary isolation?  Is that taking the normal social supports of inter-generational groups?  Sport is one of the great recreations in rural areas.  I heard this morning that places such as Achill Island find it hard to put a football team together.  That is not just for the players, that would have been the great social outlet for people, where they meet, greet and have fun together.</p><p>I know what the witnesses mean when they talk about grandparents.  I keep coming across the challenge that if one does not have a critical mass of people, it is not economic to keep child care facilities open.  Should there be a base level of support for paid child care for every community?  There can be fluctuations in population numbers and given this, should there be, as had been previously, a minimum amount of money given to professional community child care providers so that they can keep the doors open?</p><p>If the doors of the community child care close, the people have lost out completely.</p><p> It seems there is a common theme to all the presentations, be it access to third level grants and so on, it revolves around transport.  The provision of transport can be a frequent service in and out of the nearest town or city.  The model of service we have in the country is a single bus in the morning and a single return bus in the evening - a service that is seen as good enough.  The new railway service to Newbridge provides seven trains in the morning and seven return trains in the evening that go under the Phoenix Park even though another ten or 15 trains go into Heuston station.  That is the correct way to provide a service.  Would it bring about a significance difference to have frequent services into the county towns and so on?   Will the witnesses comment on the subsidy per head of population to Dublin Bus and although the subsidy applies in an area of concentrated population, the subsidy from the Exchequer per head of people living in Dublin is five times the subsidy per head of population to Bus &Eacute;ireann.  That is bizarre.</p><p> My final question in this round relates to the policy of pushing the family formation segment of society into towns and whether this is creating unnecessary social isolation in rural areas because the traditional pattern there was to live beside ones parents and grandparents and that provided mutual social support and gave the older people access to cars.  People experience difficulties in being granted planning permission for a house near their parents, particularly if they do not live on a farm, which applies more and more as people no longer live on the farm.  They must acquire a site with planning permission.  Has the policy of local authorities not building one-off rural houses caused difficulties?  It has been a double whammy, causing the gentrification of the countryside by pushing people who need social housing into towns and rural isolation by taking away the family supports that were given by inter-generational connection and which the present State policy seems to be destroying.  The State is saying that those from rural areas must go into town if they need a local authority house, and cannot stay in their own area.  That town could be 25 km away or more from their family home whereas in the old days, the local authority got a site for &euro;100 and built a house which they rented to the family.  A socially integrated society creates a support mechanism where the older people are helping the younger people and as they age, the younger people help them.  I think that is the natural way of society, but we seem to be hell bent on destroying that lifestyle.  How much is that affecting the demand for the services?</p><p> In line with what the Society of St. Vincent de Paul states, issues arising from poverty facing families are acute, particularly as most rural people live in houses they own and there are no grants for those under the age of 60 to 65 and in some local authority areas up to 70 years, for repairing houses, which is often the biggest cost people face in bringing houses up to standard.</p></speech>

The studies seem to show that the fabric of rural Ireland is changing radically.  The representatives from Teagasc a number of weeks ago indicated that most young couples want to live in a space where they can achieve dual incomes, because they need that level of income to pay their costs.  Therefore they are lining up around major urban areas and that takes the young middle generation out of the equation in rural areas and it means that children are being born into limited spaces around Meath, Dublin, Wicklow and Louth.  That is a radical change.  Higher costs and lower incomes were raised.  Are there statistics on the differences in costs of a person living in a rural area and the income of that person, so that one could see what the gap is and that we could work it out.  It is not solely financial costs, but there are health costs of living in rural areas as well.  Would there be statistics in regard to the incidence of mental health issues in rural as opposed to urban areas?  Would there be statistics on longevity or life expectancy of a person living in a rural area as opposed to an urban area?</p> <p>  Broadband is an important issue because it leads to the ability to make an income and connectivity.  One of the issues that has come into focus is human connectivity is really important.  In a way we are losing that human connectivity with the onset of the digital age to a certain extent.  All the witnesses have indicated the State interactions that lead to positive human connectivity, for example the post office and so on.  There is a world of other activities, that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned, including the GAA football clubs, but I can think also of bingo, church and so on.  Has work been done on how the State can support the other human connectivity nodes that exist in society that ameliorate against mental health issues and help against isolation and loneliness as well?</p> <p>  There is a critical issue in respect of the home help service.  The staff available to provide home help who live within a short driving distance from homes in rural areas is far lower, so the option are lower and the services they provide are far lower.  Are the primary health care teams who provide services for rural areas at full complement?  Are they operating at 50% capacity, as I know that is of particular concern with regard to mental health issues because it is the State's objective to provide these services to individuals in their own communities in their own homes?  Are we meeting those objectives with respect to the primary care teams?</p> <p>  I now call Deputy Collins.</p></speech>

I come from a rural peninsula, Cork south west, with one of the highest populations of elderly coupled with County Donegal.  The vast peninsula stretches to Mizen Head.</p> <p>  We tend to think of elderly as people from age 66 onwards, but there is a large number in the 55 to 66 age bracket, who are falling between two stools and nobody is there for them.  They may not be in gainful employment and they might be in a situation where they do not have a welfare payment or find it difficult to quality for a welfare payment and this category face mental health stresses and need a great deal of assistance.  This assistance is not there, and I see from my experience in the constituency they are finding it very difficult to survive, pay the electricity bill, put food on the table and do the very basics.  We are living in an uncaring society.  The human being is like the animal now, tagged with a number, and is no longer the individual, Michael, Linda or Patricia.</p><p>We are now just a number and are treated as such.  People on welfare are being harassed under the JobPath scheme.  They are being frightened out of their homes and forced to travel into towns and villages to meet with officials who promise to secure them employment.  They may not have public transport to get to these places and are spending most of the day on the road.  They are being dealt with via a company brought in from the UK for that purpose and which has to tick the right boxes to ensure it receives payment for its services.  The reality, of course, is there are very few jobs in rural areas.  Some of these people were very happy to participate in community employment and T&uacute;s schemes, for which they received an additional &euro;20 on top of their welfare payment.  Such engagement was good for their mental health but they are now being sent home and frightened out of their wits.  It is a vicious circle.</p><p> The closure of Garda stations has affected communities throughout the country, including in west Cork.  Together with the closure of banks and post offices, there has been a particularly negative impact for elderly people.  However, the greatest crisis for older people throughout the country is the poor state of the health service.  Indeed, there is no point in saying it is in a bad state; the reality is it has collapsed.  Some 900 people are seeking home help provision in County Cork.  We have a major crisis on our hands in this regard but the Government does not seem to realise it.  The best and cheapest place to look after people is in their own homes.  I am getting the run-around in the D&aacute;il when I ask about this and told there is plenty of money available for the home help service and no problem with it all.  In fact, the service is in crisis, with 900 people in my county alone unable to access a home help service.  All Members are aware of elderly people in their constituencies who are incapacitated but cannot get home help.  It is a scandalous situation.  The Government is not equipping itself for the future and the rising age profile of our population.  People are effectively being thrown to the wolves while Ministers continue to call our bluff in the D&aacute;il, telling us everything is perfect.  The best way to deliver a home help service is by hiring local people, but the HSE has seen fit to establish companies which bring in anyone and everyone.  Elderly people who require two or three visits a day find there are different people coming to their home, some of whom they have never met before.  It is outrageous.  The home help service previously offered an employment boost for local people and ensured elderly persons were cared for by staff they were comfortable to have in their home.  Why was the decision made to break a system that was working well?</p><p> Many young people in rural communities are struggling to secure employment, which can lead to mental health difficulties.  There seems to be no intention of securing a future for islanders.  There is no strategy for housing on the islands and people are being forced out of their homes.  There is a nasty element to what is going on.  The rural social scheme promised to provide 500 extra jobs but now the talk is that nobody aged under 25 will qualify.</p><p> There are serious concerns about the seniors alert scheme.  I understand an ongoing review of the scheme is being carried out by a UK organisation whose chairman is linked to a company which produces alarm devices.  I do not know where the Government came up with this lovely scenario where the person carrying out the review already has his fingers in the pie.  It looks like we will go down the road of the UK model, which will see elderly people having to pay &euro;160 or &euro;170 a year where it was previously costing them &euro;70 to &euro;80.  We can expect to see a lot of alarms being chucked out of houses.  On the plus side, in fairness to the HSE, it is funding local community and voluntary organisation to provide meals on wheels and social centres, which are a lifeline for elderly people affected by rural isolation.  They can now go out two nights a week for a meal at the local social centre and have meals brought to their home for the remainder of the week.  The HSE should be encouraged to push that initiative out because it gives people a social outlet.  It might only entail two minutes of interaction with another person but it is vital to them.</p></speech>

It is useful to put it on the radar of organisations, reflecting the fact, in the particular context of today's discussion, that we have the first aging LGBTQI population post-criminalisation.  In the past, criminalisation ensured such people were excluded and faced stigma and isolation within the home, in society, in the workplace and in the community.  The LGBTQI community has a role in starting a conversation around the issues facing older LGBTQI citizens.  Many of their concerns are magnified when compared with those of straight people.  A survey undertaken by the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, entitled Visible Lives, found that only 54% of aging LGBTQI citizens - defined as those between 36 and 55 years of age - felt part of their local community.  Some 46% of older LGBTQI people live alone, the survey showed, 43% are single and 53% are concerned about getting older and feeling lonelier as they age.  It is important that LGBTQI NGOs show leadership on this, but the issues that arise specifically for LGBTQI people are also relevant to the delegates' interests.  The GLEN study reported that 42% of respondents had received a poor quality of service from civic and community services because of their LGBTQI identity.  I am interested in hearing the delegates' experiences, if any, in this regard.  The most frequently reported places with a poor quality of service were places of worship, hotels and bed breakfasts, restaurants and shops.</p> <p>  Housing will increasingly become an issue of major concern for older people.  Older members of our communities should, as a broad societal objective, be supported to live at home.  There probably will be a demand in future for LGBTQI-specific accommodation in both rural and urban areas.  There may be scope to explore the provision of LGBTQI retirement homes or the emphasis might be on ensuring all older age facilities are sensitive to and respectful of LGBTQI needs.  For an LGBTQI citizen entering a general older age home there could be difficulties if the environment is not respectful of that person's identity.  I am interested in the delegates' views on meeting the housing needs of LGBTQI people specifically and of minority groups in general.</p></speech>

I take this opportunity to thank the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which does tremendous work in Killarney.  As recently as yesterday, when the local community welfare officer refused to give any financial assistance to a family that was allocated a local authority house and needed to buy blankets to put on the beds, the only place to which this family could turn was the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.</p><p>I am glad the organisation is operating in our neck of the woods because the situation people are facing is very serious.  Does the society require additional funding and, if so, would a fund-raising campaign be useful?  It grieves me when I see other supposedly charitable organisations able to avail of television advertisements and so on but nobody seems to know what is going on or what they are doing with the money.  We never hear of rows about chairmen and such like at the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  We can see what it is doing with its funding, which is assisting the people who need that help.  We should seek to provide funding for the organisation where we can.</p><p> I agree with the points made by colleagues regarding the home help service.  I spoke to man in my constituency who sought a second home help for a quarter of an hour each day for his 95 year old uncle.  This elderly man was getting 15 minutes in the morning to help him out of bed and was looking for an extra quarter of an hour in the evening to assist him in getting back into the bed.  The nephew, a busy farmer, was told there was no way in the world his uncle would get another farthing for home help.  Instead, he was offered accommodation in a nursing home, where he could be left in bed all the time, under the fair deal scheme.  I understand that particular scheme is funded by what is called a statutory payment.  In the case of my 95 year old constituent, I see no reason that some of the money which would be used to keep him in a nursing home could not instead be used to provide him with more help at home, where he wants to stay.  That is what most elderly people want.  When they are asked how they like their nursing home, they will say it is fine but they would prefer to be at home.  There seems to be a substantial funding allocation under the fair deal scheme.  Do the delegates agree it would make sense for some of it be transferred to the home help service?  I have raised this issue in the D&aacute;il several times but we need assistance from wherever we can get it to ensure proper funding is provided for the home help service.  It is a major concern for people in rural Kerry.</p><p> The cost of transport is an issue for many elderly people.  We have good community bus links but they do not cater for people who, for example, need to go at different times for doctor and hospital appointments.  Do the delegates have any proposals in that regard?  One of the Ministers in the last Government had a ridiculous idea about providing cheaper taxis, but that will not work.  There should be some provision whereby dedicated transport payments can be given in special cases.  People do not have money from their pensions to cover the cost of private transport and many of them cannot walk three or four miles.</p><p> Mental health is a major issue and I acknowledge the work the delegates are doing in this area.  Are they aware that we have a wonderful new facility in Killarney to cater for 40 patients, which, 18 months after it was completed, remains unopened?  What is the Government thinking of when it does something like that?  There was a rush to complete the Killarney facility but apparently no rush at all to have it up and running.  Are the delegates aware of the strategies being employed by the HSE and how adverse they are proving for long-enduring patients?</p></speech>

Twenty-seven people availed of the HSE's Lantern Lodge facility where they got a meal and could use the washing facilities.  Under the new model, they are assigned to Leawood House on the Countess Road, where they will not get a meal, will not have access to showers, but will, we are told, be able to access more therapeutic services.  The new facility is open two weeks and already the numbers accessing the service have reduced.  My concern is that people will soon stop going there at all.  Apparently the HSE policy is that starving people and denying them showering facilities will help their mental health.  That ridiculous policy must be challenged.</p> <p>  The de-congregation model is equally ridiculous.  I ask the delegates to press the point that this model does not fit all.  In Killarney, the HSE tried to shut down the St. Mary of the Angels facility, which houses 77 people who are not sufficiently mentally well to look after themselves.  As we all know, this world is not ideal and not everyone is born perfect.  The HSE, or whoever the wizards are who design these models, must be challenged.  The right help is not being given to the people who need it.</p></speech>

Why are people being directed into towns and villages and away from the rural areas where they were reared?  If an elderly person's house falls into disrepair, a rural cottage will not be built for him or her.  Only three were built in Kerry in the past eight years.  Where a fellow wants to stay with his few cattle where he was born and reared, it seems to be the policy not to allow that.  Not even a demountable home will be provided.</p></speech>

Members might highlight any I miss.  On Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's initial question, Age Action Ireland has always taken the term "older person" as referring to people aged 55 and over, partly to deal with the issue Deputy Collins mentioned, namely, that some people at the age of 55 need supports, including employment supports, which often are not there.  The more usual definition of an older person is anybody aged over 66, which is  currently the age of eligibility for the State pension.  However, I have found in my time in Age Action Ireland that what constitutes old age is very fluid.  We have members in their late 80s, for instance, who would be offended to be described as older people.  On the other hand, we have people in their 50s with health problems for whom the description is apt.  There is a legal definition of childhood but the same does not apply for old age.  It is very much an individual experience.</p> <p>  The Deputy made the point that it is important not to see people living in rural areas and urban areas as different races or species.  I agree that both, as older people, face the same issues.</p><p>We would argue that the lack of supports and some of the policy decisions make it tougher in rural areas.  Loneliness, for example, is an issue for older people, whether one lives where I am living at present, in Drumcondra, or where my family is from, in Caltra, but it is a bigger issue in some communities where one does not have the kind of social cohesion referred to in a rural community, where one does not have access to rural transport or to health care which are particular issues that affect rural parts of Ireland.</p><p> I would agree that the issue of the migration of younger people and families to larger towns, either in search of housing or employment, is a serious issue because what one sees then is a cascade effect.  As people move away from the villages, the demand for the post office drops, the demand for the bank branch drops and the demand for the bus drops, and slowly over a period of time one reaches a stage where An Post says that the post office is unsustainable or there are not enough people-----</p></speech>

If one has an inter-generational group around, then the natural outcome is for parents to be in contact with children so that one has this vertical support between generations, not only for services but generally.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.778" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016120700002#K00300"><p>I would agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  The point I was making, and perhaps not articulating particularly effectively, was that because the younger people in families are being forced into the towns for employment and housing, the supports on an inter-generational basis to which the Deputy refers are eroding a little.  One of Age Action's most successful programmes is our care and repair programme where volunteers go into the homes of older people and carry out small DIY jobs, such as installing a light bulb or unblocking a sink.  These are jobs that ten or 15 years ago those people would have got their sons, daughters or brothers to come in and do, but they are not there anymore as they have emigrated or are living 15, 20 or 30 miles down the road.  That is an example of where we have tried to step in to fill a gap that has been created because of that lack of inter-generational solidarity that would have been there in the past.</p> <p>  In terms of the public transport and rural transport issue, I stated it was a pervasive comment during all of the presentations.  Mention was made of the Newbridge Bus &Eacute;ireann route.  That is a good example of one of the bus routes that can be a challenge for people.  It departs at 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., as was mentioned.  We have learned from speaking to older people who might have to go to a hospital appointment - some of our members in Galway did research on the outpatient service there - that they might be able to get the morning bus in, they get taken care of and then they wait around for hours because the bus service is designed for those commuting to work for which it is effective.  That is why it would be helpful if the committee, as part of the finished outcome of its deliberations, looked at whether the rural transport programme is fit for purpose and whether it is delivering the commitments in the National Positive Ageing Strategy around rural transport already mentioned.</p> <p>  I will take a couple of points from Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  I would highly recommend the research Mr. McCafferty also mentioned by the Vincentian's on the minimal essential standard of living when we are talking about cost issues.  For example, the table provided in our submission shows the income and expenses for those in urban and rural communities as defined by the CSO and how that matches with the minimum essential standard.  One of the big drivers of cost - I accept I sound like a broken record going back to talk about transport - is car costs.  In parts of Ireland, that can make up to 82% of the difference between expenditures for an older person living in an urban community and one living in a rural community because he or she needs the car to get to work, to get to his or her family, and to get to his or her medical appointments.</p> <p>  My colleagues in Mental Health Ireland are better able to answer on the primary health teams, but in our experience, they would not be at full complement.  Certainly, there are difficulties in recruiting home helps that are particularly important.</p> <p>  Regarding community infrastructure, Geo, bingo, community nodes, one of the suggestions that we have had for a while is some way of carrying out a survey in communities of the infrastructure being under-utilised.  One of the classic examples we use is where one may have buses that are used in the school bus run and once the school bus run is over, they are put away for several hours.  They are not used, say, at lunchtime, to bring people from one village to the next or to bring people in to the shops.  I wonder whether there is something that could be done, maybe not even at a national level but at a local authority level, to identify where there is capacity in existing community infrastructure that could be better redeployed to help, not only older people but those who might have disabilities or special needs or other forms of disadvantage.</p> <p>  I will briefly address Senator Warfield's point on older people and LGBT.  It is something that we would have done some work on with older people in nursing homes, in particular, who have challenges there.  It is something we would like to do more on.  There are examples in Europe of different sheltered housing options where different groups and cultures, not necessarily LGBT, can be accommodated.  That is something that is worth looking at.  In Ireland we have an approach where one stays at home and then one moves into a nursing home, and it is a fairly black-and-white process.  We need to be able to look at other options that are more accommodating to people and to different interests.</p> <p>  I will finish on home help services on which I could talk for most of the rest of the day.  I agree completely with Deputy Michael Collins that the home help services in this country have collapsed and any suggestion to the contrary is simply not true.  We are providing less funding for home help services today than we were in 2011.  We are providing home help services to fewer people and the people who are getting it are getting shorter hours.  We have many problems where home helps are in there for 15 minutes to get somebody up in the morning but one cannot build a relationship with one's client over 15 minutes and one certainly cannot do it if there is somebody different the next day and somebody different again on the Friday.</p> <p>  We carried out a piece of research, published in June of this year.  We spoke to social workers who are telling us that if the proper home help supports were there, they estimated that as many as 50% of their clients who were in or about to go in to a fair deal nursing home could be at home.  If the supports were there, they could be able to be in their community with their family where Government policy says they should be and where every political party and Deputy and Senator tells us when we meet them that they want them to be.  The challenge is both about the lack of funding and, to pick up a point that Deputy Danny Healy-Rae made, around the lack of a statutory basis for the fair deal scheme.  If one fulfils the medical criteria to go into a nursing home, the State will provide funding to enable one to go into a nursing home.</p> <p>  There are problems with the fair deal scheme but at least there is a structure.  There is nothing like that with home help.  There is no statutory underpinning for it.  The sector is not regulated.  One of the issues Age Action and every organisation in the ageing sector and many working in the disability community as well would have been arguing for is a statutory right to home help services in this country.  Until we start the discussion about how we deliver that, we will have meetings about funding, an extra half-hour here and an extra 15 minutes there.  It is not designed for the need of the older person.  It is designed to tick a box or keep the plates spinning.  Whilst we welcome the additional funding of &euro;10 million that was announced in budget 2017, that will not cope with increased demographic demand for home help services.  The HSE's figure is that 10% or 65,000 people of those over the age of 65 will require home help services.  We are providing home help services to 55,000 people.  There is a substantial amount of unmet need.  Many of those who are getting it are not getting sufficient hours and they may not have weekend cover.  We are coming up to Christmas when there could be many days without getting any kind of home help services and families or other carers will be obliged to step in.  Home help and rural transports are probably two of the acute issues for older people living in rural communities.</p></speech>

The Government must be mindful of the fact that younger people and not so young people are moving away from their families of origin and it is creating a vacuum with people left in silos to be minded by neighbours, friends and people coming back.  There is a lack of dignity being shown to and respect for older people.  It might not be only an age issue.  Some people are old at 50 and some are not old at 90.  It is a matter of restoring due respect for older people for their wisdom and that they have worked and contributed to the country that young people now are enjoying the benefits of.  They have paid their taxes.  They have made the country what it is.  Such recognition is sadly lacking.  Maybe it is something the committee could look at.</p> <p>  As regards child care issues that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned, I know plenty of families that are caring for their grandchildren.</p><p>This indicates that people who care for their grandchildren, particularly those from a lower economic group, suffer greater instance of depression, and it has a knock-on effect in mental health services.</p><p> Going back to what Mr. Moran was saying about transport, not only older people but those with disadvantage, particularly with mental health issues, find it difficult, particularly in rural areas, to access services such as appointments and clinics.  This has a knock-on effect where maybe they do not attend clinics, their mental health suffers and they go back into departments of psychiatry and there is an extra expense on the Government.  It is a domino effect.  It keeps increasing Government expenditure at another end.</p><p> Deputy Danny Healy-Rae spoke about A Vision for Change, which is now ten years old.  It dates from 2006.  It is for review this year.  While it is nearly the Bible of how mental health services move forward within urban and rural communities, and a lot of good work has been done, it needs to be reviewed with regard to how crisis intervention teams are established, how people have access to those teams, where they are well established and where they are not, and it needs to be looked at in a global way.</p><p> As regards Kerry, I refer to Kerry Mental Health Association.  Ms Bourke outlined that we work through 92 mental health associations.  We have a vibrant one in Kerry.  It has a huge housing facility that is seen as a model of best practice.  There is quite a lot going on in the Kerry area.  I note Deputy Danny Healy-Rae brought up some of the services that are not working well there, but that is one of them that is working well.</p><p> I am sure Ms Bourke has more to add to this.  There are facilities within the State.  For instance, Inishowen has a facility under the auspices of Mental Health Ireland that works well.  There is &Aacute;ras Foll&aacute;in and Gateway, here, in Dublin, supporting people with long-term and enduring mental health problems, some of whom are elderly but, certainly, who are disadvantaged.  We need to support that.  For very little funding people can be well supported.</p><p> Other services include the green prescription or social prescribing, which was piloted in the north west where a lot of elderly people went to their GP three or four times a week and they were taking up space.  In an initiative between the HSE, the GPs and either the partnership or F&Aacute;S at the time, they employed somebody to lead walking groups and social interaction groups.  That has proved beneficial, also for very little funding.  It is a model that might be looked at.</p><p> The senior social initiative of the GAA works well, as do men's sheds and women's sheds.  There is also a suicide crisis assessment nurse, SCAN, where people will present to their GP with suicidal ideation and they will, within 24 hours, have a nurse to come out and assess them to see what level of care, if any, they need at that moment in time.  It is proving that people of whatever age, and certainly the disadvantaged, are not being admitted to departments of psychiatry and they can access care in the community.  There is also a self-harm intervention programme, SHIP.  It was piloted in the south east where people who are self-harming have an intervention programme and they have access to six weeks' counselling, which is good.</p><p> As regards primary care, the centres are not well established in a lot of areas.  In the south east, we have pockets that are well established, but it needs to be looked at and rolled out so that people can go to the one-stop shop.</p><p> Befriending for the elderly and in mental health services is beneficial as well where people have a one to one.  With the elderly, such as my own father, who is 85 and, thank God, has a home help for a couple of hours a week, it is about the connection.  It is the fact that a human being goes in and that he sees somebody.  His home help has been going in since my late mother died and I could not say how beneficial it is, if only for the social connection.  For mental health, to be connected to somebody and to see somebody, through families, through members of the communities and through home helps, is the most important aspect.</p><p> I would recommend putting funding into transport and home help and growing services that exist locally.  Deputy Michael Collins made the point about the local.  If the home help changes every day, there is no rapport and people do not have trust.  People need to have that trust, particularly if they are vulnerable.  That is where we need to be at.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.783" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia Bourke" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016120700002#L00300"><p>Looking globally to put it together, we need to adopt a whole of health model.  We tend to adopt a medical model where we look at someone with an ailment such as diabetes and often do not look at the holistic aspects of his or her health.  I agree we need good Government policies.  We have a lot of good Government policies but there is a need to look at local needs.  There are good pockets of best practice out there but they are not consistent across the country.  There is a need to look at what is working well to see can that be expanded out to other places.  Rather than reinventing the wheel, we need to be doing that.</p> <p>  In regard to peer support, a lot of the peer support initiatives are funded on a project-by-project basis which in the long term is not the best.  It needs to have a funding stream.  Not only is it empowering those who are suffering with mental health difficulties, but it is becoming a whole of community approach.  We need to be embracing a whole of population approach.  We tend to focus on the elderly, the youth, etc.  What we are talking about here is the whole of community.  There is quite a lot of research.  We are talking about families struggling because either older people are disconnected from them or are, as shown in The Irish LongituDinal Study on Ageing, TILDA, from Trinity College, with failing health, having to provide the child care because couples or single parents cannot afford the child care costs.  There is a need to look at the child care costs and whether families can be supported to become families again.  Whether it is LGBT families or whatever, families have changed and we have got to open our thinking.</p> <p>  I take on board the point about stigma.  Ireland is not fully out of the stigma category, even with the huge amount of work on mental health with the Little Things campaign and our own Five Ways to Well-being, which is based on the NEF report.  Members all will have seen the media coverage of the recent statistics on the Little Things campaign.  In 2015, 81% of people still saw stigma when it comes to mental health - they will still have a problem with that - 35% found it difficult to talk to someone even at this stage and 55% stated that they would not want people to know if they themselves experienced a mental health problem.  That relates to mental health where it is talked about a lot.  I can totally empathise.  We have not yet fully opened our minds in Ireland and we need to move towards that.</p> <p>  The inter-generational piece needs to be looked at.  We have to accept it is not a case of one size fits all.  I have worked in different sectors and I have come across young 90 year olds and old 50 year olds.  It is not a case that one size fits all.</p> <p>  On the transport issue, I agree that we need to be looking elsewhere outside of Ireland as well.  In London, for instance, they call it Dial-a-Ride.  They telephone when they want to go to an appointment and they have a set-up with a local taxi service.  Maybe we need to be looking at other ways of looking at local resources.  While I do not have all the answers, there have to be other ways of doing it.</p> <p>  Going back to the peer support networks, historically, community development used fund a lot of that.  There needs to be clear funding around that.  Whether through the local authority, the community, the Department of Social Protection, DSP, or wherever, it needs to be looked at.</p> <p>  On the care teams, this is about lack of consistency.  Some HSE areas are up to full complement; others are not.  The HSE is trying to source staff.  I recognise that the HSE is encountering difficulties in trying to source staff.  It is not from a lack of trying.  However, that is not easy for those on the ground who do not have the services.</p></speech>

I ask the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to respond to the questions that have been posed to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.785" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kieran Stafford" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016120700002#L00500"><p>I am a volunteer with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  I come from Tipperary and I have a lot of on-the-ground experience.  I live in an urban area but I operate in both urban and rural areas.  I have a national role in my capacity as national vice-president of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.</p> <p>  In response to the questions from Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, my experience is that people living in the country would tend to be happier than those living in the town.  However, if one looks at one of the themes of our annual appeal this year, that one event can quite often tip an individual or a family into poverty, that is felt more harshly by those living in rural areas than those living in urban areas.</p><p>Take the example of an elderly couple where the husband dies, and the husband would have driven the car as the lady does not drive.  Immediately, the income is cut, the costs are the same but the challenges in terms of transport and associated matters are more difficult.  I can speak from my personal experience of visiting people in such situations.  One lady whose husband had died was unable to turn the tap off in her kitchen within months of living alone, so she had to call the garda&iacute; to the house to turn it off.  This actually happened.  These are the challenges that face people who would have had an inter-dependency with a partner with whom they had lived.</p><p> Regarding migration, I worked on a conference in Tinahely in Wicklow.  I was instrumental in setting it up.  It is a small village but it has a huge rural catchment area.  It was set up by elderly people who wished to do something in their community.  They discovered that the need in their community was not the financial need that members of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul so often address, so they moved their efforts to establishing a community centre, bringing people to it and engaging in various activities.  One of the most sought after activities was to become skilled with IT.  Again, this is a migration matter because people's families had moved away and they could not do simple things such as use Skype and send e-mails.  That was hugely successful.  On that subject, the society has invested in a large youth development scheme.  We work with children in secondary schools who set up conferences on a similar basis to the senior conferences we use to help people in the community.  A large part of the work they do is working with senior citizens to help them with IT and e-mails to connect with relations, as well as showing them how to use Facebook and showing them how useful it can be to connect to relations who live around the world.  In addition, many of the projects they embarked on would be historical projects, where they map out a person's life, where they lived and the differences in the types of challenges they faced when they were young.  The young people are very surprised when they see that the challenges were hard, but often they find that the modern challenges young people face are harder when they compare their lives to the lives of the older people they talk about and interview.</p><p> The transport issue arises all the time.  People struggle when they receive appointments at short notice through the post.  We are often called upon to provide financial assistance for people who must ask a neighbour to drive them to an appointment or bring them into town.  Sometimes it can be a considerable cost.  The personal contact we provide when we visit people, whether it is in rural or urban areas, is essential.  We get an exact picture because people tell us what they are feeling and what their situation is.  We regard that as a privilege and it is something we use for our social justice advocacy as well.</p><p> On the seniors alert scheme, we have evidence of people being unable to renew their monitoring facility due to lack of income.  We have had to intervene in some of those cases.</p><p> I could speak all day on experiences of inadequate home help.  In one situation an individual with no legs who was confined to a wheelchair had grossly inadequate home help.  This individual had to clean out his fireplace onto his lap, wheel himself to the door and scatter the ashes outside the door.</p><p> I thank Deputy Danny Healy-Rae for his compliments to my colleagues in Kerry.  I will pass them on to them.</p><p> In addition, we have experience of dealing with people in the LGBT community.  We helped with funding towards providing a community centre for the LGBT community in Galway.  I met with the individuals who were prominent in setting that up and I listened to their stories.  A number of the people I spoke to came from rural areas and had migrated to the town because they had struggled in those rural areas.  That said, there are still difficulties for that community in urban areas, especially where they congregate to meet, interact and support each other.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.787" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John-Mark McCafferty" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016120700002#M00200"><p>I will speak on some of the other questions raised.  We worked with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v over the years in his various Departments.  On rural public transport, I agree with my colleagues that there are different ways to deal with this.  It requires particular consideration by the various players, both statutory and voluntary.  The Irish Cancer Society has transport services.  We fund people to assist them to get to hospital and health appointments.  The local social welfare representatives, formerly the community welfare officers, CWOs, help, but that is discretionary so it depends on the discretion.  We must think innovatively.  The dial-a-ride approach might be a way to go.  The existing rural transport schemes and how they interface with the broader network of buses and trains should be considered.</p> <p>  In terms of poverty faced by families, generally our experience is that the vast majority of our financial assistance is to working age families, whereas our visitation and social connection work is very much with older people and people living alone.  Not all people who feel isolated are older people, although many are.  Many lone parents feel incredibly isolated.  That is an experience we learned from in two pieces of research we carried out in recent years.  One was on older people.  In some ways many older people have huge resilience and many assets, but social isolation is a big issue.  Then there is the isolation and mental health challenges facing lone parents in both urban and rural areas.  I mentioned some of the headline areas of expenditure for families in rural areas.  The car, related insurance and energy are more expensive than in urban areas, and to some extent food, clothing and household expenditure is also important.</p> <p>  That brings me to where that information was derived from and the question the Chairman asked.  The Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice has a comprehensive set of figures for almost every household type one can conceive of.  In fact, the partnership has an online calculator where one can compare expenditure types for a given household in an urban or rural area with the income that it might have.  If one has a particular income, such as social welfare, child benefit or various payments coming into the household, one can enter it into the calculator and see to what extent one is in surplus or deficit.  I direct the committee to that online resource.  It is very useful and it has been funded by the Department of Social Protection.</p> <p>  With regard to the wider response to isolation and loneliness, it is not purely a statutory response.  In fact, the more deeply qualitative measures are probably in the one-to-one interactions we have in the community and in the efforts we provide.  It is important to note that since 2009 there have been huge cuts to community development and related services and they have not been replaced or rejuvenated since the upturn.  Part of the reason for that is that there is no voice, because many of those community centres or community services are gone so there is nobody to speak up for them.  That is a huge loss.</p><p>It is hard to quantify that loss because they are simply not there anymore and we do not have a representative groundswell of opinion that will push for it.  However, initiatives like bingo and events that take place at a parish level and in community centres work well.  We have several resource centres and those involved do great work on intergenerational projects.  I have in mind a project in Galway.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul visitation is a way to combat loneliness and isolation.  The men's shed movement is another example.  It is somewhat like the situation of rural transport.  I reckon one element of the work of the committee should involve looking at isolation and loneliness and community connections.  There are numerous community connections and considerable levels of voluntary activity in Ireland compared with other countries.  Perhaps the challenge is more about co-ordinating the various statutory and voluntary players and mapping what is in place and who the various players are.</p><p> I wish to underline the issue of home help.  It is absolutely crucial.  Much of the time people are left with the choice of getting the house cleaned or getting a meal made, but they cannot have both.  Home help services have suffered as a result of the cuts.  The services have not been fully reinstated.  It appears this is one of those situations where it is a question of resources and the provision of resources to fund the service.  They need to be funded.</p><p> We would be concerned if there were to be certain changes, for example, increased costs regarding the seniors alert scheme.  If the cost created a barrier to accessing the seniors alert scheme, it would be a major concern for us.  It is a question of well-being and the sense of security that older people gain from the seniors alert scheme.  I trust that addresses the question from Deputy Collins.</p><p> Deputy Healy-Rae mentioned a campaign that might be needed to assist us.  It is called the annual appeal.  It is currently in the media, where we can find the cheapest outlets for promoting it.  We raise our funds at Christmas.  We are heavily dependent on public generosity from mid-November through to Christmas.  That generosity is critical for us to carry out visitation work, in other words, for our volunteer members to visit people in their homes, assist with certain areas of expenditure as well as being a listening ear and acting as a social contact.  People prefer to be at home.  Therefore, any local and social supports that can facilitate people ageing in their homes are preferable.</p></speech>

My experience is that it has become far more difficult and bureaucratic to get the necessary assistance from community welfare officers.  In the old days, people could go in, make a case and they could give those people cash.  Now, people fill out forms and do a means test.  The officers cogitate about it and then come back, even for a simple request like going to a hospital appointment that is 60 miles away.  The person may have to get a taxi because there is no other way in or out and he cannot take the public bus.</p> <p>  Am I right in thinking that one of the major draws on the funds of the organisation at the moment is the fact that it is undertaking work that was being done by community welfare officers ten years ago?  This work is now taken as routine.  It has become a matter now of going to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul because the community welfare officer service has been centralised and taken out of rural areas.  We used to have local community welfare officers.  They knew the people and knew the quirks.  The work does not fit into neat boxes of criteria and so on.  I have noticed that some people can live comfortably on meagre resources and some people never have a dime in their pockets.  That is simply human nature.</p> <p>  Mr. McCafferty might clarify a second point.  My memory is that the Department with responsibility for community affairs used to give the society &euro;1 million at Christmas and used to give Protestant Aid a smaller sum &ndash; it might have got more per head.  Does the society still get that money?  Has the amount increased?  This was a s&iacute;nti&uacute;s given at Christmas time by the Department.  In particular, if the organisation is carrying a burden that the State used to carry, the State should carry it again now.  In other words, the State has become so systematic that it pushes on to the organisation the work it had been doing.  Therefore, it should give the organisation the money to do it.  I am keen to hear a comment on that point because it is a major issue in my area.</p></speech>

We have the unusual situation whereby there is definite evidence of where CWOs send people to us having refused to help them.  I have seen it myself.  We operate several second-hand furniture stores around the country.  There is evidence of people being sent to buy second-hand furniture from us because of inadequate money given to get a house, rather than that person being able to go into a new store and buy new furniture.</p> <p>  It is not consistent.  There are some very good CWOs in particular areas who will go to the ends of the earth for people.  Then there are others who will not do that.  Again, there is inequality for people living in rural areas.  The clinics may be once a fortnight or once a week in these areas, whereas in the towns they may be two or three times a week.  Obviously, it depends on the numbers of people approaching.</p> <p>  We still get the grant but it has reduced from when we first began to get it.  It came from the Department when Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was the Minister.  We use it to do the type of work we believe the Government should be doing.</p></speech>

It used to be &euro;1.75 million.  Those figures may not be exactly right, but off the top of my head, they are in and around that mark.  The entire reporting system around this has become rather bureaucratic and difficult.</p></speech>

T&aacute;im bu&iacute;och as ucht an cuireadh a thabhairt d&uacute;inn.  I commend the committee on examining this area because education is very often taken for granted in public policy.  It is assumed the sector is doing its job of educating young people, but it is also doing the broader work of creating social cohesion in communities and contributing to local society.  In a way, education is sometimes a little overlooked as a policy area so it is valuable to have this opportunity to go into the nuances.  With regard to rural-urban issues in education at second level, our position is absolutely unlike that of our primary school colleagues.  The INTO representatives will give a very full description of their position.</p><p>Unlike them, we do not have sharp rural-urban divides or trends evident in terms of educational experience of second level pupils.  The dynamics of second level are quite different from the dynamics of the role of the local primary school in a rural community.  Most of our second level schools are concentrated in mixed rural or small urban areas.  Accordingly, what happens at second level schools in terms of educational outcomes and achievement is very much on a par with what is happening throughout the country.</p><p> We have a good research base of what happens in our schools.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has done significant work on tracking the educational experiences of young people over a decade through the monumental longitudinal study, Growing Up in Ireland.  This has been tracking several thousand young people from when they were born.  They are currently at 15 years of age.  We have a large amount of data on the educational experience of young people plus all manner of data on their well-being, etc.  Having trawled through these data, it is clear there are no marked differences between rural and urban educational experiences.  The evidence suggests - anecdotally we would all be familiar with it - that rural second level pupils are somewhat at an advantage in our education system.  When one looks at participation rates in third level education, significant numbers come from the western seaboard and other rural areas.</p><p> If we want to look at the issues facing rural second level schools, we should not compare them with urban schools.  We have to look at the broader issues which are impacting on what our second level schools can do generally in the country, as well as what we need to do with public policy at this stage of our economic recovery to ensure our second level schools are delivering for their communities, whether they are rural or urban.</p><p> Over the past six years, the ASTI, with Millward Brown, has produced a longitudinal study of the impact of budgets on second level education.  The news is not good.</p></speech>

That needs to be addressed as it is quite difficult for many voluntary secondary schools to attend to basic management and operational needs.  Funding should meet developing demographic demands and should be based on student need rather than sector type.  Sector type funding is leading to certain differences throughout the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.802" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Byrne" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016120700002#P00300"><p>The provision of second level schools in rural areas tends to depend on reaching a certain threshold.  In other words, it is a numbers game.  For instance, I teach in Swords in north County Dublin which, by and large, is an area with a rural characteristic.  Many of the students I teach would come from small rural areas in north County Dublin, such as Naul or Ballyboughal.</p> <p>  One issue for rural schools at second level is the reduction of subject choice.  This often stems from an inability in the system to share resources.  Often at second level in rural areas with great distances between schools, sharing resources, such as a physics or accounting teacher, can be quite difficult.  This needs to be looked at if we are going to keep a high-quality system up to leaving certificate level.</p> <p>  We do not have figures on the breakdown of rural DEIS programme schools.  At this stage we should be looking at a system of the money following the student in the same way we have spoken about the money following the patient in the health service.</p> <p>  I am concerned about the cost of extracurricular activities.  When there are great distances between schools, the costs involved are both financial and time.  No football, hurling or basketball team can get from one school to another to engage in extracurricular activities without incurring great cost.  In a rural setting, that requires the hiring of private transport.  It is not simply a matter of the children going to a match with their bus fare.  There is a significant cost which is often thrown back onto parents through voluntary contributions and extra contributions throughout the week.  No child should be disadvantaged in their interest in extracurricular activities because of living in a rural area.</p> <p>  Capitation grants were cut and then frozen which has led to major problems within schools.  The cut to guidance counselling has had a major effect on students, particularly in rural areas with regard to one-to-one counselling sessions.  While many of these issues are not just confined to rural areas, a great deal of them are exacerbated by distance as well as time.  Time is quite significant to a teacher, who might happen to live 60 km from the school in which they teach, if they are providing extracurricular support for football teams, debating or musicals.  These are issues which have to be taken into account when we talk about trying to keep thriving rural communities with schools as their centres.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.803" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Moira Leydon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016120700002#P00400"><p>From the evidence base, the one significant issue coming through on an urban-rural disparity at second level is the opportunity for students in rural areas to have access to out-of-school, extracurricular activities.  Yesterday, the OECD published its programme for international student assessment, PISA, report on Irish education.  One of the pertinent questions that came from the floor at this was the lack of opportunity for students outside of cities to have out-of-school science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, activities.  This involves students visiting a local factory or institute of technology or being part of a joint school exercise.  The capacity of rural schools, by definition parents and young people, to have access to educational enrichment opportunities is significantly different and of a lesser quality than in urban areas.  That is a matter which public policy should take into account, especially with the emphasis on STEM subjects.</p><p>The cost of transport is critical to this dimension.</p><p> The second area where one can see emerging rural-urban differences is in the post-school experiences of young people.  Young people in rural areas, the evidence strongly suggests, have much fewer opportunities to engage in non-third level learning opportunities.  In other words, there are not the same amount of vocational education and training opportunities, there are not the same amount of PLC courses and there is not the access to the apprenticeships, which, of course, is only beginning to take off again and is particularly in the larger urban areas.  Despite the economic recovery, we still have a phenomenon in the country of those not in education, employment or training, NEETs.  Some 20% of 25 year olds are in that category, which is frightening, and over 55% of these NEETs are unemployed.</p><p> The urban-rural divide is stark.  Young people in rural areas do not have the same opportunities of access to vocational education and training after school.  This is significant in terms of both policy about social exclusion and sustaining rural communities.  Some economists are talking about the so-called "dual labour market".  In rural areas, there are the young people who go on to third level.  They have access to the high-tech jobs, to the jobs in the financial services, the pharmaceutical sector, etc.  They are moving out of the rural area.  Those who are left behind are not skilled enough for these jobs but they are not skilled enough even for the jobs in the locality.  There is almost a "rump" - not wishing to use a derogatory term - of young people in their local areas who do not have employment opportunities because they do not have the skills, etc.  From the point of view of public policy, that vocational education and training area would be an important area to look at.</p></speech>

Ms O'Connor and I went to small rural schools, in Donegal and Monaghan, respectively, in the 1970s at a time which was challenging for rural education.  We are still very involved in our union, the INTO, in promoting and continuing the proud tradition of the INTO for over 148 years of supporting not only our teachers' work and conditions, but also our local communities because many of the 3,200 plus schools are at the centre of their local communities.</p> <p>  We made a detailed submission to the coiste.  Ms O'Connor will lead off by taking the coiste through it and I will take the second half.  This is a timely engagement.  Over the last number of recessionary years there have been huge pressures on our small rural schools, and, indeed, on all our schools.  It is a wonderful opportunity, as we come out of recession, to try to support those communities and the teachers who work in them in the next number of years under this new Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.807" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre O'Connor" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016120700002#Q00400"><p>I will look particularly at the issues in relation to staffing in rural schools.  I will primarily keep my remarks to small schools because the figures we have provided the committee with show that, predominately, in counties with a rural base there are a larger number of schools and those schools are largely small schools.  One can see from our submission that 1,295 of the 3,124 schools in the country have fewer than 100 pupils.  We can state fairly definitively that most of those are in rural areas.</p> <p>  The committee will be aware, from the campaigning that INTO has done and also from information available, that Irish primary class sizes are among the largest in the EU, second only to those in the UK, with an average of 25 pupils per class.  The EU average is 21 per class.</p> <p>  Of particular concern to INTO were the staffing costs that were implemented in 2012 which were particularly targeted at two, three and four-teacher schools.  I set out in the submission paper the increases which came into those schools.  For example, prior to 2012, an 84-pupil school had four teachers and a class size of 21.  Bearing in mind that teachers in those classes are teaching across a range of age groups, that school would now have three teachers and a class size of 28.  There was a slight improvement in 2015, but it was disappointing to INTO that the improvements were not sustained in budget 2017.  Our position is that we are calling for an immediate reversal of those cuts prior to 2012 and to revert to the former pupil-teacher ratios.</p> <p>  On the sustainability of schools, of particular concern are issues around two and one-teacher schools.  The appointment of a second teacher to a small school or the loss of a school's second teacher is a critical issue in terms of whether that school will survive or not.  INTO has paid a lot of attention to what constitutes a school which would be sustainable in an area because in the context of a small school, there is always discussion about whether we will keep every small school and whether the school is sustainable.  In rural areas which have a two or one-teacher school, we should not look only at the numbers.  We should look at the other factors which contribute to whether a school is a required school or whether it is sustainable.  Those factors would include the remoteness of the school, and whether it serves a particular area which is difficult to access.  They would also include the distance from other schools.  We are aware that in some instances one might have two or three small rural schools in a particular parish and the question arises as to whether, for example, if all of those children are playing on the same football team and going to the same church for Mass, there is a need to have three schools in that area.  The distance from other schools is also a factor that should be taken into account, as is, obviously, ethos and the maintenance of ethos of schools.  Then there is also that schools contribution to the fabric of society.  In terms of a required school, we should not look only at the numbers and there should be provision for the retention of a second teacher in a school on a basis other than numbers.</p> <p>  One of the other consequences of the staffing reductions in 2012 has been the increase in the number of one-teacher schools.  There were eight one-teacher schools in 2008.  There are now 24 of them.  Where a school is required in an area and it is demonstrated to be a school that the community needs, working in that school is a particular difficulty for the teacher.  It is personally and professionally isolating for that teacher.  We would consider that there are also health and safety risks involved in one adult working in a school with a number of children.  Our policy is that there should be an additional adult appointed to all such schools in the form of a classroom assistant to assist the teacher and to address the concerns that we have outlined.</p> <p>  I will now hand over to my colleague who will look at some of the other issues in relation to the rural schools.</p></speech>

We would ask the joint committee to seek a commitment from the Department of Education and Skills that the favourable retention figures for Gaeltacht schools with five to 11 teachers would continue.  There has been a trend in the past number of years where retention figures have come back into the staffing schedule and that has been a great achievement in INTO negotiations.  We would be concerned if there was ever any talk about the removal of retention figures because that is the lifeline for the small Gaeltacht school.  If a small Gaeltacht school loses one family, it can still retain its last teacher with the retention figure whereas if it was a bald figure on the schedule, one appoints a teacher at a particular point and if one falls one below it one loses the teacher.  That has brought some solace to small Gaeltacht schools.</p> <p>  F&aacute;ilt&iacute;onn Cumann M&uacute;inteoir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann roimh an strait&eacute;is &uacute;r don Ghaeilge.

F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an gcinneadh at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag an Aire go mbeidh m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; breise ar f&aacute;il do na scoileanna beaga sa Ghaeltacht.  We believe that to save the language we should be prioritising extra staffing for Gaeltacht schools and schools in the Breac-Gaeltacht.  The challenges these schools are facing are different to those faced at the time Ms O'Connor and I attended small rural schools in the 1970s.  The make-up of the Gaeltacht communities has changed dramatically.  Not all of the children now attending Gaeltacht schools come from a strong language base.  We are requesting that special training be provided to teachers in Gaeltacht schools to ensure the tumoideachais - the immersion - works properly.  We very much welcome the new policy in relation to immersion but it must be accompanied by training.  In addition, there must also be a local stewardship of the strategy.  In this regard, we recommend that comhairleoir&iacute; be put into the various Gaeltacht regions to assist teachers and schools in ensuring that the new strait&eacute;is is working.  </p><p> We have a number of other concerns in regard to Gaelscola&iacute;ocht and scoileanna Gaeltachta.  T&aacute; s&eacute; thar am go mbeidh c&eacute;im Baitsil&eacute;ir Oideachais ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Now that we have new institutions in Maynooth and Dublin City University it is beyond time there was a strand of teacher education focused on training teachers to teach through the Irish language.  Another issue that came to my attention recently from craobh an Daingin is that there is extra funding provided to gaelscoileanna that is not provided to Gaeltacht schools.  This anomaly needs to be addressed.  Generally speaking, while the strategy around Gaeltacht schools is great if it is not properly resourced it will not work.  Ms O'Connor alluded to some of our other concerns.  The INTO has always engaged closely with the Department of Education and Skills and patron bodies in regard to amalgamations.  In recent years, due to the various cuts in the small schools sector, the focus is now back on amalgamations.  We are of the view that the Department of Education and Skills needs to take the lead on amalgamations.  It is not that there are going to be multiple amalgamations prioritised throughout the country but where they are necessary the Department should take the lead and work closely with the patron bodies and the INTO.  For example, an independent school support person could be appointed to each diocese to assist boards of management in relation to school amalgamations, which is quite an emotive issue.  Where an amalgamation is necessary - it will not be necessary everywhere - there are a few prerequisites to it being a success.  If there is proper investment in an amalgamation it can work well.  As a pupil, I was party to an amalgamation in the late 1960s-early 1970s which worked very well until many years later when we got a new school building.  There should be a special grant to incentivise amalgamations, including dedicated funding from the schools building unit for refurbishment works because obviously the building into which the three schools are being amalgamated will not be sufficient to cater for them.  It is important the three schools are accommodated in one building rather than on shared campus or different sites.  Also, all of the teaching posts should be retained until such time as the pupils have settled in, with teachers nearing retirement having access to redeployment if they so wished.  The ASTI delegates spoke about school transport.  It is a matter that comes to the fore at a time of amalgamation.</p><p> I am a pr&iacute;omhoide in South County Dublin and I have served many pr&iacute;omhoid&iacute; and members in the Wicklow area.  The role of the teaching principal has become extremely difficult in recent times given the lack of middle management support.  The big issue over the past few years for the INTO as a union is that the principal teacher has little time to teach and little time to administer.  A principal teacher in Newry or just outside Newry is provided with one administrative release day per way.  A key demand of the INTO for a number of years through its various conferences has been that this be available to all principals.  There was a small increase of one or two days per principal per year provided for in the previous budget but there was no improvement on that in this year's budget, which was very disappointing.  The lifting of the moratorium on post responsibility will undoubtedly help many principal teachers but not so many in rural areas because the smaller schools tend to have fewer middle management positions.  A principal of a school with 183 pupils is responsible for administration of that school every day of the year but a principal of a school with only a few less pupils might have one or two days release from those duties.  That does not make sense.</p><p> There is another issue of concern in regard to rural areas which if addressed would help rural schools greatly.  Since October 2015 there has been a strategy in place for ICT and digital learning in schools but that strategy has not yet come into effect in any primary school.  We are envious of the post primary schools that are getting their 100 megabytes of broadband.  The school in which I teach, which is a very large school, needs broadband.  Former General Secretary of the INTO, Mr. John Carr, once said that on occasion broadband in the west is dependent on the way in which the blind is blowing.  It is beyond time that proper ICT infrastructure was put in place not only to assist in children's learning but for the proper administration of schools given the increased demand on school boards of management in terms of their having to claim for substitute teachers, record absences and engage with the primary pupil database.  High level broadband is needed for administration purposes and particularly for 21st century learning.  </p><p> As a union, the INTO is, and has been for a century and a half, committed to rural Gaeltacht and island schools.  I recently visited schools on Aranmore Island.  I am delighted that the measure for the one-teacher school will improve life hugely for one of the schools on Aranmore Island.  We need to ensure that our rural schools and rural communities are resourced and funded so that they can continue to be at the centre of their communities.  People in those communities value them greatly.  We look forward to further engagement with the committee on this issue.</p></speech>

When the National Parents' Council received the invitation to attend the committee we felt it was important that we represented the children's experiences of rural and island schools and so we carried out a survey of parents over a one-week period, to which we received 832 responses.  The questions we asked parents were solely based on the areas being examined by the committee.  Some 94% of the responses were from parents of children attending rural schools and 2% were from parents of children attending island schools.  We included the results of that survey in the material sent to the committee.  In summary, in terms of distance from schools 65% of those who responded said that they travelled between 0 and 5 km to the school attended by their child and 27% travelled 5 km to 10 km.  According to 92% of parents their children travelled less than 10 km to their local school.  In terms of pupil numbers in each school, 40% of schools said they had less than 100 pupils; 37% have between 100 and 200 pupils and 22% have over 200 pupils.  In terms of class numbers, 70% of parents said that there were ten or less children in their child's class; 25% had been between ten and 20 children in the class.  The majority, 44%, had between 20 and 30 children in the class.  Worryingly, 14% said there were over 30 pupils in their child's class.</p><p>With respect to the number of classes, 79% have eight classes or fewer.  The majority seems to be around that size.</p><p> In terms of classroom facilities, which was one of the areas the committee wanted to examine, quite pleasingly, 84% of parents reported good classroom facilities.  Comments on this aspect covered a number of different areas.  Quite a few commented that they had new builds, had got new schools, new classrooms had been built or that planning for those builds had been approved and there were in the process of beginning to be built  It was nice to see that starting to come through.</p><p> Some responses indicated that the physical education, PE, hall had been converted into classrooms and that the expansion required to meet needs was not been dealt with in terms of building.  A significant number of responses indicated that were good facilities in the school but that this was down to the school communities' fund-raising and efforts in that respect.  A small number of responses indicated the schools were cold, damp and old buildings.  That number has reduced but it is still a feature of small schools.  One response indicated that their child's school was 115 years old and they were not quite sure how much renovations had been done in that time.  There was a very wide range of experience.</p><p> In terms of recreation facilities, the responses ranged from 85% plus to 63% indicating that their children had good recreation facilities.  This in some cases reflected in the comments regarding the education facilities in that those parents who said that the school's PE hall has been used to provide classrooms commented that the school did not have any indoor space for children for recreation purposes.  A number of respondents reported that there was very poor outdoor space areas as well, that there was little space to play and few play facilities in those areas.  While the outdoor space might be a Tarmac area or a field, there was very little within that for children to do.  </p><p> On the school transport scheme, 40% of parents reported that their child's school had a transport scheme, 52% of parents reported that their child's school did not have one and a number of parents did not know whether their child's school had one.  Of those parents who reported their child's school did not have a transport scheme or that their child did not have access to it, 75% of them used their car to get their child to school.  </p><p> Those were the main areas on which the committee asked for information on the experiences of children in schools in rural and island areas.  From the perspective of the National Parents' Council we would be very keen for the committee to note that when decisions are being made around rural and island schools that the standard of education is the first element that must be considered.  Many important areas such as travel distance, remoteness, ethos and protecting communities also need to be examined but we need to make sure that all those decisions come secondary to the quality of the education of children in the schools.  The key message from the National Parents Council is that the standard of education for children in rural and primary schools needs to be the same as that for children in the larger urban schools.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.813" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016120700002#S00300"><p>On the issue of school buildings, the witnesses might confirm if they believe the previous Government's policy was that school building priority was based on demographics?  If a school had a burst in demographics in terms of a major increase in enrolments it would be included in the building programme, but if it did not have such a change in demographics, even if the school was falling apart and the roof was leaking, it would be down the list in terms of building priority.  Have the witnesses information on the remaining number of poor standard schools in rural areas that are not moving up the school building list because the criteria does not have any objective measure?   For example, if a school comes under a category of being a substandard building, which I believe is category B2, how much is that holding back the necessary provision of school buildings?  It would probably be fair to say that the devolved scheme, particularly for primary schools, did much to clean up the building issue even though there was a local input.  I am all for local input as I live in rural community.  I find most rural people simply want to get the job done.  They do not care how we get it done and they are more than willing to take on the responsibility.</p> <p>  The Department has moved away from the traditional transport model of catchment areas and is now very driven by a simple mathematical measurement of where a student's nearest school is located, irrespective of whether it is located in the parish, there has been a traditional pattern in terms of students from an area attending it or whether a bus passes it.  How much is that factor affecting primary schools, in particular, but also secondary schools?  We find that families from an area who traditionally attended a particular school are now been told that, in terms of mathematical measurement, their children are living nearer to another school and that their part of a parish or area has to change what was a traditional pattern.  How much is that affecting schools?  </p> <p>  How much is the transport requirement to have ten rather than eight pupils causing the cessation of routes with respect to primary schools in rural areas?  The criterion for the setting up of a bus route was the need to have eight pupils but now the requirement is ten pupils.  Has that caused a major disruption with many schools, particularly in the more rural of rural areas,  having very little school transport?  </p> <p>  I apologise for not been here for the start of the meeting as I had to be elsewhere.  How high is it on the agenda of the INTO that the cuts in the pupil-teacher ratio in small two-, three- and four-teacher primary schools in rural areas would be fully reversed and that they would revert to what they were previously?  </p> <p>  In terms of teacher-principals, one of the witness seemed to indicate that if a school has an enrolment over a certain figure, it will get that a principal post, but if it is under that figure, a uniform policy will be applied rather than a sliding scale.  Have proposals to have a sliding scale been put forward and if they have, could we get a copy of them?   In other words, if a school has an enrolment of 183, which was the magic figure that was mentioned, that school would get a principal post, but if a school has an enrolment of 170, the teacher-principal would get to be a principal for four days a week, if a school has an enrolment of 110, the teacher in that post would get so much in respect of the principal role, and if one was in that role in a 20-teacher school that teacher might be a fully occupied teacher in that the administrative burden would be small.</p> <p>  Would the witnesses agree that rural Ireland does not have access to broadband either at home or in the schools and that what we need is not a very poor 100 Mbps but 1 Gbps, or fibre connectivity?  If Dublin wants to live with 100 Mbps of broadband, that is fine.  The demand from myself and other people living in rural Ireland is to have 1 Gbps, to have fibre connectivity to houses.  In the village in which I live in a remote part of rural Ireland, we will have fibre connectivity to the school and to 100 houses in the community.  It can be easily done, the buoys are already up and we will have that connectivity at the end of January.  The idea that we cannot aspire to having 1 Gbps, or in other words fibre, is wrong.  I would welcome if all the schools demanded that we move into 21st century and have 1 Gbps.</p> <p>  I was examining school outcomes as apart of a project I did last year, and it is hard to get statistics on them.  I used a simple test, namely, out of every 100 pupils how many got to third level education through the system?  The findings seemed to indicate that students in many rural areas, including in  remote areas, where there would be a socio-economic mix among the parents, were performing at the top of the scale in line with urban advantage schools.  I refer to Belmullet and other places like that.  In terms of rural education outcomes, if we compare them to the parents' educational levels, they surpassed the equivalents of the cities.  Having examined the statistics, if I compare urban blackspots, DEIS urban schools where 20% to 25% of students might get to third level, I do not know a rural second level school where that percentage would be acceptable or where the parents would accept that.</p><p>How much data do the witnesses have on young people's outcomes compared with the socioeconomic backgrounds of their parents?  If I am right in what I conclude, rural Ireland has been a huge resource of well-educated, well-rounded young people who have come into the production economy.  In other words, many of them get high-end jobs and are part of the tiger economy.  We always talk about our highly educated, motivated young people.  Whereas they see the jobs tend to be located in urban areas - in other words, they migrate out - the statistics on third level access would seem to show that a disproportionate number of these people come from rural areas.  I will give a simple example by way of comparison.  A higher percentage of children growing up in west Cork, specifically the rural area of west Cork, will go on to third level than the average for the whole of the city of Dublin because the high levels of progression to third level in the affluent area of south County Dublin is more than dragged down by the very low levels in the more socioeconomically deprived areas around the rim of the city.  If I am correct, rural Ireland has been a fantastic resource, between schools and community, that has kept the economy going.  Therefore, if it were to decline and die, one would lose - if I might put it in crude terms - a fantastic raw material that has driven the economy for the past 20 years.  One would certainly reduce the pool considerably because, unfortunately, in parts of urban areas, the number of people who become high-end achievers is relatively small.  I am interested in this point.</p></speech>

I apologise for the turnout at the committee.  I am slightly out of my comfort zone on the rural agenda, but the witnesses might appreciate I have some questions about broadband in particular.  The INTO document states there are 3,124 schools in the State.  It goes on in the section relating to broadband to outline that 1,500 schools do not receive high-speed broadband services.  Could the witnesses detail the day-to-day realities of the expectations of the teacher and the student in rural areas in terms of the curriculum in comparison to the urban environment where, presumably, high-speed broadband exists?</p> <p>  Separately, out-of-school activities and STEM were mentioned.  I would like to hear the Minister start to refer to STEAM rather than STEM and to bring the arts into that picture.  The witnesses will appreciate that the arts also fall under the remit of the committee.  Out-of-school activities were mentioned.  My vision for the arts is one in which they are valued as much as science, technology, engineering and mathematics and in which the infrastructure exists to excel outside the formal education environment.  Young people should be seen as artists in their own right, not only as future artists or audiences.  My belief is that we need a national youth arts strategy that would enable this area to grow outside the formal education environment to provide extracurricular activities for young people.  Reduced access was mentioned by the ASTI, and I welcome that.</p> <p>  I am showing my ignorance here, but the fact there are one-teacher schools has come as a surprise to me.  It is scandalous that any school would be left with one teacher, particularly in terms of inclusion, isolation and so on, so I thank the witnesses for including the issue in their contributions and highlighting it for me.  Sin &eacute;.</p></speech>

I am on the board of management of a rural school so I know at first hand the issues that have put us under serious pressure over the past few years.  A few other schools on the rural peninsula where I live are under severe pressure.  The problem is numbers.  I thank each of the witnesses for their presence, their presentations and the work they have done.  I also pay tribute to the boards of management and the parents' associations that work voluntarily, give their time freely and are struggling.  I noted with a passing glance on the front page of a newspaper in a shop the other day all the new instructions and rules the Minister is coming up with for boards of management.  Does the Government think we are all paid or something?  Why does it continue to make it more and more difficult for boards of management to carry out their work in schools?  I find it quite incredible.  Many boards of management and schools are criticised just because they are church schools.  The State must realise that only for the church keeping school doors open and paying for and building schools, we would be in a difficult position.  I can assure the committee and the witnesses that many Ministers in recent times have tried to take churches out of schools only to realise very quickly the value the churches have had in schools.  Thankfully, never once has a church issue come up in the school in whose board of management I am involved.  We do not discriminate against anybody coming into our school, and I would like to have that stated as a fact.  Neither I nor any board of management would tolerate that but we are made to look as if we were some sort of hierarchy that would refuse people coming into our schools because of this, that and the other.</p> <p>  I see many other issues in the day-to-day running of the school.  One of the schools in my community is a one-teacher school.  The school itself pays a second teacher.  The board of management is in an incredible situation in that this is allowed to happen in this State.  There is no clear understanding between rural schools and urban schools.  In urban Ireland, areas can be highly populated, but in rural Ireland, no matter what one does, there are few employment opportunities, there is a falling population and there is no clear understanding in government of the situation.  Unfortunately, it is the school sitting within the latter kind of area that is punished severely and the pupils who are punished in the long term.  We talk about walking principals, which is the best way to describe them.  There is a school in Schull in which there are about 150 students.  Diarmuid Duggan is an excellent principal of the highest class but, at the same time, he is stretched to the limit.  He is trying to carry out his teaching duties while also trying to deal with the day-to-day issues of parents and trying to run a school.  This is an incredible situation to be left with, and there is very poor understanding of it.</p> <p>  Reference was made to broadband.  In many rural schools we can forget about 100 Mbps because there is no bit at all.  The problem in such schools is having any kind of broadband service.  Some of them will be waiting for quite some time to come because I have been to quite a lot of meetings and I cannot see this being resolved in the future.</p> <p>  If any one of the witnesses has recommendations about the Gaeltacht, I ask him or her to make them to the Gaeltacht committees.  It is a very important time to do so.  There is a Gaeltacht, Irish language and islands committee, and the clerk to this committee is also the clerk to that committee.  He will speak to the witnesses after this meeting if they would like to submit any details or make any submissions.</p> <p>  We are examining sustainable rural Ireland and our schools.  Another question I need to ask the witnesses concerns newly qualified teachers and the very low wages they are expected to start off on and the pressures under which they find themselves.  Are they staying with it?  Are they moving abroad?  Are teachers being lost because of this issue?  Maybe we as a political system, as politicians, can help the witnesses in trying to raise awareness in the D&aacute;il that there needs to be a clearer understanding between rural and urban schools.</p><p>If that is not there going forward, we will always have the issues we are discussing here today.</p></speech>

A number of issues were raised about transport and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned catchment areas.  I taught in a rural school for many years and catchment areas have always been a source of some problems.  When one came back to school there were often issues around catchment areas because they had been redefined.  As the Deputy said, families that had traditionally gone to a particular school found they were now in a position where they were being encouraged to go to other schools.  I also draw attention to Dr. Emer Smyth's work in her book <i>Cherishing all the Children Equally</i>.  There is a conundrum here in that almost half of junior cycle students do not attend their nearest school.  Parental choice in education is largely driven by socioeconomic status.  It is a fairly complex question but is definitely one that rears its head frequently at second level.</p></speech>

I grew up in Dublin 4 and we were within 100 yards of a school but it was too posh for us so we were sent out to the Christian Brothers three miles away.  There must have been ten schools that were nearer.  Sandymount was one of those.  It was easy because it was a very modest distance on a straight bus lane.  We used to cycle.  In a rural area, I imagine that one would find the pattern is not quite as choice free.</p></speech>

I want to tease this out.  There is no school transport system in the city.  One just goes to whatever school one feels like.  Having grown up in that milieu, I understand it perfectly.  One attends the second, third, fourth, or fifth nearest school.  It is like taking one bus or another - they are coming in every direction.</p> <p>  By contrast, in rural areas there seems to be a policy driven by the Department every year.  I saw it when I was in Government and I have seen it in Opposition.  The Department wants to force it because it is very handy for its bean counting to force children to go to the nearest school, whether it is a good or bad school.  It also wants to get rid of concessionary tickets.  We refused to do it when we were in Government.  They are purposely trying to downsize the buses so there are not so many concessionary tickets because naughty people are sending children to the school of their choice rather than to the nearest school.  That is taking choice out of rural education, which urban people take for granted because in an urban setting there is massive amount of choice.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, we have a very good database of educational participation, outcomes and socioeconomic characteristics in Ireland.  It is very recent, representative and solid.  It is building all the time with the Growing up in Ireland study which is globally at the top.  The divides we see in education in terms of broader socioeconomic patterns are not rural-urban.  There is no research evidence to say there are marked differences between rural and urban in terms of outcomes of education, whether we define those narrowly in the occupational direction or more broadly in terms of civic engagement and well-being.  Dr. Emer Smyth has two decades of exemplary research behind her.  Her most recent work is Cherishing all the Children Equally, which is a beautiful compendium of all sorts of post-1916 reflections on where we have gone as a society from the point of view of young people.  Her data is that nationally 50% of junior cycle students do not go to local schools.  It is well over 65% in the Dublin area.</p> <p>  As the Deputy alluded to, it is a complex issue.  School choice is something intrinsic in our second level system.  In very many ways, one of the strengths of our system is that for very many decades the State has said we will not have a highly selective schooling system in which there are pronounced differences between socioeconomic classes going to different types of schools.  Instead it said the local school will provide, in the first instance, a broad enough curriculum so that it will be suitable for all sorts of ability type and dispositions and, second, that the quality of the local school will be maintained by national standards such as we have now in the Teaching Council, NCCA and the State Examinations Commission.  In a way, the question of parental choice in education, as the Deputy alluded to, is very complex and is not just to do with socioeconomic status but also with broader issues.  We can certainly send the committee on the Emer Smyth evidence.</p> <p>  I want to come back to one point.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  I will throw out a few figures.  In its 2006 economic survey of Ireland, which was the height of our boom, the OECD said investment in education after the Donogh O'Malley era contributed something like 18% to our overall GDP growth in the previous period.  That is incredible.  It is very clear that investment in education pays off in terms of developing the human capital to keep the economy going.  It would be wrong from the point of view of public policy to only talk about our rural-urban dimension.  All the evidence says that the inequality in education outcomes is as pronounced within schools as between schools.  In schools there will be very high achievers going off to third level and much lower achievers going to different, not so prosperous, destinations.  Public policy is an expression I keep using.  From the point of view of public policy, it has to be about making sure that all students in every school have the opportunities to make sure they have those options.  I will not labour the point.  </p> <p>  I want to respond to Senator Warfield's point.</p></speech>

It reinforces things in the school population and the aspirations of children and parents.  Peer pressure made it more difficult for children to get on even if they wanted to whereas if I went to the leafy suburbs of south Dublin I find the opposite effect - the community effect was uplifting there.  My experience of rural Ireland is that it replicates more the urban, middle class experience than the urban highly deprived area experience.  If I am right, pushing people into highly deprived areas will weaken the human capital into the future.  That is my point.</p></speech>

Educational sociologists have always pointed to four main issues with regard to outcomes for children.  The first is parental educational achievement, that is, the child's own parents' educational achievement and how they view education.  The second is community structure.  Does the child come from a community that values the things that are educational?  The third is family structure.  The family itself is an issue, in whether there are two parents or one, whether there is a nuclear family and whether there is good support from the wider family.  The fourth and biggest issue is poverty.  If there is poverty, education is very difficult.  If one is living hand to mouth, it is hard to come up with what may be important in the longer term.</p> <p>  I note something else the Deputy said regarding building, policy and demographics.  At second level, there is another issue occurring.  I would suggest that the voluntary secondary school sector, as in schools that were church-led, are now receiving far less resources than the newer-build ETBs and community and comprehensive schools.  Therefore, they are beginning to fall into disrepair and that will have a knock-on effect on teaching and learning in those areas.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v had a considerable number.  With regard to transport, I have first-hand experience of the effect of that change from ten pupils down to eight in the west Wicklow area on the far side of the Blessington lakes.  It has created huge difficulties for some of the national schools there.  It appeared that families were going to be divided, in that the older children would continue to attend the school they had been attending from the outset and that younger children would have to go to a different school.  I had representations on that issue only last year.</p> <p>  I was very interested in the comments on the "roofs overhead" policy, as the Department of Education and Skills officials in Tullamore would have described it over the last decade, in which they very much prioritised demographic factors.  It was very difficult to argue with.  A child starting school surely deserves to have a place in school, no matter where that child is living.  However, there was a consequence of that policy.  My colleagues in the ASTI have mentioned it as well.  A number of schools were left behind.  There was queue-jumping in that new communities very often availed of a new school in double-quick time, while communities that had schools in a state of disrepair had to wait.  The numbers there have decreased dramatically, let us be honest about it.  When I first got involved in the INTO executive and we went to Tullamore, we would have a list as long as our arms.  That list has become shorter.</p> <p>  The priorities for schools in the primary sector were not so much about the renovation of the schools, because there were numerous schemes until the summer works were curtailed and the devolved scheme was very useful for rural schools.  There were schemes to deal with the issue of the state of disrepair of schools.  The reason the traditional long-established schools were lagging behind was that they were not being provided with the other facilities outside of the mainstream classroom.  Children with special educational needs were going out into the rain to pre-fabricated buildings with no toilets and very poor heating, lighting and so on.  Principal teachers did not have offices because they were given over to a resource teacher.  The big problem, in a country that has done so well for decades in the sporting field, was that the vast majority of these schools had no PE halls.  There was no strategy in the last ten or 15 years to provide any previously-established school with a PE hall.  That has been a big priority for this organisation over a long time.</p> <p>  It is a very high priority for INTO to have the cuts to the pupil-teacher ratio reversed.  We have had numerous motions at our annual congress.  We actually have a target beyond even the previous pupil-teacher ratio.  Our priority reflects the promises that were made by the Government back in 2001 and 2002, which was that every child in an infant classroom in this country would be in a class of less than 20 pupils, be it rural or urban.  There were other promises made around that time as well about numbers dropping down to world-class pupil-teacher ratios at primary level.  We are lagging very far behind those.</p> <p>  We welcomed the change to the one-teacher school situation announced in the budget.  However, Ms Deirdre O'Connor gave a very stark analysis of an example of what happened to a four-teacher school.  It used to have 84 children and four teachers.  The number of pupils increased and the number of teachers was decreased to three.  We now have 28 children in those classes.  That is actually a 33% increase.  Where I work, our class sizes in south Dublin actually reduced from 28 to 27 and in some cases to 26.  In some rural schools, there is a multi-class situation of three teachers and 28 pupils per class.  It is unacceptable and is a big issue for our union and members.</p> <p>  We concur with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's aspiration of having 1 Gbps broadband in schools.  The policy of the Department of Education and Skills in recent years has been to provide 100 Mbps to post-primary schools.  We would love to have that for starters.  If we got 1 Gbps after that, it could be built on.  We have situations in some of our larger schools, which are much larger than some secondary schools, in which iPads cannot be used because the facility to run them is not there.  There is basically just enough power to run the white board and maybe a desktop computer or laptop.  Obviously, the children in Ireland will lose out badly, especially in rural areas.  In a multi-class situation, if a teacher had the facility to use iPads or other such platforms to engage one group of children in group work while delivering another curriculum to another group, the quality of learning for that period would be enhanced dramatically.  We would like 100 Mbps to begin with and hopefully 1 Gb after that.  Ms O'Connor will cover-----</p></speech>

The 100 Mbps is provided here via fibre to the cabinet.  That works in a city area.  Quite simply, it will not work in rural Ireland.  It is either the 1 Gbps or it is nothing.  It is a tactical issue.  The only way of bringing high-speed broadband to the homes of rural Ireland, if we define that as 100 Mbps or more, is to actually bring in fibre.  That means that rural Ireland could leapfrog urban Ireland.  The urban solution of 100 Mbps is not a possible one.</p></speech>

We have looked at the practicalities of that.  It arises in the context of the substitution for those teachers.  One could devise some kind of a scale but might end up with the teaching principal out of his or her classroom more often.  Our minimum demand is for a day a week.  However, that has to be accompanied by a proper arrangement for a supply panel for teachers.  What is happening at the present time in some areas is that teaching principals are not able to avail of their administrative days because of the lack of availability of substitute teachers.  It goes back to the point that was made about equality of pay for our younger teachers.  We have to make it attractive for our younger teachers, not only in terms of pay, but also in terms of working conditions.  A supply panel of substitute teachers would be of huge benefit to rural schools, small schools and schools with teaching principals.  A teaching principal would then know that he or she definitely could get a substitute for administrative days.  That is a key point.  There are technicalities to that, such as how the teaching day or week is divided up in terms of substitution and the proper resourcing of it.</p> <p>  On the points Senator Warfield made about the curriculum and broadband, schools have adopted ICT hardware.  Most schools now have access to whiteboards and to other hardware.</p><p>However, one of the big challenges for schools is the maintenance of that hardware.  There is no support for schools for maintenance or ICT support.  Teachers are well disposed to the use of ICT and broadband where it is available.  Young teachers are coming out of colleges of education with a four year BEd or even six years of training and they are well up to speed with the use of such technology and are able to deliver the curriculum.</p><p> The Vice Chairman made some points regarding the figures on teachers and the numbers in small schools.  One of the figures we examined in the context of another piece of work was the number of teacher posts that were created in the west as opposed to the east.  It is clear that the population growth in eastern and urban areas is driving up the number of teachers in those areas and leading to a lack of permanent teaching posts in western counties and a fall-off in numbers in some of those schools.  That is something we must monitor and take into account.</p><p> The resourcing of boards of management is very interesting.  One point about a multiplicity of small schools in one parish is that the parish is obliged to sustain, for example, three separate boards of management for three separate small schools.  That is, perhaps, 24 volunteers to run those schools.  The issue is how those boards of management are supported given that they are the employers of teachers and therefore need human resources, HR, support, legal support and advice relating to those areas.  There is something of a mismatch because the Department of Education and Skills says that the board must carry out certain functions and the Department cannot assist with that, particularly with regard to employment and so forth.  It is a very difficult area.  Again with regard to boards of management, the issue of parental choice has been raised.  It is important to bear in mind that 80% of primary schools enrol all comers.  That relates to Senator Warfield's point as well.  Those schools are especially schools in rural areas, which are extremely inclusive in terms of children with special educational needs, children of all faiths and none, children who have come from abroad and local children.</p><p> Those are the matters on which I wished to respond.</p></speech>

I do not have bald facts relating to the effect of the pay equality issue on teacher supply, but a survey was carried out after the first cut in 2011 in the parish of Gaoth Dobhair.  The parish of Gaoth Dobhair would have a long tradition of providing primary teachers, many of whom have achieved 515 points in their leaving certificate to get into teacher training.  That is a measure of the quality of primary and secondary education in Gaeltacht areas, but it is only one measure.  The whole-school evaluation, WSE, reports indicate that primary schools in rural areas do just as well as primary schools in towns or urban areas.</p> <p>  However, the parish of Gaoth Dobhair survey showed that quite a number of the senior football players who won Com&oacute;rtas Peile na Gaeltachta emigrated to Dubai and Abu Dhabi.  They won World Games medals recently in P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chr&oacute;caigh.  Some of their partners, friends and girlfriends also went with them and they are doing very well in Gaelic games there too.  They chose not to come to Dublin where there was a good deal of work available at the time.  They chose to go to the Middle East because they were earning &euro;36,000.  Had they remained in Ireland and had their pay remained the way it was formerly, they would have been earning more than that, so there was a very significant cut.  There is no doubt that teacher emigration has increased dramatically due to the cut to new entrant pay.</p> <p>  I am confident that there will be a full reversal of those cuts in the spring.  The three unions involved are absolutely determined to ensure there will be a full reversal of the cuts to new entrant pay.  It beggars belief that the State would invest so much money in training so many bright young people to become teachers over four or five years and then would allow them to emigrate in very large numbers.  All one need do is go to Dublin Airport just before Christmas to see the droves of young teachers returning, from the Middle East in particular, for their two week break in this country.  The issue is affecting all schools, teachers and the morale of teachers.  It is also affecting rural Ireland and its small schools.  I am glad it was mentioned and that the committee gave us time to air all of our issues.  While there are myriad issues, that issue affects every school.  It is affecting rural Ireland in a big way because if teachers from the parish of Gaoth Dobhair emigrate to the Middle East, as happened during my time in St. Patrick's College in the 1980s, there is a grave danger that those teachers will never return to this country.</p></speech>

If there was gender discrimination, we would all be up in arms.  It is age discrimination.  I believe, and I said this to groups of teachers who have appeared before the committee and particularly primary school teachers, that whatever money is available for wages and wage restoration should first be used to end that discrimination as it cannot be called anything else.  Pursuing that objective will certainly have my full support.</p></speech>

Regarding school transport, the National Parents Council position is that it must be completely overhauled, rather than tinkering with it at the edges.  There must be a more modernised system for transporting children to and from school.  Parents often have children in different schools at different age ranges with different starting and finishing times.  It becomes a logistical nightmare to try to get the children to and from school.  Then there is the amount of traffic on the roads in urban areas because there is no school transport system within the cities.  Instead of going from 8 km to 10 km or this or that mileage, there should be a complete overhaul of the school transport system.  Proper school transport infrastructure should be put in place.  It could be a mix of paid by the parents, subsidised and free, depending on the ability to pay and other factors.  However, there should be a complete overhaul of the school transport system with proper infrastructure put in place for all schools in Ireland.  That is our view on school transport.</p> <p>  On the broadband issue, everybody wants high-speed broadband in primary schools.  According to the latest figures, approximately 1,000 primary schools currently do not have access to high-speed broadband.  Even if we started today with its delivery as the highest priority in the country, we know it would not impact on many children in primary school at present because it would be too late.  In terms of digital skills strategies in schools, it is really important that we do not say those strategies will commence when the schools get their high-speed broadband.  There must be a specific strategy that deals with what those schools should be doing to develop digital skills in the absence of high-speed broadband.  We know from many European studies that children in Ireland are falling behind their European counterparts due to the fact that while they might be passive users and viewers of the Internet, they are not creating digital content at the same level as their European counterparts.  Much of that can be done without Internet access.  It is important that a digital skills strategy does not wait for one third of the schools to get up to speed to be able to engage with it but has a specific digital curriculum for the 1,000 primary schools that do not have high-speed broadband.</p> <p>  Those are the two areas I wish to highlight.</p></speech>

My colleague might have a comment to make on that but I also wish to make a few brief comments.  The ASTI would concur with the Vice Chairman regarding our appreciation of the valuable voluntary work that is done by parents, teachers and other individuals in communities throughout the country on boards of management.  It has become a far more onerous task.  The workload burden associated with it has become quite dramatic in recent years, so we concur with the Vice Chairman's view.</p> <p>  Like my colleague, I was pleased with the Vice Chairman's comments and those of Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v on the differential pay scale.</p><p>It has been a canker in the system over the last eight or ten years and is having a seriously deleterious effect on teacher morale in our sector.  The position of the ASTI is not unknown to anybody in the room so I will not delay the meeting with that.  It has serious implications for the system which could be quite major.  There is no urban-rural divide on this.  New entrants to the profession, whether rural or otherwise, are going to Dubai, England and so on.  In September there are road shows where schools come over from England and set up stall to encourage our young and brightest entrants to the profession away.  </p><p> With the forbearance of the Vice Chairman, perhaps Ms Moira Leydon will address the point made by Senator Warfield.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.854" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Moira Leydon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22016120700002#X00200"><p>We are all looking at the clock but it would be unfortunate if we did not address the issue of STEM which Senator Warfield raised.  There is good news and bad news on that.  Industry drives much of the policy for education.  We need to be quite explicit sometimes.  There is good knowledge that what drives STEM subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths - is the imagination and aesthetic appreciation.  It is implicit rather than explicit and perhaps policy needs to reflect that.  The good news is that we have an arts strategy for education.  It is being driven by the very eminent educationalist who has done us all wonderful public service over the decades, Professor John Coolahan, and is being funded by the Government.  The bad news, which is endemic, is that when a school has an art teacher, he or she is within the pupil-teacher ratio.  One of the big issues we have, which is particularly apparent in rural schools, is that there is a rigid pupil-teacher ratio.  That means that when there are a particular number of pupils, the school gets a particular number of teachers.  The evidence is very strong that art and music are slowly but surely dropping off the curriculum.  Schools have to provide 35 subjects so it has to get the teachers who teach the mainstream subjects.  It is very hard for schools to appoint teachers whose degree is primarily in art.  I am a great believer in putting forward practical proposals.  We need to be able to give concessionary allocations to schools to allow them to appoint art teachers which will allow many more students to avail of this very enriched form of education.  It will be particularly enriched with the new syllabus that is coming in.  We need to look at sharing teachers between schools, which they do very successfully in primary schools.  It is not rocket science.  We have a fantastic precedence of sharing resource and learning support teachers and we have a little bit of that at second level.  There is no reason why we could not look at models of sharing art teachers.  In a typical first-year intake in a second level school of about 120 pupils, there might be 28 doing art which will drop after junior certificate.  It is very sad, given the fantastic cultural richness in this country.  I would be very pleased to talk to the Senator afterwards.  There is good news but the allocation is killing it and we need to look at that.</p></speech>

I remind members that the Estimates are supplementary, rather than the totality.  As we are in public session, I request that all mobile phones would be switched off, as distinct from being put on silent mode.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister, Deputy Ross and his officials for attending and assisting in our consideration of the Supplementary Estimates for 2016.  I remind members that we are only considering the Supplementary Estimates and that while members may discuss issues relevant to the individual subheads they may not recommend increases or decreases in the Supplementary Estimates.  There are no votes.  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.865" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2016120700002#A00400"><p>Thank you Chairman.  I will be seeing some members again this afternoon in the D&aacute;il.  I wish to address the Supplementary Estimates today and thank the committee for the chance to present the details of the Supplementary Estimate for my Department.</p> <p>  The winter of 2015 to 2016 will be remembered as an exceptional one across Ireland, with many climate records broken and high impact weather events causing considerable disruption from flooding in particular, but also from high winds.  A succession of winter storms tracked across the country, bringing persistent and, in places, record-breaking rainfall, most notably from Storm Desmond between 4 and 6 December 2015.  In total, six storms occurred during that winter period starting with Storm Desmond and finishing with Storm Imogen.  Records were set for both monthly and seasonal rainfall accumulations widely across Ireland.  That had a severe impact on the road and rail networks.</p> <p>  In response, the Government decided in January 2016 to allocate extra severe weather funding to address the damage caused to the road and rail network.  The total funding package agreed was &euro;106.1 million, with &euro;96.1 million to be provided by the Exchequer and &euro;10 million from within the Department's existing allocations for regional and local roads.  Therefore, the amount being sought in this Supplementary Estimate is &euro;96.1 million.  The breakdown of the extra spend during 2016 was regional and local roads - &euro;80.1 million; national roads - &euro;8 million and Irish Rail - &euro;8 million.  The amounts were advised to Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in respect of national roads and to Irish Rail in respect of the rail network.</p> <p>  Regarding regional and local roads, my Department requested local authorities to submit an immediate list of proposed road repair works by 5 February 2016.  It was indicated to local authorities that funding would be allocated in two tranches, with the initial allocation facilitating local authorities to start repairs as quickly as possible and the allocation of a second tranche in May intended to allow some time for the further investigation and evaluation of proposed works, for example in relation to bridges.</p> <p>  All of the moneys under the different headings have since been spent and are in the process of being claimed through the normal end-of-year processes.  With regard to the rail network, as the Deputies will recall, many lines on the rail network were badly affected by the storms with sections on some lines closed for short periods and, in the case of parts of the western rail corridor, closed for a number of months.</p><p>The &euro;8 million in funding provided for repairs to the rail network includes funding for the following projects - repairs to railway bridges and culverts; track repairs and alignments; drainage repairs and remediation; significant coastal protection works for the rail line in Murrough, County Wicklow and dredging at Rosslare.</p><p> I would be happy to address any questions that this committee may have.</p></speech>

I can have a field day.</p> <p>  Has that additional money been spent already?  Was that the additional money agreed in January because of the storm damage etc. or is it additional funding from the Exchequer? </p></speech>

Given the deterioration of regional and local roads could the Minister not have secured a little more funding?  It will require &euro;580 per year to keep them in a steady state.</p></speech>

The allocations were made on that basis.  This was not an extra allocation to improve roads willy nilly.  It was for specific problems which arose as a result of the storms.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.880" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1333" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2016120700002#B01500"><p>I am talking about the deficit in respect of the regional and local road funding.  It was stated that &euro;580 million per year was needed to keep them in a steady state but in the overall budget the allocation is &euro;334 million.  That is far short of what is required.</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy.  Under the capital plan the moneys are due to increase.</p> <p>  I have now secured the first significant step towards restoring funding to a sustainable level in the medium term, particularly for the regional and local roads that the Deputy refers to.  The capital expenditure on the regular maintenance of local and regional roads will increase from &euro;250 million in 2016 to &euro;275 million in 2017 which is a 10% increase excluding the emergency funding provided for storm and flood damage in 2016.  </p></speech>

It will cost more in the long term.</p></speech>

We will be short of a steady state condition until then.  It is regrettable but it is not something we can resolve without more funds.</p></speech>

That was all Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, looked for and that is what it got.  I was not going to give it more than it looked for.  The capital plan will provide for the steady state situation.  This was very specific.  TII looked for &euro;8 million and that is what it got.</p></speech>

In the context of the requirement for additional funding in the event of adverse weather conditions, while I am conscious that this morning the temperature is 17 or 18 degrees and the highest risk is of the tar melting on the road, how prepared are we for any future adverse events, storms or very cold weather such as we had in 2009-2010?  Is there an emergency task force or some group that is ready to meet in such a situation?  In the event of there being serious storms or a cold snap in winter 2016-2017 would the Minister be confident of being able to secure funding similar to that secured in early 2016?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-07a.889" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2016120700002#B02400"><p>I think 40% of the money has been given for preventative measures.  The ratio is 60:40, with 60% for a response to what happened and 40% for preventative measures.  We hope that it will not repeat itself because the preventative measures will be effective and there will not be such a crisis or a need for such large funds in the future.  We cannot guarantee that, despite the weather today, because we are in a very volatile climate situation.  We do not know what will happen.</p> <p>  I have raised the issue of a contingency fund and there is no contingency fund but it is being addressed across Departments.  We in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport certainly do not have the money to suddenly find &euro;80 million or &euro;96 million or &euro;106 million.  I think &euro;10 million came from our resources for this.  This is being addressed across Departments because it affects, for example, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment and others.  I cannot predict the future but it is being addressed because it has caused very great difficulties and there is certainly no contingency fund of the size necessary to meet such a situation.  That does not mean that if there is an emergency we will not find it but it is not there at the moment.  </p></speech>
