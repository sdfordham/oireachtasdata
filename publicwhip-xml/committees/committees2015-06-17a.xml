In commencing session 1 today, we will be hearing from Mr. Tom Considine, former Secretary General, Department of Finance.  I would like to welcome everybody to the public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Today we begin a series of hearings with senior officials from the Department of Finance who had key roles during the crisis period.  At this morning's session, we will hear from Mr. Tom Considine, former Secretary General, Department of Finance.  Tom Considine joined the Department of Finance in 1974.  He was secretary general of the public service management and development section of the Department of Finance from 2002 ... or from 2000 until 2002.  Mr. Considine succeeded John Hurley as Secretary General of the Department of Finance in March 2002, a position he held until his retirement in 2006.</p><p>Mr. Considine, you're very welcome before the inquiry this morning.  Before I hear from you, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect to their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  The utmost caution should therefore be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-17a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Considine" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061700002#C00100"><p>Thank you very much, Chairman, good morning, and members of the committee.  I thank you for allowing me to make this opening statement and I'll draw on my witness statement and summarise a number of points - the international and domestic background, the system of financial regulation, fiscal policy and the risks as they were seen in 2005 and 2006.<br/><br/>In relation to the international and domestic background, by 2006 financial markets had become increasingly globalised.  They had become accustomed to readily available credit, significant product innovation, greater financial integration in the euro area, large current balance repayments in balances and lower risk premiums.  Technology had transformed the efficiency, speed and complexity of financial instruments and transactions.  This was supported by a strong belief that new modes of finance had reduced systemic risk.  Against that background, Ireland experienced an extended period of strong economic expansion, interrupted only by lower growth rates in 2001 and 2002.  Consequently, Irish expectations were high that living standards and assets ... asset prices would continue to advance.  This, in turn, was reflected in strong demand for credit in housing.  The departments statement of strategy, particularly fiscal policy, was strongly influenced by the provisions of the programme for Government published in June 2002.  The Social Partnership Agreement 2003 to 2005, entitled Sustaining Progress, also had a strong influence on fiscal policy.  Fiscal policy, incomes policy and regulation were the key policy instruments available to the Irish authorities to manage the domestic economy within the euro area.  This was recognised from the outset of our EU membership.  The Department of Finance established an internal working group to examine the implications of EU membership.  The report, entitled The Implications of EMU Membership for Various Aspects of Public Policy, was approved by the Minister of Finance for publication in October 1999 on the Department's website.  And at page 10 that report states, and I quote:<blockquote>The &ldquo;Celtic Tiger&rdquo; economy is already having a major effect on expectations in terms of income, taxation and expenditure policy and it is clear that, far from moderating, these pressures are likely to continue to grow.  In the circumstances, it will undoubtedly prove extremely difficult to persuade the social partners, interest groups and the public in general to accept a prudent fiscal stance.</blockquote>End of quote.  Being a euro area member state, the Irish Government had no function in relation to official interest rates or the euro exchange rate.  During the period 2002 to 2006 Ireland had a AAA credit rating and Irish banks were able to borrow wholesale funds at competitive rates.<br/><br/>Turning to the system of financial regulation, in October 1998 the Government agreed in principle to establish a single regulatory authority and established an implementation advisory group chaired by Mr. Michael McDowell, senior counsel.  The group reported on 19 May 1999 and recommended that the single regulatory authority, or the SRA, should be an entirely new, independent organisation.  As a member of the implementation group, I proposed an alternative model on behalf of the Department of Finance.  This model located the SRA within a restructured Central Bank and provided for increased autonomy for the regulatory function but under the direct control of the Central Bank board.  This alternative model is at appendix II of the report, page 79.  In the event the Government legislated for a model with a separate board for regulation but within an overall Central Bank and financial services authority framework.  The new model came into operation on 1 May 2003.  The Government's White Paper, Regulating Better, was published by the Department of the Taoiseach in January 2004.  It identified what the Government saw as the principles of good regulation, namely, necessity, effectiveness, proportionality, transparency, accountability and consistency.  The White Paper advised that, and I quote, &quot;The recommendations and actions in this White Paper are best seen in the context of the continuing drive for competitiveness and people's expectations of high quality public services.&quot;  <br/><br/>The 2006 annual report of the Irish Financial Regulator, at page 26, refers to its approach to regulation in the following terns, and I quote, &quot;In order to ensure that our regulatory requirements do not become a barrier to competitiveness and innovation, we apply the Better Regulation principles which the Government published in January 2004 [...] and are an active member of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Better Regulation Group.&quot;</p><p>This approach in turn appeared to be aligned to the prevailing EU and wider international belief in the economic benefits of rational self-correcting markets and the merits of financial intermediation.  </p><p> On fiscal policy, over the four years 2002-2006, each year the Department of Finance engaged with the Minister on the preparation of the budget strategy memorandum that was submitted by the Minister to the Government at mid-year.  The Government decision, based on that memorandum, formed the basis for the preparation of the spending, taxation and borrowing ... and deficit-surplus framework for the upcoming budget.  Government Departments were required to submit their spending proposals by early autumn, based on that Government decision.  The Department of Finance would also prepare an estimate of the cost of funding the existing level of public services during the following year and this would be used as a reference point in discussions with Departments-Ministers in the lead-up to the budget.  The budgets for 2003 and 2004 were difficult because, in each case, Departments were required to prepare their pre-budget expenditure figures at a level significantly below what the Department of Finance estimated it would cost to fund existing service levels during the following year.  For the 2003 budget, the required reduction was &euro;900 million and, in the case of the 2004 budget, the corresponding figure was &euro;500 million.  In the case of the 2004 budget, line Departments contended that the Department of Finance base was &euro;2.1 billion too low.  These two budgets were naturally unpopular and subject to criticism.  </p><p> When it came to preparing the 2005 budget, the political pressure to ease up on what were seen as expenditure cuts was very strong.  In addition, the pressure was more difficult to resist because the economic recovery from the 2001-2002 downturn was more firmly established.  Against that background, Government decided, on the recommendation of the Minister for Finance, that Departments should prepare their Estimates for 2005 on the basis of the Department of Finance Estimates of the cost of funding the existing level of services in 2005 and that, in addition, &euro;900 million would be provided to cover the cost of the budget day social welfare and tax changes.  In the event, the budget strategy memorandum targets were exceeded by approximately &euro;1 billion in gross terms.  The budget day tax package accounted for almost &euro;580 million and gross public expenditure accounted for the remainder of the &euro;1.9 billion.  The year-on-year increase for gross voted public expenditure was just over 9%.  </p><p> In preparation for budget 2006, the Department tabled a paper for the ministerial management advisory committee of 2 February 2005 entitled, "Draft Framework for developing the Budget Strategy Memorandum 2006-2008".  I enclosed a copy with my witness statement.  That paper recommended that the target for capital expenditure be about 5% of GNP and that gross voted current expenditure be increased by 6.6% over its 2005 level.  In the event, the 2006 budget strategy memorandum was based on an increase of about 7.5% in gross current expenditure and gross voted Exchequer capital of 4.6% of GNP.  Post-budget, the gross voted current expenditure increase was 10.9% and gross Exchequer capital was 4.7% of GNP.  From a sustainability viewpoint, gross voted current expenditure is particularly important because of the difficulty in reversing welfare, pension and pay increases once granted.  The gross 2006 cost of the budget day tax package was &euro;763 million.  </p><p> During each of the four years ending 31 December 2006, the general government was in surplus and these surpluses ranged between 0.4% of GDP in 2002 and 2.9% of GDP in 2006.  During the same period, the general government debt declined each year as a percentage of GDP from 32.2% in 2002 to 24.7% in 2006.  The European Commission recommendation on the Irish stability programme update of 22 February 2006 to the Council of Ministers stated that: "The fiscal position can be considered [as] sound and the budgetary strategy provides a good example of fiscal policies conducted in compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact."  </p><p> On taxation of housing and property, the 2005 Budget Statement delivered by the Minister for Finance in December 2004 announced that the Department of Finance and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners would undertake, in 2005, a detailed review of certain tax incentive schemes and tax exemptions in the areas of property and housing.</p><p>Arising from the review, the Minister for Finance in his 2006 Budget Statement announced a broad range of changes including the ending of a number of property based tax incentive schemes, subject to certain conditions.  The main condition was that the period during which the qualifying expenditure can be incurred was extended to end July 2008.  This extension was limited to projects that had already satisfied the terms of the particular scheme.  The Minister also introduced with effect from 1 January 2007, a new measure to limit the use of tax breaks by those with high incomes.  <br/><br/>Turning to risks, publically acknowledged in 2005,  the annual financial stability report was produced jointly by the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.  The two boards came together to approve the document.  Despite this level of co-operation, I consider that the single board structure, recommended by a minority of the McDowell group, was the best option, and in the aftermath of the crisis the Government reverted to a single board structure.  The 2005 financial stability report published on 1 November 2005 identified the primary risk to be credit growth and indebtedness levels.  This risk was placed ahead of the risk in unanticipated and sudden fall in residential property prices because of a moderation in house price growth since the 2004 report.  However, the report notes the emergence of tentative evidence that this moderation may not have persisted and goes on to state that if house prices were to accelerate this would increase the risk of a sharp correction to house prices.<br/><br/>The report went on to conclude that, &ldquo;The stability and health of the Irish banking system appears generally sound, according to the standard indicators of financial health such as asset quality, profitability, solvency, liquidity and credit ratings&rdquo;.  This view was broadly shared by the IMF and the OECD.  The IMF executive board published an assessment of the Irish financial system in August 2006.  That assessment stated, &quot;Directors welcomed the Financial System Stability Assessment Update, which finds that Ireland&rsquo;s financial sector soundness indicators are generally strong and that the major lenders have adequate buffers to cover a range of shocks.&quot;  In March 2006 the OECD economic review of Ireland had stated at page 118 that, &quot;The most likely scenario is that prices stabilise and the housing market stays flat for some years.&quot;<br/><br/>Regarding the fiscal situation, the 2006 budget material made clear that as a small open economy, Ireland was particularly vulnerable to changes in the world economic outlook.  Among the significant international and domestic downside risks highlighted was the following:<blockquote>Given the loss of competitiveness in recent years, the economy is vulnerable to any further deterioration.  In addition, the fact that the construction sector now accounts for a historically high share of economic activity and employment, implies that the economy is vulnerable to any shock affecting this sector.</blockquote>In this context, the December, 2005 ESRI Medium-Term Review, 2005-2012, included an economic assessment of a housing shock.  The ESRI stressed that the assessment was not a forecast.  For illustrative purposes, it calibrated a housing price shock with a fall in house prices of approximately one third in 2007 and with house prices only beginning to recover after 2010.  They analysed the potential impact of these major changes on the economy over the period 2007 to 2010.  The study concluded that annual housing completions would not fall much below 40,000 and GNP would fall sharply in 2007 but remain above 1%.  Unemployment is shown increasing sharply and peaking below 12% in 2009 before beginning to ease back, with the rate of wage increases falling sharply to just above zero.  Considering a scenario where the Government allowed the deficit to rise without responding, the paper concluded that the impact on the public finances would be quite large, with a peak Exchequer deficit in the range of 4.5% to 5% of GNP in 2009.However, despite the acknowledged risks, the consensus view remained that the external environment was broadly positive, with international forecasting agencies projecting continued strong growth in the world economy in 2006 and 2007.  <br/><br/>In summary, against the background of the financial stress tests and the outcome of the ESRI assessment of the fiscal impact of a severe housing shock, the available safety margins seemed to be more than adequate.</p><p>In a budgetary context, this safety margin can be summarised as follows: in 2006, the general government surplus was 2.9% of GDP and the general government debt was the second lowest in the euro area at less than 25% of GDP when the Stability and Growth Pact reference point was 60%.  Ireland had a AAA credit rating, was financing a major capital programme from current revenue, and, by end-2006, the National Pensions Reserve Fund had a balance of &euro;18.9 billion.  The then consensus view of economic commentators, including the EU commission, the IMF and OECD, was that the domestic and international economic outlook was broadly favourable.  The Government's 2006 budget had included measures designed to help ease pressure in the property market and these pressures were further eased by increasing interest rates and the requirement on banks to hold higher capital against some higher risk loans.  Measured by reference to 2006 GDP, the safety margins I have outlined above had a value of up to &euro;95 billion.  However, that safety margin and the measures taken in 2006 proved to be inadequate in the face of the crisis that reached seismic proportions in September 2008.  In this regard, I note a conclusion of the US Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission report of January 2011:<blockquote><br /><br />...the ... inconsistent handling of major financial institutions [by the US government] during the crisis - the decision to rescue Bear Stearns and then to place Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship, followed by its decision not to save Lehman Brothers and then to save AIG - increased uncertainty and panic in the market.</blockquote>We now know that Ireland did not have a sufficient safety margin in place to withstand the domestic and international pressures that emerged in September 2008.  In the event, our exposure to private sector debt and the direct and indirect impact of the property crash on the Exchequer were more than we could manage without outside assistance.  I very much regret that I did not see that as a likely outcome in June 2006 or earlier.  Thank you for your attention.  I am happy to assist the committee and to answer your questions.</p></speech>

Good morning, Mr. Considine.  Mr. Considine, you were on the board of the Central Bank of Ireland from 2002 to 2006.  Over that period, from your observations and experience, do you think that board members had the knowledge and expertise necessary to judge on the macro-financial stability matters that arose?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-17a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Considine" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061700002#F00400"><p>I would say that they had.  I mean, the ... there was a structure in place.  It wasn't, obviously, just the board members.  The Central Bank and the Financial Regulator had established a section which examined financial stability issues and brought their conclusions to the board.  And the two boards came together to decide on the content of the annual stability report.  So, I think when you look at the membership of the boards, I mean, including, say, you know, the Financial Regulator, there were people there with significant financial experience ... insurance, markets, banking, NTMA, and so on.  So ... I mean, given my experience of boards down through the years, I wouldn't say that that was an issue.  The issue was, really, how to evaluate the information that was coming.  And that information included assessments by the IMF and others and, say, in 2005, the last one I was there for ... I mean, the conclusions that were reached on that were based on the belief that a lot of the increases in Irish house prices could be explained by the rapid growth in population.  The large numbers of additional people who were on the labour force, in the previous ten years, it was something like 600 and ... if my memory tells me right, 650,000 or something like that.  And in addition to that, salaries, wages, and so on had gone up.</p><p>And there was also a fairly widespread belief that supply and demand would eventually ... would eventually balance out.  And particularly in, I think, the ... from, say, the start of the second quarter of 2005 up until after the summer break there was a general view around that the property market was coming off the boil.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-17a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061700002#G00200"><p>But there were more overall facts as well, Mr. Considine, particularly with relation to the rapid growth in the banks.  Can I quote to you from the then Governor, or at a later time Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, in the report that he did into the banking crisis, page 217:<blockquote><br /><br />A very simple warning sign used by most regulators to identify a bank exposed to increased risk is rapid balance sheet growth.  An annual real growth rate of 20 per cent is often taken as the trigger. ... So this was a very obvious and public danger sign not only for these two banks, but because of the potentially destabilising effect of reckless competition on the entire sector.  </blockquote>Now at previous hearings, Mr. Considine, we don't need to rehearse it again tonight, but we showed the figures, in the time that you were on the Central Bank board, for Anglo Irish Bank, for Allied Irish Bank and for Bank of Ireland, of astonishing rates of lending, astonishing rates, and astonishing increases in profits.  And we had evidence from Mr. Bill Black, a famed US former regulator and bank expert, that growth of this type means that the alarm bells should be ringing for regulators, for people like yourselves who are supervising the whole system.  Why weren't there alarm bells ringing in your head and in the board at that time?</p></speech>

The financial stability reports do recognise these risks.  The problem, with the benefit of hindsight, is that the evaluations that were done didn't suggest that the outcome could be anything like what was ... what was ... what eventually happened.  If you read the financial stability report, say of 2005, I mean, the risks are set out.  I referred to them in my opening statement.  But the judgment that was arrived at really was that these could be explained to a great extent by what was happening in the real economy.

You must have been aware, for example, of the Scandinavian banking crisis in the 80s and into the 90s, based on speculation, property, and massive over-lending by the banks.  Would that not have caused you, and indeed other board members, to fear and to understand indeed, that the same could happen here?</p></speech>

And they modelled at the time a crash of a third in the Irish housing market.  The problem is that the results of it, it ... even if it happened, and it wasn't expected, it wasn't a forecast, it was a modelling exercise, even if it happened it didn't seem to threaten the stability of the Irish financial system.  And the reason for that was that there seemed to be so many buffers in the system; we had a big surplus; we had low debt; we had a pension reserve fund; and we were funding our capital budget from current revenue.  And people like the EU were saying, "This is a model of how you should manage your public finances."  So I know with the benefit of hindsight I've no problem, that ... that is not what happened.</p></speech>

I never remember a time when there weren't voices threatening, you know, or listing out risks and we listed them out as well.  The Minister for Finance in particular, in the run-up to the 2006 budget repeatedly - and in the budget material itself - stressed the risks but, at the end of the day, you have to come to a conclusion.  And the conclusion that was arrived at was that the system had sufficient buffers in it to cater for any likely shock.  Now that has turned out to be wrong but I heard, at one of your sessions here last week, somebody saying this was ... one-in-a-hundred-year event.  But, whether it was or it wasn't, it was certainly a very unusual occurrence and, I suppose, that ... the only thing I can say to you is I didn't see that as ... as the likely outcome.</p></speech>

I, just to be clear, I'm not disputing that.  If we had had, you know, greater buffers in our system, say, just for argument's sake, twice as much as we had, we would have been able to withstand this, so, I'm  not saying that we're not responsible for what happened to us, but the trigger for it ... the trigger, what set it off, is all I'm saying, came from outside.</p></speech>

And, if you look at, say, the 2003 Act that set up the regulator, you would see in that there are clear structures set in place, functions assigned to the board of the regulator, their strategy statement required to be submitted to the Minister, laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, performance reports and so on - the same thing.  So that was ... that was how we operated.  We are a small country and we ... one of the difficulties that we had down through the years in finance, was retaining people with financial expertise and, essentially, that's why the NTMA was set up in 1990.  We couldn't keep people in the Department because the wages that we were paying were so much below ... what was paid-----</p></speech>

John Hurley was Governor of the Central Bank in your time, yes?  In his opening statement, on page 12, he said, and I quote, &quot;I was not aware of contrarian views within the Central Bank, which differed in substance from the Bank's overall assessment&quot; and again said &quot;Views, which set out a different risk assessment, were not made known to me or to the Board in my presence.&quot;.  Now, Mr. Tom O'Connell, who was head of economics and research within the Central Bank from 2005 to 2010, in his evidence, page 3, said, and I quote:<blockquote><br /><br />While the Central Bank in its public utterances presented a low-key assessment of what was happening, that is not to say that it was not fully aware of the major excesses ... Patrick Honohan&rsquo;s report acknowledged that the three major excesses were well recognised in the [financial stability reports]; [that's] the huge increase in bank lending ... concentration ... [on] property ... and the ... reliance by the banks on potentially volatile wholesale funding ...</blockquote></p><p>Mr. O'Connell then says, &quot;In fact, I should say that one member of the board did have grave doubts, to the effect that I can recollect his words still ringing in my ear, &quot;It was all a house of cards and would all end in tears&quot;.&quot;  However, his views appear not to have had any impact on policy-making in the bank&quot;.  And Mr. Honohan said again in page 10 of his report, &quot;More generally, a rather defensive approach was adopted to external critics or contrarians&quot;.  And finally on the same subject, Mr. Considine, the Nyberg report in its executive summary said as follows:<blockquote><br /><br />A minority of people indicated that contrarian views were both difficult to maintain during the long boom and unhealthy to present to boards or superiors.  A number of people stated that had they  implemented and consistently supported contrarian policies, they may ultimately have lost their jobs, positions or reputations.  Other signs were also noted pointing to sanctioning diverging or contrarian opinions as well as self-censorship because of this.</blockquote>Now, can I ask you starting in the Central Bank first, were you aware of people who had an opposite view to what was generally accepted in relation to the credit growth, the property speculation, etc.?</p></speech>

I don't remember any such views being expressed to the board but I think there is an issue around house ... there is an issue around asset pricing.

And then, Mr. Considine, within your own Department ... in recent years, newspaper reports emerged that there were a number of people who had a very seriously different approach and were attempting to raise red flags about a property crash, for example, housing crash, etc., in the middle of the 2000s.

And I see in the core papers there, there's position notes developed for MAC meetings and they would have been discussed, but the bottom line really is somebody has to arrive at a conclusion at the end and when there's a meeting to discuss an issue, if you don't manage to persuade your colleagues of your position, then it won't be adopted but, you know, there is nothing unusual about that.  And there was no issue about trying to stymie these comments or in any way close them down.</p></speech>

One of the things I used to do as Secretary General was to read all the replies to PQs, every single one of them, to make sure that they weren't representing the views of the Department differently to what the Minister and the Department had decided.

Move on again so Mr. Considine.  The Regling and Watson and indeed many other reports and individuals highlighted the overexposure of banks to commercial property, including land and development sites.  Was your Department aware of the risks as they emerged or as that ... the speculation and so forth intensifies and were any steps taken in relation to that?</p></speech>

The first one is I suppose in so far as fiscal policy was concerned and in my opening statement and in my witness statement I outlined the measures that were taken in 2005 and in the ... for the 2006 budget to phase out a whole range of, you know, of supports for the property sector.  So that's, that's one, one thing.  The other thing then is in relation to individual banks.  Now the regulation of individual banks was at arm's length from the Department of Finance and I mentioned that in my witness statement.  One of the ... one of the results of the new arrangement, if you like, the two-board structure, was the Department of Finance didn't have any representative on the board of the Financial Regulator.  So we would have been at, at arm's length from the actual regulation of individual banks.</p></speech>

We received about 350 pre-budget submissions and if you actually count them, you know, that's not counting duplicates.  If you count duplicates we received about 1,000 or 1,200.  We count them now for FOI and that's what the figure was last year I'm told.  So some of the bigger representative ... it's a standard thing for representative bodies to make submissions, pre-budget submissions and some of the bigger ones, at least, will look to see the Minister and they will meet the Minister most of the time, I would say.  And others might meet the head of the division, the taxation division or whatever.  But this ... all this material is fed into the system ... that ... that produces the tax, the finance Bill.</p></speech>

We know, by common consent, there was massive speculation in building land, which hugely drove up the price of homes, etc., for ordinary people.  Who do you think came out best?  Who was "favoured most" to use the language there, Mr. Considine, by Government policy - the landowners and those who speculated with land or the more disadvantaged members of the community - during that whole period of the bubble?</p></speech>

I mean, basically, at the end of the day, I mean ... these pre-budget ... this is almost an industry, you know, submitting pre-budget submissions and what you expect these people to do is what... a term they use in financial markets is to "talk their book".  I mean, you know what else would they say?  But, like, this is only part of the policy making, you know, input and people are entitled to say whatever it is that they feel, you know, is ... represents the views of their sector and, you know, whatever decisions are made, at the end of the day, is a matter for the democratic system and whoever gets elected by the people decide whether to, you know, go along with this submission as opposed to this other one, or whatever.

I think what she was talking about was in terms of lending and the impact it had on the banking crisis.  There's two sides to the balance sheet obviously.  One, on the funding side, if you decided in the middle of 2006, you woke up some day ... some morning, and decided that you wanted to take measures to insulate the banks from a possible shock, you could have raised extra capital, you could have lent the maturity of your ... of your wholesale funding and so on.  So there was quite a lot that could be done.  If you look at the core documents that are here in ... given for this session, one of them shows the amount of mortgages that were issued each year.  2007 was the biggest year ... second biggest year, in that table.</p></speech>

Every other year it cost more.  But I'd like to stress though, that what happened was, and this is a very important point, that that advice was actually signed off by the Minister for Finance.  So, what happened was, in the autumn when the horse trading took place between the Department of Finance, the Minister for Finance and other Departments and Ministers, then it wasn't possible to hold the line.  The political pressure to spend, to give extra tax relief, and so on, was too strong and-----</p></speech>

I'm sure you believe that you need extra resources and if you take, say, in 2000 ... in my witness statement there and in my opening statement, we had huge problems in 2003 and 2004 because we cut back &euro;900 million in 2003 and &euro;500 million in 2004 from the cost of paying for the existing level of service the following year.  Now, when it came to the 2005 budget, because the economy ... we were able to do it in 2003 and 2004 because the economy had turned down, but when we came to 2005, the political pressure to ease up on this was enormous.</p></speech>

That is exactly what the Government does every ... or did anyway when I was there every year at the middle of the year.  And if ... I took some trouble in my witness statement to show how that evolved in 2005 for the 2006 budget.  We actually started in February of 2005 looking at how we should frame the 2006 budget and we anchored it on competitiveness, the competitiveness of the economy, and the challenges that we saw down the road.  We had ... in 2003, we had a working group, which was well supported by economic talent, that looked at what were the consequences up to 2050 of the emerging trends in public expenditure.</p></speech>

Just explain what happens there.  Is it another sort of horse trading?</p></speech>

In the start of the year, the Department does out its work and prepares its advice and, by and large, the Ministers for Finance bought into that.  If you take 2006, for example, the paper that we produced in February recommended a 6.6% increase in gross public expenditure.  The figure that went to the Government for approval in June or July was 7.5%; it's not a million miles away from it right.  But the problem arises then.  The government decides that ... they sit down the way you are saying around the table and they decide that, but when the rubber hits the road and you come back in the autumn and health says,  "Well, you know,  we can't live with that.  We need to do X, Y and Z."  One example might be, in 2003, the Government decided it had to do something about controlling public sector numbers.  It took a decision that it was going to stabilise them, I think, and cut them by 5,000 over the following three years.  Now the Civil Service actually delivered on that because we were in a position to actually exert enough influence but political pressure caused numbers in health, education and elsewhere to keep on going.</p></speech>

No, we weren't successful in ... we weren't successful in either ... most of the time, apart from 2003 and 2004, you know, we weren't successful most of the time in making our advice stick.  Now, people have said if we had presented it differently or whatever and look, I'm not going to argue with that.  You can always present things differently.  But to be quite honest, and I'm sure you want the facts here, it's a political system.  We are operating in a political system.  I have worked in commercial operations; they're totally different.  You know, this is a political system and, you, know advisers are there to advise, politicians are there to make decisions and that's where it ends up.  Now you can always criticise us for saying if we had provided the advice, if we had shouted louder or something, but you know, you can't ignore the fact that that's how it works.<br/><br/><b>Senator Susan O'Keeffe:</b>You were on the McDowell group that reached the decision about the new Financial Regulator.  The decision was that there would be ... that the Financial Regulator would be separate from the bank.  That was what they were asked to look at that and that's what they came back with.  And I'm asking, do you think ... that's not what happened in the end, of course.  Do you think that the governance structure that was put in place for the Central Bank and Financial Regulator was effective and appropriate, the one that emerged?</p></speech>

And one of the key things when a crisis comes around really is that you need to have all the people moving quickly, very quickly.  And also I had experience.  Prior to that, there was an awful lot of trouble because the Central Bank, because of ... you're familiar here with 33AK.  Well, there was a version of that before 33AK came in and it made it very difficult for the Central Bank to pass information about, say, a wrongdoing that came into its possession, say, to the consumer director at the time, who was ... it was separate, right.  So what I wanted to do really was to keep them under control of the same board so that we could get rid of these issues and you couldn't have people coming up and saying: "Well, I knew about that but because of the law, I could not do anything about it".

And, in March 2006, the management advisory committee agreed to recruit another ten.  I assume ...

In addition to that, we felt that there was a need to strengthen analysis, not just in the Department but throughout the public service, and we launched a programme allowing suitably qualified assistant principal officers to do a two-years master's in policy analysis and generally we stepped up our support for policy analysis all over the place; you know, five-day programmes, diplomas, that kind of thing.

I mean, in my view, it's the constant challenge to keep up.  It has never been different.  As I started to say to  Deputy Higgins, back in 1990 that was the reason the NTMA was set up, because you couldn't keep people from the financial sector in the Department of Finance and, by ring-fencing it, you know, you could pay the going rate, or whatever.  So that ... you know, it was a challenge but it was a challenge though that, you know, it was worth dealing with and I felt, you know, that if we kept doing what we were doing, which was bringing in and targeting, you know, the particular skills that we needed, that that would build up  But one of the things that happened, you see, was because we were part of a wider Civil Service promotion system, all these bright people ended up departing pretty quickly, so that was ... you know, that's a problem.</p></speech>

Because, arguably, people would've said the Department of Finance was more powerful at the end of the 20th century than it was in the beginning ... or in the middle of the 21st century, in the decade that we had, or would you have any comment to make?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-17a.145" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Considine" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061700002#O02000"><p>Well, I think, as a general rule, it's much easier for the Department of Finance to operate in fiscal policy - and by that I mean expenditure and taxation - when money is in short supply.  If ... to put it crudely, if you don't have it, it's a good excuse.  When there's a perception ... and, you know, the two things I think that made a big difference were the programmes for Government and how they became increasingly more ... more detailed.  Like, for example, I think the 2002 programme had ... had a provision in it that old age pensions would be increased to at least &euro;200 a week - at least.  Now, not that I have any judgment to make about what old age pensions should be but, in the political world, if you see a statement like that, what it tends to signal to people is "Well, we have at least 200, so what ... what more can ... can be delivered?"  So, the way programmes for Government and the agreements with the unions worked, once they were there they had their own structure for monitoring were they being implemented.  So, the ... I mean, it wouldn't have been just, say, civil servants but I think some backbench Deputies might have felt as well that this was a major driving force and Wright, I think, mentions that in his report fairly clearly.  So, in that sense, like, you were centralising power not so much in the Taoiseach's Department or, you know, anywhere.  They did have a role because of their role in the social partnership agreement but it was more to do with, you know, how programmes for Government and the agreements with the unions actually drove things.</p></speech>

Did the presence of it in Ireland change the attitude to finance, to regulation, to competitiveness?</p></speech>

In my mind, like, there was no issue there between that and regulation, you know, sound ... in fact, I would have the view that if you engaged in sort of dangerous regulatory practices that you would probably suffer in terms of, you know, your business, as opposed to anything else.  But, listening to some of the people that gave evidence to this committee, I could see that, down the line, that message may ... you know, it may have come across differently.  There's always that risk that, you know, you ... you give out a message and the people who are giving it out maybe understand it, hopefully, but when it gets translated down several steps ... I heard what they said and I have no reason to believe that it's not right.</p></speech>

Did you see that those would suddenly develop, that all sorts of buildings would arise, in all parts, particularly in rural Ireland?  Did you ... did you actually translate that into what would happen or did you see it simply as a piece of financial, you know, construct that you needed to deal with or to advise on?</p></speech>

I did see, you know ... and the problem with tax reliefs really again, in a political system, is ... and particularly when you have area-based tax reliefs, originally they tend to get introduced for some specific reason which kind of makes sense but very quickly then demands start to come in, like, "Well, we should have some as well" and so on, so they can get out of hand.  And, I suppose, when you look at those tax reliefs, I mean, they should have been phased out earlier.  But I have to say that the reason for that was there was a great nervousness about doing this.  Back in 2000, you know, the Bacon reports and so on, when they moved to make purchasing property less attractive to the buy-to-let people, and they saw the consequences of it in terms of higher rents and all that, it made everyone in the whole system - in fact, I reviewed those papers - it made them very nervous about touching the property market and it wasn't until, you know, 2004 that ... you know, that we actually set about ... and there was a good job done on it then but, I think, obviously with the benefit of hindsight, it should have happened a lot earlier.</p></speech>

Mr. Considine, if ... just locate something for a moment and just familiarise myself.  From the period of 2002 to 2006, you were both the general secretary of the Department of Finance and you were also an <i>ex officio </i>member of the Central Bank.  Yes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-17a.152" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Considine" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061700002#P00300"><p>That's correct.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-17a.153" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/990" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Lynch" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061700002#P00400"><p>So those two roles are held concurrently, those two senior positions.  Okay.  Sorry, so after 2004, the IMF, the OECD and the ECOFIN all clearly recommended a tighter fiscal stance and a building up of a cushion for the time when income from property-related transactions would fall.  That was a consistent message coming from those very, very senior observers.  And, in fact, in the Regling and Watson report looking back upon that period, it talks about one of the difficulties ... it's on ... I won't take you through the reference documents, as such.  What's relevant to you, Mr. Considine, I'll bring up on the screen.  But, in page 43 of Regling and Watson, it talks about the light-touch approach to provision has been discredited, it sent wrong signals to banks and left supervisors poorly informed about banks, management and governance and potentially impairing crisis driven response capacity also, which is the type of cushion type of things we would be looking at.</p><p>So I just want to go on now Mr. ... and I'll bring up on the screen, it's related to pre-budget letters from the Central bank in around the period 2004.  And this is a narrative document and I just want to take you through two sections of the pages in front of you.  The first one is the pre-budget letters to budget 2004 and if you look at the italics section there it says:<blockquote>Fiscal policy could also play a role in smoothing the adjustment of demand for property by limiting its more speculative components.  In this regard, it would seem more appropriate, for example, to allow no further extensions to the termination date of mid-2006 for a range of tax driven incentive schemes for housing.</blockquote>So there's an early flag up in 2004 there, that something should be done with regards to the tax incentivisation for the property market.  Down at the end of the page then, it says in the second last bullet: &quot;After the budget was announced, the board discussed the budget outcome and it was noted that the advice from the Governor was not fully adhered to.&quot; ... adhered to.  I might come back to that in a moment.  So, this is a board that your sitting on.  Would you have been privy to these documents in your role as the general secretary the Department of Finance and in your role on the board?  Would you have been familiar with these devices and these documents at that time?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-17a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/990" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Lynch" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061700002#P00600"><p>Okay.  So we'll go on a small bit more then.  And its ... the next document is a pre letter in 2006 and there's a box here.   If you look at the section ... the mid-section in the box it says: "Another indicator that house prices are becoming overvalued is that, based upon a debt service threshold of 40% of disposable income, an increase in proportion and potential buyers are being priced out of the market."  So this is 2006, house prices are still going up.  2004, there's discussions with regard to tax relief being a difficulty.  In 2004, there is commentary with regard to the Governor's advice not being adhered to and so on.  Then I'll just ... to finally to go on to the Honohan report, and that'll come up on your screen there, where he makes a general commentary on the annual pre-budget letters ... these are the sort of documents that I just discussing a moment ago.  And if you look at 7.8 and take it from the second sentence in, it says: "These letters regularly highlighted the issue of house price inflation and the size of the construction sector, particularly in the letters of 30 September 2004."  This is well before 2006.  It's a year into your tenure as the ... as the general secretary of the Department of Finance. "The level of house prices, along with continuing high rates of increase in prices, posed macroeconomic as well as financial stability risks" - stability being a responsibility of the Central Bank, regulatory being an issue of the regulator, but you're on the board of the Central Bank and stability is an issue concerning your responsibility. "There remains a risk, however, that in the current state of housing output is on some estimates very much higher, not far off twice."  And this goes back to your earlier statement this morning that ... about housing supply and demand, there's a very, very strong indication here that demand is less than 50% of actually supply ... that there's an oversupply of a very, very high capacity.  So, not far off twice the underlying demand for property.  Then the very, very final statement I'll take it ... its the last line on that page and continues into the next page: "In this regard, it would seem appropriate, for example, to allow no further extensions to the termination date of mid-2006 for the range of tax driven incentive schemes for housing."  So what we have in the earlier testimony there is back as far as 2003, there is discussion with regard to doing something about the tax incentivisation in the property sector.  And here we are out in 2006 and it's still being discussed.  Could you explain to us this morning, Mr. Considine, why was the Central Bank's recommendations to the Minister not more forcibly alert to the issue, given that you would have been, maybe, conceived as being the middle man between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank?</p></speech>

The Governor would have written the letter and he would have come and spoken to the Minister himself.  So the advice was there and it was clear.  Now one of the ... the 2007 budget, I wasn't there for the second half-----</p></speech>

I'm talking specifically about your term.  In 2003, there are significant concerns about where the economy is going.  There's significant concerns about the, the inflation that's in property and there's concerns with regard to the taxation measures and how it is effecting the property market.  And as Deputy Higgins was referring to earlier, there is an adverse effect to that.  While there might be greater profits being made upon the purchasing of homes, the cost of them are increasing significantly and having an adverse effect upon purchasers.  So, what I'm kind of trying to drill down to is can you explain why no action was taken by the Central Bank board up until 2006 to start cooling house price measures?  Why wasn't that happening?</p></speech>

Following the ... Bacon did three reports, and the net effect, I think of ... you know, I'm just talking now from my memory what, what ... the main things that were done was people who bought buy-to-let properties were not allowed to offset the interest against their income and stamp duty was put up for buy-to-lets to 9% at max, I think.  Now, the effect of that actually was to create a scarcity of rental properties and rent started rising.  At the same time, you had the bursting of the dotcom bubble.  And for about three months, house prices actually fell and I'm referencing that to the Permanent TSB house price index, right?  They fell both for new houses and for second-hand houses.  So, the lesson that people learned from that and I think they over-learned it, including myself, was that ... it was you needed to be extremely careful when you were interfering in the property market; you need to be clear.  So-----</p></speech>

And I think that had a sobering influence.  But when it came to 2004, that explains, to some extent, the great care that was taken in actually phasing these out, and the fact that they brought in Indecon and Goodbodys to actually evaluate each of them.</p></speech>

I'll bring in Deputy O'Donnell then, Mr. Considine.  If the tax incentivisations that were being discussed in 2003 in letters coming in from the Central Bank to the Department of Finance and obviously to feed on to the Minister of Finance for that year's budget, starting in 2003, our evidence will show that there was serious concerns with regard to tax incentivisations and that those difficulties and concerns were still there by 2006.  If action had been taken earlier to deal with the tax incentivisations and to bring an end to them, would it have cooled the property market and would it have lessened the level of exposure of risk to this country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-17a.194" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Considine" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061700002#Q01900"><p>I think, as a general statement, the answer to that is, "Yes".  But I think the property market is a lot more nuanced than people give it credit for.  If, for example, you have a scheme in place, just for argument's sake, which gives, say, 50% allowance for spending done in a particular period, if you actually come along and say, "We're going to end this now," one of the effects that happens is there's a rush to hire labour and get the job done within the period that will allow them to claim.  So you have to be careful.  And that's why when it came to 2000, to the Indecon and Goodbody thing, that you had the phasing out.  There was a great fear that you do more harm than good if you just said, "It's all going to end now."</p></speech>

Thank you.  Mr. Considine, during your tenure as Secretary General, what was the role of the Department of Finance in overseeing the Financial Regulator and was that ... was this role restricted to legislative issues related to the implementation of the new regulatory system or did it expand beyond this?  I suppose, in simple terms, what was the role and, for instance, what was your role with the IFSC?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-17a.203" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Considine" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061700002#Q02800"><p>The IFSC was part of ... we would have seen it ... two dimensions to it.  It was part of the economy and, as such, we would have been anxious to develop it, make it a significant contributor to employment and growth.  That's ... now, side by side with that, we would have certainly seen that an essential element of that was sound regulation, because if we got a bad name of, you know, running the thing loosely, it couldn't but do us harm.  So that's the way we looked at it.</p> <p>  Now, when it comes to legislation and the Financial Regulator, the legislation is actually very specific.  If you take, you know, the specific ... I saw Mr. Patterson giving evidence there, and the actual format of the strategy was set out in legislation.  So it wasn't just, you know, that the legislation didn't just say, "You should produce a strategy statement," the legislation said, "You should produce a strategy statement with A, B, C, D and E in it."  And our job was to make sure that that was done.  The next thing that happened was that that strategy statement had to be submitted to the Minister and then placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas, and it was open to scrutiny.  I don't know to what extent that happened, but I know they were up before some committees.  Then following that then there was a requirement for an annual report.  And the same thing happened there.  They were required to report on what was in the strategy statement and that, again, went to the Minister.</p></speech>

And I think there is more or less universal agreement that there was no ... certainly during my time, I never remember anybody being refused extra staff.  There was a problem all right in recruiting staff, and that goes back to what I was talking to Senator O'Keeffe about.</p></speech>

Our function was mainly around who was going to pay for it, right.  And initially, as I recall it, 50% was levied on the industry and 50% came from the internal resources of the Central Bank.  Originally, I think the McDowell group recommended that the industry should pay the whole lot.  And, obviously, you can make a case for that.</p></speech>

So, when we came in to preparing the 2005 budget then, the economy had picked up and the case, it became increasingly difficult to actually keep the, the same pressure on.

For example, you could attach conditions to a licence, there were a number of things you could do.</p></speech>

First of all they were only guidelines from the regulator, that's the first thing.  The second thing was the introduction of Basel II effectively took a different approach to this by requiring capital as a solution to these sort of things but, you know, the Department was well at arm's length away from, you know, individual-----</p></speech>

On page 23 of the Wright report, "the public and policy makers were insufficiently sensitive to the effects of extraordinarily expansive monetary conditions at the time, and to the fact that fiscal policy was the key potential counterbalance to this pressure".

I think the Department of Finance through the public service side of it, was the employer, if you like, in those talks ... for the public service, so that's the first thing.  I think in some other report, it notes there, I forget where it is now but, that essentially, the unions and the private sector representatives tended to dominate the, you know, the settlement, and then it was applied to the public service, sometimes with pay pauses of six months or whatever, but the idea that we didn't ... I mean, the document I submitted with my witness statement, I mean, clearly shows that we were anchoring the advice we gave on competitiveness, it was a big issue, and also on the, if you like, the upcoming calls on the Exchequer over a long period out till 2050 so I don't know whether he had sight of these, I don't know that, and we would have submitted those to the Government and then say, you know ... and absolutely fed in; there were four principal officers from expenditure division on the one that reported in 2003.</p></speech>

Now, that doesn't mean that we didn't know about it.  Obviously, we got the letters and I was on the board of the Central Bank so I, you know ... but, you know, I'm not going to say there couldn't have been a better presentation of this. </p></speech>

It started in February.  The Department set out its stall ... said, you know, "This is the way we think budgets should be determined for this country: they should be anchored on competitiveness; they should take account of the things that we can see down the road".  On that basis, we think gross public ... gross current expenditure should increase by 6.6.%.  In the event, the memorandum that went to the Government had a 7.5% figure which isn't, you know, unreasonable.  It's from there on in the autumn, engaging with the other Departments, it wasn't possible to hold that line.</p></speech>

You answered a question earlier on from Senator O'Keeffe about staffing numbers and skills and experience within the Department and you made reference to efforts that were made around 2006 to enhance them.  Can you answer the same question but about the earlier period of your tenure, 2002 to, say, 2005, what efforts were made to improve staffing levels, resources, expertise?</p></speech>

Well, first of all, I think the legislation was kind of ... it was ... it was ... it wasn't very modern.  So, we actually modernised the legislation and when we had the modern legislation, we moved to target the particular skills that would fit within the Department of Finance and those people, which was very unusual ... we brought in eight people at the same time in the first quarter of 2006.  I'd a belief that, you know, they would feed off each other and they would be good for, you know, the ... the Department.  In March 2006 we decided to hire another ten.  Prior to that, we did a lot to strengthen ... there used to be a system in the Civil Service where people were trained as analysts and back, I think it was in 2003, we relaunched that and invited applications for suitably qualified assistant principals to do a two-years course in analysis.  At the same time, we also had diplomas and other analytical courses.  So ... and also coming out of the ... I forget which ... which union agreement it was, we got agreement from the unions that where someone left the public service at, say, at a non-recruitment grade, that we could replace them by open competition ... advertise on the market.  So ... and as part of that agreement, we also launched a special competition for people with IT skills.  So, I mean, I don't quarrel with Wright, that there was a constant issue around trying to keep the skills up to the level that were needed.</p></speech>

I accept  ... I accept in one sense, like, I mean if you take VAT, which would be one of those big taxes, you can't easily, you know, sort of, distinguish between what happens in the property sector and other sectors.  And as I said to the Chairman earlier, once you get into a position where a property market is overheating, it's very difficult.  I mean, the obvious thing to say - and it's not a smart comment - is "You shouldn't have allowed it to overheat in the first place".  I mean, that is the criticism, if you like.  Once you're in there, it's very difficult because if you cut stamp duty, for example, I mean there's no doubt what you'll do is just drive the market harder and, equally, if it was possible to cut VAT, it would have the same effect.  So, once you're in there, it's very hard to get back out of it.  Now ... you know, you could argue ... someone could say "Well, you could have offset that by public expenditure cuts" but I think I'm just after demonstrating that we were doing as much public expenditure cuts as we could in 2003 and 2004 anyway.</p></speech>

So, while large budget surpluses were being reported, in fact, when you stripped out the cyclical element of much of that tax revenue, there were underlying deficits.  Do you now accept that?</p></speech>

The reason that sticks in my mind is because I had to answer to that ... for that to another committee, the public accounts committee at the time.  So the ... that experience was repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>in advice.  I mean, there was a recognition that if ... if things went wrong that ... that you would be hit but, as is demonstrated by the exercise done by the ESRI and so on, the problem is it wasn't seen to be anything like what happened and, viewed against the buffers that I listed out at the start, it wasn't seen to be something that couldn't be handled.</p></speech>

And during your years as Secretary General of the Department, there was a dramatic acceleration in the dependence on cyclical taxes to such an extent that it increased to 30% in 2006.  So 30% of all taxation revenue was deemed to be cyclical in nature and dependent on, essentially, temporary factors which, ultimately, fizzled away.</p></speech>

I mean corporation tax ... what ... you know ... what ... how can that be, you know, it is cyclical but I mean, what can you do about it?  I mean we have a ... we have a national policy in relation to our corporation tax rate.</p></speech>

If ... if you were to narrow the definition to include taxes arising from property then I would agree that that's the case.  But what I would say to you is that by the time you get to 2003 or 2004, the scope for actually moving off that situation that you found yourself in is quite limited.  And once you get ... once you get into a situation where the property market is overheating, then almost anything you do to cut taxes will have the opposite effect of what you ... what you would like.  In other words, it would stimulate the market as opposed to ... to dampen it down.</p></speech>

And if we take the example that you went into some detail on, 2006 ... in the February 2005 paper the draft framework for developing the budget strategy memo '06 to '08, that basically set out an expenditure growth in 2006 of 6.6%.  Then by June, there was a budget strategy memo, which was based on the Department's advice and was accepted by the Minister, and that pencilled in growth of about 7.5%.  And then in the ... in the budget, the increase was closer to 11%.  So, okay, in February, the Department recommended 6.6%; in June, the Department was satisfied with 7.5%; but can you advise between June and the first week of December when all of this horse trading is going on between Ministers and Department officials, what role did the Department of Finance play in October, in November prior to the budget?  Did the Department of Finance say, ''We reiterate our position that the growth in expenditure should be no more than 6 or 7%''?</p></speech>

One  of the issues would be - and, you know, it was modelled by the ESRI, I think, in 2004 as well - if the output of housing, for example fell from, you know, whatever it was, - 80,000 - 90,000 maybe to 40,000 - what would be the impact and what could the Government do to replace that in the economy?  And there is a paper - I think it's in the core documents somewhere - that was done in relation to that.  In relation to the taxation which you're asking, I mean, the work that I was talking about there was more or less the ... when the tax take fell sharply in 2001 and 2002, the work was concerned about understanding why that happened, could we improve the forecasting methods and that kind of stuff, rather than replacing the taxes.</p></speech>

When the bailout programme was entered and taking the banking collapse out of that period, there was a structural deficit of approximately &euro;30 billion regardless of bank debt - approximately &euro;30 billion.  When were the seeds of that deficit sown?</p></speech>

And, essentially, at the outset of that, it says that Government spending was falling up to ... "General Government expenditure as a percentage of GNP in Ireland was on a downward trend from 1997 to 2000 ... The total fall in the period was 5 percentage points.  There was a 4 percentage points increase over the two years 2001 and 2002."  Now, that was in the context of the dotcom bubble and there was a lot of controversy about it but that ... the response to that, if you like, was a major step change from the direction it was going.</p></speech>

The ... a continuous theme coming up in some of the testimony today is that the crisis isn't happening when the crisis ... when the house is on fire, the crisis is happening when there is something else happening earlier in the timeline.  And you're indicating that the timeline in and around 2003 onwards was where the seeds -  and I need you to clarify this - is where the seeds for the ultimate structural deficit of &euro;30 billion in the Irish economy, separate from the banking debt that actually was there at the time as well and which ultimately led Ireland going into a bailout programme ... are you saying that that ... that the structural aspect of Ireland's requirement to go into a bailout programme, that the seeds were set during that period?</p></speech>

I mean the diagram speaks for itself.  I mean ... but, in reading it you have to take into account both the domestic and international background.  So, I'll say, if you look at 2001 and, in particular there ... I mean, that was, you know, associated with a big downturn in the international economy and, you know, so, it doesn't happen in isolation.  If you then take the years 2003-2004, as a consequence of, you know, what had happened previously, there was a greater buy-in to trying to, you know, get things back on track.  And you can see there that the advice given by the Minister for Finance, in the middle of the year, stuck to a much greater extent than it virtually did any other time, except with the exception of 2008 there, I'd say.  So ... and I have explained I think, already, that in the case of 2005, the pressures were building up in the system, a bit like a pressure cooker.  And the ability of the political system to hold the line when the economy is seen to be improving ... see, the ... the argument for ... for holding back was a weaker economy in 2003 and 2004, but that was gone by ... by-----</p></speech>

I mean, some people say, in particular that, you know, at the end of 2005, you know, it should have been clear that some kind of action should be taken.  Now, the ... in the ... the middle two quarters of 2005, that's from April to September, say, there was a general view that the housing market was coming off the top.  But, as ... and you can see that reflected in the actual stability report.  But, once the fourth quarter began, doubts began to emerge about that.  And I've seen that repeated in ... in different papers from different organisations.  So, when it came to producing the 2005 stability report the view was that the growth in population, the huge numbers additional at work, the rise in the prosperity of the country, and so on, explained an awful lot of the increase in property prices.  That is, you know, that is, I think, the reason why, you know, there was an acceptance that a soft landing ... Now, if you go to the OECD report which went into this in great depth, it was done in March 2006, and they are one of the few people actually who defined what a soft landing is and they say quite clearly that the most likely thing to happen is that prices will stabilise and stay that ... and stagnate for a number of years.</p></speech>

I didn't say that.  I'm just outlining what the thinking was.  Now, the ... in relation to ... there's so many of these reports.  The IMF did an assessment of Irish banks in 2006, it published it in August 2006.  And it did a stress test, it got a stress test done, and the actual outcome was published by the IMF as Annex II to its report.  And it makes clear that they were considering a 40% ... the impact of a 40% fall in house prices.  Now, the fact of the matter is they still concluded that the banks would still be able to cope with that.  Now, it's quite clear that there was some problem with those stress tests, but that was the state of knowledge.  Looking at them now it's very easy to say they couldn't have been right.</p></speech>

The vast majority of that happened on your watch, from '02 to '06, where they passed the European average and then went from the European average to the most indebted citizens in Europe.

The greatest driver for bad debts is unemployment.  So it does depend on the extent of the downturn and we did not see at the time an event of the type that happened.</p></speech>

The Keane report and all the other reports actually showed that the critical matter of dealing with debt is affordability; it is not necessarily unemployment.

I'm going to start with this question.  You may have covered aspects of it already.  Can you remember if, and at what time, during your tenure the Central Bank identified excessive property-related lending and the heavy interbank borrowing of Irish banks as a substantial threat to their financial stability?</p></speech>

I mean, it is not about not recognising it; it's about whether you ... what you consider to be the threat that it poses and the analysis that it was available suggested that the banks could deal with any likely shock to the system.  And that's where the flaw, you now, was.  It wasn't that ... I mean, it would have been clear that credit was increasing; it was clear that house prices were increasing.</p></speech>

Could I bring you to page 119 of the same document, the briefing of the Minister in the same year, which says that, "[T]he Bank expresses concern about the high rate of credit growth [...] which has been increasing by around 25 per cent."  And the advice to the Minister is to say that the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, on the next page, should "remain vigilant".  Was 25% growth of credit per annum not a matter of some concern in the Department?</p></speech>

The annual Financial Stability Reports [to which we've referred] [...] did not contain any critical analysis.</blockquote></p></speech>

And there was also ... Mr. O'Connell said that he rang the ESRI to complain about a reference to the property market by Professor Alan Barrett.</p><p>Did you know that on the three boards who were on, that one of them ... that pressures were being exerted by people from the other two organisations which were associated?</p></speech>

I think ... well, first of all, I think, in fairness, there should be, you know ... I was on the council of the ESRI and we didn't interfere with any of their academic work.  It was purely just managing the organisation and that's a fact.  The second thing about it is that as part of its ongoing day-to-day work, and I think John FitzGerald said this, there would have been contact between the relevant section and the Department of Finance and the ESRI and that was mainly technical.  Now, every now and again, inevitably, there would be maybe difference of opinion which would be more than technical.  Now, I inquired ... I got onto the Department of Finance and I was told anyway that ... that one of the issues anyway definitely didn't concern me, it happened after I had left.  I don't know anything about it.  I couldn't get to the bottom of the nervous Nellies either, so I'm afraid I can't help you with that.</p></speech>

Because I would have some concern that the apparent consensus that's been referred to was, in fact, manufactured because of the way the contrarians may have been silenced in one way or another and I thank you for your clarification because I would not like if such had occurred.  The IMF concerns about house prices in Ireland ... you know, double digit growth rates in 2006.  The concerns of the IMF in 2003 ... and a five-line note from the Minister saying, you know, "Dismiss the IMF on house prices".  Didn't we pay a price for that afterwards?</p></speech>

One is that supply and demand would help to solve the problem.  The second thing is that there had been a large increase in the population of Ireland and, in particular, the number of people at work.  And that the ... that the prosperity and wage levels in the country had increased.  And the belief was that this accounted for a lot of the increase in property prices.  Now, you know, with the benefit of hindsight, you know, you'd have to question that.</p></speech>

That ... while there are rumours, I suppose, that the Department of Finance was against directors' compliance statements ... that Nyberg says he could find no evidence that the Department of Finance gave explicit instructions to the Financial Regulator not to proceed with the implementation of that provision.

I've seen this ... and including the proposition that somehow we should have been saying something in private and saying something different in public, wouldn't like to be here trying to explain that.  I mean, as far as I'm concerned, this is pretty straight down the middle.  The analysis came to the board, the discussion took place between the two boards, they signed off, there were no dissensions.  Now, you know as well as I do if your on a board, you dissent if you're strong and your dissent ... you should have it recorded.</p></speech>

You know, all directors have the same responsibilities.  The difference is that the Minister decided to appoint people with a public sector background in the belief that that would influence the way they looked at things.  It's as simple as that.</p><p>But in the 2006 ... 2010, I think, Central Bank Act, all the directors of what they call the covered banks, banks that were ... they all have a public interest obligation.</p></speech>

They were providing bonuses after the guarantee, which was prohibited under the terms of the guarantee, to its staff - there was a special report done by the Department of Finance that was commissioned by the Department of Finance - which totalled &euro;66 million.  They showed that bonuses were being paid out or to be paid out and Bank of Ireland was fined &euro;2 million as a result of this in terms of, I believe, misleading information to the Department of Finance.  The D&aacute;il record had to be ... had to be corrected because misleading information was given to the Minister of Finance at a prior occasion.

Can I ask you in relation to the property tax reliefs ... and you talk ... you talked at length in relation to the fact that you phased them out in 2006 in the Finance Acts 2006, but is it not the case, Mr. Considine, that these property tax reliefs were going to expire in 2006 anyway?  Can I put it to you that the urban renewal scheme was actually going to expire in 2002 and extended to 2004 and then extended to 2006 and then extended to 2008?  Can I put it to you that the living over the shop scheme was extended twice during the period of the scheme?  The rural renewal scheme was extended twice up to 2006.  There was the park and ride scheme, the town renewal scheme, the student accommodation scheme.  The multi-storey car park scheme was extended twice over the period of that scheme.  And these were all supposed to conclude either in 2002 and 2004 and were extended to 2006 and 2008.  Wasn't it not the case, if the Department took a position of no policy change, that these would have just ... there was an exit clause or a conclusion date on them that you decided in your review to extend up until 2008?</p></speech>

Well, I think I said that, you know, ideally these should have been ended a lot earlier, you know, than they were, but the reason for it was there was a nervousness about the whole property and housing ... particularly housing and I, I think the reason why there was such a thorough exercise conducted in 2005 was to make sure that we didn't do any great damage by ending them.

Now, given the fact that second-hand houses in Dublin rose by &euro;30,000 between 2001 and 2002 ... but can I put it to you, in 2006 a second-hand house average price was &euro;512,000, compared to in 2001 when this blip happened, of &euro;267,000.  How could a three-month blip, where the overall year showed an increase in house prices of quite a substantial amount, be of a major concern when people like the ESRI and others are saying that there is an overheating in the economy and we need to start to not just phase out the property tax reliefs but do not extend them, which is what calls were being made at that time from external agencies?  And what was your advice?  Were you of the view, in 2002, 2004, 2006, that each of these property tax incentives should have been not extended at that point in time?</p></speech>

There was a whole structure around looking at the taxation of property and so on, the tax strategy groups and so on.

I'm going to move towards a wrap-up.  I'll just deal with a couple of questions and then I'm going to conclude with the two lead questioners.  I just want to revisit one question that was ... I think Deputy O'Donnell engaged with you this morning.  I just need a bit of clarity on it ... it's during your tenure as Secretary General as to what was the role of the Department of Finance in overseeing the Financial Regulator.  If you could explain to us, Mr. Considine, was this role restricted to legislative issues related to the implementation of the new regulatory system or did it expand beyond that?</p></speech>

For example, section 33P required the regulator to draw up a strategy statement.  And that legislation was more specific.  It also specified what was to be in it.  So the function of the Department was to review the strategy statement to see did it actually comply with the Act, did it have in it what it was supposed to have.</p><p>Then that was submitted to the Minister and then the Minister laid it before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  </p></speech>

I don't know whether it was forged during my tenure, but, it ... it was there anyway because the ... the ... I mean, the OECD report of March 2006 is one of the few places where it's defined.  It could mean many different things but they define it.</p></speech>

I suppose the ...the ... expertise that was in the system in relation to public expenditure and taxation.

As has been stated earlier, 24% of the economy tied up in construction ... as members have identified a whole series of issues this morning - highest debt, indebtedness in Europe, most ... evidence, I think, I presented myself to yourself this morning, the house ... the highest property values in western Europe, most expensive houses, Dublin more expensive than cities like New York and Hong Kong - just for residential property not even commercial stuff - consumption taxes now becoming the balance of income more so than the structural tax.  And ... so where's the evidence to say that as soon as this ... there would be a slow down in construction, there would obviously be a knock-on effect upon employment, this  would have a knock-on effect upon consumption taxes, peoples indebtedness levels ... it's not even a case ... like, we know from the finance committee that you've been in before and from the Keane report, that for a lot of people who ran into difficulty, it wasn't that they actually lost their job, what they actually lost was their affordability to actually pay back their debt?  Was there any evidence that any of these things was going to happen?</p></speech>

I think the work ... the work that was done on ... on these I have outlined already, which was done in the context of the, you know, the ... the ... financial stability reports and the ESRI material.

And it depended on, you know, how much of a fall ... but there was nobody predicting the kind of economic shock that actually transpired.</p></speech>

The ... what ... what we do know is that there were a lot of external reports by the IMF, the OECD and all the rest.  These are all reports about you, about us.  These are external reports talking about the state of our house.  You're using the language and the vocabulary of a sort landing ... a soft landing and you're referencing the content of their reports with our external analysis of us.  Did you carry out any analysis in the Department of Finance with regard to modelling, examining, stress testing and actualising the reality that there would be a soft landing when there was the inevitable downturn that was being projected or identified in the financial stability reports and all the rest?</p></speech>

Mr. Considine, in March 2006, the Revenue Commissioners wanted to impose stamp duty on contracts for difference and there was strong lobbying by stockbrokers and interested parties against that.  In a book, <i>The Fitzpatrick Tapes</i>by Tom Lyons and Brian Carey, it was said that on 22 March, you were emailed by Davy Stockbrokers significant ... heavily lobbying against this, that PricewaterhouseCoopers also lobbied and that by 30 March, under the Minister, Mr. Cowen, this proposal was dropped.  Do you remember this?</p></speech>

Actually, what happened was that Revenue was going to issue an opinion that stocks purchased for ... to support sales of contracts for difference will be subject to stamp duty.  Now, the understanding I have is that when that piece of legislation was introduced, these didn't exist.  So, what we got was representations from the Irish Stock Exchange, the London Investing Banking Association, J&amp;E Davy and PricewaterhouseCoopers.  And the essence of it was that if we went ahead and did this, that the stock market would be hit fairly hard in terms of, in terms of its business and ... so, this was ... it was decided to review it and this was eventually dealt with in the Finance Bill of 2007 with the introduction of intermediary relief and it was fully debated in the Oireachtas and the Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, made a statement on that in Wednesday, 18 February 2009.</p></speech>

I'm putting my last question and the last one was a question as well.  But, Mr. Considine, after this very heavy lobbying by Davy Stockbrokers and others, you resigned a few months later, and then within six months, you were employed by Davy Stockbrokers.  Would you not see a problem of ... with that?</p></speech>

What happened in the case of Davy Stockbrokers was that they repurchased some of the equity in the firm in the middle of 2006 and they wanted some independent people on their board and that was ... and I had all appropriate approvals for what I did.  There was an actual structure in the Civil Service at the time called the outside appointments board and at the ... I submitted to them the proposal to join Davy's board for their direction and that's what happened.  In relation to the functions of the Minister and the Department of Finance, one of them is clearly to make sure that we don't do anything which will undermine a sector of the economy.  Now, if we have reason to believe that there was something proposed which could cause a significant loss of business to companies operating in Ireland, of course we have a duty to respond to that and look into it and examine it and see, is it wise?  If it were considered to be the right thing to do, we would've gone ahead with it.</p></speech>

Who were those people and what do you mean by nervous?  Because you said several times also that, you know, you as a Secretary General and your team could only advise and in the end the politicians decided.  So I'm not clear - were those people auctioneers, property developers, bankers, civil servants, politicians, Ministers, the Taoiseach?  I'm not clear.</p></speech>

Thank you for the opportunity to make these opening remarks to the committee.  May I say that my objective at all times during the banking crisis and today has been and is now to serve the public interest.  I will limit myself to comments on the guarantee, nationalisation, the ECB, Central Bank, regulator while also dealing briefly with fiscal policy.<br/><br/>Fiscal policy in the decade up to 2008 should have been more conservative and the crisis was caused by a dramatic escalation in lending by the banks.  The banks created the banking crisis but the Financial Regulator and others might have done more.  The Department was concerned about the over-reliance on the property market as a component of economic growth and of course, about pro-cyclical fiscal measures and Ireland's lost competitiveness.  However, the Department did not anticipate the severity of the property crash and the international financial crisis.  It accepted the consensus view of the Central Bank, the ESRI and others that the construction sector was facing a soft landing.  At that time, it was generally thought that there would be a significant reduction in levels over a number of years and not a sudden crash.  The Department was wrong to take, without challenge, the assessment of the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the banks' reassurance about the state of the financial sector.  Such a reliance on consensus forecasts and the assessment of the Central Bank, the regulator and the banks was a mistake and I regret it.  In the decade up to 2008, the demand from virtually all sides of the political and lobbying spectrum was for greater expenditure on more public services and for a reduction on taxation.  The typical response to increased levels of spending in many quarters was that it wasn't big enough. <br/><br/>Before dealing with fiscal and taxation policy matters in more detail, I'll just run over quickly the guarantee decision itself and the decision to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank.  You are all familiar with the fact that funds were flowing out of the country and that there was huge public concern about the safety of savings, which led to the introduction of the &euro;100,000 guarantee.  That assuaged the ordinary customers of banks but not the wholesale money market and larger depositors.  Intensive discussions took place between the day of that decision around the middle of September and the end of the month about what further measures might need to be adopted.  Matters came to a head on 29 September.  The Minister had detailed advice from Merrill Lynch with the input from the Central Bank, the regulator and the NTMA also.  Merrill's document, that was considered on the night of the guarantee, was that you could not ... they recommended you should not allow any Irish bank to fail because of the state of the market and the impact of that would be so damaging.  They went through a number of options, liquidity provision, taking Anglo and Nationwide into protective custody, consolidate some of the banks and introduce a guarantee.  Their conclusion was: <blockquote>Even if the situation stabilises, the immediate outlook for monoline, single asset ... lenders is increasingly uncertain.  In this context, it is important for the Government to act quickly and decisively ... to step in and prevent a systemic problem.</blockquote>Turning to the guarantee night, on the night of the guarantee, the Financial Regulator was of the view that while Anglo was illiquid, it was profitable and solvent.  All of the banks were suffering from liquidity pressures but Anglo had no access to liquidity and was facing imminent collapse.  The question of emergency liquidity assistance was considered for Anglo that night and stand-by arrangements were put in place for it.  But there was a major concern that if word got out into the market that ELA had been put in place, that this would have leaked, inevitably it would have leaked, and lead to the sort of consequence that you had with Northern Rock which has, if you recall, the BBC running the story, ELA had been extended, massive queues outside their branches including in Ireland and a decision then to guarantee their deposits and ultimately nationalise it.  On the night, concern about the sustainability of Anglo and Nationwide models were heightened.  The two major banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, emphasised those concerns and argued that they should be addressed by nationalisation, which should also be accompanied by a guarantee for all banks.  The regulator continued to assure the Government on the night that all the banks were solvent.  Nationalisation of the organisations was considered on the night of the guarantee.  The case for nationalisation was that the business models were regarded by the major banks and indeed, by the Department and the NTMA as suspect.</p><p>There was a real concern that there could be a serious problem with their loan books, regardless of what the boards of management were saying.<br/><br/>An involuntary liquidation at that time of a bank would have created a real danger of a complete collapse in the banking system with all that would entail for the economy as a whole.  An orderly nationalisation, given the conditions at that point, would have taken over all the assets and liabilities, as occurred in January 2009.  The reservations that night about nationalisation centred around a number of key questions.  The first was whether nationalisation was warranted.  There were concerns about the business model but no quantified evidence had been produced which showed insolvency.  There was some theoretical stress testing but no bottom-up examination of the loan books had been carried out.<br/><br/>On a second question, whether nationalisation could be undertaken without having a domino effect, one view was that nationalisation might lead to the undermining of the other banks even with a full guarantee.  This is because it could give rise to the idea well if Anglo was that bad, the others could be equally exposed.  So in that case, the guarantee might not have been convincing from day one and might have failed.<br/><br/>On the third question, whether nationalisation would avoid the need for a guarantee.  The view was that nationalisation or not, a guarantee would have to be given to save the banking system and in strong conditionality terms.  On a fourth question, whether the ECB would allow a bank failure, the view of the ECB as quoted to the meeting by the Governor on the night was that Mr. Trichet had advised him that no bank failure could be allowed, or words to that effect.  On this point, the domestic and international market turmoil at that stage was such that this view was shared by all concerned at ministerial, Central Bank and Department of Finance official level.  Nationalisation would not of course have been a bank failure as such, but it might have been regarded in the panicked market conditions as tantamount to a failure, and indicative of greater dangers.<br/><br/>Throughout the night of the guarantee the pros and cons of (a) nationalising Anglo and having a guarantee, or (b) having a guarantee, were debated several times and late into the night.  The two main contending viewpoints in the debate were: there was a strong case for immediate nationalisation; and the nationalisation at that point could lead to an undermining of the banks and the guarantee.  Whatever about those contending viewpoints, the simple fact was that if emergency measures were not taken that night to address the problems created by the banks, there was a very real danger of a collapse in the domestic banking industry, not just in Anglo but quickly in the rest of the banks through a widespread loss of confidence.<br/><br/>The damage to individual depositors, large and small, both personal and business would have been extreme.  The potential reputational damage would have undermined consumer business confidence, domestic and international investment, existing and future.  A collapse in the banking industry would have led to Ireland's sovereign borrowing reputation and capacity being irretrievably damaged.  A collapse on this front, combined with impacts on revenue, would have resulted in Government services and investment across the board being summarily cut or suspended.  No one was prepared to countenance this.  The Taoiseach and the Minister left the room for a private political discussion late in the night to review the debate.  On their return, my recollection is that the Taoiseach said they had decided to recommend a guarantee to the Cabinet and that Anglo would not be nationalised for the present.  The Minister did not in decree, indicate any disagreement on this approach.<br/><br/>Turning to nationalisation of Anglo in January of 2009, very quickly after the guarantee, there were a series of meetings with Anglo which didn&rsquo;t generate a lot of confidence given their business model, one aspect of which was they paid more for deposits and charged more for loans.  They very assertively stressed their profitability, their liquidity and their positive future but it was received with some scepticism.  A report by PwC after the guarantee, pointed to end September transactions with another bank and this raised serious questions.  That matter was referred immediately to the Financial Regulator.  Subsequently, further corporate governance issues regarding directors' loans and the nature of certain other loans also raised serious concerns.<br/><br/>It also became clear over the following months, that new or existing shareholders were not going to emerge, and a &quot;white knight&quot; who some people were expecting to emerge, wasn&rsquo;t going to emerge either.  The banks, the domestic banks had enough of their own problems to address without getting involved in Anglo.  All of that undermined confidence, despite the appointment in December of 2008 of a new chairman and public interest directors.  The loss of confidence culminated in early 2009 and led the Government to decide the close control of the bank had to be taken to ensure confidence in the banking system for the same reasons I referred to earlier, that a bank closure had to be avoided. That decision was taken after consultation with both the Central Bank and the regulator.<br/><br/>Turning briefly to the ECB.  The ECB is an independent body and it pursues its treaty-mandated primary role which is the maintenance of price stability through interest rate policy, and that policy takes account of the average conditions across the eurozone, not in individual countries.  Credit growth in Ireland to households and non-financial businesses in the ten years 1998-2008 increased by an average of nearly 20% each year.  Interest rate policy over much of the early 2000 period operated to boost borrowing and lending in the Irish context.  Those low rates encourage inappropriate lending by the banks.<br/><br/>The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that the European system of central banks, which consists of the ECB and the national central banks of all member states, &quot;shall contribute to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent authorities relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and the stability of the financial system&quot;.  The ECB, as you know, is completely independent of Governments and so is the governor.  It&rsquo;s a matter for the Central Bank to say whether the ECB ever advised the Irish Central Bank and any others experiencing excessive growth rates that specific measures needed to be taken to curb this.  My view is that they should have.<br/><br/>Turning to the Central Bank.  When the Central Bank was being amended following the Government decision in 2001 on financial regulation, there was express powers included in the legislation to give authority to the Governor and the board to issue guidelines to the regulator.  I might just read that out:<blockquote>'Either the Government or the Governor or the Board may, with respect to the functions of the Governor or the Board, issue to the Regulatory Authority guidelines as to the policies and principles that the Authority is required to implement in performing functions, or exercising powers of the Bank.  The Regulatory Authority is required to comply with guidelines issued to it under this section.</blockquote>The financial stability analysis produced by the Central Bank in 2006 and 2007 suggested that while concerns were heightened about escalating house prices and associated banking exposures, this would not lead to any insolvency issues.  The Central Bank placed undue reliance on their reports of the banks and assessment of the regulator in arriving at this conclusion.  That was a mistake.  The regulatory regime also imposed ... the legislation also imposed obligations on the regulator in relation to financial stability.  It provided that if a matter relating to the financial stability of the State&rsquo;s financial system arises in the connection with the performance or exercises by the regulatory authority of its functions, that authority shall consult the Governor.  It goes on to say then if that arises, they may give a report to the Minister.  The Department has told me there was no ... they could find no record of such a report.  I do recall the financial sector having deep concerns about the credit union sector.</p><p>The combination of the express authority given to the Central Bank, together with the requirement on the Financial Regulator to put any financial stability issue to the Central Bank, and the fact that there was some common membership of the board did provide for an effective corporate governance structure if properly operated.  While somewhat cumbersome, it was an appropriate regime.  I'll just mention briefly an IMF report into the regulatory system in 2006 more or less gave it a clap on the back and said it was amongst best practice and that they had ... conclusion was that the results of stress tests undertaken through the Central Bank and the regulator and the major lending institutions confirm that the major domestic lending institutions have adequate capital buffers to cover a range of large but plausible hypothetical shocks.  The Financial Regulator operated a principles-based regulatory system, which obviously took at face value the assessment of the banks and did not exercise independent judgment on their exposures and the quality of their loan books.  This too was a mistake.<br/><br/>Turning to fiscal policy, in the decade up to 2008, Government programmes combined with the pressures ensuing from social partnership, as well as the need to address both infrastructural deficits and demographic pressures on various sectors, drove expectations of public expenditure higher.  The outcome was that from 1998 to 2008, total Government current and capital spending, excluding the Central Fund, increased from &euro;20 billion to about &euro;60 billion.  Total current spending increased from &euro;18 billion in 1997 to &euro;53 billion by 2008, an average increase of 11%.  That was clearly an excessive increase.  The Department did recommend a much tighter control of current spending.  Total capital spending increased from over &euro;2 billion in 1997 to &euro;9 billion in 2008, an average increase of 15%.  A good deal of this increase was supported by the Department, as it felt that major infrastructural deficits such as our core interurban transport corridors - motorways - had to be tackled before demographic pressures crowded out investment.  In general, prior to 2008, and as result of the pressures exerted by the social partners, individual Ministers and the Cabinet, the annual budget day packages ended up significantly higher than those recommended in the budget strategy memoranda put forward by the Ministers for Finance.  The fact that revenues were buoyant in that period added to expectations.<br/><br/>Taxation, just to touch briefly on that Chairman, the reduction in the top tax rate from 48% in '98, to 41% by 2006 increased disposable incomes significantly and that added to the appetite for fixed assets.  The pressure from all sides were for less taxation over that period and, as I noted earlier, for more public services.  Tax incentive generally in relation to housing and the incentives for commercial development did contribute to pressures in the construction sector.  Other factors driving activity were reduced interest rates, the availability of loans and easier terms and the expectations that investing in property was always going to be a winning formula.  Loose and unco-ordinated planning development controls contributed to the problem.  On foot of recommendations from the Department of Finance, the Minister for Finance progressively moved from 2005 onwards to reduce and terminate tax incentives associated with building and tax minimisation by high earners.<br/><br/>Uncontrolled lending: the accepted analysis after the establishment of the ECB and the transfer of monetary policy from Irish Central Bank was that the only tool available to Government to control economic activity in the economy was through taxes and spending.  The Department of Finance placed too much store on this conclusion.  Greater consideration should have been given to the impact of uncontrolled lending.  The Department should have adopted a more critical stance on monetary and regulatory matters in the decade ending in 2008.  As Secretary General between July 2006 and January 2010 I was an <i>ex officio</i>member of the board of the bank but not of the regulator.  I do not recall any proposals being advanced by the management teams of either the Central Bank or the regulatory side on foot of any identified imminent threat to financial stability or to the solvency of any particular institution. <br/><br/>As I said earlier, the analysis that was done was insufficiently critical of the realities behind the financial reporting of the banks.  Some of the factors involved in pushing growth in the economy over the decade ending in 2008, include increased wages and changes in Government spending and taxation.  However, increased bank lending was by far the biggest factor.  The average annual increase in spending already touched on was about &euro;10 billion - sorry - &euro;4 billion a year, average of about 10% a year.  The tax package cost about &euro;1 billion a year, increased costs of wages and salaries in the economy, all adding fuel to what was going on, was about &euro;6.5 billion.  Unit labour costs in the economy increased by more than 55% in Ireland between 1997 and 2008, remained static in Germany and increased by 26% in the USA and 36% in the UK.  The average increase in lending to individuals and non-financial business was almost &euro;25 billion per annum or an annual average of more than 20%.  The total increased from &euro;40 billion in 1997 to over &euro;300 billion in 2008.  The reality is that it was this huge increase in lending that drove excesses in the property market.  A more moderate approach to spending and taxation would have been better.  Even with such moderation in spending and taxation, the uncontrolled explosion in credit by the banks would still have created much of the problem which crystallised in 2008.<br/><br/>I might conclude Chairman, the guarantee decided in September 2008 was essential to avoid a complete collapse of the banking system and the economy.  Ultimately, Anglo Irish Bank had to be nationalised in January 2009 to stop it collapsing and triggering a wider banking failure.  The ECB set interest rates at a level that it judged appropriate to the whole of the euro area.  The question of ensuring that credit growth was appropriate to the particular conditions in each euro country was left to the domestic central banks.  Measures to control credit should have been taken.  The Central Bank placed undue reliance on the regulator's assessment of the financial reports of the banks - that was a mistake.  The regulator took the report of the banks at face value and did not subject their loan books to any meaningful scrutiny - that was a mistake.  The Department of Finance was wrong to rely on consensus forecasts for a soft landing.  It was also wrong to take at face value the assessment of both the Central Bank and the regulator of the state of the financial sector.  I regret this.  Fiscal policy in the period 1998 to 2008 was pro-cyclical.  The pressure for more spending and less taxation came from all sides.  The average increase in lending by the banks to individuals and non-financial business, in the period 1998 to 2008, was &euro;25 billion per annum.  That is what really caused the banking crisis.  Thank you Chairman.</p></speech>

If the potential losses are 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, what does that show?"  It's not based on any rigorous examination of the loan book.  A real test ... stress test that you would get in a due diligence situation would be to get in and do a bottom-up examination of the loan book - look at the collateral, look at the cross-guarantees, the wealth of the individuals - and come up with an analysis.

At the top of page 114 you have a statement from Merrill Lynch, "It is important to stress that at present, liquidity concerns aside; all of the Irish banks are profitable and well capitalised."  Now, in the case of Anglo, that night they had run out of liquidity.  And a bank that runs out of liquidity is on borrowed time.  If it can't meet its obligations, that will become known very fast.  Liquidity, being the available ... cash available to it, would simply disappear.  People would start pulling out funds and, very rapidly, an illiquid bank becomes an insolvent bank.  So, what I definitely felt ... that if their lack of liquidity continued, they would rapidly become insolvent.  Now, if ... if ... there was certainly a concern about the ... the business model and-----</p></speech>

I had serious concerns that their liquidity had disappeared and if that continued, they would rapidly become insolvent.  Just if I might, finally, Deputy, point out that after the guarantee, PwC were sent in to do a range of analyses on the banks and I think in the case of Anglo, certainly in the case of Anglo and I think also probably Nationwide, they applied stress tests of varying degrees of write-offs and I don't think in any of those write-offs they come out and said they're insolvent.

I wanted to see what ... how the argument would unfold and how the debate would unfold.  The reservations about that approach that I touched on in my opening statement were that it could undermine the guarantee and call into question the need to have further nationalisations.  We now know what happened since but ... so that particular argument, Anglo business case very doubtful, there's an exposed property market, the need to be nationalised and take out versus the other one.</p></speech>

That was the argument at the outset of his intervention.  When he listened to the reservations about what nationalisation could imply for the credibility of the guarantee and the rest of the banks, he changed his mind and he accepted that-----</p></speech>

Nationalisation could be a problem.  The Minister would have said "Yes, I accept that view, I have listened to the views of the Central Bank and the regulator, they don't think there should be nationalisation at this point".  The meeting would then go on several times over the course of the night.  The Minister went back to the same issue and the same debate took place quite a number of times over the course of the night.  So there was a continual concern.  Each occasion, the pros and cons of each would be discussed and it appeared that the Minister was acquiescing.  What he was really ... position ... he was not saying "I remain convinced that Anglo should be nationalised".  At some stage during the course of the night - you asked me when, I actually can't recall what time, it was quite late anyway - the Taoiseach nudged the Minister and said "Come on, let's go out and have  a chat".  So they went out and had a chat. I don't know how long that lasted.  I can't recall.  It certainly was not five minutes or ten minutes, could have been longer.</p></speech>

Just to be precise: "On the core question [whether the ECB would allow a bank failure] the view of the ECB as quoted to the meeting by the Governor on the night was that Mr. Trichet had advised him that no bank failure could be allowed, or words to that effect."</p></speech>

It averaged 20% a year for ten years and, what I'm saying, steps should have been taken over the period up to the build-up of that from 1998 to 2006-2007.  If you have credit growing, as it was in some years by 30%, 35%, it would seem to me blatantly obvious that there should have been an intervention.  Now, what should that intervention have been?  If you listen to some people, they say they didn't have the authority.  In my opinion, there was authority there.</p></speech>

The regulator should have stepped in and said to each, individual bank, &quot;You're lending too much.  It needs to be cut back.&quot;  They should have gone to the Central Bank and looked at the whole big picture and said, &quot;We're building up too much credit&quot; and there should have been an intervention.  Now, the Central Bank had <i>force majeure</i>authority in relation to the regulator to issue directions which they had to observe.  That should have been done, directing the regulator to make sure that credit would only grow by whatever rate was appropriate to the economy.  It wouldn't have just been ... the whole picture is not just credit, but it's largely credit, as I said in my opening statement.  The pro-cyclicality of expenditure and taxation added somewhat to the issue, but it wasn't the major component.  The major component was the excessive lending.  If ... if ...  if the banks weren't complying with directions from the regulator to curb credit, well then it would have ... should have been a matter for the Central Bank to step in and bring in the chairman and chief executives, lay it on the line, and if they didn't accept that credit was going to be curbed, then you'd make a public policy intervention.  If the Central Bank felt that, for some reason, they had inadequate authority or powers, they could have presented suggestions to the Minister for Finance to get additional powers.  I don't believe they were necessary.  To touch on the question that you were ... on the latter part of your question in relation to the ... to my arrival on the board of the bank in 2006, I think Governor Honohan, when he was here, said that the problem in the banking system was created in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 and that if you came up with a bright idea in 2006 to address the problem, it was too late.</p></speech>

Just before I bring in Deputy McGrath, can I just ask you one question, Mr. Doyle, and that is, was there any prepared documentation or draft Bill or draft legislation in the building on the night of the guarantee that was proposing or suggesting the nationalisation of a financial institution?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-17a.906" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Doyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061700002#PP00200"><p>There were drafts of legislation that had been prepared by the Department with the agreement of the Minister, with the input from the Attorney General, not physically in that building but they were in the Department of Finance across the square.  There was a team ready on the night to finalise a Bill for nationalisation of ... there would be different versions, for a bank, a building society, and there was stand-by arrangements for a bank guarantee also.  So that legislation was on stock waiting for political direction.</p></speech>

Are you saying this evening, that once the meetings were taking place around the guarantee, that somewhere here in Dublin, there was a draft of a Bill to nationalise a bank if a decision was made in the room that night potentially to nationalise the bank, specifically for those discussions - not something that was earlier drafted, not relevant to those discussions?</p></speech>

And on the night of the guarantee, was that legislation ... were ... was the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach or yourselves, cognisant of that draft Bill?  Was it specific to the discussions that was taking place and at any time during the night was it discussed that there was, that there was legislation that could enable the nationalisation of a financial institution?</p></speech>

Anglo was subsequently nationalised in the following January or in and around that period.  The Bill to nationalise Anglo in or around that January, was that similar or more or less the same Bill that was in waiting or available on the night of the guarantee?</p></speech>

It was the principle features and the provisions that were in the September draft were utilised in January so that when the Government made the decision, the Bill was very quickly produced.</p></speech>

Mr. Doyle, you're very welcome.  Can I just continue along the theme that the Chairperson opened up there.  You have confirmed that draft legislation to nationalise a bank was prepared and similarly to issue a guarantee.  Was there special resolution legislation prepared, which would have enabled the Government to take a bank into State custody, as such, to separate the deposits from the bondholders and to execute an orderly wind-down of a bank, involving the bail-in of bondholders?</p></speech>

I'm not aware that there was, Deputy.  I do know that over the course of a year, and I wasn't dealing with this hands on myself, there was a small team dealing with it.  I did know that, in the context of moving on any particular organisation, there were all sorts of legal issues, some of them relating to constitutional issues in relation to the rights of shareholders, if the State was to step in and how you would deal with them.  So at that particular point in time, there was no special resolution legislation ready.</p></speech>

Dealing with bondholders, to get them to take a bath you're more or less getting into a liquidation situation.  And the read at the time was that if you got into a liquidation situation, certainly an involuntary liquidation, where a deficit ... whoever was driving the liquidation saying there aren't enough assets here to discharge the liabilities, an involuntary liquidation would have been seen as a disaster for the rest of the industry.  A voluntary liquidation, where the shareholders or the promoter of the liquidation was saying that all the assets will be realised and all the liabilities of that company would be discharged, that would be a totally different question of thing ... different question.

It looked at the scenario of examinership for a bank, for example.  And yet, are you telling me that at the end of September 2008, when the proverbial hit the fan, the Department did not have resolution legislation in place to deal with a situation where a bank was insolvent or where the Department felt that the bank should be put into some form of examinership, so that there could be a more detailed examination under the bonnet to check the proper underlying health of that bank?</p></speech>

The financial markets continued to melt down and then reached crisis point.  The resolution mechanism that was available was the one that I outlined to the Chairman.  An examinership of a company, an ordinary company, doesn't give rise to the same sort of an issues that does in relation to a bank.  If you appoint an examiner to a bank, the first thing that happens is that a red card goes up around every money desk around Europe and the world, and no ... and funds are called and there's no fresh funds made available.  So you instantly trigger a financial crisis with that institution.  So an examinership wasn't judged, at that point, to be an appropriate approach.  You must remember that throughout the year, all these financial institutions were producing annual reports saying they were making huge profits with their interim results and five-year declaring dividends.  So, there was nobody saying we are going to have an actual crash.</p></speech>

Page 81 in that presentation says - this was February 2008, over six months before the guarantee - "As a matter of public policy, to protect the interests of taxpayers any requirement to provide open-ended/legally binding State guarantees which would expose the Exchequer to the risk of very significant costs are not regarded as part of the toolkit for successful crisis management and resolution."  And yet, six months later, the Department did not have in its toolkit the option, where it believed, if it did so believe, that a bank was in deep, deep trouble, to strip that bank down, to protect depositors to the extent of the deposit guarantee, to bail in bondholders and effectively conduct an orderly wind-down of that bank.  Why not, is the question?</p></speech>

And right through ... like, the ... when people did their crisis exercises, my recollection is, from what I was told, is that the reaction of the central bankers, the regulators, was, "Well, based with this hypothetical crisis that you're looking at now, the Government will have step in with cash."  That was their first reaction.  Our reaction was that's not the first thing to do, its to try and see can you resolve it on trade acquisition or trade sale or merger-disposal situation.  Now, by the time September arrived, you had the international financial meltdown taking place; you had Bradford and Bingley being nationalised; you had German banks being nationalised; you had Lehman's being let go to the wall; so towards the end of that month, the view down in Dame Street was that the financial markets had become so crisis bound that, as a last resort, a guarantee would have to be considered.  That was the view that started to emerge the week before this down in Dame Street, because of the huge flows of liquidity and what was going on internationally, that it would have to be considered.</p></speech>

The option wasn't there to burn the bondholders.  You had crisis in the money markets; you had panic right across Europe; you had people in the domestic market extremely worried, money being withdrawn; you had the view being taken around Europe that bondholders could not be bailed in, that you couldn't have a bank failure, and that if you had a bank failure, this would cause a most extreme financial and economic crisis in Europe.  But, as I said, if ... if the possibility had emerged that you would ... you would make an intervention where you would secure the depositors and have a deferential approach to bondholders, it could ... it could have been rapidly dealt with in the legislation.  We had the most amazing Attorney General of all time when it came to drafting legislation, but you would have to consider yourself what would have happened if you had brought in a measure to wipe out bondholders.  Now, I can't recall what proportion of the Anglo funds were bondholders.  I don't think it was by any means the majority of their funds.  But if you had said, "We're going to take on this particular institution, guarantee deposits under the deposit guarantee scheme up to &euro;100k and everyone else will be burned proportionately", there would have been an instant meltdown in the rest of the banks in Ireland, possibly having a domino effect across Europe, given what had happened on Lehman's and the ... the knock-on effect in terms of the domino implications for the Government sovereign market would have been disastrous.  The Exchequer would not have been able to go into the market.  It did have ... had built up a big cash reserve at the time against the pressures that could emerge in the market.  But once that was exhausted, you ... and funds had been withdrawn from it, well, you would have been in severe difficulties.</p></speech>

That was their advice to Government, as such, at the end of September 2008, and you clearly placed some weight on it, because you've quoted it twice, but can I put it to you that, in arriving at that conclusion, what Merrill Lynch did was base it on some information and conversations they had with PwC as regards Anglo Irish Bank, with Goldman Sachs as regards Irish Nationwide, and with very limited verbal information from "the Ministry of Finance", as they put it, and IFSRA, the Financial Regulator - "We have not spoken to the management at any of the Irish banks."  So, in arriving at that conclusion, Merrill Lynch had not gone into the banks, they hadn't assessed the records of the banks, the quality of the loans, the quality of the underlying collateral, and they hadn't even spoken to the management of the banks, not to mention ... not to mind, say, examine the underlying documentation.  So was that not a rather flimsy basis for advice to Government which formed the basis of a very significant decision?</p></speech>

They were reviewing the published documentation in relation to the financial institutions, which were statutory declarations under company law in relation to their financial results.  They wouldn't ... they wouldn't have got much information from the Department of Finance because the Department of Finance was not the regulator of the financial institutions, but the people in the regulatory regime were supposed to be the experts on the true state of the banks.  So were they to ignore what the Financial Regulator was saying or take it for what it was worth?  I'm sure they would have assumed that there was a robust regulatory regime there.</p></speech>

But I've no problem giving it over to you: <blockquote><br /><br />I believe it's important to include dated subordinated debt under the guarantee as the problems we are dealing with here were caused by the financial institutions having too great a mismatch between their assets and liability profiles to such an extent that they were funding long-term assets with too much reliance on short-term funding, be it commercial, paper, interbank deposits and corporate deposits.  Surely the objective of the guarantee of this dated subordinated debt from our point of view is to give the covered institutions the ability to access at least two-year term funding to reduce their reliance on short-term funding, thereby avoiding the liquidity squeeze.  If any covered institution was to issue term debt with a maturity longer than two years, then the market would want to be compensated for that by an appropriate step up in the interest rate pricing.  The investors in dated subordinated debt, while receiving a reasonable return commensurate with the risk, are not equity-type investors and invest on the basis that they expect their original to be returned at maturity whereas equity investors take the risk of losing their equity, but also with the very real possibility of receiving a multiple of their equity investment through dividend income and capital appreciation, in theory.</blockquote>So that was the, that was the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>I saw on the documentation after the event.  The first time I, I recall seeing anything about it was in that Merrill Lynch document.  And, as it turned out, a lot of that subordinated debt was taken out through liability management exercises.</p></speech>

But what I ... I ... I have read the article and ... what he was, in fact ... with his conclusions ... it was interesting the conclusion that he reached.  He said the expected ... if the average.  He says: ''...a close relationship historically across different economies in housing markets between the size of increases in real house prices and subsequent declines.  If this relationship were to hold for Ireland the expected fall in average real house prices in the range of 40%-60%, over a period of around eight years.  So a soft landing.  Such a fall would return the ratio of house prices to rents to its level at the start of the decade.''</p> <p>Now he wasn't predicting a short ... a soft landing, he said that could happen but, equally, the opposite could happen.  But he did go on to say: ''The Government did not cause the current boom and it's powerless to do anything about a subsequent bust'.'  That's on page 15 of his article.</p></speech>

When Governor Honohan attended before this inquiry and he clarified some evidence subsequently in writing on the question of what should have been done with Anglo Irish Bank and Nationwide, he set out a hindsight scenario.  And I want to put that to you ... and that hindsight scenario is on the basis that you now know the cost to the State of rescuing Anglo and Nationwide will be in the order of &euro;35 billion.  And in that hindsight scenario, his view is that although Anglo was systemically important at the time, the Government would have done better by not including those two banks in a guarantee.  It could have advised the ECB and the European Commission that it intended to liquidate these banks, protecting only insured depositors.  European officials would have been shocked, they might possibly have agreed to some risk-sharing arrangement to induce the Government to refrain from the bail-in and absent from such a risk-sharing agreement and notwithstanding the associated significant reputational damage, on balance, some bail-in should have been applied.  My question is, with the benefit of hindsight, and given we now know the cost of rescuing those two banks is of the order of &euro;35 billion, should a different decision have been made regarding Anglo and Nationwide?</p></speech>

I think ... I think Governor Honohan made a number of comments.  He did say:<blockquote><br /><br />I think with the information available, they should have nationalised Anglo.  Would it have saved &euro;40 billion?  No.</blockquote>That was his answer, on page 732 I have written down here, I don't know whether ... I don't have the hearing notes with me.</p></speech>

Given the comments that you said there and your quote with regard to Professor Honohan, I suppose the obvious question, is why was legislation not actually acted upon and did anybody, on that night, advocate that the legislation would be used?</p></speech>

The Minister, having heard the debate surrounding the possible consequences of that, arrived at a different view and then went over those arguments a number of times.  So, in terms of, was anybody saying the legislation should be used, the argument was being put forward that Anglo should be nationalised.

That's a very abstract concept.  What I'm trying to establish is on the evening, was there a concretised proposal that said, "We can nationalise Anglo Irish Bank, we do have legislation here and we can move it."  So the argument in terms of nationalising Anglo is in the context that there is a vehicle and a mechanism and a methodology to actually do so.  Not that we need to go in and do something now, how can we do it, but there is actually a method to do it.</p></speech>

But again, can I just put to you what Mr. Kevin Cardiff submitted in his witness statement which starts on page 14.  His recollection is that:<blockquote><br /><br />Before the guarantee night, the governor of the Central Bank, John Hurley, reported three important points from Frankfurt after discussions with the president of the ECB.  One, there was no European approach to the financial crisis in preparation at that point.  Two, the message from Mr. Trichet, the president, was that each government should protect its own financial institutions and should not let them fail, and finally, the ECB was not preparing any special intervention in relation to liquidity including in relation to collateral.</blockquote>That is a complete contradiction of what Mr. Trichet said to this committee in Kilmainham.  Which is accurate?</p></speech>

My recollection on this before the guarantee night ... so that was the day before I take it, because Kevin was in touch with the Governor on that Sunday and my understanding is you had a certain note there that was passed into the Cabinet.  The Governor was in touch with Mr. Trichet.  My understanding is that Kevin's account there is what he would've got from the Governor that Sunday.  I think the Minister and Kevin were down in the Central Bank on the Sunday and inevitably, the feedback in relation to where the ECB was or wasn't, would've come to him then.

And move to page 15 which was the Financial Regulator's feedback, &quot;The assessment of the crisis was unclear as there was no systemic impact assessment carried out.&quot;  And then I move to page 16 and it is the feedback from ... again, sorry, continuation of the feedback from the regulator and it says, &quot;We need to explore what measures/options are available to handle a crisis apart from ELA or Government guarantees.&quot;  And then on page 18, Mr. Doyle, the Department of Finance feedback:<blockquote><br /><br />In planning a next exercise, a particular concern should be to test the central elements of the national response to a financial stability event (i.e. financial analysis of an individual institution in difficulty, liquidity/solvency assessment, ELA procedures, Eurosystem/ECB aspects, systemic analysis, interacting with media/political level, communications between national authorities, resolution issues etc.) rather than areas which are, while still important, more peripheral.</blockquote>There seems to be a lot of energy put into the exercise without a clear determination that this was worthwhile.  Was it worthwhile and the benefit that it contributed towards the actual crisis, when the crisis erupted?</p></speech>

That was Kevin and William Beausang, and I think Michael Manley were there, the people who represented the Department.  The purpose of having the exercise, my understanding was they'd have the exercise, stand back and look at actually what happened and identify, well, how well did that go?  How could it be made better?  You know, the next time round what were the areas we need to look at?  So that was the sense that the exercise took place, there's a critical evaluation taking place, with a view to what would happen the next time.  I think Kevin would probably share with you his view of that particular exercise.</p></speech>

The reason they did the exercise was to see, if there was a problem, how would the various players in the Central Bank, regulator and Department react to the hypothetical stress scenario that was discussed, and then to evaluate that, and then clearly a lot of people weren't totally satisfied with the way it had done and were identifying how the next such exercise could be enhanced.</p></speech>

And it's also available to yourself, cc'd to yourself.  And the question was in relation to the impact of a full guarantee, and this is dated 26 September 2008.  So this is three days before the actual night of the guarantee.  And Brendan McDonagh says:<blockquote><br /><br />This is very difficult to answer as the potential real exposure to the Exchequer of writeoffs is not yet independently qualified.<br /><br />The rating agencies will be taken aback at the scale of the state involvement in any [I'm not quite sure what it is, I assume it's clean-up] operation and the speed of it occurring.  Clearly the length of the workout will be an important factor in their assessment of Ireland's credit rating also.  We expect to be put immediately on negative watch and probably soon after be downgraded, how many notches from AAA we just don't know.<br /><br />Combining to takeon of banks Balance sheets of Anglo and Inbs of 110bn and guaranteeing the others of over 420 bn with a deteriorating budget deficit will lead at least in our estimation, an increase in the cost of funding of perhaps [at least] 1 percent in funding costs.  </blockquote>I just want to leave it there, Mr. Doyle, please.  It would suggest, or would it suggest, that the bank guarantee was well considered days before the night of the bank guarantee itself within the Department, within the NTMA, that this was one of very few options that were available to yourselves?  Is that a fair comment?</p></speech>

Well, my recollection is that at a board meeting the previous day or two days ... I think it was the previous day, that the Governor at that meeting said that up to that point his conclusion, having regard to all the analysis available to him, was that a guarantee shouldn't be part of the suite of measures, but that given where things were now he felt that, for the first time, that a guarantee would have to be contemplated.</p><p>And in the light of that, then, I posed the question:"What are the implications of that going to be, for the sovereign debt cost?!  Now, in Brendan's note, which actually wasn't copied to me at the time ... what the note at the top ... oh, yes, it was ... I'm sorry it was, it was forwarded on by William ... what Brendan's note is saying there, a 1% increase in debt costs, and the debt ... national debt at the time was &euro;50 billion, so that's going to cost &euro;500 million.  The reference to &euro;110 million nationalised bank is a separate issue.  That was hypothetical and if it had been nationalised, in fact, it wasn't going to be on the basis of the State writing cheques to make up for the borrowing of those nationalised banks, so it's ... I don't think the read ... I can see where he was coming from, but it was going to be, we were going to be underwriting ... the nationalisation would have meant that we would have been standing behind the borrowing of the banks, not actually, borrowing the money.  So we're like the State, like the borrowing of the ESB which ... so what was really critical there was the 1% and the half a billion that that was involved in the additional servicing cost, and that was the figure around which the fees for the guarantee centred, in, in the days after the guarantee had been decided.</p></speech>

There was a shortage of skills in the requisite disciplines.</blockquote>Do you think that's a fair assessment?</p></speech>

The Department had a wide range of staff, I think, before I retired.  We had our own in-house review of the capabilities of the Department.  That was published about six ... in the middle of 2009, and it identified the need for the Department to increase its skill base.  I wouldn't accept that the Department had no skill base, say, in relation to economics, for instance.  There were something like, depending on what figure ..I ... 60 to 80 people in the Department with some form of economics qualification, but, as somebody else commented, how many economists do you need to work out that the explosion in credit was a fundamental problem, you know?  There was a failure there, as I said in my opening statement, to stand back and look at what was happening in reality in the housing market, and to accept the assurance of the Central Bank and regulator.  But, basically, a lot of the people in the Department were very committed and dedicated, but the Department did need a broader pool of skills, accountancy, taxation, economics, right across the board; it did need to enhance its skills base.  And from what I've read, that has been carried through into action.</p></speech>

Good afternoon, Mr. Doyle.  I want to refer to your opening statement and indeed to the core documents ... I think it's page 141 to 145, which is about the domestic standing group.

The reality is that the work that this group was doing at the time was regarded as ultra sensitive.  The manager group was quite a large group and, while everyone trusts everyone else, I think, as a former Minister said to me once, "If you know something and tell somebody else something, the number of people that know it is not one plus one equals two, it is one plus one equals 111. "  So it was regarded as ultra sensitive that ... the fact that legislation was being prepared to take fundamental action.  So ... but I would've been briefed by Mr. Cardiff as he saw fit.</p></speech>

Did you, at any juncture, voice those concerns as a member of the board of the Central Bank?  You had an opportunity and a position on the board to raise those concerns.</p></speech>

It went from &euro;40 billion in 1997 to &euro;270 billion by 1996.  There was another increase in 2007 of 311 and it's ... remained at that and started to reduce significantly after that.  So, when I went on the board, there was a lot of concern about the explosion in credit that had happened - the potential implications of it.  Their assessment was that it wasn't going to create financial instability.  They had tightened some of the liquidity rules, made the decision in 2006, implemented it in early 2007 in relation to 100% mortgages but that was all too little too late.  The first thing that I read on becoming Secretary General was an analysis from the International Monetary Fund on our a regulatory regime which, as I said earlier, gave us a green card, not quite best-in-class, but the banks could cope with anything adverse that would come down the road at them.</p></speech>

Going back when it was established in 1990, by a decision of the Government to separate from the Department so it would be professionalised and staffed with people with appropriate skills, there did seem to be some - I'm just observing from outside - some historical baggage about the few of the people in the Department that the NTMA were, had, you know, been hived off.  The people in the NTMA seemed to think that the Department resented that.  I never found any justification for that myself.  My own dealings with them were ... I regarded them as highly professional and competent.  Towards the end of the 90s, I dealt with a number of issues where we transferred additional tasks to them - central treasury management agency ... or central treasury management, State Claims Agency.  And at the time, Charlie McCreevy issued a press release in which he said that the investment experience ... investment expertise available to him was in the National Treasury Management Agency.</p></speech>

Mine were no different from anyone else.  I think in my case there was two added years because I had been in the service for ... I can't remember now, 1972 to 2010.  So it was about two added years.  Younger Secretary Generals retiring would have got an awful lot more than that.  Standard arrangements.  Do I think that the arrangements were justified?  I think that the pension arrangements for top people and, indeed, the salaries for it were excessive.  They've been significantly reduced now and the pension arrangements have been significantly curbed.</p></speech>

The time limit was generally seven years and so if you retired considerably below the normal retirement age of 60 or 65, there was a top-up.  I couldn't swear what the total top-up was supposed to be but I have a feeling it would've been up to seven years generally.  In my case, it was two.  Who sanctioned it?  They were the arrangements approved by the Government.  They have been ... they have been ... those top-ups, as I understand it, no longer apply and the basic salaries have all been significantly reduced.  As I said, I ... I never set out to become Secretary General so that I could earn more money.  That was what went with the job.  I'd have been very happy with less and, in a way, I'm surprised that my pension wasn't cut even more than it was.</p></speech>

Okay, don't hold me to specific figures then - but if there's a particular document, I'll have a look at it - but my recollection is that post the increase in the deposit guarantee scheme to &euro;100,000, the view was that that bought time.  It bought time to ease the concern of the ordinary citizen who had a few bob tucked away in the banks and was concerned about it ... that assuaged them.  But, in relation to what the position was in the banks, the Department and the National Treasury Management Agency were very concerned that we didn't have a flow of information coming to us about what the real state of play in the financial institutions was.</p><p>PwC were commissioned by the regulator, to my recollection, at the request of the NTMA and ourselves to go in and have a look firstly, at what the liquidity position was in each of the financial institutions and in the case of Nationwide, I think what they found was that the, there was, strangely enough a large cash pile at the time, which was going to dissipate rapidly over the following few months because there was a major facility going to expire.  They were, they were losing a lot their normal deposits.  If you recall, there had been a false story published at the beginning of September 2008 to the effect that Nationwide were in discussion with their, with their lenders in the context of, of seeking protection.  I can't remember the exact story but it was false and it did damage them, quite apart from whatever other damage might have been done there anyway.  They also went in and looked at Anglo, and they found-----</p></speech>

Rather than relying on ... and can I refer to one document ... that's from William Beausang, it's not in the book but it's cleared for display ... from William Beausang, e-mail, and yourself is copied into that Mr. Doyle, on 19 September 2008?  Maybe that could go up, yes, thank you.  And then in the second last paragraph under Anglo, it says GS, which is Goldman Sachs, who were had looked at INBS, ''were very clear that if they were in our position, they would have legal, accounting and corporate finance expertise combing through the books".  Now, shouldn't that really have been a warning to the regulator and to yourselves that a forensic examination was needed, not depending on information from the management of the banks?</p></speech>

Secondly Goldman Sachs were in there originally doing some work for, as I regard, Nationwide, and they were asked by the Central Bank to go in and have a look on their behalf.  So, while they did say this, they also said I think over the following fortnight, that things weren't as bad as they thought originally.  Goldman Sachs expressed that view in some document or other.  The, the central point that you're making is that the system didn't have adequate information, we found that the regulator ... did not have adequate information to say to us exactly what was their liquidity position, what was their exposures.  And we weren't happy with that, we were pressing the regulator to get people in ... Goldman Sachs did some work for them, they eventually brought PriceWaterhouse in to do a, a job on the liquidity and then they also asked them to do a significant job on the loan book.</p></speech>

The banks reiterated that it was not a realistic proposition for either institution [that's AIB or Bank of Ireland] to provide unsecured funding for an entity that had a hole in its balance sheet which would exceed its reserves.&quot;  And two sentences down, &quot;Both AIB and BoI [Bank of Ireland] independently took the view that the CBI/FR [Financial Regulator] was seriously ruling in the possibility of letting IN [Irish Nationwide] go as a realistic option.&quot;  And because of time, I'll just go to another piece of evidence, which is Mr. Drumm and this on the same book but it's page 119 and this is a letter from Mr. Drumm to the Financial Regulator in relation to whether Anglo Irish should take control of Irish Nationwide and in page 119, Mr. Drumm says, in a minute or statement, and I repeat:<blockquote><br /><br />To publicly undertake to make up any deficit in net assets after the loan book has been realised and all liabilities [...] repaid.  That is to say, any losses incurred in realising the loan assets will first be absorbed by member's equity [...] and then if any loss remains, by the Minister.</blockquote>Is it very clear or not, Mr. Doyle, that all the main players were saying Irish Nationwide is simply insolvent?</p></speech>

Looking at it in retrospect, given everything that emerged for both those organisations, once you got past the point of the guarantee, the capitalisation and then the NAMA loan acquisition and write-offs, obviously they were seriously insolvent.  Were they insolvent on that night?  There were people who were saying that they were in major trouble.  The ... what the regulator was saying they weren't insolvent, my understanding from what I saw elsewhere subsequent to some of those earlier meetings with Goldman Sachs, they weren't saying clearly that they weren't insolvent.</p><p>The PwC, when they went in and did the liquidity thing, said, "Yes, actually, INBS might have plenty of cash but it's all going to disappear."  When they went in and did their Project Atlas work, the three different stress tests, my recollection is that that ... even that stage didn't show that their capital was wiped out, but it did show a lot of concern.</p></speech>

And in Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, I don't have time to quote it, Mr. Doyle, but you can take my word that it's here, both Merrill Lynch said that INBS loans were &euro;11.7 billion, and that its assets were &euro;3.6 billion, and Goldman Sachs said it had regulatory capital of &euro;1.834 billion; again, further evidence.  Now, in view of these ... all these players were in daily contact with yourselves, with the regulator; would you say that there should have been ... of course Anglo, but because of the apparently extra information that was known about Nationwide, that there should have been the most serious discussion in relation to Nationwide.

So were we convinced that Nationwide was a wonderful organisation?  No.  Did we almost collapse when Anglo came in and said they wanted to buy Nationwide?  Absolutely.</p></speech>

Is it surprising to you, in view of these serious concerns about some of these institutions, that the Taoiseach of the country would take such a stand at the very beginning of what was a critical discussion?</p></speech>

It's ...  it's impossible to recall with clarity a meeting that happened, whatever it is, seven years ago now, but I accept his word that the Taoiseach put it on the table.  But my recollection is the Taoiseach was a pretty direct character.  He'd put it on the table and say, "Now, let's examine this."  I don't recall ... like, if he had come in and said, "Let's examine this.  We're not going to discuss anything else.  Let's just do it", I'd accept that that wouldn't have been the appropriate position, but that's not what he did.  He put it on the table and the debate went on for about six or seven hours after that.</p></speech>

There wasn't the time to go in and get a root-and-branch analysis from the ground up as to what the true financial position of the banks was.  We were relying on what the regulator - who had been regulating all these institutions for so many years - presenting his view or the view of the regulatory machine, which is more appropriate to describe it, of the state of the banks, which was that they were solvent, profitable, well capitalised and well managed, I think, was the mantra.</p></speech>

It's just to note that, it's not an agreed report.  It's their note of the meeting.  The statement there is still the same statement I made in my opening statement today, in my written response to you and my oral statement today.  I don't know what the workings the European Central Bank and the Central Bank are because they're shrouded in secrecy and, you know, if you want to know - from an authoritative point of view - as to what ... how that worked, you'd have to get it straight from the Governor, who's a member of the ECB.  In relation to my ... my, just, external observation, when you had credit growing throughout the early part of the 2000s, at phenomenal growth rates, 30%-35%, I was just staggered that no intervention was made.  Now the European Central Bank, its core function or its principal function, I think, is the word, is inflation; but it's also, as part of the ESCB with the central banks, charged with the task of contributing to financial stability.  Now, throughout the 2000s, you had a significant drop in interest rates, which reflected the economic conditions right across the eurozone, particularly some of the bigger countries where the growth rate was very low.  In our case, it was extremely high, so the interest rate regime applicable throughout the eurozone was not appropriate to Ireland, and my point ... my criticism is that, given that excessive growth rate and what that was doing to the economy, there should have been an intervention.  I don't know whether the ECB ever advised the Irish Central Bank that they should make an intervention.</p></speech>

One that refers to figures after capital and one that doesn't refer to figures after capital.  So, precisely which is the correct transcription, I don't know.  I did say earlier that I'm absolutely satisfied I didn't answer my own question that I posed.  I asked the accountant that was attending the meeting from PwC, whose name is incorrectly recorded in that minute as Dan O'Connor - I think it was Denis O'Connor - I asked him "Did I, did I make those ... did I gave that answers to my own question?".  He said: "No" that he thought it was the NTMA representatives.</p><p>So, I can't recall on what basis they made those but I would suggest that they were saying, well if Anglo's book has to be written off ... like, to arrive at a figure of &euro;8.5 billion after capital, their loan book at the time was about &euro;70 billion.  Their capital say was, just to make it easy, &euro;7 billion.</p></speech>

There was more and more concern in the ... in the international market about the real position of the banks.  They were regarded as having a lot of deadweight loans, which was dragging them down.  The Minister decided to bring in Dr. Bacon to look at the options.  The two principal options that were identified was, one, an insurance-based approach where you would write out an insurance policy, charge the banks an appropriate fee, let them work out the facility over the following ten years, say, and at the end of that period, if there was a deficit on the loan portfolio, it would be made good by the policy, for which they would have paid a significant premium.  And the understanding on that particular option was that if there was a deficit from that arrangement, there would be a levy on the bank in subsequent years.  However, the analysis that was done was concerned that that approach would still leave the market very uncertain about what, in reality, was going to emerge.  So, the recommendation was that the cleanest thing to do was to take the loans off the banks for a discount and take it off their balance sheets, remove the doubt about their underlying financial position.  They were the two main options, Senator.</p></speech>

In an analysis paper you prepared in 2004 - it's coming up on the screen now, Mr. Doyle - it was estimated that a decline in housing output of 10,000 units would cost the Government &euro;500 million in lost revenue.  Despite warning that the current level of housing output was unsustainable at that time, no policy or strategy was proposed to deal with such a scenario."  So can I ask you was this, in your opinion, a reason for the Government to be very reluctant with measures to cool down the property market?</p></speech>

I ... I ... as it's in the heading there: "Could a significant decline in housing or output be affected by an expansion of public investment?" So like, in 2005 there was the usual heightened concern about housing output, or where the housing market was going and, I can't remember who advanced the proposition that if the market did contract, that the Exchequer would be in position, because of the marvellous position the Exchequer was in, to make up for that drop in activity, which wasn't an argument that held any water.  And the purpose of that note was to demonstrate that well, if ... if housing output dropped, there would be a big impact upon revenue and that if you then tried to replace, through public capital investment, the capital equivalent of 10,000 houses, there would be a huge net cost on the budget.  So it wasn't a practical proposition.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-17a.1227" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/990" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Lynch" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061700002#KKK01200"><p>Okay, can we maybe examine that proposition a bit further with you, Mr. Doyle, in that we do know, and we knew it then as well, that the construction sector was growing so exponentially that it had grown to nearly one quarter, just under one quarter of the Irish economy?  And it was by any measure or means at least twice what it should be by EU norms or considered at a sustainable level, which is in around 10% or 12%; it was up around 24%.  So the proposition ... could a counter-proposition to that be - and this is what the question is that I'm testing with you - was the Government, or was it your opinion, a reason that the Government to be very reluctant for measures to cool the property market because there's not a lot of apparent measures there at this time to actually cool the market?</p><p>In fact, discussions of earlier today - with Mr. Considine this morning - will show that the taxation measures that were under review were not actually acted upon, they just remained under review between the, kind of, 2003 to 2006 period.  So, can I put it to you, if I go onto the next page there, it's two pages in ... and in the top paragraph it gives a sort of relationship between the 10,000 houses volume decline or ... it's the third line down, "a rough rule of thumb is that each 10,000 volume decline in housing output [my Latin isn't great so you might translate that for me later] reduces economic growth by about [one quarter] - 1 percentage point.  As a result, employment growth would be around &frac12;- 1 percentage point lower than would otherwise be the case."  So there's a correct ... or there's a direct correlation here between the number of houses being built and how it's actually presenting in economic growth and if the production of houses ... and as we know this morning ... there was an overproduction of houses being built at the time as well, that if the ... the roll-out of housing units was reduced, it would have an impact on the headline sum on the economy.  And then it ... just to bring you down onto the next paragraph, and it's the ... it's the second line into that and it goes again, "However a broad rule of thumb is that each 10,000 reduction in housing output would reduce revenue by around &euro;500 million", and I presume that that's in annum.  So, the question I'm putting to you: did these figures in any way influence or give consideration to the Administration of the day that to take any cooling measure with regard to the property market would have an ... an immediate adverse effect upon the revenue and employment figures, regardless of what the long-term consequences would actually be?</p></speech>

Whether that's true or not, I mean, he did say that.  You could ... you could debate parts of that.  But all I was making the point ... that the budgetary position was so strong, if the ... if the Government wanted to make an intervention to drive prices down or to drive property output down - which wouldn't have been all that easy to do because everyone was building all over the place - there was the financial scope there, apparently, only ... on the ... on the face of the numbers.</p><p>The underlying position was that given the obsessive level of building that had been going on, the real revenue flow was underneath that, were... weren't lasting, that was clearly known.  I can recall myself pointing out at the end of 2006 to my colleagues and to political people that the very figure that you spoke about, the 25% of output there on the construction side, that it was unreal and that it would come down and that we were going to be facing tremendous pressures.  What we didn't factor in was the international recession which drove out but down internationally about 8%, including in America, England, our main markets.  That impacted on us.  It didn't factor in the financial crash either and it didn't factor in the collapse in building.  It didn't factor in the unsustainability of the reality behind the banks' explosive increase in lending.</p></speech>

Their involvement in funding the whole operation was critical and that was explored and I understand, cleared and agreed with them, before the final decision was made.</p></speech>

And by the time early September came, that had moved on to &euro;5 billion.  In fact, in your own ... in the documents, it was already declared that there was a recession in the country, and that by the end of September there was, the shortfall looked like it was perhaps close to &euro;6 billion.  So obviously there was a lot of concern behind the scenes.  Yet in that documentation relating to the budgetary consolidation, there is no mention anywhere of the banks and what was happening with the banks.  Was there a parallel universe there where budget and constraints and expenditure and so on was here, and over here you had, oh, "bank mess" for want of a better word?  And if so, why was that?</p></speech>

You don't get, like when Revenue Commissioners get in the cash in a particular quarter, it is impossible for them to extrapolate from a particular quarter what's going to happen by the end of the year.</p><p>It's an accumulation of knowledge, so the budget deterioration was accelerating.  I can recall myself coming back from my holidays in August that year and it was as if the wind had been taken out of the country.  There'd been a complete loss of confidence.  I can remember the Taoiseach being personally alarmed at what was going on and was very anxious that something be done to try and address the slide in economic activity.  But equally we were concerned about the slide in the revenues, so when the Government decided to bring forward the budget, there was a twin-track approach of, say, "Okay, we'll take some measures to reduce the fiscal slide", bearing in mind the strong position that the public finances were in, apparently, "but we will also look at stimulatory measures where it can be shown to be good value for money".  So, you'd have a twin-track approach.</p></speech>

Now, at that point, for good or evil, what we had been told was the banks were solvent.  There was no talk at that point ... at the end of September, the budget was about a fortnight away.  There was no talk about major capital outlays.  That started to emerge in December, when the Government decided it would have to back up its support for the banks by a capital injection.</p></speech>

Well, as general secretary, if you look at pre-budget outlook documents, memoranda for Government, stability pact updates, you will see that the Department was concerned about the state of the industry.

In the run up to the 2007 election ... sorry, Freudian slip - budget, it was totally different.</p></speech>

So there was a lot of worry that the construction industry was going to contract.  And, on the one hand, you had ambition of the political system, taken at its widest, to have the best possible intervention in a budget in terms of improved public services and appropriate levels of taxation.  And we were arguing for a very much lighter approach because our concern was that while we were exhibiting high growth rates at the time, that the possibility ... probability was that that was going to tail significantly.  I think at the time, I was concerned myself that we could have been facing a recession.  Now, a recession would be a very technical thing, a small drop in growth.  We never envisaged a depression.</p></speech>

I'll move on to the next question.  You were a board member of the Central Bank ... you were the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, you had a birds-eye view in relation to both prudential supervision, the stability of the financial sector, and also the issues in relation to the Department.  Given everything that was happening in public, and I'll just mention a number of them: we had in January of 2008 we had UBS telling there investors to sell shares in Anglo Irish Bank; we had Fitch coming out with critique in relation to Anglo Irish Bank; we had an attack by the markets in relation to the banking sector; we had the issue that was revealed sometime at least round February March in relation to the contracts for difference issue in Anglo Irish Bank.  We had all of that and the construction and obviously the Central Bank had the whole access to information in terms of concentration of lending in the property sector, and concentration of individuals.  Why did you, or can you convince us otherwise, take no action to deal with the tsunami that was facing the Irish State in relation to this?</p></speech>

The lending had all been incurred.  The problem, as Patrick said, was sitting in there waiting to pop out.  What I did hear at the Central Bank was a lot of concern about potential exposure in the market, but I also heard was the ... the risk analysis that they did in their financial stability reports in late 2006 and late 2007 which said, "Yes we're concerned, yes there looks like the property is overvalued ... we've looked at this and our conclusion is that even with a market correction, the banks are well placed to cope with the pressures that could emerge.''  As I said, we were at fault for accepting that analysis.</p></speech>

And you mentioned that Merrill Lynch said this is tip of the finger tips, or some language of that sort.  Top of the finger tips data, it wasn't an indepth data.  The question I'm really putting to you is, given your position as General Secretary of the Department of Finance for a number of years, given your position as a board member of the Central Bank, do you think it was appropriate that we had to rely on that type of tip of the finger tips data, or whatever suggestion that you had, no real indepth analysis of where the losses could be in the banks?  Could a bright idea not have been, to look in at the start of 2008, to send a team into Anglo Irish Bank when the markets were saying there was going to be losses in terms of their loan book, and actually assess that?  So there would at least be a bit more concrete data on the table when the decision had to be taken on the night.</p></speech>

Can I ask you in relation to the guarantee itself ... and explain this to me because I've not been ... we've not been able to get this at the committee so far.  The guarantee was announced by Government.  When did the banks, legally ... when were we contracted, bound by the guarantee?  There's evidence here in the book, I think, which talks about ... it's page 26, Vol. 3, which says that on Friday, 24 October, it was in "[the] order [to designate] the first group of banks and building societies to participate in the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 ..." was made on Friday, 24 October 2008.  It's also the same month where the Minister starts to make provision for contingent capital to be made available to the banks.  So my question to you is: were we actually, as a State, legally bound by a guarantee on the night of the guarantee, or was it when the banks signed up to the scheme and the order was signed on the 24th?  And at that stage, did we know that these banks would be requiring at least some capital?</p></speech>

When the announcement was made, there was a moral statement made.  The legislation, I think, was passed on the 3rd.  It was introduced the next day and I think it was passed within a day or two.  I can get a precise answer for you from the Department for that, or you can ask Kevin - he will know on the spot - when he's in.</p></speech>

So it was actioned from that point on, once the smoke had cleared on the outcome of the guarantee, the initial smoke.</p></speech>

I've given my view in my opening statement today, which I think covers the decade prior to 2008, in which I said that I felt that the regulator didn't get involved adequately in assessing the real position surrounding the loan books of the banks.  They accepted too readily the analysis that the banks made, that they were making huge profits, which went on over quite a number of years.</p></speech>

You had people doing their stability report who said there are risks, but there's no fundamental issues arising, and there's no threat to financial stability.  So the Department didn't, on foot of that, take action.  What it did do in relation to the brief the Department had on the fiscal front was to urge caution and moderation on spending and taxation.</p></speech>

In relation to imposition of fines, I do recall them imposing fines on one particular organisation which I, I don't propose to mention, Chairman, on foot of an issue that was brought to them by the auditor of that organisation, and that, as I understand, was actioned and might have led to some penalties; and there were other penalties emerged.

So, a few brief questions following on from your earlier evidence today.  You said earlier on that accepting the consensus view of the soft landing was a mistake.  But were you not a part of formulating that consensus view ... in that language soft landing?  Because we heard in evidence from Tom O'Connell about the 2007 financial stability report which talked about favouring a soft landing over a hard landing.  Professor Honohan told us that there was no evidence in that report and there is none to back up that assertion and Mr. O'Connell told us that that language came from the board, which you sat on at the time.  Do you remember that conversation about putting that language into the document?</p></speech>

I've a vague recollection of being sent a draft of some document by Tom O'Connell, whether it was 2007 or 2006, I don't know or what the document was.  Following a discussion of the board, board members might be sent documents that want to ... "Is this okay? Does it reflect your views?"  I might have put something in and I recall the only instance I ever got that was I sent it back to them and said, "You have editorial control."</p></speech>

At that point, one bank, no one would lend to one bank in the Irish economy.  In another bank, no Irish bank would lend to.  The Governor and the Financial Regulator were approaching each of the banks and asking them to lend to each other.  That was the green jersey agenda.  &euro;20 billion had been wiped off bank shares in Ireland since the beginning of the year and there was a feared run on one bank, which led to intervention.  So why not move in then?  Why not take the opportunity then to seek a resolution?</p></speech>

Was it international speculation, was it caused by some of the speculation on shares that was going on that we ... would be difficult to go through?  Was it ... was it based on analytical evidence on what the true story in the banks was or was it just an Irish ... an anti-Irish story?  Or did it reflect the common things that were happening across Europe, the UK, the massive downward trend in share prices generally?  Now, the trend in Irish share prices was more.  But there was ... there was clouded thinking there.  There was a cloud, you know, was there a real Irish problem or was it an international problem?</p></speech>

Irish banks weren't each other.  The Financial Regulator and the Governor were going to the banks asking them to lend to each other.  And they were or were not ignoring them.

There was no analysis from the regulator or the Central Bank that an actual intervention was necessary.  There was stand-by arrangements being pushed through that consultative process with the bank and the regulator and the Department to prepare for an event, an event in the future.  The event hadn't crystalised.  Possibly, if you had stepped forward with an announcement at the ... at the time that the Government was going to stand behind the banks and provide capital, that might have calmed the market down.  But the reality ... like what the real problem was that when it came to the crunch and the problem was created by the explosion increase, explosive increase, in credit rolled out by the banks - when it came to the crunch, they assets that they had lined up, particularly on the development side weren't remotely near worth what their loans that they should ... for those assets.</p></speech>

That was the story.  As I said originally at the outset, it is a matter of regret that the Department accepted that analysis of the banks, the regulator and the Central Bank.</p></speech>

I'm just going to move to wrapping things up.  I have just one or two questions that remain outstanding and I just need to round off some matters with you as well, and then I'll invite the two leads and bring matters to a conclusion.  If there is anything you'd further like to add at that time Mr. Doyle you are more than welcome to.  If I could just return to the issue or, or get into the area of the troika bailout programme and Ireland's contribution to it.  The bailout programme was of &euro;85 billion, &euro;17.5 billion came from a National Pensions Reserve Fund and that's excluding bond redemptions from NAMA disposals.  Could you maybe please elaborate to the committee the main features of the discussions with the troika, bilaterally with our EU partners and particular, if the &euro;17.5 billion, as mentioned with regard to the National Pensions Reserve Fund, was presented as a precondition for assistance in that programme?</p></speech>

I think to provide for directed ... directive investment powers in relation to the fund.  So, obviously that translated into action later on.</p></speech>

There was a mechanism envisaged in the draft legislation to ... to deal with the shareholder residual value and a process of assessment and determination and appeal and so on, and that's all in the legislation ... in the January legislation.  But from ... from, as I said, from the middle of October on, Kevin and his team moved on to considering what are the real financial needs of ... of the ... of Anglo.  And the initial figure that was put on that was about a ... a billion and a half.  I recall the company asserting, throughout that last quarter, that a billion in extra capital will see them right and they were confident that major investors were going to supply that ... that equity.  So when ... when the State did move in to nationalise, the ... the quantification of the likely capital hadn't been determined.  The Government nationalised to take Anglo off the agenda and to stand behind the banking system.</p></speech>

I want to come back to your tenure, which is, on that eve ... was a costing put on how much it would cost to nationalise Anglo?  You say ... you've indicated there that part of the nationalisation process would be to take out the shareholder base.  That's one cost eliminated immediately.  There's also the borrowings that ... and the lending exposure that Anglo had.  So were you ... was there discussions of that nature as to how much Anglo ... it would cost to nationalise it?  At the guarantee time, now.</p></speech>

There was no ... there was no figure put on it because what the Government was ... was going to contemplate at that time ... it was standing in to stop the ... the bank sinking.

To conclude that they were all solvent you would have to be absolutely certain that the assets were in each company to back up those loan exposures.

That's it.  In the ... in the fourth paragraph of that, it says - one second there now - &quot;Surely the objective of the guarantee of&quot; ... and this is October '08 now, I'll remind.<blockquote><br /><br />Surely the objective of the guarantee of this dated subordinated debt from our point of view is to give the covered institutions the ability to access at least two-year term funding to reduce their reliance on short-term funding, thereby avoiding the liquidity squeeze.  If any covered institution was to issue term debt with a maturity longer than two years, then the market would want to be compensated for that by an appropriate step up in interest rate pricing and that would be entirely commercial.&quot;</blockquote>So basically what they're saying there is that the guarantee is going to be called in, or would be called in in that regard.  So, can I put the question to you, Mr. Doyle: did this structure or design of the banking guarantee, along with the period of duration as outlined here, have any relationship to the Irish State entering a bailout programme two years and two months later, after the banking guarantee had expired?</p></speech>

The price of not doing that, of letting them fail and ruin the country would have been far greater, so if you're subtracting the answer to that second bit from the first bit, it didn't have a cost, but there was a huge cost and the cost was caused by that drastic increase in lending by the banks.

Then even prior to that, on 24 April, the Department of Finance, page 21 ... document 21, Vol. 2, you're preparing ... your ... within your Department, you're looking to put in place a guarantee for institutions.  So, it would appear as if you were doing some contingency planning, at least, what, nearly five months out?  So the question I'm asking is, there appears to the ... in terms of resolution mechanism legislation, it was mentioned at some stage but it never seemed to get anywhere.   Why did you get to a point on the night of the guarantee where ... or two quick questions, did you ... was it your understanding prior to the meeting the night of the guarantee that you would be nationalising Anglo?  And, why was there no resolution mechanism legislation in place?  How much did ye pay Merrill Lynch, and why did ye ignore the advice of Merrill Lynch and who was driving on the night of the guarantee ... the blanket guarantee would be put in place?</p></speech>

The commercial property market continued to slide.  That was the big impact on the banks, not the housing market, strangely enough, although that was a big impact.  But the big issue was the development loan portfolio.  The quantification of that ... was extremely slow coming, it didn't really ... it didn't come until NAMA became operational and they started to get the loan portfolios over and they saw precisely what was behind them or, more relevant, what wasn't behind them in many cases, and what the reality of the valuation ... the valuation of the property on the ground was.  If they had had ... sight that all that was going to happen, combined with the international recession that was going on, combined with the collapse in domestic confidence, and investor confidence generally, they would have come up with a bigger figure, but they didn't.</p></speech>

But there's one reference on page 30 of his report where he says ''And, in a final twist, real expenditure rose by over 11 per cent in both 2007 and 2008, an unfortunate late burst of spending which boosted the underlying deficit at almost the worst possible time.''  What was the advice that you were giving, at that time, to Government about spending, going into 2007 and going into 2008?  The outturn was an increase of about 11%, in both years.</p></speech>

For capital expenditure, the recommended increase, from the notes I have, was 9.5%.  The outturn was 20% in 2007.  In 2008, the recommended current increase was 7% and the outturn was about 10%.</p><p>The recommendation on capital was 13%; the outcome was 16%.  And there's a consistent pattern, if you look back over the years, of the Department urging moderation in relation to current outlays and the outturn, at the end of the day, being significantly ahead of that.  On capital, we were positively disposed, I suppose, towards capital, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, because we had concluded at the end of the '90s that the country had a major infrastructural deficit, that there was an opportunity on the fiscal front because of the improvement that was happening to make significant investments in our capital, motorways and so on, and we felt that that opportunity had to be taken over the decade, early 2002 to 2012, because our feeling was that after that period, demographic pressures would start crowding out investment.</p></speech>

There is, on the basis that all evidence has to be tested, one evidential narrative would be that Minister Lenihan, on the night of the guarantee, was overruled by the Taoiseach and some suggestion has that been made.  Can you concur or do you ... with that suggested evidential narrative or do you have a different view in it or could you care to offer an opinion from your observations on that night?</p></speech>
