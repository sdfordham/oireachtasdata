Are they agreed to?  Agreed.  </p><p>  The following is the correspondence received since the meeting of 25 April.  No. 3A is correspondence from Accounting Officers.  No. 3A.1 is correspondence, dated 30 April 2013, from Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Keeffe, chief executive, Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, providing information requested at the meeting of 18 April.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  </p><p>  No. 3B is individual correspondence.  No. 3B.1 is correspondence, dated 22 March 2013, from an anonymous source regarding the abuse of the free travel pass scheme.  The correspondence is to be noted and forwarded to the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for necessary follow-up action.  </p><p>  No. 3B.2 is correspondence, dated 25 March 2013, from Mr. Michael Brosnan, North Circular Road, Dublin 7, regarding cases involving Mr. Harry O&rsquo;Reilly who is seeking certain information from the Property Registration Authority.  The correspondence is to be noted.  While this appears to be outside the remit of the committee, we will ask the Property Registration Authority to send us a note on the matter.  </p><p>  No. 3B.3 is correspondence, received on 25 April from an anonymous source, regarding the maintenance of rolling stock by Irish Rail.  The correspondence is to be noted and forwarded to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Transport Authority for necessary follow-up action.  Presumably, they will come back to us on the matter.  </p><p>  No. 3B.4 is correspondence, dated 24 April 2013, from Mr. Eugene Mitchell, Ballinasloe, County Galway, regarding flooding in Ballinasloe and the alleged waste of public money by Galway County Council.  The correspondence is to be noted.  While this is a matter primarily for the local authority, we will forward the correspondence to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and ask it for its response.  </p><p>  No. 3C is documents relating to the committee meeting of 2 May.  No. 3C.1 is correspondence, received on 30 April from Mr. John Tierney, chairman, Dublin Docklands Development Authority, regarding the opening statement.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  </p><p>  No. 3C.2 is correspondence, received on 1 May from Ms Geraldine Tallon, Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, regarding the opening statement.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  </p><p>  Reports, statements and accounts received since the meeting of 25 April include those for the Athlone Institute of Technology and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  </p><p>  Our work programme is now on screen.  On Monday the special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the administration of the national health and local authority levy fund was published.  It is to be factored in to the work programme.  I will ask the clerk to the committee to produce a briefing note for next week's meeting on how we will continue the examination of this issue.  I propose that we dispose of the report before the summer recess.  This committee and its predecessor have examined the issue.  Perhaps we might find an early date to deal with it because it dates back to the last committee meeting.</p></speech>

The agenda will be the 2011 annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, chapter 11 - VAT on intra-Community trade.  Is that the only issue to be discussed?</p></speech>

Agreed.  </p><p>  Before calling the witnesses, Mr. Tierney is here as chairman of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  We will be dealing with the issue of departmental oversight.  I understand Mr. Tierney will make an opening statement, but he may have to leave early because he has another commitment.  We can always come back to the issue.</p></speech>

He is taking over at Irish Water this week.  The committee has already agreed that it will be bringing him back to consider the accounts of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority which will be the subject of a full meeting.  The purpose of this meeting is primarily to deal with the issue of departmental oversight.</p></speech>

Each of us could then choose the areas we wanted to discuss.  My understanding is that the Dublin Docklands Development Authority is moving to Dublin City Council and that, as the current city manager, he has had responsibility for that area.  I would like to know whether, once he finishes at the council, he will continue to have a separate role in respect of the authority.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-02a.48" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013050200004#C01000"><p>Given the elapse of time since the committee last considered this matter, I propose to outline briefly the background to and the key findings made in the report.  On the basis that the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, was a State body operating with a commercial mandate, the audit of the authority's financial statements was carried out by a commercial auditing firm up to and including 2009.  The first financial audit of the authority by my office was carried out for the financial year ending 31 December 2010.  In that context, the special report before the committee was prepared to give a full account of the overall financial position of the authority and significant events that had contributed to its difficulties.</p><p>  The authority's financial statements for 2010 reported a deficit of almost &euro;2 million for the year.  At the end of 2010, the authority had current liabilities of &euro;32 million, including a bank overdraft of &euro;12 million.  Its capacity to fund itself depended on the continuing availability of banking facilities until such time as it could liquidate its property assets and collect its debts.  Because it had limited cash reserves, any failure to realise projected income or any requirement to advance the timing of payment liabilities would have required the identification of other sources of funding.</p><p>  The authority reported a surplus of just over &euro;1 million for 2011 and had liabilities at year end of more than &euro;26 million.  The audit of the financial statements for 2012 has not yet commenced because draft financial statements have not been provided.  </p><p>  A key factor contributing to the authority's strained financial position was its participation in a joint venture with private developers to buy and develop the Irish Glass Bottle site.  In October 2006 the authority and its partners in a joint venture company, Becbay Limited, agreed to bid &euro;412 million for the Irish Glass Bottle site in Poolbeg.  Other related expenses brought the total acquisition cost to &euro;431 million, of which &euro;291 million was borrowed.  The authority provided equity and loan funding for the joint venture company and guaranteed the repayment of loans by Becbay Limited which were initially provided by the then Anglo Irish Bank.  Subsequently, Becbay Limited's loans, which I understand by then were in excess of &euro;345 million, were taken over by the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  A settlement was agreed between the authority and NAMA in 2011 under which the authority agreed to transfer to NAMA a portfolio of property assets to settle sums due under the guarantee.  Ultimately, the cost to the authority of its involvement in the Irish Glass Bottle site purchase was around &euro;52 million.</p><p>  The examination noted a number of concerns regarding the authority's decision to become involved in the Becbay Limited venture.  In October 2006 the authority's management presented to the executive board an assessment of the level of investment, benefits and risks of the project, but there is no evidence that a detailed analysis of these factors, commensurate with the scale of the proposed investment, was carried out.  Management advised the board that the property market was overheated, but it nevertheless recommended the investment for strategic reasons.</p><p>  The authority did not obtain its own independent valuation when it was deciding on the bid that Becbay Limited should make for the site.  After the bid had been lodged, Becbay Limited engaged professional valuers who confirmed, for bank borrowing purposes, that the value of the site as at 3 November 2006 was &euro;412 million - the exact amount of the bid.  The authority had to seek ministerial approval to increase its borrowing capacity up to the statutory limit of &euro;127 million and engage in the joint venture.  The information submitted to support the application stated the value of the site was approximately &euro;220 million.  It appears that the authority did not update the Department when it decided to bid almost double that amount.  Consequently, consent by both the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for increased borrowing and the authority's participation in the joint venture was evidently given on the understanding an investment to the value of approximately &euro;220 million was being contemplated.</p><p>  The critical factor in the Departments' assessment of the application for approval of increased borrowing and participation in the joint venture was the authority's capacity to service the borrowing involved.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government received assurance from the authority that it had the capacity to service the borrowing without recourse to Exchequer resources.  The audit found no evidence of a formal analysis by the Department in that regard, or any testing of the sensitivity of the authority's servicing capacity to different outturns for the joint venture.  The Department has stated it would have undertaken a full assessment if Exchequer funds had been sought.</p><p>  In the course of the examination my office reviewed the management by the executive board of conflicts of interest around the decision to invest in the joint venture.  Clearly, there is a risk of conflicts of interest occurring in any situation where boards of State bodies include persons either with an interest in a business that is regulated by the body, or which provides services for the body.  In the case of the decision to purchase the Irish Glass Bottle site, some board members disclosed their connections as directors of banks that were providing project finance and these were handled as provided for in the authority's code of practice.  The executive board minutes do not record disclosure of any other personal, professional or business interests of board members that could represent a conflict of interest in relation to the decision to acquire the Irish Glass Bottle site.</p><p>  The examination looked at the response of the authority to the findings of the High Court in October 2008 in a case taken against the authority regarding a section 25 application, which is a form of planning permission.  In response to the case the authority amended its section 25 application process in December 2008.  Owing to the substantial reduction in the number and scale of planning applications received by the authority since the conclusion of the High Court case, there was limited scope for my office to examine the effectiveness of the revised procedures in the course of this examination.</p></speech>

There are now ten bodies, of varied scale and functions, under its aegis compared with over 20 five years ago.  As the committee is aware, the Government decided in May 2012, following publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report, to begin winding up the DDDA over an 18 month period.</p><p>  Each agency has a statutory basis, with a board and an executive responsible for its operation.  The Department is represented, as provided for in the relevant legislation, on the boards of a minority of these agencies.  Each agency operates within the framework of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies which assigns to the board collective responsibility for the body's activities.</p></speech>

I was appointed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to this position on 1 June 2012, with a new board.  The remit of the new board was set out by the Minister in his statement of 31 May 2012.  At the time the Minister envisaged that the authority would remain <i>in situ</i> for a transition period of 18 months and then be wound up.  This transitional period was to allow the authority to progress elements of ongoing work and make the necessary preparations for the orderly winding up of the authority and migration to new arrangements to be decided by the Government.  The board prepared a transition business plan to achieve the objectives requested by the Minister.  I take the opportunity to highlight some of the key issues we are dealing with as part of the transition.  </p><p>  The context for our work was outlined by the Minister at the time of our appointment.</p></speech>

I am very grateful for the opportunity to make a statement and relate the facts from my point of view in regard to the IGB site.  I was the assistant secretary in the planning division of the then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government from June 2000 to October 2007.  I was appointed by the Minister to be a director on the board of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority for the same period.  I had no executive functions as a member of the board.</p><p>  The authority had been established under the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act 1997 to secure the social and economic regeneration of the Dublin docklands area on a sustainable basis and had the power to acquire, hold and manage land for these purposes.  The authority was self-financing with a commercial mandate.</p><p>  In early October 2006, the executive of the authority recommended to the board that the authority should get involved with a development partner in the development of the IGB site to achieve its statutory objectives for the social and economic development of the whole docklands area and the objectives in the authority's 2003 masterplan.</p><p>  The Poolbeg peninsula area was clearly underdeveloped.  The authority had previous experience that where it owned land, it was better able to influence the delivery of the less commercial land uses such as social infrastructure.  The authority's Grand Canal Dock development was seen as very successful.  I believed that acquisition of an interest in the IGB site fitted in with this policy and, therefore, was an appropriate objective for the authority and in line with the objective of the masterplan.</p><p>  The CEO of the authority wrote to me in my capacity as assistant secretary on 2 October and 12 October seeking ministerial approval under the 1997 Act to borrow up to the statutory limit of &euro;127 million and approval under the code of practice for the governance for State bodies to participate in a joint venture to acquire the IGB site.  I referred the correspondence to the business section to consider the applications and consult the authority and the Department of Finance.  </p><p>  The Department wrote to the Department of Finance seeking the consent of the Minister for Finance.  On 19 October 2006, the Department made a submission seeking the Minister's approval for the authority to incur borrowings up to the statutory limit provided for under the 1997 Act and purchase shares in a joint venture company.</p></speech>

The reason this is particularly significant is that this is the first minuted example we have of discussions regarding the cost.  I refer to section or paragraph 1.3 of document R909, in which it is stated: "The executive recommended that the authority should make a joint bid with Mr. McNamara, developer, to acquire the site for a sum in the range of &euro;275 million to &euro;375 million".  The first point is that here we have confirmation of a figure in respect of the site.  We also have a letter which had been issued prior to that meeting, on 12 October, from Mr. Paul Moloney, found in correspondence 3A.1.</p></speech>

The letter dated 12 October was to Ms Moylan, a member of the board, and included a figure of &euro;220 million.  Ms Moylan attended a meeting some eight days later and the discussion was on a figure ranging from &euro;275 million to &euro;375 million.  Did she ask why there was such a variation?</p></speech>

A number of issues arise.  The Minister's approval was being sought for the increase in the borrowing limit and also for entering into the joint venture.  The actual price to be paid for the land and the related commercial decision were matters for the authority.  The Minister had no function in that regard.</p><p>  With regard to the values discussed at the meeting on 20 October, they were discussed in the context of an explanation from the chief executive of the basis for the valuations.  They were also discussed in the context of the authority taking a 26% share in the company and of what the total investment of the authority would be.</p></speech>

I have a letter from Mr. Moloney, chief executive of the board, to Ms Moylan, including a figure of &euro;220 million.  In the minutes of a board meeting, attended by Mr. Moloney, there is a figure ranging from &euro;275 million to &euro;375 million.  There is a gigantic difference between them.  Did Mr. Moloney not indicate this to Ms Moylan and the board?  The issue is that he was seeking departmental consent for a different figure from the one the board was discussing.  Why was there a difference and why did nobody quiz him on it?  Specifically, why did Ms Moylan not raise the issue because the letter was sent to her?</p></speech>

In relation to the book valuation of some &euro;250 million [I think that is a typographical error] which had been included in the Authority's submission to the Minister, it was noted that this figure was based on a plot ratio of 2:1 and on the basis that the Authority would be acquiring some 49% of the shareholding in the company (as opposed to 26% in the current transaction). </blockquote>Therefore, the value of the site had varied in relation to plot ratios and the commercial and residential mix being proposed.  Also, I remind the Deputy that the Minister's sanction was not being sought for the actual purchase price.</p></speech>

The letter including the figure of &euro;220 million was dated 12 October.  I will get to the minutes of the meeting of 24 October in a moment.  The letter to the Department mentions a figure of &euro;220 million, but the board discussed a figure as high as &euro;375 million.  The value did not vary by that much.  There was no change in plot density and commercial value in the weeks from when the letter issued to the Department to when the discussion took place.  Why was Mr. Moloney writing to Ms Moylan with a figure of &euro;220 million when the board was discussing a figure of up to &euro;375 million?  Given that the letter had been sent to Ms Moylan, did she ask why there was such a discrepancy?  The issue of ministerial consent is separate.</p></speech>

With regard to the discussion that took place on 20 October, at that stage valuations were fluid.  There was a variety of valuations available to the authority, ranging from &euro;240 million plus VAT in 2005, with a plot ratio of 2:1.  There was a valuation in 2005 and 2006 of &euro;264 million, based on a plot ratio of 2.5:1.  Ultimately, the plot ratio agreed on 20 October and 24 October was 2.6:1, on the basis of it being 70% residential and 30% commercial.  Therefore, there were variations in the value of the site as the discussions and negotiations continued.</p></speech>

That is one hell of a variation.</p></speech>

The letter dated 12 October was on the basis of a valuation of &euro;220 million.  At the board meeting on 3 October it was recognised that a range of valuations was possible, depending on plot ratios and the development mix.</p></speech>

I accept that she has given me an answer, but I challenge it, as I still want to understand why there was such a difference.  As she has pointed to the meeting of 24 October, I will move on to discuss what happened at that meeting.

This meeting took place with the majority of people taking part via telephone.  I want to go on to the particular issue of declaration of interest.  Paragraph 2.3 states: "members were concerned that to some people there might be a perception of conflict but following further discussion it was agreed that such perceived conflict, if it was ever alleged, would have to be dealt with by declaring the facts of the situation".  How was that conflict dealt with at that meeting?</p></speech>

On 24 October, the chairman informed the meeting that Mr. McNamara was now seeking financing from Anglo Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland, and in accordance with the code of practice, he declared that he was a non-executive director of that bank.  Another board member declared that he was the chairman of that bank and a further board member declared that he was a non-executive director of the Bank of Ireland.</p></speech>

In the report, the references to withdrawal relate to the meeting of 3 November.  For the meeting on 24 October they continued to participate having declared their interest.  The withdrawals on 3 November related to proposals for funding, that is, a specific proposal of lending X amount at such a price or interest rate and so on.  That was when members of the executive board withdrew from the meeting.  They continued to participate in this meeting having declared their interest.</p></speech>

They stayed in the meeting.  That is a helpful clarification.  According to the minutes of the meeting at paragraph 2.1, the chairman drew attention to the fact that he and the chief executive had been advised by Mr. McNamara at 8.30 p.m. the previous night that Mr. McNamara had been in discussions with Bank of Ireland and Anglo Irish Bank to secure the acquisition funding.  Those two banks were named.</p></speech>

They declared that they were non-executive directors of the banks.  They said that they were not involved in any credit decisions relating to particular funding.  That is stated at the end of paragraph 2.1.  It is stated in paragraph 2.2: "in the course of full discussion on this and recognising the provisions of the code of conduct, the board concluded that no material conflict of interest existed in respect of the participation by the board members in the discussion and the decision on the proposed acquisition".  Subsequently, the board asked that the authority's legal advisers examine the manner in which the board had looked at and dealt with these declarations of interest in light of the code of practice, and the legal advice that came back was that it had been handled correctly and in accordance with the code of practice.</p></speech>

I understand there was a 26% stake and that the cap was in place.  I also contend, as the figure increased exponentially, notwithstanding the presence of the cap, the Department should have been aware of that.  The original figure was &euro;220 million, a figure of &euro;375 million was mentioned in a board meeting and the eventual figure was &euro;411 million.  Does Ms Moylan see my concerns?</p></speech>

The simple point in all of this is that we have a figure of &euro;375 million and a final figure of &euro;411 million which differ massively to the only written communication I have to the Department.  The Chairman has been very generous in terms of time with me.</p><p>  In her concluding paragraph, Ms Tallon states: "I am sure the committee will appreciate the risks in reaching conclusions even in this component of the committee's examination without hearing all relevant witnesses as this could lead to potentially unbalanced and incomplete findings."

The Department dealt with, in particular, the subsequent chairman, Professor Brennan.  Obviously the Department had a role.  Ultimately, Ministers and the Government had various roles, as far as the evolving situation was concerned.</p></speech>

I want to quote from <i>The FitzPatrick Tapes</i> by Tom Lyons and Brian Carey, to which I have referred in other committee meetings.  Mr. FitzPatrick said:<blockquote><br />There was little discussion at board level about whether Mr. McNamara was the right man for the job as his reputation spoke for itself ... Bernard was an established builder and developer.  He had done a lot of successful work.  He had dealt with the docklands over the years and seemed to have a good relationship with them.  No one thought he was a difficult man or anything like that.  </blockquote>It goes on to say he was doing civil engineering and development, and seemed to be doing everything.</p><p>  Ms Moylan has answered all the questions I put to her as well as she can.  In order to get a full view of what has happened here it is important for us to get a full assessment of what happened.  I agree with Ms Tallon.  We should invite Mr. Bradshaw, Mr. FitzPatrick, Mr. Moloney and other members of the board who were involved at the time under discussion to come before the committee. We owe it to the people who have contributed to the hearings to date to gain a full understanding of what happened in regard to the selection of a developer and how there were such huge variations in cost while the Department had only a single figure that was substantially lower.</p></speech>

I must admit I am on the same page as Ms Tallon with regard to completing this circle.  I thank Ms Moylan for being as frank as she possibly can be, under the circumstances.  We will not be able to complete the picture in the absence of evidence from other individuals named.  At our previous effort to examine these issues, I had requested that Mr. Moloney, Mr. Bradshaw and Mr. FitzPatrick make themselves available to meet the committee in an effort to examine all the issues in as complete a way as possible.  I welcome the decision of the committee to extend that invitation.  To coin a phrase, there is no show without Punch.  It is very important that those critical players in this process make themselves available to allow us to complete the picture in so far as we can.</p><p>  I am particularly interested in the issue of ministerial sanction.  I refer Ms Moylan to minute No. 8.2 of the meeting of 24 October.  This was a critical meeting in the context of the issues under examination today.  It is stated in the minutes that the board noted that ministerial sanction to increase borrowing and the acquisition of shares in the company was expected to be received during the day.  Ms Moylan stated in her evidence and from our own examination of this issue that it was indeed a very fast-paced environment.  I ask Ms Moylan to clarify whether the reference to ministerial sanction was made by her.  How could the meeting have had the confidence that ministerial sanction would be received that day from the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and, as is required, from the Minister for Finance?</p></speech>

The submission to him mentioned the value of &euro;220 million.  It also stated that negotiations with the private developer were ongoing and that it was proposed that the authority would acquire between 25% and 49% of the joint venture company, depending on the equity acquired.  This would entail an indicative borrowing requirement of between approximately &euro;55 million and &euro;110 million.</p></speech>

He agreed in principle with the recommendations that the authority be allowed to incur borrowings up to its statutory limit and to purchase shares in the venture company.</p></speech>

I considered that the investment by the authority which was capped at &euro;36 million and the investment of 26% in the shareholding of the company was within the terms that had been agreed in principle by the Minister on 19 October.  Given that the Minister did not have a role in relation to the purchase price, there was no need for me to speak to the Minister about it on 24 October.</p></speech>

Hindsight is 20-20 vision.

I was taking care in relation to my role as a board member and my role in the Department.  In the circumstances of the time, I made the judgment that I made.  As I look back now, it would have been better if the Minister had been told of the final bid price, even though his approval was not necessary.

Did that cause Ms Moylan any concern?  We all respect and value the public service.  We are in lucky in this country that we have a public service that delivers for the taxpayer and the citizen.  There is a view that public servants, by their nature, tend to be risk averse and that they provide excellent advice and are very prudent and balanced in their dealings.  With the way this situation evolved so rapidly over a period of two to three weeks, surely Ms Moylan's best instincts caused her to put her hand up and say, "Hold on, that is an extraordinary statement to make".  This was extraordinary latitude to give one individual in the context of a situation like this.  Has Ms Moylan any concerns about how this situation was evolving given her function as a civil servant of some repute and experience?  Did a red light go on in her mind about giving Bernard McNamara or anybody this kind of latitude?</p></speech>

The authority's investment was linked to that amount of &euro;375 million about which the authority was satisfied.  In this paragraph it was noted earlier that Mr. McNamara believed that a higher bid should be made and he offered to fund a higher bid.  The higher bid above &euro;375 million was being funded by Mr. McNamara and the authority was not being exposed to that.  That was the context of it.</p></speech>

There are indications in the documentation we have to suggest that advice was offered to the board that the market was overheating.  One would not need to be an expert to understand that this particular development and a bid of this nature would be particularly risky.  Did Ms Moylan ever personally identify any of those risks?  Did she ever express the view at a meeting, sub-committee meeting or board meeting about the need for more cautious?</p></speech>

What was important as the negotiations developed was that various measures were taken to protect the authority's interests and these included, as I said, the valuation of &euro;375 million being regarded by the authority as a reasonable valuation and the 26% shareholding.  The venture was being financed by a 30% equity and 70% borrowing with the borrowing being secured against the site.  We also were being advised by professional advisers and care was being taken to protect the authority's interests.  What was emerging was that the authority's exposure was going to be limited to &euro;36 million in terms of the equity and the recourse finance in relation to the borrowing.  The authority had assets of &euro;100 million at that stage, &euro;30 million of which was in cash.  The shareholders' agreement between the authority and Mr. McNamara was to protect the authority's interests and to make sure that they were protected.</p></speech>

The position on that appears bizarre and incredulous.  It is akin to Lannigan's Ball where Sean FitzPatrick and Lar Bradshaw stepped in and then stepped out, and Declan McCourt stepped out again.  We identified that and discussed it at a previous meeting.  I do not necessarily want to reflect on it, but did Ms Moylan feel uncomfortable with that level of interest?  I accept what is contained in the minutes.  That was the view of the board and its members have explained it in the context of the minutes, but did Ms Moylan personally feel uncomfortable with any potential conflict of interest that may have arisen?</p></speech>

All of us rely on our colleagues making the appropriate declarations.  They were members of the board and, with hindsight, it probably would be better if they did not have these interests at the time but, as I said, it was a board of experts.  They had been appointed for their expertise and in such cases it is difficult to avoid conflicts of interest in individual transactions.</p></speech>

They were people with considerable experience and expertise and at that time had a long and considerably successful record in property development and banking.  Given their level of experience and the perception that prevailed at the time with some people being of the view that some of these individuals should have been running the country, God forbid, did Ms Moylan ever feel bounced into making a decision with which she was uncomfortable given what she said, that these people were experts and they had huge expertise as far as she understood the position to be and as far as the board was concerned?</p></speech>

I thank Ms Moylan for attending.  We have all said on many occasions, and I am glad it has been agreed under the proposal from Deputy Donohoe and the Chairman, that the other key players, the missing in action, should be invited to come before this committee.  The Secretary General was correct in her opening remarks when she said it is impossible to get a full picture until some of the key stakeholders appear before us.</p><p>  To counter that, Ms Moylan has given evidence to this committee which was frank and honest but she highlighted that she herself was a key stakeholder.  She was a fully participating member of the board that actively partook in the discussions and the decision-making process that resulted in the debacle that was the Irish Glass Bottle Company site.</p><p>  Much of the detail has been covered by Deputy Donohoe but I want to go back on some of the points.  I apologise if there is any repetition but I am not clear on some points, and they all originate from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The first one is the conclusion in section 3 on the case for investment.  It states:<blockquote>The Executive advised the Board of the Authority that the joint venture bid for the Irish Glass Bottle site would be made in an over-heated commercial property market.  While an assessment of the level of investment, benefits and risks of the project was presented to the Board during the decision-making process, a detailed analysis of those factors does not seem to have been carried out by the Board or the management of the Authority.</blockquote>What I read from that is that Ms Moylan had staff in the authority advising, or at least cautioning, against this venture and presenting analysis to the board suggesting that this venture needed to be re-examined, reconsidered or possibly should not proceed.  Ms Moylan was a board member who partook in the decision to proceed.  Can she explain to me what that environment was like?  What sort of advice was she being given?  Did the executive advise the board not to proceed or did they at least advise Ms Moylan that there was an overheated commercial property market?</p></speech>

Yes, the executive did advise that the tender was being made in the context of an overheated market but the executive went on, nevertheless, to recommend that the authority should get involved in the acquisition of the site.  It is in the paper of 20 October.  It is at the start of the paper in 1.3.  The reference to the bid being made in the context of the overheated commercial market is at paragraph 13.2.2 but at 1.3, in the summary of the document, the executive does recommend that the authority should make a joint bid with Mr. McNamara to purchase the site.</p></speech>

Does Ms Moylan accept or reject that finding?</p></speech>

They considered the various valuations and were satisfied in relation to the plot ratio and previous land purchase prices.  The board had advice from the executive regarding devaluation scenarios in the context of a devaluation of land, although obviously not to the extent to which devaluation ultimately took place.  The authority's capacity to repay the borrowing was considered.  All of that was considered and is part of an assessment of the risk.</p><p>  There was a very tight timeframe regarding this because the site was being sold by tender and the tenders had to be submitted by 25 or 26 October.  Yes, there was an assessment.  There was advice but I think it likely that if a longer time period were available, a more detailed analysis would have been carried out.</p></speech>

The late Tony Gregory, then Deputy Gregory, raised with the then Minister for the Environment, Dick Roche, the potential conflicts of interest on the part of members of the board of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and that this would prevent them from making balanced planning decisions.  The then Minister, Dick Roche, had a bit of a P. Flynn moment - "You should try it sometime".</p></speech>

It demonstrates my lack of knowledge.  What was Ms Moylan's role on the board?  In my view, her appointment as a public servant to the board was, to some degree, in the public interest.  Would she agree with that?  As a senior civil servant from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, would she have been appointed to carry out a public-interest role?  Would she have viewed that her role was to keep an eye on things from the Department's perspective and from a public-interest perspective in addition to honouring her responsibilities as a member of the board?</p></speech>

I was appointed to the board as an ordinary director.  The Act did not provide for ministerial representation on the authority so my duty was to do the best I could in the interest of the docklands area and docklands community.  I did have a public-interest duty along with every other board member.</p></speech>

I am wondering whether Ms Moylan had an extra obligation in regard to keeping the Department and perhaps the Minister informed.  Did she feel she discharged that?  It would be useful to know whether, at any stage, she expressed concern to the Department and whether she had discussions with the Secretary General or Minister on developments in the authority.  What was the level of interaction within the Department?  It is important to know that.  We already know the taxpayer was left extremely exposed.  Ms Moylan told us very frankly that, with hindsight, she perhaps wishes she had had a conversation with the Minister, but I accept that she was not duty bound to have that conversation.  What was the environment like in the Department?  Was the Minister taking an active interest?  Was Ms Moylan talking to the Secretary General and was she making reports?  What were the formal and informal reporting structures?</p></speech>

I suppose the main route of reporting between the authority and the Department and Minister was through the annual report.  The Minister would have met the chairman from time to time.  Aside from that, the sections dealing with the Docklands authority would have had regular dealings with the authority in relation to various matters, such as staffing.  My role was not to report to the Minister on the activities of the board.</p></speech>

I was not there at the time but subsequently I introduced a clear delineation of responsibilities which separated board membership and departmental responsibility.  Ms Moran did not have the luxury of being in that situation.  There is the reality that, under the Docklands legislation, disclosure of confidential information as a member of the board or the council is an offence.  That is quite explicitly stated in the legislation.</p><p>  The 2001 code, which applied at the time, set out the collective responsibility and authority of the board to be safeguarded and at any time the Department is one member of that collective and the board has to take responsibility as a board.  There were clear procedures set out in the code.  Our understanding in so far as the Department was concerned was that they were being observed.  Annual reports, for example, included a compliance statement.  As Deputy Harris and Deputy Nash have identified, this is a bit of a grey area in the code, even in terms of the 2010 protocol that applied to non-commercial semi-State bodies.  This is an area that we think needs to be the subject of live and active engagement by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

One is the political element.  Ms Moylan has alluded to the responsibility of the chairman to report to the Minister.  That is generally the way the communication works between semi-State bodies and relevant Ministers.  Have we an idea how many times the relevant Minister would have met the chairman of the board?  To respond to Ms Tallon's request that we complete the circle &ndash; I do not wish to put words in her mouth &ndash; it is quite important that we look at that element as well.  How many times would the chairman of the board of the authority have met the Minister in a typical year, specifically the year in question?  I am sure all these matters are subject to a massive degree of confidentiality and off-the-record comment, but have we any idea as to what was discussed at the meetings and the outcomes?</p></speech>

There is no indication in 2006 of a meeting between the Minister and the chairman in the Minister's diary for that year.</p></speech>

I refer to the difficult position that Ms Moylan was put in.  I do not want to personalise the matter because any civil servant in her position would have been put in that position.  If one reads the letters going backwards and forwards, as I have done, one will note the circumstances were quite bizarre.  Ms Moylan was a full member of the board, legitimately appointed to meet board responsibilities.  I accept that.  Despite this, the chief executive of the body of which Ms Moylan was a board member was writing to her in her other capacity about decisions made by the board and advancing them within the Department.  It is quite crazy.  Ms Tallon quite correctly stated Ms Moylan was put in a difficult position but we did not put her in that difficult position.</p></speech>

Whether that involved a meeting with the chairman of the board, I am not sure.  However, I note what is reflected in the diary.  Although the first board member was Mr. McCarthy, who is sitting to my left, after a year it became the general practice in the Department that the head of the planning division was appointed by the Minister to the board of the DDDA.</p></speech>

We have learned today that a criticism of the process is the difficult position in which Ms Moylan was put as evidenced by the letters and her need to switch caps.

The authority was established on 1 May 1997 to take over from the preceding Custom House Docks Development Authority.  A docklands area task force was established by the Government in 1996 to chart the transition from the Custom House Docks Development Authority, which had a narrow geographical remit, to a much broader docklands regeneration exercise.  By virtue of my duties in the Department in the urban renewal area, I was the secretary to the task force.  My understanding of the rationale for my appointment to the board of the DDDA by the Minister of the day was that I had knowledge and experience of the task-force work which was of benefit to the authority early in its work.  I was appointed with effect from 1 May 1997 - at the very outset of the new authority - and resigned, to the best of my recollection, in December 2007 when I moved to other duties in the Department.</p></speech>

The committee was discussing this matter previously but its discussions had to come to an end.  As a result, further time has elapsed, which makes it difficult to get to some of the issues.  I appreciate greatly that Ms Moylan is only one of a number of serving board members who are now appearing before the committee.  It is unfortunate if the full weight of our concerns are falling on one person, but it is good to have her before the committee to answer the questions members have.</p><p>  Before I get into the detail of some of its activities, I want to touch on the culture in the board at the relevant time.  As a committee, we often encounter systems failures in Departments which have led to financial mismanagement.  There is also an issue of cultural failures in organisations which lead to financial mismanagement.  This might be a very useful example of that.  Deputy Nash also touched on this issue.  Ms Moylan sat on the board from 2000 to 2007.  When did she leave the board?</p></speech>

At a meeting on 2 November 2006, for example, the chair leaves with another board member but then the replacement chair has to leave too because of a conflict of interest.  From the minutes, it is quite common for people to leave board meetings due to conflicts.  It did not just happen with the Irish Glass Bottle site either but at other meetings dealing with other issues.  Did it strike Ms Moylan as odd that board members would leave because they had, or a company for which they worked had, an investment in the project under discussion?</p></speech>

I just find it odd that so many people on the board seemed to have so many professional interests in the work the authority was doing at the time.  I also find it odd when we discuss conflicts of interest that it is just seen as a perception issue, a perceived conflict of interest rather than actual conflict of interest.</p></speech>

At the meeting on 3 October, the chief executive briefed the board that he had undertaken confidential negotiations with a developer.  The board agreed that he should carry on those negotiations and if they were not successful, he could have discussions with other developers.  The chief executive approached a developer in respect of the paper for 3 October.  However, I believe that developer may not have been Mr. McNamara.</p></speech>

As I said in my opening statement, the authority was involved in trying to deliver the regeneration of the area and improvements in infrastructure and achieving the social and economic development of the area.  It did this partly through its planning function but the authority's experience was that it was much better at delivering less commercially viable development where it had ownership of land.</p></speech>

There had been a meeting the night before on 23 October.  Item 2.1 of the minutes of 24 October states that, "Opening the meeting, the Chairman drew attention to the fact that he and the Chief Executive had been advised by Mr. McNamara at 8.30pm the previous night that Mr. McNamara was in discussions with Bank of Ireland and Anglo Irish Banks in order to secure the acquisition funding".  Item 2.4 states that, "The Chief Executive confirmed that all of the negotiation and preparation of documentation by the Executive had been virtually completed before the issue arose.  He had understood that Mr. McNamara had been in discussion with the Bank of Scotland but was only advised of the Bank of Ireland/Anglo Irish involvement in the same meeting as the Chairman".  I take it that the meeting to which the Chairman was drawing attention at the beginning of the board meeting was the meeting of 23 October at 8.30 p.m.</p></speech>

This is the change.  They thought Bank of Scotland was involved and then there was a change and discussions were being held with Bank of Ireland and Anglo Irish Bank.  Mr. McNamara only told the chairman that the night before the board meeting.  Was Ms Moylan concerned that the people with this interest, who could not stay in the room when it was discussed or decided upon, had a meeting before the board meeting?</p></speech>

I want to look into the detail as the board came to value the site.  A report from the Comptroller and Auditor General from February 2012 states that the board was trying to establish a valuation for the site and:<blockquote><br />[I]n June 2005 the authority had obtained an independent valuation of the property which placed a value of &euro;240 million (exclusive of VAT) on the site.  It was reported to the board on 20 October 2006 as being based on an assumed plot ratio of 2:1.  Two internal appraisals were carried out by the authority in 2005 and 2006, which valued the site at &euro;303 million (based on a plot ratio of 3:1) and &euro;264 million (based on a ratio of 2.5:1) respectively.  However, the authority did not obtain any further independent valuations of the site prior to the bid being placed by the joint venture company in October 2006.</blockquote>Did Ms Moylan ever query the changes in plot ratios proposed, which were driving up the price?</p></speech>

The executive assured the board that the plot ratios and development mix were in accordance with authorities and policies of Dublin City Council.</p></speech>

Their report placed a value of &euro;412 million on the site as at 3 November 2006.</blockquote>In terms of the higher valuations placed on the site by Donatex of up to &euro;430 million, these are based on a plot ratio of 2.6:1, but the report states:<blockquote>The only documentary evidence of this made available on audit was a spreadsheet appraisal which sought to determine the costs, income and developers margin assuming a site cost of &euro;430 million.  While this was discussed at the board meeting on 24 October 2006, the authority has informed me it was not circulated to the board until a meeting on 2 November 2006 which was after the board had agreed to bid for the site.</blockquote>I see justifications for valuations coming in after a decision to bid has been made.</p></speech>

The executive had other valuations of the site, which related the plot ratio to the number of units per hectare and what that development opportunity would realise.  The executive was in consultation with professional advisers and the chief executive advised the meeting on 20 October 2006 on the value of the site, which is when the board agreed that the value of &euro;375 million was a reasonable value having regard to the information the chief executive had presented about plot ratio and the development mix.  There was a discussion on the number of units that would be realised by that type of plot ratio.</p></speech>

There is a distinction between a valuation, which is one particular price arrived at in particular circumstances and based on particular assumptions, and then speculative exercises that would be undertaken asking what would happen if one changed one of the assumptions, say, regarding plot ratio or commercial mix.  That would be the normal exercise one would expect to see undertaken in an investment decision.  It is a useful tool to have that kind of information.  Deputy Harris asked earlier about the point we made in the report about detailed analysis not having been carried out.  One would expect for a proposed investment of approximately &euro;400 million to see quite detailed business and cashflow analysis being done.  There is an element of apples and oranges here, in that sometimes what is quoted is a price based on a business-type analysis, and in other cases it is a valuation based on an exercise carried out by professional valuers.  I hope that is not over-complicating it.</p></speech>

The authority's legal advisers were asked to ensure that the agreement between the authority and its partners was drafted in such a way that protected the authority's interests.  The negotiations with the banks were to be done in the same way, particularly with a view to ensuring that the authority's exposure was capped and that there would be no cross guarantees, that is, the authority would not be liable if its business partners did not meet their obligations.  As to the details of what happened after I left the board, that is probably a matter with which the executive can help the Deputy.</p></speech>

These financial problems were known to the board in 2008, when Ms Moylan left.  It strikes me as odd that, if the authority sought legal advice to protect itself, it then covered the borrowings of the joint venture in its entirety as well as 26% of all interest due and 26% of all cost overruns on the site's remediation, a decision that led to increased exposure and liability.  Does Ms Moylan assert that this information only came to light after she left the board?  As far as she was concerned in November 2006, there was a limited liability.</p></speech>

For the purpose of assisting the Comptroller and Auditor General in preparing his report, given the way the situation has developed in recent years and in preparation for today, the analysis has been built over time.  I would refer to it as being &quot;pulled together&quot; and it is offered in that vein.</p><p>  As Ms Moylan stated, a clear decision was made at the 24 October board meeting to limit the authority's liability to &euro;29 million in shareholders' loans and equity, plus &euro;7 million in recourse finance, totalling &euro;36 million.  On 9 November and as Ms Moylan indicated, the banks raised the issue of a further guarantee of borrowings by the shareholders.  In effect, the banks were seeking shareholder guarantees to cover &euro;100 million of the debt financing.  As a 26% shareholder, the authority would have taken on &euro;26 million of the overall guarantee.  The intention was to cover that amount, plus a <i>pro rata </i>share of interest for a period of two years, and that the total liability should not exceed &euro;35 million.  This was in the shareholders' agreement between the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, Donatex Limited and Mempal Limited as the three shareholders.  The actual guarantee into which the authority entered with the bank provided for a &euro;26 million capital guarantee and a guarantee on 26% of the interest, but there does not seem to have been a reference to the overall &euro;35 million cap on liability, as there had been in the shareholders' agreement.  Obviously, the bank was not a party to the shareholders' agreement and was not bound by it.  The conclusion of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report seems to outline how the exposure increased before ultimately settling on foot of the engagement with NAMA.</p></speech>

As the assistant secretary has said, the set of related documents is extremely complicated.  Again, to try to help with an understanding of it, we need to distinguish between the shareholder's loans and equity element, which the DDDA was putting upfront, and the guarantee figures and the percentages.  One of the difficulties is that the numbers are similar but one is not necessarily talking about the same thing.  We must be careful in going through the issue, as we set out in the report.</p><p>  At the meeting of 24 October 2006, there was a reference to the exposure of the authority being approximately &euro;29 million in shareholder's loans and equity, with an additional &euro;7 million in recourse finance.  That comes to a figure of approximately &euro;36 million, but it is mostly the money the DDDA had to put up.  In the outturn, what it ended up putting in by way of shareholder&rsquo;s equity and loans was approximately &euro;33 million.</p></speech>

Part of the reason for the increase was the remediation of the site, which occurred in 2007.  Additional funding had to be borrowed at that stage and that is one of the reasons refinancing was required.  They had to put up a further tranche of cash, which explains the difference in that regard.  If one goes back to the &euro;7 million in recourse finance that was originally mentioned, it is not clear in the documentation what that was referring to.  It could either have been interest or that this was the extent to which there might be a further guarantee or a further exposure.  The guarantee relates to a commitment given and agreed with the shareholders on how the overall project was to be funded by Becbay.  There was &euro;291 million in lending from Anglo Irish Bank, in the first instance, &euro;100 million of which was to be covered by guarantees.</p></speech>

The balance of the lending - &euro;191 million - was secured against the site.  The undertaking that was entered into with the lenders by the DDDA was 26% of &euro;100 million, therefore &euro;26 million, and 26% of interest accruing for a period of two years, which was the term of the lending at the time.  At that time the liability was capped.  I think that was in the first agreement.  Subsequently, two more guarantees were negotiated, replacing the original.  In the replacement of the guarantee at a later stage, the two-year cap on the interest was lifted.</p></speech>

I ask that the committee be furnished with minutes for the period when this decision was made and in the immediate aftermath.  I wish to see minutes of any meetings held in October that contain references to the Irish Glass Bottle site purchase.</p><p>  I thank Ms Moylan for her testimony today.  In the absence of others being willing to discuss what happened, she has had to take all of the burden of questioning alone.  I thank her for the way in which she has responded to this committee and as the Chairman has said, this committee will do its best to ensure that it can make inquiries of a broader number of people regarding what happened.  I thank her for the way she has contributed to this discussion.</p></speech>

I will ask the clerk to the committee to write to them this week.  We will send them a transcript of this meeting, invite them to appear before us and try to determine the dates on which they will be available to attend.  A number of questions were raised previously and the DDDA has come back to the committee with certain additional information in response to members' questions.  Members will be given that information as soon as possible.</p><p>  I join with my colleagues in thanking Ms Moylan for the information she supplied to us this morning.  She was extremely well prepared and did not hesitate in trying to answer, to the best of her ability, all of the questions that were put to her.  She is to be commended for that.  I hope that the other witnesses we are interested in speaking to will be equally as well prepared as Ms Moylan.  </p><p>  We will not dispose of the report because we have a number of other meetings to be arranged arising from this one.

The next item on the agenda is the scrutiny of EU proposal COM (2013) 133 for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council establishing a framework for maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal management.  At last week's meeting, the committee agreed that this proposal warranted further scrutiny, especially concerning issues surrounding the principle of subsidiarity.  I wish to thank officials from the four Departments concerned for being here today at short notice to explain fully the proposal before us and also to assist the committee in its scrutiny.  The committee can then decide whether it wishes to take any further action.</p><p>  I welcome the following officials: Mr. John Quinlan, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Ms Lorraine O'Donoghue, Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government; Ms Una Dixon, Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources; and Mr. Martin Diskin and Mr. S&eacute;amus Ryan, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I understand that Mr. Quinlan and Ms O'Donoghue will make the opening remarks.  I will then call on members to ask questions, if they have any.  The officials can then respond as they see fit.</p><p>  Before we begin, I wish to bring to their attention the fact that witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  </p><p>  Witnesses are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p></speech>

I will open by providing an overview of the way in which marine issues are being handled at present across the Government.  Some time ago, in recognition of the need for co-ordination and integration among Departments with an interest in marine issues, the Government established a high level marine co-ordination group.  It is chaired by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, and includes representation from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Environment, Community and Local Government, Transport, Tourism and Sport, Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Public Expenditure and Reform.  Representatives from the Marine Institute also attend.  Under the auspices of the group, the integrated marine plan for Ireland, Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth, was developed.  Its vision is to ensure that the oceans contribute to economic recovery while generating benefits for citizens and this vision is underpinned by three high-level goals, namely, a thriving maritime economy, healthy ecosystems and engagement with the sea.</p><p>  The aforementioned plan recognises that managing the seas requires a national marine spatial plan, which should be underpinned by effective planning and licensing frameworks.  To this end, the group established what we refer to as the enablers' task force on marine spatial planning.  It is regarded as a key action of the Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth plan and the group's terms of reference include the consideration of emerging European Union policy in this space, the need for legislative change that may be required to support a national marine spatial planning framework, international best practice in the area and consideration of a national spatial planning capacity and responsibility for data co-ordination and exchange.  This task force is carrying out its work programme at present and is due to conclude and report to the marine co-ordination group in September.  In this regard, the publication of the draft directive is timely as it will give the group an opportunity to consider both initial member state views and institutional views of maritime spatial planning across the European Union, which it will then consider in the context of its wider work programme.</p><p>  I should clarify that four Departments are represented here today and pending the outcome of the enablers' task force on consideration of marine spatial planning for Ireland, no lead Department has been identified as yet.</p></speech>

I apologise if I referred to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government as being the lead Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-02a.511" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine O'Donoghue" time="09:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013050200004#D00400"><p>No, I simply wished to clarify the manner in which it is being handled in a collaborative sense at present.</p><p>  Turning to the directive itself, as members probably are aware, it was published in March 2013 and consequently, the discussions are at a very early stage.  The proposal itself aims to establish a common framework for marine spatial planning and integrated coastal management among the member states with a view to ensuring the growth of marine and coastal activities, as well as the use of resources at sea and on coasts, remain sustainable.  Marine spatial planning is a process based on stakeholder involvement.  It analyses and plans best use of the seas and where and when human activity should take place.  Integrated coastal management is a separate tool that is used to co-ordinate all policy processes affecting the coastal zone.  It addresses land-sea interaction in a co-ordinated way, again with a view to ensuring sustainable development and use of those resources.  The Commission perceives maritime spatial planning or marine spatial planning and integrated coastal management to be complementary tools, which, when applied jointly, can improve the land-sea interface planning and management.</p><p>  As for the national position, as I mentioned discussions are at a preliminary stage.  There have been a small number of working group meetings at official level in Brussels but as I have outlined, from the work that is going on nationally under the Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth plan, it is clear that Ireland supports the concept of marine spatial planning.  Ireland currently holds the Presidency of the European Council and given this role, which continues for a further two months, as matters stand we are obliged to maintain a neutral position on the discussions.  However, suffice it to say the directive is regarded as a framework proposal.  Its objectives are operational in nature and ultimately, if adopted, I expect the outcome would be that member states would be required to develop and implement marine spatial planning across the European seas to ensure sustainable management of the coastal areas and to ensure cross-border co-operation in areas of mutual concern.</p></speech>

Obviously, in the case of my Department, our primary interest is in those issues which come within the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  However, as Ms O'Donoghue has observed, everything is at an early stage and we are approaching this proposal on a collaborative basis under the auspices of Roinn an Taoisigh.</p></speech>

The reality is that facing eastward, we face Britain and facing to the west, we face the United States of America and Canada.  Our cables go west as well as east and therefore, we need an international framework to deal with these issues.

I believe Ireland should have a spatial plan and have no problem with what the Departments are doing.  I am absolutely 100% in favour of it but my point is that if members are considering this issue in Ireland's national context, America and Britain are important.  Consequently, bilateral arrangements with those two countries would be a lot more important than having in place some arrangement that tied us up with all sorts of issues with which we do not have any real connection in the Mediterranean, the Baltic or all sorts of other places.</p></speech>

As for timeframes set out the proposal itself, after transposition I believe it gives a two-year timeframe, which may be problematic.  It is proposed that member states would have 36 months in which to develop a marine spatial plan, which generally is regarded as a short timeframe.</p></speech>

The deadline for the submission of a reasoned opinion is 13 May and consequently, the joint committee must make up its mind next week.  The background in this regard is that Ireland's holding of the EU Presidency obviously means we must maintain a neutral stance.

We employ 360 people directly and a further 170 indirectly.  We operate two sawmills in Ireland, in Fermoy and Longford, and two sawmills in Scotland.</p><p>  I thank the committee for inviting the Irish Timber Council to discuss the implications of the proposed sale of Coillte's harvesting rights.  The Irish Timber Council was founded in 1918 primarily to represent the sawmill industry in Ireland.  Today, we represent 2,500 people working in ten sawmills throughout the country.  I would like to outline our key concerns for the sawmill industry and the threats that it faces as a result of the proposed sale of Coillte's harvesting rights.  The Irish Timber Council is completely opposed to the sale.  We will also discuss a number of guarantees we are calling on the Government to put in place in order to protect the security of sawmill operators should the sale proceed.  However, these safeguards should only be seen as a last resort.</p><p>  The forestry and forest products sector generates &euro;2.2 billion annually, or 1.3% of the country's GDP.  The forestry sector is a vital employer, with 12,000 people working in the sector.  Timber is one of our most valuable indigenous natural resources and in 2011 alone we exported forest products worth &euro;308 million.  Forestry is also part of our heritage, as is obvious from the 18 million visits made annually to the Coillte estate.  Ireland has a strong history associated with timber and we need to guarantee future supplies.</p><p>  The Irish sawmill sector converts logs into products predominately aimed at the construction sector but also for the pallet and packaging market and fencing sectors.  Our residues - bark, sawdust and wood chip - supply the horticulture, energy and board mill sectors.  The sawmill sector provides much needed employment for 2,500 people, practically all in rural areas where job prospects are otherwise extremely limited.  In 2011, sawmills in the Republic of Ireland exported sawn timber to the value of &euro;83 million.  In recent years the sector has invested over &euro;200 million in creating a modern, efficient and customer focused industry.  It is the main supplier to the board mills and the energy sector.</p><p>  We commissioned a report with EPS consulting to examine the impact of the proposed sale of Coillte's harvesting rights on the sawmill sector.  We have supplied a copy of this report to the committee.  The report underlines our members' concerns and sets out reasons for not proceeding with the sale.  The Irish Timber Council is opposed to the sale for several reasons.  The net realisable value from the sale of harvest rights will be so small as to be completely disproportionate to the negative impact on the sawmill sector.  The ten sawmills that comprise the Irish Timber Council have purchased 100% of the logs produced by Coillte since the formation of that company and, indeed, the Forest and Wildlife Service before that.  As this accounts for 80% of our raw material supply, we are almost entirely dependent on Coillte's harvested output.  There is no viable alternative supply source.  Naturally, therefore, the proposed sale of Coillte's harvesting rights is a significant concern for the council.</p></speech>

The unusual feature of the proposal to sell Coillte's harvesting rights is that I have not heard anyone, other than members of the Government, speak in favour of it.  I hope the indications given this week that the Government is rethinking its proposal are correct.  The Irish Timber Council has outlined succinctly, from the perspective of the sawmills, the reason this proposal is wrong.  It would be useful for the joint committee if our guests were to outline how the industry managed to overcome the downturn without any significant loss of jobs in the sawmill sector.  I understand that at one stage 70% of the output of the major mills went into the domestic market and that this figures has now reversed and with 70% of output being exported.  This means the sector has shifted from a position in which a small proportion of finished saw logs were being exported to one in which the vast majority of output is being exported.  Will the delegation briefly outline how the industry managed to achieve this turnaround during a rapid collapse in the housing market?  This development illustrates the resilience of the industry in Ireland and its capacity to survive an utter disaster, particularly as the downturn was so connected to construction.</p><p>  I ask the delegation to elaborate on the effect of the proposal on employment.  Where is employment in the sector located?  One of the major challenges we face is to protect rural jobs.  Different figures were provided on direct employees and ancillary employment for harvesters and so forth.  How many of those employed in the sector live in rural areas or within 20 or 30 miles of the forests they harvest or the mills that employ them? </p></speech>

I wish to place on record the fact that my party completely supports their position.  For many years we have taken a consistent approach in respect of the exploitation of Coillte harvesting rights for the benefit of the Irish people and those in the industry.  The debate relating to this matter has been ongoing since it was first proposed that we should sell off the harvesting rights to Coillte lands in order to try to deal with the current economic crisis.  Sinn F&eacute;in and others have been consistent in their opposition to such a sale.  We are of the view that it is an extremely amateurish and negative way of allowing a national capital asset to be exploited by outside investors to the detriment of the Irish people and of producers and timber merchants such as our guests.</p><p>  It was stated earlier that our guests are responsible for 2,500 direct jobs.  What is the knock-on effect of those jobs?  I am sure said effect is quite considerable, particularly in the context of the spending power created in the areas in which people are employed and the benefit this brings to local economies.</p><p>  We understand the Government may be having second thoughts about proceeding with the initial proposal relating to this matter.  We would like it to state definitively that it will not be selling off the harvesting rights to Coillte forests.  The arguments put forward by our guests are valid and I completely concur with and support them.  I am of the view that those from the Government parties who are present at this meeting should indicate their wholehearted support for our guests' position.  Obviously, however, the members to whom I refer will speak for themselves when others have completed their contributions.  It is imperative that we should retain the harvesting rights and protect Coillte, the sawmilling industry and the jobs of Irish people.</p><p>  Our guests also referred to the rate of growth of trees in this country as compared with the position elsewhere in Europe and highlighted the opportunities for further investment in this regard.  Will they elaborate further on that matter?  Obviously they are referring to the planting of other areas and so forth.  In many parts of the country where there is marginal land, the people who own it and who are struggling to survive could become involved in forestry.  This would benefit the individuals to whom I refer and the communities in which they live.  Such a development would also have a knock-on effect in terms of the amount of product being sold to the sawmills, etc.</p><p>  I again thank our guests for their presentation.  As stated, they have the wholehearted support of my party, and Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v also indicated the support of his party.  I will be very interested to hear what Government Deputies have to say in respect of this matter.</p></speech>

Like other members of the committee, I am completely opposed to any sale of the harvesting rights relating to Coillte forests and to the transfer of what is a vital State asset into the hands of any private company, regardless of whether it is a pension fund or an international forest products company.  As we face into dealing with the challenges posed by climate change, Coillte and the forestry for which it is responsible have a massive part to play not only in the context of the production of raw timber but also in respect of the provision of alternative, carbon-neutral sources of heating for homes throughout the country.  Coillte's role in this regard is vital.</p><p>  I am in complete agreement with everything contained in our guests' presentation.  The only difficulty I have with it is with the inclusion of safeguards.  The implication seems to be that if one or two of these safeguards are put in place, then the proposed sale might meet our guests' needs and, instead of being an eventuality about which they were concerned, could be dressed up as something they were actually seeking.</p></speech>

The previous speakers do not have a monopoly on their objection to the sale of forestry rights.  As the Chairman knows, this matter has exercised our parliamentary party during many meetings.  We have been bringing the matter to the Minister's attention for a long period.  We hope for a successful conclusion to our lobbying shortly.  It is important that certainty be brought to the issue soon.</p><p>  I welcome the delegation, particularly Mr. Patrick Murray, who is from my part of the country.  When I had cause to visit the Murray Timber Group I was impressed with the facilities.  I had not visited a saw mill for many years, although the one in question was not far from me.  Amazingly, a piece of timber that arrives in the yard is not handled until it exits on the other side.  This is due to the technology and number of people involved.  The timber business is important for areas such as Ballon, County Carlow, and others that have been mentioned.  It creates employment in rural areas where there are no alternatives.  It is essential that the sector be maintained.  The issue boils down to how much money can be derived from the sale.  It makes no economic sense to sell the harvesting rights.  It will not generate the amount planned and will provide no benefits.</p><p>  The Government has requested a significant investment in SmartPly in the south east.  Have the delegates an opinion on how such an investment would affect their businesses?  According to the presentation, businesses are already paying Coillte a premium price of 29% compared with the English equivalent.  This is a significant amount.  Why is it so high?  Can it be pared back?</p><p>  The Opposition parties do not have a monopoly on this issue.  I am supportive of the proposals made by the delegates.</p></speech>

If so, how did Coillte get on the list of State resources to be considered for privatisation?  When the Government came to power, a list was drawn up of what was going to be flogged.  Coillte was on the list commissioned by the Minister for Finance of the previous Government.  I come from County Clare, the third most afforested county in Ireland in terms of the size of its estate and the proportion of the county that is afforested.  I would have many concerns about the impact of the sale of harvesting rights.  However, the <i>status quo</i> is not good either.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to Coillte's remit as a national forestry board, but Coillte does not perform that function as matters stand.  Forestry's social and economic dividends in Clare do not reflect Coillte's supposed function.  There is no requirement to provide a social dividend to communities in which there are forestries.</p><p>  I appreciate the importance of harvesting, but does any witness have a long-term supply contract with Coillte, that is, one of more than ten years?  If so, do those set a particular price?  Companies in my hometown and throughout Ireland would operate tomorrow morning if they received a security of supply guarantee from Coillte.  Not only will Coillte not provide security of supply, but it will not agree to supply at a particular price over ten years.  Who would invest in any sector if there was no security of supply or price?</p><p>  I share the concerns of witnesses and am opposed to the privatisation of Coillte.  I would also be concerned by any proposal on the sale of forestry rights.  That said, I do not support the <i>status quo</i>.  The State forestry sector is not properly managed.  There is no evidence of proper management where I live, which is on the edge of one of the country's largest plantations.  It stretches from Scariff to Gort to Loughrea and back to Scariff again.</p><p>  I would welcome the witnesses' answers on security of supply, ten-year price guarantees and what can be done in that regard to generate an industry around the existing forestry.</p></speech>

I am well aware of Mr. Glennon's business in Castlelyons.  I pass it regularly.  It is difficult to estimate its value to the north Cork economy, as there are many tie-ins upstream and downstream.  I am sure the same applies to the other businesses of the other delegates.</p><p>  There is no point in going through the delegation's arguments, as they stack up from a business point of view.  Putting the businesses of delegates at risk at a time of financial uncertainty makes no sense.  Stability is the Government's focus.  There should be no change in that regard.</p><p>  Coillte attended one of our meetings.  I am concerned about its debt, including its pension deficit.  In total, the debt is approximately &euro;300 million, if my memory serves me correctly, comprising &euro;120 million and &euro;180 million.  I will stand corrected.  As such a level of debt would decimate any sale of Coillte, there is no point in selling the company just to pay another debt.  There would only be a small profit.  Who would replant our forests and so forth?  The proposal does not add up.</p></speech>

Much of what I wanted to say has been said.  I have great concerns about the proposed sale of Coillte&rsquo;s harvesting rights.  There seems to be cross-party agreement on the issue.  The company is not just about the timber but the added value of what is involved such as land rights.  Those issues will be on the table when a decision has to be made.</p><p>  Most of the issues have been addressed.  The witnesses pay a 29% premium.  Is that due to the fact that they are not allowed to import timber because we have disease-free status?</p><p>  It is stated in the EPS Consulting report that we are not reaching the targets on afforestation and that we would need to plant 25,000 ha per annum.  Unfortunately, that aim is at cross purposes with another vision in this country, namely, Food Harvest 2020, whereby we are seeking to produce more milk, beef and sheepmeat from our land - increasing production by 50%.  If one puts land into afforestation, one takes it out of what is available for Food Harvest 2020.  Is there not a contradiction about the future direction of the country?  Is our future in afforestation or in Food Harvest 2020 and the production of more food?  I would welcome a comment in that regard.</p><p>  Coillte has a monopoly and while there have been some private forestry plantations in this country in the past 20 years the vast majority are in partnership either with Coillte or some other company.  What percentage of the forests in this country are still held in private hands that would be able to supply companies such as those before the committee, or is that not feasible due to insufficient supply?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-02a.555" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013050200010#K00300"><p>I welcome the members of the Irish Timber Council.  I am utterly opposed to the sale of the harvesting rights of Coillte, which is not just, as has been explained, a hugely valuable economic asset but a priceless cultural asset.  Frankly, if one pardons the pun, it is nothing more than treason to even consider selling off the harvesting rights of our public forests.</p><p>  Could the witnesses outline how they feel their campaign is going?  We had a big demonstration against the proposal at the weekend in Avondale.  As soon as people know that it is being considered, they are utterly appalled.  Do the witnesses take heart from the comments of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, on foot of the campaign of the Irish Timber Council and IMPACT and the big protest at the weekend that the Government has moved from a commitment to sell our harvesting rights to saying it is unlikely or it is being considered?  That would seem to suggest that the Irish Timber Council&rsquo;s campaign is moving in a successful direction but I would be interested to know what the witnesses think.</p><p>  There has been much criticism of Coillte as well.  Some of it, as hinted at in the previous comment, suggests that it is being used to justify the move towards privatisation.  Even under the previous Government, the McCarthy report referred to the possible disposal of Coillte.</p><p>  To my mind there are problems with Coillte but they would be made significantly worse if the company were privatised.  The issue is about reforming Coillte not selling it.  Could someone comment on the problems?</p><p>  I wish to inquire about the sustainability of current forest strategy.  The Bacon report suggested that we need to plant approximately 20,000 ha per year to have a sustainable forest strategy while we have only planted approximately 5,000 ha.  How do the witnesses think we can improve the situation?</p><p>  Concerns have also been expressed about monoculture and the overdependence on citrus spruce rather than diversifying forestry towards hardwoods.  Do contractors need assistance, first, to move towards a more diversified forest strategy and do sawmillers and contractors need assistance from the State to shift away from a dependence on citrus spruce?</p><p>  Could the witnesses comment on the 2010 report in which Irish forest contractors painted a very bleak picture of Irish forestry?  They said the industry was utterly doomed because of over-harvesting and under-planting.  It was suggested to me by one of the forestry NGOs that the level of harvesting was 1.5 million tonnes, whereas the optimum amount of harvesting to maintain a sustainable forest strategy should only be approximately 1 million tonnes, and that if we keep going in that direction we are going towards deforestation which would ultimately be bad for the sawmill sector.  Someone might correct me if I am wrong.  I would welcome a comment on what I have said and what the witnesses think is behind the sale of 40,000 ha of Coillte land in recent years, even before full-scale privatisation was considered?  In the opinion of the witnesses, why has that been happening because there seems to be a significant lack of transparency in the way Coillte operates and why it has been selling public forests in recent years?</p></speech>

I suspect he has just coined a new phrase that will probably be picked up by others.  I ask the witnesses to clarify a point for me.  I understand that 47% of the forest estate is now privately owned.  The witnesses have said that the Coillte supply accounts for 80% of the raw materials for Irish saw mills.  Is it the case that the privately owned forest has not reached maturity yet?  If that is the case, what is the projected time line for that forest estate to come on stream?  I ask the witnesses to respond now to what was quite a wide range of questions.</p></speech>

We could be accused of a lot of things but I do not think that is one of them.</p><p>  The range of topics raised is very wide but I will try distil my response into a few key points.  This industry is not looking for a hand-out.  We have come through one of the toughest recessions the world has ever seen and we are still here.  Any industry that is still functioning despite the fact that its market has gone from 90,000 units to 8,000 units, its energy costs have increased by 70% in two years and its transport costs have increased by 35% in two years is an industry worth holding on to.  In a country with over 400,000 people unemployed, I would encourage the Government to protect and grow this industry.  I wish to make it clear that we are not looking for hand outs.  Ours is a vibrant, tough industry that is able to compete.  However, we do not want to go into the boxing ring with one hand tied behind our back.  </p><p>  There are 2,500 people employed in the industry at present.  Page 5 of the report we prepared and circulated to committee members outlines the employment potential in the industry in the future.  Every 15,000 hectares planted will generate another 490 jobs directly and every 100 jobs in a saw mill will generate another 70 full-time jobs in other sectors of the economy.  A steady supply of raw material from Irish forests could generate another 7,000 jobs by 2025.  All of those jobs would be in rural areas, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v pointed out.  On average, the typical haulier would live within a 50 km to 60 km radius of the saw mill being supplied, although that can change depending on where the logs come up for sale.</p><p>  There is quite a good recreational link between Coillte and walking groups, including Mountaineering Ireland and others.  Rights of way are provided.  If some of the saw mills happen to be harvesting on a given site, walkers can still access that site at weekends.  The rights of way are kept open, albeit on a more limited basis.</p><p>  We are talking here about a green product.  Wood is the building material of the future, from a green perspective.  Forestry is a totally sustainable industry where trees can be grown, felled and replanted.  Going forward, with all of the new carbon-reduction demands for new houses, wood is the preferred product.  In terms of climate change and carbon sequestration, there is no other product on this planet that actually absorbs carbon dioxide, stores it when it is cut and continues to store it when it is used for a building.  </p></speech>

We do not know and the point must be dealt with.  If investment is required for smartply, it should come about.</p><p>  The question of planting trees as opposed to more regular agriculture has been raised, and there is much land that is not good for agriculture but it is good for trees.  There is a compelling argument to be made for planting more trees.  We accept that Coillte must be reformed, and what has happened is not right.  That is not the fault of sawmills but the issue should be dealt with as well.  The return from Coillte has been pretty poor, and all we need to do is read the McCarthy report, which states pretty clearly that profits in Coillte came from the sale of land rather than trees.</p></speech>

The public must guess the correct value for the stakeholder or the State for the product and there should be a separation in that respect.  It is a conflict of interest.  Mr. Murray may answer the question about diversity of private planting versus public planting and what may happen in future.</p></speech>

That is on the cusp of coming to the market, as the Chairman asked.  It is a major concern that the sawmill sector is placed to process the taxpayer's investment, with Irish growers having taken up the partnership with the Government on the verge of getting the return on the investment.  We are at a potential crossroads as the return on the investment could be scuppered by the sale of Coillte.  If a private investor takes over the harvesting rights of Coillte and take a dominant position, it could make a hostile takeover of the entire industry and bring us to rack and ruin.  By taking us over cheaply, it would have control of the sawmill sector, allowing it to process Irish taxpayer investment on its terms and prices.  That is a massive concern for all taxpayers in the country and the current Government.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, private planting has approximately ten to 15 years to go before it will come to our industry.  It is young but the crop is in the ground and growing.  It is not yet ready for our type of industry.  Mr. Fahy can give a small synopsis of what is happening on Corr na M&oacute;na, the type of people there and the downstream industries being affected.</p></speech>

At our plant we have 100 people working full-time inside the gate, with an additional 200-plus employed in harvesting, extraction and haulage.  That number would be replicated in the businesses run by my colleagues.  We are located in Corr na M&oacute;na and one can travel to Clifden some 65 miles away without passing another factory.  Luckily, there is a successful McHale farm machinery plant in Ballinrobe but, apart from that, one could travel in a 30-mile radius to Galway without passing another factory giving the kind of employment we do.  Most of the workers are from the local community, and this type of rural employment is replicated across the industry.  The contractors employed by us would typically come from a fairly close distance to the sawmill.  These people work in forestry in rural parts of the country, and they may stay in local bed and breakfasts and support local shops.  Their work feeds into the rural communities.</p><p>  There are spin-off companies from a typical sawmill.  We operate in an estate with two other companies.  One deals in the sale of timber products and the other utilises bark and residue from our process.  It is mulched for garden products, etc., and the company has up to 15 people working on the process.  The number of people employed in such spin-off companies exemplifies the multiplier effect, and one can see it in the employment of engineers and maintenance personnel.  It is a multiple of the 2,500 people employed by the main industry.</p><p>  Five years ago construction industry activity fell off a cliff and at that stage our industry exported approximately 15% to 20% of output.  We had to react overnight and, in highlighting the resilience of the industry, we managed to turn around those figures in a 12-month period.  Our company currently has 80% of output going across to the UK.  We achieved this in a two-pronged fashion.  We had major capital investment and in our company we invested over &euro;7 million in the past five years, without any subsidy coming from the State.  The second element came from workers, and to get to get to the stage where 80% of output was going abroad, our staff had to be very versatile.  They pulled out all the stops for whatever time or travel was needed to establish a market in the likes of the UK.  I speak for the rest of the sawmills in that regard too.</p> <p>We process fast growing sitka spruce.  We compete in the UK market with Scandinavian and Nordic countries that have a more slowing grow tree.  Ours is a slightly superior product.  Irish construction timber is now the benchmark for quality and service in the UK.  This will be damaged if we cannot maintain the production and supply of our sawmills. </p></speech>

We may need to take another look at the grant structure for planting softwoods versus hardwoods.  Deputy Doyle is correct that it will not be possible to grow strange species on some of the land we are considering.  Sitka spruce is the workhorse for the construction industry across Europe.  It is where we will be competing and where we need products.  We need to consider having a second string to our bow should something happen to that species, such as disease and so on.  There are other species that can and need to be considered.  We are not competing with good quality agricultural land and should never be.

Is the premium price based on the fact that the council has to import some of its raw materials or is it because the premium price is being paid to Coillte?</p><p>  Investment in this area comes from the body charged with developing and growing forests in this country.  It has advised the council that there is a huge amount of timber coming down the line and to gear itself up for it.  It says a lot about the standard of management within Coillte when, as the body charged with developing the forestry industry, it can get it so wrong.</p></speech>

This is very serious.  The communication of such a serious statement could be interpreted as enhancing the financial situation of a company.  The sum of &euro;200 million is a colossal amount.  At the end of the day, it will be the consumer who will pay for this.  I agree with the comments on land sales.  Bottlehill landfill, which is close to where I live, is a &euro;50 million white elephant.  The land was sold by Coillte to the county council for &euro;15 million.  One could buy a large amount of good land for that amount.  The consumer will pay for this also.</p><p>  Another issue of concern is that of leeways.  One example is the huge tariffs the ESB must pay to Coillte if it needs to run a wire through Coillte-owned land.  This also affects the consumer.  It makes no sense.  A neighbour of Mr. Glennon's who works for Green Belt Limited in Castlelyons told me in conversation last week that while last year it was difficult to get 7,000 ha of land, this year they are inundated with applications for forestry from all types of land, good and poor.  The common thread in this regard is the age profile of the farmer.  Farmers who have good land are no longer leasing it but are getting involved in planting.  We will be faced with a huge issue in terms of Harvest 2020 if we do not take account of land being used for forestry.  While I am a great supporter of forestry, it is increasing for all the wrong reasons.  We need to be careful and to monitor this closely.  Elderly farmers who should be encouraged to retire and lease their holdings are not doing so because of the horror stories such as people refusing to continue paying after one year and are moving instead to forestry of good land.</p></speech>

I have found listening to them very interesting.  I, too, have had concerns for a long time about the sale of Coillte harvesting rights.  I believe Coillte can do a great deal for us not only in the area of the growth and sale of timber, but on the recreational side in terms of walkways, etc., which have been allowed to deteriorate in some parts of the country.  A lot of work can be done in this regard in terms of the promotion of tourism.</p><p>  Mr. Glennon has already responded to the question on imports.  I heard recently that timber is being imported from Scotland.  I understand trees planted ten or 15 years ago will soon be ready for first thinning, which means we should have a good crop of timber in the next ten or 15 years.  This will ensure the availability of timber for the council and create an income for growers.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that Coillte has consistently invested in a manner in which a private company would not in public good in terms of rural recreation.

It is a matter to which the committee should address itself.  I was fascinated by what Mr. Fahy had to say.  It is fair to say that he, his father, Mr. P. J. Fahy, and Connacht Gold have done a tremendous job in my area.</p><p>  I will add one more statistic.  There are more than 100 employed in the mill mentioned.  I would suspect there are 50 to 100 other jobs, between CNM and M&aacute;irt&iacute;n Seoige, contractors who live locally, etc.  I would say that the direct reach of employees in our area is somewhere between 150 and 200 employees.  If one puts a dot on the map where the timber mill is and draws a circle around it of radius 20 miles, the adult population in that area would not exceed 2,500.  When one imagines 200 in a population of 2,500, one understands the scale of the impact that this has on the local economy.  It is quite simple.  Our local economy would not exist without ECC Teo.  One could apply the same exercise across the country.</p><p>  I will ask one direct question.  Would the Irish Timber Council arrange for the committee, if it was agreeable, to visit some of these mills so that the members could see the impact of what is going on, understand the human impact by meeting those who work in them, between harvesting, transport, etc., and get some sense of how colossally important these are to the national economy?  The figures are most impressive.  The committee should see how vital these mills are to the economy of certain rural communities.  The rural communities that have the mills are most fortunate.</p></speech>

The witnesses and others outlined some of the problems.  Whatever difficulties there are, they will be made worse if we sell off the harvesting rights of Coillte.  The point I am trying to get at is that some of the underperformance of Coillte is related to the fact that it has been preparing for privatisation for some time and has had a commercial focus which is not necessarily at one with the best interests of the forestry sector in Ireland as a whole, from the point of view of the sawmilling sector, public access, planting or whatever.  It has a commercial mandate.  That would seem to be borne out.  The witnesses did not really answer the question; maybe they do not know the answer.  Why did they sell off 40,000 hectares?</p><p>  As I acquainted myself with this issue over the past while, I was shocked that a country that can grow trees twice as fast as any in Europe has the lowest level of forest cover anywhere in Europe.  That is an extraordinary indictment of the failure of forestry policy.  I stress that I do not blame this on ordinary Coillte workers, who do fantastic work.  I pay tribute to the staff in Avondale Forest Park and all the rest of them.  However, it indicates a failure of Government and the top management of Coillte that, instead of realising that potential, the main activity in which they seem to have engaged in the past few years is selling land.  It seems that the threats to the Irish Timber Council's sector are directly related to that failure because, in a country that should have a plentiful supply of wood, the sector does not have it.  The answer to that is more public investment in planting, rather than privatisation, because a private company will merely asset-strip our forests.  They will not have any interest in the sector, in public access and in the wider economy.  They will only want to take what they can get and, possibly, sell it on further down the road.  I wonder how the council sees the committee addressing these matters in the future, because it seems there is significant unrealised potential.</p><p>  Could the council briefly comment on the question of deforestation?  Because of under-planting and, possibly, over-harvesting, are we in danger of deforestation and of having an unsustainable forestry strategy?</p></speech>

On the clear fell, there was talk of 5,000 hectares being planted.  We believe that amount is far too low.  However, one must take into account that Coillte replants any acreage it fells.

That has not come to fruition yet.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-02a.602" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Glennon" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013050200015#P00400"><p>That is one of the important issues in answering two of the Deputy's questions.  Mr. McNamara is referring to new planting - so we will call it greenfield planting rather than the replanting.  As the Chairman has said, anybody starting off has to replant when they fell.  Coillte does the replanting, in fairness.  However, we are talking about new planting basically.  We need between 15,000 ha to 20,000 ha per annum of commercial forestry coming in, which would make a very viable industry.  In Sweden one in four people works in the forest products industry.  It is a massive powerful industry.  We could have something similar here with our good growth rates.</p><p>  I was asked why Coillte sold off land.  I can only guess it was to make the books balance.  I do not honestly know.</p></speech>

Deputy Barry spoke earlier about the debt of &euro;180 million - it borrowed &euro;80 million to buy Medite.  I do not know what it borrowed when it invested in the OSB, but there were some capital payments by Coillte.</p></speech>

As it was deemed to have an unfair advantage over private organisations, it was delisted from entitlement to establishment grants.  Until probably the last eight to ten years, it was buying as much every year as it was selling.</p></speech>

A further issue is that some of the land sold was low-productivity land in terms of forest.  It owned all sorts of bits of land.</p></speech>

I can give an example.  Land was made available on the edge of a village in south County Wicklow to build a few local houses in a combined effort between the community and Coillte.</p></speech>

The committee has agreed a work programme.  I know Deputy Flanagan is not a member of the committee, but that was our work programme.  The then CEO of Coillte, the company secretary, and its chairman designate, who also happened to be outgoing chairman, were here in November or December to give us an outline of the Goodbody investigation which was ongoing at the time.</p></speech>

The review of the forestry sector and the consideration of the potential sale of the harvesting rights are two different but entangled pieces of work that are being done.  We hope this committee offers a public forum for people to articulate the concerns.  It seems to be a fairly unanimous opinion that people are opposed to giving away what was being investigated.  That is not to say there are not equally concerns that something needs to be done by way of reform.  In our exercise we hope the committee can receive contributions that will help to inform consideration of a reformed Coillte.  Should it be a semi-State organisation?  Should it be commercial or should it just have overall management of the forest estate?  I cannot predict what options we might come up with.  There is certainly a body of work to be done and this committee can play a central role in that.</p><p>  We chose this time for this because we were told in November that the Goodbody report was to be completed and forwarded to the steering group for consideration in the first or second quarter and it would take to the end of the second quarter before there would be any recommendation.  We get the sense that something might go to Cabinet.  There is speculation that there has been a change of heart - maybe there was never a heart in it - or a change of direction.  If that is the case we then need to consider what the alternative is.  That should be our focus.  We definitely need some reform and Coillte is important in that.</p></speech>

The Chairman has now said there may well be a second string to this committee's bow in that if we do not sell those rights it needs to decide what we should do.</p></speech>

We found that astonishing given that we account for 90% of its revenue - its external sales.  If there is a second string to this bow, we should investigate the right solution for the future.  We respectfully ask that the industry be consulted and have its say at the table should that be the case.</p></speech>

That one is important from the strategic point of view of the entire forestry sector.  It relates to the private afforestation programme that we are talking about.  Approximately 6,000 ha or 6,500 ha of private estate will be planted this year.  Replanting continues mainly on Coillte lands as clear-fell occurs.</p></speech>

There should be some consultation process to allow for the development of a new, mixed, private and public forestry sector in all its guises.</p><p>  We should conclude because it is midday.  I wish to thank the representatives of the Irish Timber Council for attending the committee.  I was present at the launch of the council's report which is both useful and worthwhile.  I compliment the council on producing it.  We will try to ensure that this issue is carefully considered before any final decisions are made on it. </p></speech>
