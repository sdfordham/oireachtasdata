Interference from mobile phones affects the sound quality and transmission of the meeting.  I welcome the Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.  He is accompanied by Mr. John Palmer, principal officer of the economic division; and Mr. Eoin Dorgan, principal officer of the banking division.  Seated behind them are Ms Ruth Sutton and Mr. Anthony Maloney.</p><p>I thank the Minister for attending the meeting, the purpose of which is to consider the Department of Finance proposals to establish a rainy day fund as set out in the consultation paper published as part of budget 2018.  The Parliamentary Budget Office and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, have both published research notes on the rainy day fund.  We have highlighted a number of issues and queries regarding the potential design and establishment of the fund.  It is important for the committee to carry out <i>ex ante</i>scrutiny of the proposal.  This type of committee work can contribute to improving the budgetary scrutiny over time.  I acknowledge the work of the Minister and his officials in assisting the committee in this process.</p><p>I will give the usual privilege announcement before we hear from the Minister.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that Members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or any official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-31a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018013100002#D00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee.  I am accompanied today by colleagues from the Department who have been involved in developing the range of options as set out in the rainy day fund consultation paper.</p><p>I begin by providing some background and context to the proposal on the setting up of a rainy day fund.  The concept was originally mooted by my predecessor as part of the Summer Economic Statement, SES, in 2016.  It was announced that once the medium-term budgetary objective, MTO, of a balanced budget was achieved, a rainy day fund would be set up.  The establishment of the fund forms part of a wider policy commitment to sound and sensible public finances.  It will play an important role in creating a budgetary safety buffer to help absorb inevitable future shocks to our economy, while at the same time ensuring the long-term health of Ireland&rsquo;s public finances.  In the 2017 Summer Economic Statement, the Government committed to consulting the Oireachtas before bringing forward detailed proposals.</p><p>The initial proposal for a rainy day fund envisaged an annual contribution of &euro;1 billion per annum to commence post-achievement of the medium-term objective.  Subsequently, the Government reduced the planned contribution to &euro;500 million per annum for the years 2019 to 2021 in order to fund capital expenditure over the same period.  The level of contributions thereafter was left as an open question and it is one of the many topics on which I welcome the committee's views today.  </p><p>In budget 2018, I announced that the Government had decided to transfer &euro;1.5 billion from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to the rainy day fund when it is established.  I published the consultation paper, on which the Chairman has commented.  I welcome the paper I have received from Fianna F&aacute;il along with the papers from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Parliamentary Budget Office.  Before I form any particular view on the specific details of the fund, I hope today to get some initial views from the committee on the outstanding questions I have set out in the consultation paper.  These matters relate to the design, operation and purpose of the fund; as well as the issues of how it is resourced; withdrawal triggers; and its governance.</p><p>Broadly speaking, the current proposal is to design a rainy day fund that will primarily meet budgetary demands which may arise from a specific, one-off shock.  As set out in the third section of the consultation paper, a natural question arises as to whether the rainy day fund should be used in the first instance as a contingency reserve.  It would be necessary to clearly define the circumstances under which such reserve funds could be deployed in order to ensure it is used only during a time of crisis.  <i>Force majeure</i>events which might necessitate access to the contingency fund may include a natural disaster or a public emergency.</p><p>Expenditure based on a withdrawal from a contingency reserve fund would be permissible within the parameters of the fiscal rules.  If at the end of a given budgetary year, the funds within the contingency reserve remained unused, they could then be transferred to a separate rainy day fund, the establishment of which would require primary legislation.  </p><p>These are just some of the issues outlined in the consultation paper which require further consultation on this reserve fund.  Other matters to be discussed include: whether such a contingency reserve should be held within the Exchequer account or within a rainy day fund; how the withdrawal triggers should be determined; and what kinds of shocks or events should be considered as triggers.  As I mentioned at the outset, I am keen to hear the views of the members of the committee today on these and other questions that I put forward in the consultation paper.  </p><p>Sections 4 and 5 of the paper raise questions on operational and administrative matters associated with the overall rainy day fund.</p><p>These design and operational issues relate to the deposit mechanism, the withdrawal mechanism, the size at which the fund should be capped and the replenishment methodology.  Other practicalities to be considered include how the fund might be invested, what governance structures would be most appropriate and who should administer and manage the fund.  </p><p> I will identify some of the key design concepts of the fund about which the views of the committee will be important.  The first is the deposit mechanism.  The proposal as currently drafted envisages a deposit mechanism whereby, aside from the &euro;1.5 billion seed funding from ISIF, there will be an annual contribution of &euro;500 million from the Exchequer until 2021.  Clearly, it would be my intention that the annual contribution would continue beyond that point.  Is this a sufficient level of contribution?  Should we be looking to bring additional seed funding into the rainy day fund?  How will name and determine the size of annual contributions after that?  Many options spring to mind.  One would be to have a fixed contribution key in either nominal or as a percentage of gross domestic product, GDP, or gross national income, GNI, terms.  An alternative could be to lodge windfall tax revenue on the basis of revenues above target in general terms or with regard to specific taxes.  I am sure that members will have other options as well.</p><p> In respect of the withdrawal mechanism, clear and defined rules will be required in respect of the events and conditions which could trigger a withdrawal proposal and the process by which such a proposal would be progressed by the various State actors.  International evidence shows that these triggers tend to comprise economic and fiscal triggers such as the level unemployment and revenue and expenditure levels, as well as democratic triggers relating to approval by the Executive and Parliament.  The design of these triggers will be a critical task in developing the fund.  They should be appropriate and relevant as well as being based on data which is timely and transparent.  There is a need to also strike a balance between sufficient checks and balances and a process that allows the speedy utilisation of the funds given they will be needed in a crisis.  </p><p> Associated with the interplay between deposits into and withdrawals out of the fund are the issues of the overall fund size and the process by which it should be replenished if it used.  The optimum size must be determined so that we have sufficient capacity to address challenges emerging but also while avoiding the carry costs of a cash or near-cash fund which could become too large.  Given the State's debt levels are consistently identified as one of the State's top risks, the State should always be seeking to pay down debt except where there is a better return for the State.  In this case, the rainy day fund provides resources to mitigate tail-risk events that would have a significant impact on the Irish economy and public finances thus justifying the additional interest costs on the debt that could be paid down by the rainy day fund.  </p><p> Once the maximum size is achieved, should annual contributions continue for the purposes of budgetary discipline or cease?  If they continue, should the surplus in the fund be used to pay down our debt?  I consider that the rainy day fund should be of a sufficient size to act as a fiscal buffer.  The rainy day fund should give the economy and public finances time to make the longer term adjustments to re-establish debt market access at normalised levels.  This is connected to the paying down of debt as the lower the State's existing debt level, the more sustainable the cost of debt from markets.</p><p> Subsequent to any withdrawal and determined by the target fund size, the fund will need to be replenished to rebuild the fiscal buffer.  Clearly, replenishment will also be influenced by the prevailing economic and fiscal conditions, which might impact on the timing of the Exchequer's capacity to recommence contributions to the fund.  Should the provisions for the replenishment of the rainy day fund be determined now or should they be determined post the withdrawal of the funds? </p><p> It is also important to note that everything we do must be must be compliant with the Stability and Growth Pact, as well as the Fiscal Compact.  The fiscal rules dictate that use of funds from a contingency reserve or payments into the rainy day fund would be treated as expenditure by the Exchequer.  Payments made to the fund are deemed a financial transaction within general Government but not counted as part of the general Government deficit.  Therefore, any withdrawals from the fund will result in expenditure that worsens the general Government balance.  In addition to all of these issues, the consultation paper outlines some options on the governance structure for the fund and how it might be managed with the NTMA indicated as a clear, and in my view, very good, possibility. </p><p>  I look forward to a constructive engagement with the committee now and in the coming months as we pull together the proposal and the legislation relating to this matter.  It is my objective to be in a position that allows us later this year to complete all the work that is necessary to draft this legislation to present it to the Oireachtas.  Accordingly, I welcome the views of the committee on the consultation paper and the different ssues to which I have referred.</p></speech>

A number of members have indicated that they wish to ask questions.  I will add Deputy Heydon to that list while Deputy Burton is already on that list.  We have a list of everybody who would like to ask questions.  On foot of the end of this meeting, we will also write to the Minister with committee views as part of this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-31a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1335" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018013100002#E00300"><p>I welcome the Minister and his officials and thank them for their time.  With respect to the Minister's predecessor, I think it is Deputy Michael McGrath who has been the champion of the rainy day fund for some years.  I will start where the Minister finished, which is around European fiscal rules.  In its submission, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, is of the view that the current exemptions are unlikely to provide the kind of flexibility the Minister seems to be seeking in terms of the rainy day fund and avoiding a breach of domestic and EU rules.  Has the Minister had any engagement around the design of the rainy day fund to provide it with the flexibility it needs to and to ensure that we are still in compliance with all the various rules?</p> <p>  The Minister spoke about international evidence.  The Parliamentary Budget Office has shown us the Estonian example but it did say that there are a few other examples.  Has the Minister unearthed other examples at which the committee could look and make a call in terms of the flexibilities?  </p> <p>  I think there are possibly two different roles for a contingency reserve fund and a rainy day fund.  I think they are probably two different animals.  A contingency reserve fund might be something that should be there on an annual basis in the event, which the Minister mentioned in his speech, of some sort of one-off event.  An example would be the flooding two years ago.  In such a case, money could come from a contingency reserve fund.  If that is not needed in a year, the balance left in that fund can go to a rainy day fund, which is much more medium and long term.  Is there not an argument to be made in terms of good prudence for two separate funds - a contingency reserve fund and a rainy day fund, which is a much more long-term fund?  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-31a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018013100002#E00600"><p>I will deal with each of them in turn.  With regard to whether there are any other examples of countries that are well advanced in doing this kind of work with a European setting, the answer is "No".  When we commence this work in terms of putting together a fund, we will be in the first wave of countries that are looking to carry out this work well.  In terms of compliance with fiscal rules, where there is an intersection with current EU fiscal rules, under the current fiscal rules, there is provision for expenditure to be used in response to so-called exceptional circumstances.  Given that I would only be proposing to use the rainy day fund in light of exceptional circumstances, there is some fit there but once we are clearer in how we want to structure the rainy day fund and how it will operate, we will have to engage further with the Commission with regard to that.  I am optimistic about such discussions.</p><p>The European Commission understands the distinction between the day-to-day challenges, the expenditure consequences of the day-to-day management of the State, and exceptional events that require a response from the State.  Given that we are only talking about setting up this fund, once we have achieved our budgetary objectives I am optimistic that we will be able to make this work within the existing rules and with the support of the Commission.</p><p> Regarding the Deputy's third question, I agree with what he said.  There are two different ideas: one is a contingency reserve and the other is a rainy day fund.  That is something I have introduced in my discussions with my Department in recent months.  I well remember, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, dealing with the flooding the Deputy referred to towards the end of 2015.  Something that struck me at the time was that when we are dealing with an event in our country that, for example, stretches beyond a county or even a number of counties but affects many regions and, therefore, has a high cost across a number of Departments, inevitably it involves, in the middle of the year or whenever it happens, having to open discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and other Departments on how we can respond quickly to something like that.  I believe there should be a better way of doing that.  That is the reason I am interested in the idea of this reserve fund.  In terms of where it would sit, I have an open mind regarding it.  I believe we could do it two ways.  It could be a separate fund to the rainy day fund or, alternatively, it could be a certain level or parcel of funding within the rainy day fund that would have different access criteria.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-31a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1335" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018013100002#F00200"><p>I thank the Minister.  Are there any other countries in the same space as Ireland that are preparing or having discussions on this, particularly in terms of where the eurozone need has come from in recent years, and many countries having had fiscal crises?  As a member of the eurozone, does the Minister not believe it is prudent that this would be examined across each eurozone country, particularly those that have had to face the challenges we have faced in recent years?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-31a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018013100002#F00300"><p>I am not aware of any such discussions in other countries.  Even if those discussions are beginning to develop, they have not got to the point of causing discussion in either Eurogroup or ECOFIN meetings.  When our thinking is more advanced on this in the next few months, I believe we will be one of the countries, if not the first country, to raise this matter.</p></speech>

In its paper provided to us, the Parliamentary Budget Office pointed out what it referred to as mitigating risks.  In other words, having the cash on hand to react to events such as flooding would improve the State's capacity to deal with that after the event.  It also refers to immediate investment in preventing those events such as flood defences.  How do we achieve that balancing act?  Has the Minister given any consideration to that?  That would also question the need for a contingency fund.  Would the Minister see the need for the contingency fund but also the investment?  Last week, the Minister of State in charge of flooding stated that approximately &euro;1 billion would be needed to complete all the current flood defences and those proposed for the future.</p> <p>  The second question relates to the withdrawal criteria for a rainy day fund.  One aspect the briefing paper highlights is the way the criteria would be written into legislation.  The Minister said in his contribution that for a longer or medium-term rainy day fund, he might have to consider primary legislation in terms of the criteria and how we would access it.  An issue the paper raises is the need to put that on a constitutional footing.  It references the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which was designed to do one thing but which, when the crash happened, was diverted.  Does the Minister have any thoughts on that?</p> <p>  The final question is on the objective formula-driven deposit criteria, which are mentioned.  What does that mean and how would it work in practice?  For example, if there was a significant increase in certain tax receipts, is it a formula or a percentage of those increases?  What type of formula is the Minister considering?</p></speech>

Regarding the first question, I would not anticipate that the contingency reserve fund could be used to fund precautionary work.  In any Department, precautionary work that needs to be delivered should be part of the normal Estimates process.  In my experience of dealing with these matters now, precautionary work and the objective of preventing future difficulties can be used to justify very large amounts of expenditure.  I genuinely believe that if I was to include that as a use of the contingency reserve fund it-----</p></speech>

If I have the Deputy's question wrong, I will deal with that.  As I said, if I was to include that as a use of the contingency reserve fund, I think I would never get it set up and it would be in withdrawal all the time.</p></speech>

I used flooding as an example.  We are looking at &euro;1 billion being needed for the flood defences.  Obviously, if we had the &euro;1 billion and it was spent, that might mitigate any longer-term risks for using a contingency fund for that particular event.</p></speech>

That is for two reasons.  The first is the variety of different events that might require use of a contingency fund.  In the papers I referred to a natural phenomenon.  For example, what would happen if we had another episode of foot and mouth disease here?  That is something a lot of effort and focus goes into seeking to prevent happening but it could well happen.  If a natural phenomenon like that happened which we were unsuccessful in preventing-----</p></speech>

I look forward to answering his questions in a moment but I will continue answering the questions put to me by Deputy O'Brien.  For that reason, I do not believe that investment in precautionary measures will offset the need for a reserve fund in the future.</p> <p>  Regarding withdrawal criteria and their role in primary legislation, I believe they should be inserted in primary legislation because in the year-to-year effort of trying to form budgets, if we do not have the contribution to the rainy day fund set aside, it will undermine our ability to set up the rainy day fund in the first place.</p> <p>  In regard to putting it on a constitutional footing, I am not in favour of doing that.  I believe it is a matter that should be dealt with exclusively by the Oireachtas.  We have enough in our Constitution.  It is up to the Oireachtas and the Government of the day to set up this fund and it is clearly open to any future D&aacute;il to change its mind on the way that fund is set up.</p> <p>  Regarding deposit criteria and whether one of them could include an increase in particular tax heads or forms of tax collection, the answer to that question is "Yes".  As part of the debate we will have on this, I would be willing to consider is whether we should examine the possibility of putting higher than expected levels of tax receipts in a fund like this one.  However, that is one of the many matters we need to conclude in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

Regarding the deposit criteria, for example, if we have an increase in tax receipts in a particular area and we are looking at a rainy day fund or a short-term contingency fund, the Minister said he could have the contingency fund for those unusual events like flooding or foot and mouth disease as part of an overall rainy day fund, with particular withdrawal criteria.  Is that still something he is open to and considering?  There is no definitive-----</p><p>The inevitable question is that if we are faced with some kind of very significant difficulty to which the Government must respond clearly, the political challenge will be to use the rainy day fund.  The best way of dealing with it is to define the criteria of how a fund would be accessed and to acknowledge upfront that even in using the language of "crises", there are different forms of crises that have a different cost.  A flooding event or a natural phenomenon of some kind that causes a huge amount of harm to people's public property is a clear crisis to which the State must respond but the State going into a lengthened and very difficult recession would also be a crisis.  It would be sensible to define the different ways in which a fund like that could be accessed in future.  It might not be possible to do all of this in primary legislation but some of it could be done that way.</p></speech>

It has certainly been a proposal of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party for quite some time now that we would establish a rainy day fund.  The consultation paper as published indicates that in an Irish context, it is envisaged the rainy day fund would primarily operate along the lines of a defined purpose instrument to address specific events and shocks.  Following on from the crash in 2008, the fund is envisaged to be counter-cyclical, in that we would address cases of deep recession and we should also have the ability, when the economy is overheating, to withdraw funds from the economy and try to stabilise it.</p> <p>  We had an interesting discussion last week with the Parliamentary Budget Office.  I agree with its view that a contingency reserve is probably of little benefit to the country in cases of deep recession or overheating.  Flooding is an easy example to bring up but the various Departments should be robust enough to deal with those types or occurrences.  There is an opportunity cost when we save money, such as the &euro;500 million proposed for the rainy day fund, so if there is no real benefit in terms of counteracting a recession, is there really a purpose to a contingency reserve fund?  Using it in a counter-cyclical way is probably the intention and we are all of the view that we are trying to avoid what happened ten years ago from happening again.  A contingency reserve probably would not stop that happening.</p> <p>  The figure put to us last week from the parliamentary budget office was that we would probably need in the region of &euro;20 billion to put a counter-cyclical fund in place.  With &euro;1.5 billion going in initially and &euro;500 million going in thereafter up to 2021, it would take us nearly 40 years to put the fund in place with such a level of contribution.  Is that sufficient or if it is not possible between now and 2021, will the Minister would ask for feedback on the contribution post-2021?  If we are serious about putting in a counter-cyclical fund to deal with times of recession, the amount being put in must be greater.  The Minister's Department and this committee would need to investigate the opportunity cost to the State were we to go that far.</p> <p>  On the design, operation and purpose of the fund, I agree that we have far too much in the Constitution as it is and there is no place in it for such matters.  It is for the Parliament of the day to decide on this.  The Minister is also correct in saying there should be defined criteria.  I also suggest there should be parliamentary control and this should not just be down to the Department of Finance to decide when cases meet the criteria.  I am not suggesting we need 100% agreement, as we will never have that, but some sort of parliamentary control would be desirable.  I suggest a built-in review, perhaps every three or five years, to assess whether it is working and the ongoing opportunity cost to the country of putting aside substantial amounts of money on an annual basis.  It should also assess whether the amount decided to be put aside would continue to be sufficient.  Were that amount to be insufficient, we obviously would need to address that.</p> <p>  The Minister wanted feedback on the purpose of the fund and I believe its purpose must be counter-cyclical or else there is no point to it.  I would welcome the Minister's view on that.  I would also welcome his view on how we can go about assessing the opportunity cost and dealing with an ongoing review within the Parliament.</p></speech>

Her second point indicates the difficulty in this regard.  I have never had anybody in this D&aacute;il calling on me to spend less.  It never happens.  All the demands - many of them legitimate - are to spend more.  That is why it is valuable to have a precursory discussion about the matter before we move to the legislative stage.  The moment somebody in the D&aacute;il stands up and asks me to spend less in a Department, I want to ensure I am there to hear it.</p></speech>

The moment this or a future Government starts setting aside money, the Opposition in the D&aacute;il will call for that money to be spent now.  Perhaps it will not be all the Opposition, although I suspect it will be.  They will argue there is a better use for the money now.  That is why there is value in a legislative approach to examining this concept.  We need legislation to set it up anyway but the value of the Oireachtas making a decision is in creating a framework within which that kind of debate can happen.</p> <p>  I differ with the Deputy on the role of the Opposition.  The Constitution is crystal clear that matters relating to the spending of money must sit with the Government.  That is why the Government has the unique role relating to money messages.  I would not support the set-up or access of this fund going beyond the role of the Government.  It should sit with the Departments of Finance or Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy about a built-in review but I do not have a strong view on whether it needs to be laid out in primary legislation.  We should in particular review how much we are contributing to the fund and how long it will take to get to the right level of funding.  When we have it up and running, it should be a minimum of &euro;500 million.  We should also consider that if one-off tax gains become available to the State, it would provide an ability to more rapidly build up the size of this fund than many years of individual contributions from tax revenue.</p></speech>

The question can be asked of what happens when we reach the desirable target.  There will always be a necessity to have the ability to withdraw money from the economy if needs be to prevent overheating.  That would go beyond the desired target.</p> <p>  No matter what we do, there will always be recession and a return to growth.  It is a cycle every economy goes through and we are no different from anywhere else.  There should be further investigations around the opportunity cost of this and when will be the review.  I appreciate the point made by the Minister around money messages being confined to the Government and Departments.  There needs to be some element of parliamentary control.  This could relate to changing the criteria of the fund down the line.  Although we will make the decisions now with the best available evidence, there must be an ability for a future D&aacute;il to change the criteria if evidence or information changes.  We should be open to that as well.  I thank the Minister for his responses and I welcome the interaction.</p></speech>

There will be an opportunity cost in doing this and we will struggle to quantify it because it will mean not doing something many want us to do.  The more easily measurable one, therefore, will be whether we pay down debt or put the money into the fund.  It becomes particularly interesting, of course, if we do it in a low interest rate environment.  One of the challenges we face in holding money is that it is difficult to preserve the value of a very large amount of money.</p><p> With regard to parliamentary control, I have outlined my answer and the Deputy understands why I am saying it.  Something that perhaps might be examined is, in the event of withdrawal, what are the criteria in which it will happen.  I would be very cautious in ceding power away from the Government to determine when it can contribute or withdraw because it could create really big practical difficulties in the future.</p></speech>

Has the UK Government's budgets always included a contingency amount, going back several centuries?  The Minister is speaking about contingencies such as an outbreak of foot and mouth disease.  He is presiding over a homelessness and housing crisis.  Every Deputy receives messages hour in, hour out from people who are in desperate situations.  This morning I raised with the Minister's colleague, the Taoiseach the issue of the health budget and whether the Government had made a grave error in the health Estimates for 2018.  I cited one specific waiting list for children on the autistic spectrum who needed early intervention assessments.  The Minister may know because it is also his district that the waiting list is well over 300 children, 150 of whom have been waiting for more than a year and some for almost two years.  These are contingencies for which he should have provided in normal budgeting.</p> <p>  I remember that the Minister said about something else that it was bonkers.  That seems to be a favourite word of his, but is it not bonkers to be thinking in these terms when the Government is not meeting the essential needs of the people?  Clearly it has not met them in the areas of health and housing this year and perhaps in education and others also.  If it cannot meet them, why are we talking in a nonsensical way about setting up a rainy day fund?  I look back at the record of the Minister's predecessor as Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, about which people will be incredibly critical in the future but not the media that tends to puff up Fine Gael.  However, others will look back at it and see the real austerity and setbacks people had to endure during the period, which we need not have had to endure because the Minister and others voted in favour of a blanket bank guarantee.  At this stage of our development, I look back on it as being bonkersand cannot see any basis for it.  The country has a debt of &euro;42,000 per citizen, one of the highest national debt figures anywhere and still greater than 100% GNI.  Why would we let it sit there?  If the position will be better in 2019, 2020 or 2021, why would we not use the resources to try to get back to where we were before the Government made the errors it made and the errors made by the previous Government in 2011?  At this stage in our history, the basis seems to be incredibly flawed.</p> <p>  The Minister spoke about deposit mechanisms.  Has he given any consideration to hypothecation?  If he were to do this in the future and we were running significant surpluses, perhaps we might look at a surtax on very wealthy earners which might be hypothecated into a fund.  We had a pension fund which was our wealth fund.  We were not in the league of the Norwegians or the Saudi Arabians, but we had a significant wealth fund which the Minister's predecessor and former Deputy Brian Cowen totally got rid of, diminished and blew away.  The NTMA is holding a net &euro;14 billion, but it has to engage in significant refinancing in 2018 and 2019.  As the Minister's colleagues in the Department of Finance know, the situation is still dodgy enough in refinancing the national debt.</p> <p>  The Minister spoke about emergencies.  I will take flooding as an example.  We have always known it.  It dates back to the time of the de Valera Governments in the 1930s and was something the State did not address.  To be fair to some of the Minister's colleagues, we are beginning to address it, but we always knew about it.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned Estonia.  There is a group of Deputies who interact with others in some of the Baltic countries.  Estonia suffers from grave infrastructural deficits and has a very small population.  I do not know, therefore, whether it should be used as a model.  By the way, Finland has a countercyclical fund, as we are told in the report of the Minister's Department.  Again, one wonders as the Finnish experience is different from ours.  There is no point in comparing Ireland to the United States because it cannot run a deficit or borrow.  I do not know whether this is fantasy or, to use the Minister's own words, just bonkers?</p></speech>

On the same side of the coin let us also acknowledge that we are now in a position where it is very likely later this year that we will have more people at work than we ever had, that we will be investing more in public services, in other words, schools, hospitals and public transport, than we were able to do for many years.  The Deputy's overall contribution proves the point Deputy Lisa Chambers put to me, that it is a matter of an opportunity cost.  It is a fair point that if we spend money in setting up a rainy day fund today, it will mean that there will be other things we will not be able to do, but setting up a fund is a good idea, one that could be of help to the country in the future when we will again face some difficulty.  Whether it is a house, home or country, it is sensible to have money available to deal with it when we get to that point.</p></speech>

Where I am coming from is the principle of keeping it simple.  When I think of the concept of a rainy day fund and from where it originates, it is about the notion of putting something aside until a real need emerges.  If families can afford to do so, they put something aside for a rainy day when something will arise which cannot be met from existing or normal resources.  It is unpredictable and the money is to meet such strict emergencies.  </p> <p>  I welcome the debate because the issue becomes provocative the deeper we dig into it.</p><p>I am interested in what Deputy Thomas P. Broughan said.  Perhaps he might regret mentioning the example of the foot and mouth disease outbreak, but it is provocative too as it gets us to think deeper.  For me, one of the principles of such a fund is that it should benefit the common good as opposed to being for use in dealing with a sectoral disaster, for example.  Will it or can it make money while funds are sitting in it?</p></speech>

One of the reasons for having it is that one would be able to access it if it was needed.  If one is to access it when one needs it particularly quickly, it means that there will be a trade-off in that regard in terms of a return.  It would be a low level of return versus longer term options that would be open to the State.</p></speech>

The second is that we keep it simple.  It is for unforeseen and unexpected consequences.  For example, families have debts, mortgages, car loans and insurance that require monthly repayments to be made which they meet from their existing income.  However, it is traditional for a few quid to be put away, if people can afford it, to meet the unexpected or the unknown unknown that we know will emerge and that falls outside the normal.  It could be somebody in the household losing a job; therefore, it would allow the household to keep going.  We could use that as a metaphor.  I welcome the paper and the opportunity to continue discussing it before bringing it before the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-31a.57" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018013100002#J00800"><p>The proposal and the elements the Minister has outlined are strange and baffling.  In terms of the language used by the Minister, it almost feels we are in a "Back to the Future" moment, with extremely Bertie Ahernesque language being used in referring to there being more people at work then ever before, things being better than ever and so forth.  I sat in these and similar rooms ten years ago when I was very sceptical about that type of language.  At the time I warned about some of the inherent dangers.  I can understand the reason the Minister is delighted that more people are back at work because I am delighted too.  I doubt that anybody in the room is not delighted.  However, the tone of the language of quasi-celebration, with fist pumping almost taking place, except that we do not do that in the D&aacute;il, is strange.</p> <p>  The crash happened from 2008 onwards because as the economy collapsed we could not borrow internationally.  Around September 2010 the markets rated Ireland's debt costs as extremely high, to the point where we could no longer afford it.  Once the debt interest rate went over 7% - John Palmer knows these figures - we were basically out of the game.  There were many discussions about when the IMF would arrive with a package and the model it had adopted at the time.  Incidentally, it subsequently did not adopt that model for France, Italy and Spain because they were bigger EU countries.  </p> <p>  What I am hearing from the Minister is both intriguing and confusing.  At the time we had the National Pensions Reserve Fund which, if memory serves, was up to &euro;18 billion.  It was certainly over &euro;17 billion.  It was nabbed by the troika as our first payment under its package.  The money had been set aside, not in law but in general indicative commitments similar to the ones the Minister is indicating today, to pay for Civil Service pensions in the era after 2025 and potentially, although it was never clarified, retirement pensions paid by the Department for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I was never clear on the second point, but they were the indications.  I see Mr. Palmer nodding; therefore, my recollection is right.</p> <p>  We face the very same challenge on pensions, except that it is closer and higher.  If the Minister said he was going to set aside funding to pay for the demographic changes occurring in the country, for example, I would understand it.  However, the last such fund was taken in its entirety by the troika.  I stood in a room with a tall Hungarian - I was in opposition at the time - who asked me if we were prepared to give everything up.  The troika specifically had in its sights on all public utilities, led by the ESB.  The Government of which I was a member held it off and there was a difference of views on what should happen in that Government.</p> <p>  I am really confused.  Technically, I do not understand the status of the rainy day fund in respect of our debt level.  I agree that the current level of debt is a negative in the assessment of Ireland.  There is a profound argument that if surplus funds are available, they should be used, as has been done by the Department, something on which I have supported the Minister 100%, to recycle debt to cheaper debt at lower rates of interest or to pay down debt when it becomes opportune and advisable to do so.  Even in the scenario outlined by the Minister today, that would be the most sensible argument.  We would then have an enhanced or enlarging capacity to meet at cheaper debt rates in the current markets.</p> <p>  I realise it was the Minister's predecessor who came up with this idea and that the Minister inherited this horse, camel or giraffe - to be honest, I do not know what it is.  I also understand and accept his comments on the contingency reserve fund.  I was Minister in a Department which every year had to expend millions to deal with flooding, including in the Chairman's constituency.  A couple of months after we took office there were extensive flood waters coming down from the Dublin Mountains into various rivers; therefore, I accept the remarks made on the contingency reserve fund.  There is also the pensions issue.  Dealing with all of these issues would make much more sense.</p><p>The Minister has not yet said what the rules for this fund will be in the context of withdrawals, except to indicate that it will come out of public expenditure.  That is what I understood him to have said.</p></speech>

When money is put in does it reduce our debt?  When money is taken out, it counts as expenditure.  In a sudden crash of the economy, that could become a very difficult issue.  It certainly did on the most recent occasion.</p></speech>

The objective is that if the economy gets into difficulty in the future, money will be available to us which we can invest in the economy to offset that difficulty.  I am struck by the fact that some of the countries that have been most successful in doing this, although they are asset rich, are those of a socially-democratic persuasion politically.  When they get into difficulty at a point in the future, they will be able to invest in capital programmes in order to employ people at a time at which unemployment would otherwise be rising.  For me, it is as simple as that.  It operates on a countercyclical basis.</p> <p>  On the other questions the Deputy has put to me, her description of the bind is correct.  If we put money in, it will reduce our net debt, although it will not affect our gross debt, as the Deputy well knows.  She is also correct that when the funds are used, it will count as expenditure.  However, we could get to a point at which we would have a choice between borrowing to fund expenditure or having access to a bank account in order to fund that expenditure ourselves without having to incur high interest payments.  Amid all of the complexity, which the Deputy was right to raise, that is the simple insight on which I am trying to hone in.  The Deputy is putting a number of questions to me and is saying that there are things which need to be teased out.  There are.  One of the reasons I am before the committee this afternoon is to hear the views of its members on the matter.</p> <p>  If I can just say one more thing on the questions the Deputy put to me, there was no fist-pumping on my behalf at all.  In fact, I was at pains to acknowledge the great difficulty in which people still find themselves.  I am painfully aware of it.  I was simply making the point that, in contrast with what Deputy Bruton said, there are some good things happening in our country and the economy.  If people like myself and, indeed, the Deputy - because she acknowledges that it is good that more people are back at work - do not point that out occasionally, we give way to the kind of political attacks that are capable of undermining what the people of Ireland have achieved.</p></speech>

Can we get an explanation which sets out the debt impacts, the spending limitations and any other implications which this fund will have?  The Chairperson knows as well as I that when the rating agencies come to examine national debt, the gross national debt is the figure many of them use, as do the US markets.  The Minister can tell them that we have a given number of billions stashed away but unless he were to use the model of wealth fund Norway or some states in the Middle East and the Far East use, it would not count because it would be, in a certain sense, relatively small potatoes.  That is why the National Pensions Reserve Fund just got chopped at the time.  The Minister is talking of markets.  The markets are very tough.  I just do not get the technical explanation.  Although I am not putting this forward as a proposition, it would seem that if the Minister's objective is to improve the country's debt position, there is an argument for improving the country's gross debt situation because, in the long run, that will stand to us more in the context of the markets because they will see that debt is on the decline.  The Minister can argue, and I would argue, that-----</p></speech>

In fact, we also had a discussion yesterday about a supplementary pension that the Government has been unable to kick-start.  There are much more valuable objectives which we could discuss as alternatives.  We need a technical explanation of this proposal which can stand up to scrutiny.</p></speech>

I am not putting this proposition forward with the direct objective of reducing our gross national debt.  I never presented this proposition in such a way.  As I have said on a number of occasions, this is about creating the capacity for the State to deal with an external shock in a way that avoids the need to borrow in the future at what would be a higher interest rate.  That is the policy objective I am trying to address.  A consequence of setting up such a fund is that it would reduce our net debt level, but not our gross debt level.  However, I am not proposing that we set up a fund to affect our debt metrics because, as the Deputy is correct to say, if that was my objective, the simpler way to do it would be to reduce the national debt in the first instance and pay it off.</p> <p>  On the view of the rating agencies in this regard, one of the interesting things is that the external rating agencies, which made grave mistakes in the run-up to the financial crisis, were actually more alert to the difference between Ireland's gross debt position and our net debt position than many of the analysts and opponents at home who were predicting imminent default at every point as the country worked its way through grave difficulty.  The other choices which the Deputy has outlined illustrate the scale of the choice involved in this because, if we decide to put money into the rainy day fund, it means that we are deciding not to put it into health expenditure.  The Deputy is correct on that.  That is why, before I move this into the legislative arena at all, I thought it valuable to have a discussion about the costs and benefits of the policy I am proposing.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister and his officials for coming in.  I am mindful of the fact that a number of my colleagues on this committee from Opposition parties have highlighted the fact that they have been calling for this measure for some time.  If one was to be cynical, one could argue that members of the largest Opposition parties would be very keen to see the Government and Minister for Finance lock away much of the money we are earning from our prudent fiscal approach and save it for them to spend when they get into power.  Perhaps that is what they are thinking.  However, it makes sense to have a contingency reserve.  Really what we are talking about here is the process - what it would look like and how it would play out.  Will the Minister outline the kind of events he could see triggering the use of a rainy day fund in practical terms?  I know there has been upset at some of the examples which have been given.  How would this look to people?</p> <p>  On the funding beyond 2021, it obviously becomes harder to predict what these things will look like the further into the future one looks.  This is a medium-term approach, however, so I presume that the Department would have a view on how it could continue.  Would it continue at the same rate or does the Minister believe it would need to be ramped up in the future as budgets allow?  That would be my main point.  The Minister has already outlined that the purpose of this proposal is to provide a bit of extra security and a buffer for things as they arise.  It is hard to plan for every eventuality but I would like to get a clear idea of the type of circumstances in which he sees the need for this arising and the type of circumstances for which he would not see this fund being used.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-31a.73" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018013100002#L00100"><p>The kind of things I see it being used for include global recession, which has a significant effect on a very small and open economy; a natural disaster of some kind; some event happening in the financial markets; or as a result of policy choices made here at home that lock us out of access to the financial markets again.  I used the example earlier of a disease that affected our economy and has grave consequences for it.  I was simply making the point that a Government can invest a lot of money in trying to prevent particular phenomena from happening but those or other phenomena can still happen and there has to be a response.  From my experience of being involved in trying to do that, particularly regarding extreme weather events, I think it is a good idea to have a way to access funding like that in a more predictable way than at present.  This would help a number of Departments, particularly the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Housing, Planning and Local Government, to maintain their day-to-day commitments while dealing with the kinds of events that happen every few years to a country despite the best efforts of everybody most of the time.  I absolutely envisage contributions extending beyond 2021, otherwise, as Deputy Burton touched on, we would not get the fund up to the critical scale that would enable it to deal with the kind of events to which countries need to respond.  As a result, it will need to continue beyond 2021.  I do not see us being in a position to take billions of euro out of day-to-day expenditure and put it into this fund because of the pressures the Government faces each day in using tax receipts to fund public services.  The more likely sources of that money are one-off gains to the Exchequer, particular tax headings doing exceptionally well for a period, and putting in place an amount of money each year that is genuinely sustainable and which we are confident we can maintain for a number of years.  To approach it in any other way would set up expectations that no Government would be able to meet.</p></speech>

It could be stated that I would say that.  If we take account of the fact that we are coming out of a decade of underinvestment in our public services, there is a balance to be struck as to the best outcome for our country and investment in infrastructure and key services.  Investment in our people is just as important as keeping money aside for one element.  I agree that it is a matter for Government.  Whoever is in government at a particular time should have control over it as opposed to saying it is a matter for the D&aacute;il, which could meant that it would be kicked around as a political football.  How prescriptive could the rules relating to the drawdown be?  Would it be at the discretion of the Minister of the day?  I ask that in terms of the politics involved.  Is there a risk that something which might not be seen as a big emergency in some years, a year out from an election, for example, could be used by a Minister to free up &euro;500 million for a slush fund to splash around the economy?  How prescriptive can we be to make sure it is used in the targeted manner in future?</p></speech>

The policy on it has to strike a balance between being prescriptive enough that it cannot be accessed to deal with the kind of difficulties any Government might face, day after day and year after year, while at the same time not being so prescriptive that a Government can never use the money.  The Minister for Finance of the day would be central to that choice.</p></speech>

I go back to the point I made earlier.  Traditionally, when economies such as our own have had to deal with global events or the kind of phenomena I outlined a moment ago, the way they do it is by borrowing more.  That is a perfectly legitimate policy choice to make.  It is perfectly legitimate to borrow more and to respond to difficulty.  There are many levels of borrowing that can develop which act as automatic stabilisers that an economy triggers as it goes into difficulty.  One of the challenges of that is that normally when a Government needs to do that, it ends up paying a higher rate of interest on the borrowing because rates of interest tend to be the lowest when one needs to borrow the least.  The core of the idea is whether it is worth trying to set aside an amount of money to offset the effects in our society of tough external circumstances instead of borrowing the money at interest rates that will be far higher than is currently the case.  I am trying to portray the idea simply.  I am not running away from the inherent difficulties.  The moment we set it up and the moment the money starts being put in, people will ask why we are not using the money to invest in dealing with the difficulties of today.  That is the trade-off on which I am interested in hearing the views of members.</p></speech>

At least one Deputy has indicated a desire to ask another question.  Before I go into a second round, I will ask the Minister a number of questions.  The Minister touched on the European view on this matter.  It is very early stages.  I would have thought our European partners' view would be that budgetary issues are managed within the fiscal rules.  If there is no willingness to move from that then expenditure coming out of the fund would have to count as expenditure.  We would get no benefit from looking at expenditure going into it.  Could there be a European view not in favour of states establishing funds of this sort?  Would they prefer to see the budgetary process managed primarily through the current and existing fiscal rules set-up rather than states engaging in this process?  If we were to establish a fund - I cannot see how we ever would - that was of sufficient size and scale to deal with a countercyclical issue, the deployment of the fund would probably be in breach of the fiscal rules.  How would we handle that with our European partners if we do not have some understanding that the fund can operate in some space parallel or outside the fiscal rules?</p></speech>

Organisations such as the IMF are very supportive of the principle we are looking at here.  One of the main thrusts of current EU policy is that expenditure or macroeconomic decisions by governments should take account of where an economy is at a particular point in its cycle.  That is why we have so much focus on something that is simple in concept but very difficult to measure, which is the structural performance of an economy.  That is an ongoing spread of all EU economic policy at the moment.</p> <p>  On the Chairman's final question about whether the use of such expenditure would breach existing fiscal rules, my view is it would not but clearly we would have to work it all out with the Commission.  The reason is the fiscal rules recognise that events can occur within any economy that require expenditure to be incurred to offset their effect.  While I cannot prejudge what the Commission would say about it, I am pretty hopeful it would see it as a good idea.</p></speech>

That is my understanding of where that exemption sits.  If we were looking more at a countercyclical version of it to deal with a recessionary situation and the drawdown in that, is there the same scope within the rules to look at that in terms of the borrowing expenditure limits under the fiscal rules?</p></speech>

At that point, it is when the focus on structural measurements of the economy become - for want of a better phrase - one's friend.</p><p>The European Commission would inquire as to the outputs of the economy on the basis of where it stood in the context of its cycle.  If the economic cycle is in such a place where it is in difficulty or where we are going in the wrong direction, it strengthens the case for using expenditure to offset that, particularly expenditure on capital, which, of course, is investment for the future.  While I cannot predetermine what the Commission may say about this because we are clearly at a principal stage ourselves, I hope it would be seen in a positive light.</p></speech>

Will the Minister advise us of his assessment of where the off-balance sheet investment rules currently stand in the context of EUROSTAT and the European Union?  To my understanding, it is becoming increasingly difficult to have, for example, public private partnerships classified as they have been for a period as off-balance sheet items, such as with the experience of Irish Water.  I think this has a great bearing on the country's capacity to invest in key areas such as housing, health and so on, which we referenced.  It might be helpful to this discussion to have a note about the off-balance sheet rules.  They have become much more Germanic.  Many countries have off-balance sheet investments which were allowed a couple of years ago but which are now being put back on member states' balance sheets through EUROSTAT.  That means the investment capacity has become more limited.</p></speech>

It has improved slightly because EUROSTAT has issued guidance that allows us to make decisions on a forward-looking basis.  As a result, we have a better idea of where policy on the matter stands.  All that being said, I continue to be careful regarding the use of off-balance-sheet mechanisms.  Even though some may not be on our balance sheet, they absolutely affect the quality of it.  That is one of the many lessons that we have learned from what happened to the banking system.  We can come back to the committee with a note on that.</p></speech>

I am developing a bit of understanding from the meeting that we are probably looking at two separate issues.  The Minister said that his preference would be a countercyclical approach.  The language is important because if we are looking at approximately &euro;500 million, that is not really countercyclical.  The Minister would agree with that.  We are looking at two separate issues.  If that is the case, we will need two separate types of withdrawal criteria.  If there is a countercyclical rainy day fund and withdrawal criteria set out in primary legislation, then will annual events such as flooding - which is becoming an annual event - be suitable for a rainy day fund or for the emergency contingency fund?  I know the Minister is open to all this at the moment.  Is he looking at two different funds right now?  Would that be the preference of the Department?  I think he has already said that primary legislation would be needed for a counter-cyclical rainy day fund, but I would see difficulty in putting a contingency fund into primary legislation because one would want to access it quickly if it was something like foot and mouth disease or a flooding event.  One would not want to spend three weeks trying to get permission through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Will the Minister make that clear?  On the actual funding of the rainy day fund, if there are two separate issues, the &euro;500 million would, to me, be the short-term immediate contingency fund.  How will we fund the longer-term model?  I know the Minister said that one might be looking at such things as once-off gains to the Exchequer, maybe tax surpluses.  In that case, is it not very hard to define how quickly we could actually establish a rainy day fund of &euro;20 billion?  We do not know what once-off gains to the Exchequer could be coming down the road or what tax surpluses may or may not happen.  Will the Minister give us some insight into his thinking on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-31a.94" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018013100002#M01300"><p>I agree with the first part of what the Deputy said.  He summarised my own thinking on the matter, which is that we would look at putting together a fund which would have a countercyclical effect on the economy.  I will make one point.  Let us say we were to set up the fund as I am describing and stop contributions in 2021, for the sake of argument.  We would end up with a fund of approximately &euro;3 billion, which could make a difference to the lives of many people in our country if we were to get into difficulty.  An unfortunate effect of the awful difficulty we have gone through and are currently trying to get out of is that we have become a little anaesthetised to large amounts of money.  A Government dealing with a slowdown in global economic growth or a global recession that had &euro;3 billion or &euro;3.5 billion available to it over a couple of years could make a difference through, for example, putting in place capital programmes or providing additional work to people if they lost their jobs because of what was happening in export markets.  Amid all the debate regarding what I am seeking to do, that is the simple idea here and it could make a big difference.  The Deputy is correct to say that my current direction of travel is to have a particular fund that would deal with that kind of cyclical experience.</p> <p>  Second, I am putting forward for evaluation by the committee the idea that, either within that or separately, or even held within Departments, we should be looking at the idea of whether we can better plan for when events are more predictable in the future but will have a lower effect rather than being a crisis for the entire country.  Much of this is influenced by my time as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, when I had to deal with a series of flooding events.  If those flooding events happened towards the end of the year, at which point most capital expenditure had already been committed and most current money was gone, responding at the speed at which communities want could be difficult.  That is why I am presenting this idea for discussion.  I will see what the committee has to say about it when it gives its own views back to me.</p> <p>  The Deputy has outlined the different ways in which it could be funded.  I have outlined them myself.  He is right.  It could mean that it could take quite a while to get up to a fund that would be of significant critical mass, possibly tens of billions.  I think we still lose sight of the fact, in that debate, that billions of euro spent over 12, 18 or 24 months could have a significant effect on people's lives if we were facing into difficulty.  The most recent crisis we went through absorbed &euro;120 billion of the State's money on the fiscal side to deal with the difficulty that we were in.  I hope we never go through an experience like that again but we will go through different difficulties.  That is why I think there is value in this idea.</p></speech>

I imagine it would be very difficult in primary legislation to specify what an event would be.  One could not give a list of potential events.</p></speech>

When this idea was originally conceived, regardless of who the parent of it was, it was about having a rainy day fund to deal with global shocks and how an open economy can respond to big events beyond its control.  One of the ideas I have just brought to bear in this debate is that there are other things that can happen that are not at that level of difficulty but to which the Government of the day would still need to respond quickly and there are different ways of doing that.</p></speech>

If he does not have the facts at his immediate disposal a note will suffice.</p> <p>  Is there anything the Minister wants to say on our experience with Carillion recently and PPPs?  Does it have anything to teach us?  Is the Minister exploring other options to PPPs that might free up capital or take advantage of capital in respect of investment in infrastructural projects?</p> <p>  I have a specific question on the HSE.  We have a note here that the HSE is potentially facing a financial shortfall in 2018.  Has that been accounted for in the baseline budget figures for 2018?  I will relate that to a specific example in my constituency where Tallaght hospital has two or three major projects, one being an intensive care unit that is at design stage.  The other project is a renal unit that had been approved for funding by the HSE.  Tender documents issued for it in December with the intention of awarding that contract in March.  The HSE has now extended the tender process until October with the hope that it can award the contract in early 2019 when funding may be available.  My understanding is that the problem lies with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform side of the Minister's area of responsibility.  The HSE formally confirmed funds last June but it is now citing an unanticipated deficit in the capital budget for 2018 arising from cutbacks applied by the Department in October.  That has now caused the delay not just of this project, which is not just a once-off project but is part of a jigsaw of projects about which Tallaght hospital management have been pretty keen and excited.  I would welcome the Minister's comments in that regard.</p> <p>  If there is a deficit in the capital budget, could the Minister confirm that funding is available for the national maternity hospital and where will it come from?  What is the status of that project in terms of capital funding?</p></speech>

I am not in a position to answer that question now.</p> <p>  On his point about public private partnerships, they do have a valuable role to play in the economy and there are many other projects that have been delivered well by PPPs.  The benefit they have for the State is that we do not make any payments for a project until it is either open or finished.  That is why PPPs play a valuable role but I continue to take a careful approach to them in that we must decide on a project-by-project basis whether they are the right thing to do.</p> <p>  I hope and expect that the difficulties regarding the schools that are being built by Carillion will be resolved.  I know the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, is working on that at the moment.  I will look to see what we can learn from that particular experience.</p></speech>

Is it currently the position that each Department assesses its own PPPs, for example, the Department of Education and Skills examines the PPPs for the building of schools or third level institutions?  Is it done on a departmental basis currently?  One of the things the IMF included in its recommendations is that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would take an overall approach to PPPs.  What is the current situation and how does it work?</p></speech>

First, we have a set of PPPs that are either now complete or under way and I am not in a position to publish details on them because of the way they are conceived but we always look at the start of a project to see whether the figures stack up and then we evaluate at the end of a project whether it was the appropriate way to do it.  That has informed the view I gave to Deputy Lahart that I believe in many cases, PPPs can be a good way of delivering projects, in particular if there is an income stream delivered by them which can be fed into the business model for the project.  However, I look at all those things on a case-by-case basis.</p> <p>  As for what I said in response to the Deputy's parliamentary question last week, I am of the view that for future PPPs, we can publish and make available more information than we do at the moment.  I believe we can still meet the requirements of commercial sensitivity while giving the Oireachtas and people who focus on those things more information than is currently available to them.  If and when we engage in future PPPs that is something I aim to do.</p></speech>

I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones, as they interfere with the broadcast system.  During this meeting, we have an engagement with Pobal representatives.  It is proposed that this session will conclude not later than 1 p.m. and will be followed by a two-minute sos, after which we will resume in private session.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Denis Leamy, chief executive officer, and Mr. Gerry Murphy, deputy chief executive officer.</p> <p>  This is a new committee.  We had our first meeting on 29 November 2017.  Rural development support is the second pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and the committee is interested in several elements of the policy.  The EU plans to spend almost &euro;100 billion on rural development policy in the period 2014 to 2020 through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, EAFRD.  In Ireland, we plan to spend &euro;4 billion of public money on our rural development programme, RDP, during this period.  The committee met members of the EU Court of Auditors recently and examined their special report: Rural Development Programming: less complexity and more focus on results needed.  I welcome its recommendations and conclusions to reduce complexity and the focus on performance and results.  However, the future is unknowable and unforeseen shocks to the system can undo the best laid plans.  We need only mention Brexit or recent threats to international trade and the effects of climate change.</p> <p>  The committee has an oversight role in respect of the Department of Rural and Community Development and the following bodies come under its remit: Pobal, Western Development Commission, Irish Water Safety, and the Charities Regulator.  Pobal is the first body to appear before the committee.  The organisation disbursed &euro;615 million directly to beneficiaries in 2017, up from &euro;257 million in 2011.  Given Pobal's importance, the committee is interested in hearing about its past performance, current issues and future strategies.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Any submissions, opening statements or other documents the witnesses have supplied to the committee will be published on the committee's website after this meeting.<br/><br/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Jerry Murphy, who is deputy CEO.</p> <p>  Pobal, formerly known as Area Development Management, was established in 1992 by the Irish Government with the European Commission to manage an EU grant for local development.  We work to support communities and local agencies towards achieving social inclusion and development.  Our activities and priorities are shaped by the context and policies laid out in several reports, including the programme for Government, the Action Plan for Jobs, Pathways to Work, the Action Plan for Rural Development, the framework policy for local and community development in Ireland, Putting People First, and EU 2020.  We are in the process of developing a new strategic plan for 2018 to 2021 which will form the basis of how Pobal responds to the needs of communities and our funders over the next three years.  We will ensure that our new strategy takes account of the principles contained within the national planning framework when it is finalised later this quarter.</p> <p>  Pobal&rsquo;s work supports the delivery of valuable services to marginalised communities in Ireland.  Some of the groups supported by Government through Pobal include the long-term unemployed, young people, farmers, fishermen, families, Travellers, older people and ex-prisoners.  We have formed alliances nationally and internationally to advance our service delivery model, including close working relationships with the OECD and ESRI.  Our day-to-day work involves assisting on programme design, assessing grant applications, proposals and plans, managing contracts, distributing funding, monitoring progress, and auditing beneficiaries.  We provide good practice case studies, evaluations, and demographic information that support Departments in making policy decisions.  We make tools such as Pobal Maps and the Pobal HP deprivation index freely available to allow policymakers and communities respond to needs identified by these sets of tools.</p> <p>  Through our work, Pobal supports collaborative approaches to planning and decision-making.  We work to promote good relationships between the community sector, State agencies and other stakeholders.  In keeping with our goal to operate a balanced regional approach to service delivery, we operate from office bases in Dublin, Monaghan, Sligo, Clifden, Letterkenny, Galway city, Limerick and Kilkenny.  The Department of Rural and Community Development is our lead Department and I will later discuss some of the governance and regulatory mechanisms under which we operate.</p> <p>  In 2017, Pobal managed 23 programmes, primarily for four Departments.  The full list of programmes is detailed in the supporting information provided to the committee.  In managing these programmes, Pobal distributed almost &euro;615 million to beneficiaries.  We had contracts with almost 5,000 groups throughout the country, channelled funding to 4,360 child care providers which support 162,848 children, and supported 24,780 people in employment and enterprise programmes in 2016, with an additional 7,960 supported into employment or self-employment through the social inclusion community activation programme, SICAP.  This activity was achieved with an average of 356 staff, 45% of whom are based outside of Dublin.</p> <p>  Our total administration spend for 2017 was &euro;26.4 million, or 4.1% of programme costs.  This is down from 5.68% in 2008, 4.60% in 2015 and 4.44 % in 2016.  Pobal&rsquo;s work has grown significantly in recent years, with the amount of funds disbursed rising from &euro;257 million in 2011 to the current level of &euro;615 million in 2017.  Significant amounts of that growth have taken place within the early years sector, as support to parents and child care providers has grown.</p> <p>  In preparing for today, we decided to focus in detail on those programmes which we administer on behalf of the Department of Rural and Community Development.  Members should have a separate briefing paper detailing these programmes.  If members of the committee have any questions on other programmes, I and my team would be happy to furnish them with the details at a later stage. </p> <p>  Over the course of our 25 years, Pobal has evolved in response to Government priorities.  We are dedicated to supporting communities and civic society in responding to local needs.  Our board and staff are committed to supporting Government in its work to make Ireland a fairer place to live for all of our communities.  We are also aware of the need to ensure that our procedures are fair, not overly burdensome and are appropriate to the size of the funds being allocated.  This is not easy in a world where there is a need and expectation for increased governance, oversight and financial prudence.</p> <p>  It is company policy to identify the minimum data requirements needed for the effective administration of a given scheme.  However, issues such as European level data requirements must be factored into this design process.  Key achievements over the past 12 months have included reducing by more than one third the non-financial annual reporting requirements under the scheme to support national organisations, SSNO, significantly reducing the minimum participant information required under the new SICAP programme for 2018 to 2022  as of 1 January 2018, and reducing some of the contractual obligations on seniors alert scheme community groups.</p> <p>  We recognise that there is significantly more work to do on this area and it will be an important element of our new strategic plan.  We are increasingly using online platforms as a measure for reducing red tape while at the same time ensuring sufficient checks, balances and audit trails are in place to protect taxpayers' money.  The seniors alert scheme is a good example of a technical solution that was delivered by Pobal and the Department to reduce administration and delays in getting personal monitored alarms fitted in vulnerable older people&rsquo;s homes.  We can turn requests for personal monitored alarms around within a 24-hour period, or shorter in the case of emergencies.</p> <p>  In recent years, Pobal has established a formal feedback and engagement process, which ensures that the voice of beneficiary organisations are factored into operational decision-making.  As part of this project, an independent organisation was recently commissioned to undertake a series of workshops to identify areas for improvement in Pobal&rsquo;s administration of grants on behalf of Government.  This report, currently in draft stage, has highlighted a number of successes as well as areas for development and improvement.  The report finds that among beneficiaries in the social inclusion sector, 85% believed that Pobal provides clear guidance and information on the application process, 76% reported that Pobal provides good customer service, and 78% reported that training events are useful and helpful.  The issue of the level of information required by Pobal was identified as an area for possible improvement and, as I have mentioned, a number of steps have been and continue to be implemented to reduce the administrative burden on beneficiary organisations.</p> <p>  A commitment to social inclusion is at the heart of Pobal.  While there have been improvements in Ireland&rsquo;s social and economic landscape, there are still a number of key issues requiring attention, funding and collaborative solutions.  A few key findings from our 2016 deprivation index are that affluence is highest in the urban peripheries and gradually declines as one moves towards rural locations.  Dublin has fared the best over the past ten years, being less impacted by the effects of the recession, as well as disproportionately benefiting from the recent years of recovery.  Small towns of 1,000 of 5,000 people have been the worst affected over the past ten years, having been disproportionately hit by the recession and benefiting less from the recovery than the most urban and the most rural areas.  We would also attest to the need for further targeted initiatives and responses for those on the margins of our society.</p> <p>  Pobal operates on the basis of a framework agreement with the Department of Rural and Community Development and programme-specific service level agreements with individual Departments.</p><p>Each year a programme of work is agreed with each Department for any work Pobal is requested to undertake.</p><p> Key features of Pobal's governance structures include that members of the board work on a voluntary basis and are appointed at the discretion of the Government.  The State board appointment process is utilised by the Department of Rural and Community Development for the initial selection of interested and suitable parties to be appointed to the board.  The term of office of our current chairperson, Mr. Seamus Boland, is due to conclude in 2018 and I expect a new chair-designate will be before the joint committee later this year.</p><p> Pobal is responsible for adhering to all relevant legislative provisions, Department circulars, guidelines and public financial procedures issued by the Government.  We are subject to the 2016 code of governance for non-commercial State bodies and audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General annually.  Pobal is registered with the Charities Regulatory Authority and is fully compliant with all its obligations in that regard.  Pobal reports to Departments through regular governance meetings, and delivery of programme reports and data and is subject to regular audits by Departments.</p><p> Over time, Pobal has adapted its skill sets and competencies to respond to the changes and challenges in the socio-economic landscape.  We are in the process of developing a new strategic plan, while also undertaking a leadership review of the organisation.  It is hoped both processes will ensure the organisation is lean, fit for purpose and responsive to the future needs of communities and government.</p><p> It goes without saying that the unsung heroes of the work in which we are involved are the boards, committees and volunteers that work to make their communities better places to live.  A great strength of community development is that it emerges from communities.  The State relies heavily on community groups to deliver services.  Pobal, with 25 years of experience, supports the continued sustainability of these services in towns and villages throughout Ireland.  As the chief executive officer of the organisation, I am confident in the work Pobal delivers daily.  As the company continues to grow and adapt to the requirements of Government, we have the expertise and people needed to support communities in future.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for this opportunity to appear before the joint committee.  Mr. Murphy and I will be please to answer questions members may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-31a.125" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1263" speakername="Michael Collins" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018013100002#C00200"><p>I welcome Mr. Leamy and Mr. Murphy.  Having been involved in many boards and committees on a voluntary basis, I would have liked an opportunity to review the 23 programmes being rolled out by Pobal because I would be able to connect to many of them.</p><p>Some years ago, a new social inclusion programme was introduced which focused initially on farmers and fishermen.  It subsequently changed, however, and in west Cork it became more focused on Roma and other sections of society that have nothing to do with my area.  This was a serious blow because farmers and fishermen, especially those on low incomes, lost a great advisory service provided under the programme.  While I do not know what form the new social inclusion programme will take and I do not seek to discredit anyone, there are no Roma in Goleen, Bandon or anywhere else in west Cork.  I do not know why discussions on the ground did not filter back to the needs of the constituency I represent and, I presume, many more constituencies.  I ask the witnesses to clarify that matter.</p><p>Pobal probably has some connections with the Leader programme, which is basically no longer available.  With only two years left of the current programme, there has been little or no delivery to the community and voluntary sector.  This is alarming to say the least and it will be a scramble to the line to have the available moneys disbursed to community and voluntary groups.  These organisations, all of which are voluntary, receive a small amount of funding and deliver a large number of services.  The people involved do not receive any payment for the many hours of work they do.  They have been telephoning politicians trying to secure Leader funding as this used to be available to them.  The number of hoops they must now jump through means many of them have decided to forget it.</p><p>The West Cork Development Partnership, an excellent group that previously delivered the Leader programme, was wiped off the face of the earth for no reason.  We no longer have a programme in the area and I understand it is now delivered through the Aran Islands.  This is mind-boggling and questions need to be answered because it will probably lead to an inquiry in a few years.  While that issue may not have anything to do with the witnesses, there is no harm in letting them know how people on the ground feel.</p><p>Pobal delivers the community services programme.  I am often asked the same question about the schemes operated under this programme, some of which were allowed to appoint managers.  If a manager retires, can he or she seek redundancy from the community group in question?  This is a serious concern for the community and voluntary sector because many of these groups are being asked this question by managers contemplating retirement.  The programme has been in place for many years.  Who would fund redundancy payments?  Voluntary organisations are extremely worried that they may be expected to do so.</p><p>Payment for bank holidays and so forth is also a grey area.  Many issues arise regarding section 39 funding, which I accept is not the business of Pobal.  However, the bottom line with the community service programme is that Pobal provides funding to the voluntary organisations which must then administer the funding.  This is a significant burden and things fall between the cracks.  Some of the organisations are concerned that workers may be entitled to payment for bank holidays on which they do not work.  They fear they may end up in serious trouble.  In one case, a group was fined &euro;4,000 by Pobal, which was a scandalous decision.  The group in question bought a work unit which community service programme workers could work in.  However, it was later told it should have rented the unit and Pobal would have paid the rent.  The organisation did the honest thing by buying the work unit from its funding and applying a small charge on Pobal, which refused to pay it and asked for the money to be returned.  This is brutal for a voluntary organisation.</p><p>We need to consider what is happening on the ground.  When people see attractive programmes advertised, they may decide to bring them into their community on a voluntary basis.  They are then subjected to audits.  I was the chairman of one group where the treasurer nearly suffered a breakdown as a result of an audit that was carried out.  The auditor was ruthless.  I did not give a damn because the bottom line was that we were all volunteers.  I was not a politician at the time.  I told the auditor to stop being ruthless as we were all human beings and asked if there was an issue.  He replied that there were no issues and everything was fine.  It was as if he had to justify his day's work in west Cork or wherever else he visited.  This is not good enough.  When a group makes a human error, the auditor should sit down with the individuals involved and rectify the problems rather than fining the group because that could put it out of business.  The treasurers and other volunteers doing great work in their communities may decide they can no longer cope and will not want to be involved in what appears to be professional work that is way over their heads.</p><p>I am not arguing that Pobal's work is all bad but I need to have these issues clarified.  Where is the delivery in respect of farmers and fishermen?  Is Pobal involved in delivering the rural social scheme?  This fabulous scheme for low-income farmers and fishermen has become less attractive because payments have changed, which is a significant worry.  We fought bravely and successfully when negotiating the programme for Government to have the numbers on the scheme increased.  I notice, however, that the increase <i>per capita</i>in west Cork was among the lowest in the country, despite the area having large numbers of inshore fishermen and low-income farmers, primarily suckler farmers.</p><p>I would appreciate it if they might be able to answer some of those questions.</p></speech>

I will respond to some of the issues and I might call on my colleague to respond to some of the others because he is more familiar with some of the questions the Deputy raised.</p> <p>  I will respond on the community services programme first because the Deputy raised a number of issues in terms of the audits and the burden that is placed on voluntary committees involved in that.  On the context, there are more than 350 community service projects nationwide and the Department requires us to audit at least 5% of them on an annual basis.  A set of rules has been set up for the community services programme by the Department against which we have to audit.  Some issues that come across to the groups - I fully understand that from a local perspective, one would wonder why Pobal or the State is chasing an item of expenditure - are against the rules under which the programme was set up.  They are against the rules to which the group signed up.  We have raised this with the Department and have been working through it to try to change some of the rules to get rid of some of these anomalies over time.  I also am aware that the Minister, Deputy Ring, is planning to review the programme towards the end of the year, which might allow for some of these pieces to be looked at.  In terms of our role, our auditors go out to audit against the rules of the programme and we do not have the flexibility to move away from that.</p> <p>  The results of those audits come to our audit, finance and risk sub-committee and we discuss many of them in detail.  It is fair to say the percentage of groups to which we go back to recoup moneys or against which there might be negative findings is very small.  However, there might be findings that relate to governance, to how decisions were made or to how persons were accounting for the moneys.  It is about trying to improve the practice of the groups when they receive the reports or where they get some supports from us as well around these broader issues, and we use these reports to inform some of that.</p> <p>  On the manager piece, while I will come back to the Deputy directly later, there should be no liability on a group locally in respect of someone coming to retirement age.  As for people seeking redundancy, we take a firm view that the contract with the individual is between the local group and the individual.  The support that exists, from a community services point of view, is a subsidy to the programme.  Because they sign up to this concept of community supports, it is expected that local groups would have a level of matching funding or income they would raise from an enterprise they are running and that they themselves would then run the programme.  On the redundancy piece, if someone was looking for redundancy or if an organisation had to make people redundant, it is an issue that must be worked through the local mechanisms from a governance point of view.  All the groups must provide a three-year business plan and a big part of our testing and working through those business case studies pertains to sustainability.  We do not always get it right but we do in the vast majority of cases, in trying to ensure they will be sustainable for those three years.  In that sense, we would not foresee that there would be a need for redundancy.  It is, however, the call of the local group in that regard.</p> <p>  Deputy Michael Collins raised issues in terms of the Leader programme.  We are all familiar with the issues that relate to the Leader programme in terms of the slow take-up and throughput of projects.  To clarify, our role in it was to assess initially the plans that were developed by each of the local action groups, LAGs.  Second, it was to develop an ICT system to support the development of the Leader programme and third, we were required by the Department to carry out Article 48 checks at a central level on the Leader plans.  The Article 48 checks are often the issue thrown up as being part of the delay and our turnaround time for any such checks that come before us is ten days.  Moreover, we have kept to that over the past couple of years.  However, I am aware that there are delays at a local level and nationally.  There have been some changes made in the past number of months that have helped to speed up the process and we have noticed a good increase in the number of Article 48 checks coming to us to be done.  In that regard, there will be a significant change over the next period but I accept there has been much difficulty and frustration in trying to roll this out on a local basis.</p> <p>  I might turn to my colleague on the point the Deputy raised on the fishermen and farmers with regard to the programme.</p></speech>

First, there is a nationally set number of groupings that the programme is to target but each local area, through the local community development committee, LCDC, is also given authority to add a target group locally if it is appropriate.  That was open as a local opportunity.  Although I might be wrong on this, I suggest that probably the reason they felt they did not need to add fishermen and farmers was that the programme now includes a target for low-income families.  There was much discussion about farmers and fishermen.  The intention always had been that the farmers and fishermen who had been targeted in previous programmes were to be those on low income.  The idea was that targeting of low-income families should allow any low-income farmer or fisherman, in west Cork or any other area, to be a perfectly valid recipient of supports through the programmes.  There certainly should be no reason that such work cannot continue with those groups in SICAP.</p></speech>

There is a huge terrain of countryside in south-west Cork and at that time we lost our worker who was specifically dealing with low-income farmers and low-income fishermen.  He was moved on to do some other job that did not relate to any issue of great concern to the people of west Cork.  Unfortunately, we lost that worker.  It was a huge loss to west Cork.</p></speech>

It certainly is valuable to hear the information, particularly the thorough and informative presentation from Mr. Leamy.</p> <p>  I will raise a couple of issues with which I am familiar.  I certainly concur with Deputy Michael Collins that the Leader programme is posing difficulties for many community groups.  One of Pobal's roles is to protect the services and support the community groups.  Could an intervention be made to call for a review of Leader in light of all the complaints that are coming in?  We have raised this at this committee previously and a review is warranted at this point.</p> <p>  The T&uacute;s schemes throughout the State are doing fantastic work.  From speaking to participants in my constituency of Offaly, I am aware they are enjoying the schemes and are attaining valuable skills on them.  I could not compliment them enough.  A number of supervisors from T&uacute;s schemes have met me recently, however, and raised serious concerns about how the JobPath scheme is taking some employees from them.  People are very unhappy.  The supervisors are unhappy but the participants, who had been enjoying their T&uacute;s scheme, are suddenly being pulled away and forced into employment in which they are unhappy and are not attaining valuable skills.  This must be addressed.  I took up this issue with the Taoiseach last year when he was Minister for Social Protection.  It must be addressed because it is causing huge dissatisfaction among the participants and we want to safeguard the schemes.</p> <p>  The T&uacute;s schemes have been doing fantastic work.  In many cases, they filled the void when we lost our town councils.  They give participants an valuable opportunity that they would not otherwise get in marginalised communities.  I reiterate the importance of an intervention to be made in that regard.</p> <p>  In terms of the PEACE programme, could a strategy to broaden this programme be put in place in light of Brexit?  In terms of the priorities, is it possible that the priorities in the PEACE programme could be reviewed before 2020?</p><p>Could negotiations with the European Parliament be called for in that regard because we are facing Brexit and its associated impact?</p></speech>

As regards the PEACE programme, we sit on its monitoring committee and are involved with Co-operation Ireland and Ulster University in regard to the quality and impact body for the youth strand.  It is early days in that regard.  The effects of Brexit were to the fore of discussion at the PEACE monitoring committee over the past couple of years.  There are now firm funding commitments from the Irish and British Governments and the European Union for the PEACE programme to be sustained in the coming years.  It is to be welcomed that this has been overcome in recent times.</p> <p>  As regards our role, we are not a decision maker in terms of the PEACE programme although we sit on its monitoring committee.  I am happy to bring the point raised by Deputy Nolan to the attention of the PEACE monitoring committee and the Special European Union Programmes Body.</p> <p>  On the programme being widened beyond the Border counties, I take it the Deputy was referring to it being spread more down South, as opposed to the Border region and the North.  That is set in stone because the plans were approved by the European Union and the European Commission, which took a long time.  It would be difficult to extend it at present but perhaps that should be considered for the next PEACE programme or whatever will follow in that regard.</p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Murphy to respond to the questions on T&uacute;s and JobPath.</p> <p>  We have a fairly defined role in regard to the Leader programme.  It is not our call to have a review of the scheme but, rather, it is a decision for the Department.  We meet the Department on a regular basis and reflect on the issues that have been raised, of which it is well aware.  There will be a significant improvement in the uptake of the scheme in the coming months.  It will then be time to consider what needs to happen in terms of sustaining it for the future.</p></speech>

We share her sentiments in that regard.  Several of the programmes operating within local communities that have a dual aspect in assisting people into jobs and in offering significant local community services are particularly important.  Pobal plays a particularly important role in so far as we have a role in several such programmes.  We are involved with T&uacute;s, the rural social scheme, RSS, the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, and the community services programme, CSP, and we do our best to ensure co-ordination in that regard.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, we are not party to JobPath, which is directly contracted by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, although we have many links in that regard.  The Deputy's representation via the Taoiseach is the most important route but we can channel that these concerns exist.  We also have heard these concerns  and it is very important for the Government as a whole to carry out that co-ordination role and we will do what we can to ensure those messages are clearly passed through.</p></speech>

I would like to take a step back, as this is a relatively new committee and my questions are not as specific as are some others.  What is the witnesses' definition of "community"?  What do community and community development mean to Pobal?  Is Pobal succeeding in the community-centred approach?</p> <p>  I am from Tramore, County Waterford, and always have been very active in my local community.  One issue that is repeatedly raised by members of the community is that smaller groups that are already relatively embedded in the community are buckling under the weight of administration.  Such groups are small and have ambition but they believe there is a time-consuming burden upon them and they have to go through hoops and loops to access support funding.  What can be done to support such smaller groups that are developing but are wasting too much time or missing opportunities because of the administrative burden?</p> <p>  Another issue which has been raised pertains to personal professional development, such as continuing professional development, CPD, in the early childhood development sector.  There is a sense that remuneration is low for what staff are putting in but that may be somewhat mitigated if there were more funding and support for professional development programmes.  Not only would such people have something more to offer to their communities but there would be an appreciation of what they do and that they are moving towards more professional academic qualifications and would then have more to offer to organisations such as Pobal.</p> <p>  There is a sense that the outcomes to which Pobal looks are very prescribed.  The area of climate change was mentioned by the Chair.  As a society, we will have to adapt not just to environmental but also social and cultural changes.  I wonder about the ability to have emerging, rather than prescribed, outcomes.  We will need a society that is able to adapt, emerge and be creative.  People in the community are our leaders and we should be looking to them as to how to develop our programmes.  They should not have a sense of being told what is wanted from them and that they should not exercise too much creativity because that does not work for the organisation.  I would like for there to be more development in that area.</p></speech>

Pobal sees community as every town, village and city across the country but we look at it through a lens of social inclusion, equality, where the areas of greatest disadvantage are and from where the resources to address those issues will come.  We work with the Government to target those areas through that lens.  While some programmes may have a more universal element, most have a targeted element to assist those who need supports to have a better quality of life in terms of engagements with society, while taking into account people's broader issues people.</p> <p>  On community development, which also relates to the Senator's latter point, it is very much a bottom-up approach.  Needs are identified at a local level and plans are then worked through to respond to those needs.  That is our definition of community development.  However, we sometimes struggle with defining or working through the programmes as to how they might match that in the most effective way because there is a clear requirement for accountability for the funding and taxpayers' money spent on each area.  Trying to get that match can be difficult.</p> <p>  To return to the Senator's point on people's creativity or innovation in responding to their local needs, a key challenge for us is that because an idea does not fit a particular box there may be no scope for it to be funded or worked through.  We will address that challenge over the course of our next strategic plan and the next few years in terms of matching that in a better way.  However, we are constrained in respect of data protection, public accountability for moneys spent and the various circulars on how that must be accounted for.</p><p>As I said in my statement, Pobal has evolved over a number of years.  It has to evolve further in how it truly responds to those things that are emerging from communities.  </p><p> A good percentage of our staff come from community development backgrounds and have worked on the ground in every parish in the country.  They know the issues involved.  We have to work through the frustration people sometimes feel at the very defined ways in which Pobal expects people to account.  </p><p> I will hand over to my colleague who will talk about professional development in the early years sector.</p></speech>

As an organisation working on behalf of the Government, we are channelling many services through local communities.  If we do not actively support them, we will all lose, including communities.  The senior alert scheme is a good example of where there has been a series of changes in legislation which have lead to more onerous demands being placed on groups.  Garda vetting is one such demand.  The group is linking directly with vulnerable older people in their homes and the law now provides that the person who goes to people's homes has to be vetted.  That is a large additional burden on a group.  We have tried to put processes in place in order that we can make these arrangements for groups in order that they will not have to carry all of the bureaucracy.  We have also taken other bits of the bureaucracy off them that they had to manage in the past, in particular finding all of their own equipment and going through tendering processes.  We now control these things centrally.  We have worked with local volunteer centres to make the Garda vetting process available to them.  The feedback we are getting is that once people have been through the training process, the committees see that they have to be on board in dealing with the issues they might have viewed as a burden previously.  We are the messengers and the face of the centre for groups and making these demands.</p> <p>  On further professional development in the early years sector, I point to two things.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has been providing money for us for a number of years for an active learner fund that offers direct funding for training for people within the early years sector.  It has been an effective fund and very useful for people within the sector.  I flag that there is work ongoing between us and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to look at the further need for professional development and how it could be delivered.  It is a need which is very much a recognised within the sector.  We are aware that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is looking at it and we will be supporting it in that regard.</p></speech>

Like every other Deputy, rural Deputies especially, I have a long history of working in the community.  I compliment the delegates on the work they do.</p> <p>  We have spoken about the rural social scheme and T&uacute;s, but one of the issues I am coming across lately is insurance cover for rural social scheme or T&uacute;s participants working on projects in villages and towns.  In that regard, there is an issue about working on public roads.  There is an anomaly in that it is very hard to determine who is the employer and thus should insure participants if they are working on roads.</p></speech>

This is seriously curtailing the benefit that can be delivered by the schemes.  It is something of which the Leader groups and those administering the rural social scheme are acutely aware.  I remember back in 2007 and 2008 that it boiled down to who prepared traffic management plans.  The Leader groups or companies trained somebody to prepare the plans which previously had been signed off on by the council engineer.  However, they were told that they could not do so.  It nullifies and negates much of the positive work that is being done and that can be done.  It may not be the role of Pobal to sort it out, but it has a responsibility, with the local authority groups and Leader companies, to put something in place quickly to prevent the demise of the schemes and their benefit to the areas in question.  That is not a criticism but a comment on something that is hitting us hard in rural Ireland.</p> <p>  Last week my group in Belclare in Tuam, County Galway received its paperwork to fill in for next year's rural social scheme programme.  I compared it to what had happened in the first year the scheme was run in terms of the documentation required from the sponsoring group.  I question the need for some of it.  It has applied for so many years to seek to provide a scheme, a work schedule, in engaging with the supervisor and the Leader company.  Every year there is an additional request that something else be provided.  For instance, this year groups have to provide health and safety plans.  The sponsoring and local voluntary groups are being burdened with a huge responsibility.  It is turning people against getting involved and signing their names on a piece of paper on behalf of a sponsoring group.  Some body, be it Pobal, the Leader company or the Department, needs to play a role in taking it back.  They should be sorting out the insurance issue rather than telling us why it cannot be sorted out.  Pobal should play a role in that regard.</p></speech>

When we undertake a project, we are asked if we delivered value for money.  If, for example, an engineer was to write a letter to say value for money had been achieved, is it the kind of thing Pobal would accept?  I know that the schemes do achieve value for money.  Any money spent on them, including the social inclusion and activation programme, SICAP, the rural social scheme or the community employment scheme, probably represents the best value for money achieved for any public money spent.  I would like to see it being proved, rather than making a bald statement they did achieve value for money.  From a political point of view, we need to see the value that can be achieved with a small amount of money.  With a little more money the schemes could achieve so much more for communities.  For the participants it is very important that this kind of stuff is being spoken about.</p> <p>  I find that when participants aged 55 plus are told that they have to go off a scheme, they do not find other gainful employment . Someone who is 30 years old may be brought onto the scheme who might be in a better position to find employment.  I ask Pobal to take on board the issues people who are part-time farmers face on rural social schemes.  When they reach the age of 55 years, they should be allowed to remain on the scheme until they reach pension age.  That would provide stability in the numbers of participants involved.</p><p>We are to increase numbers on the rural social scheme.  We are meant to double them over the next two years.  We also need to ensure we bring the threshold down to 55 or 56.  If an individual at that age does not have employment then he or she can remain on the scheme until he or she gets the pension.  They are small things that mean an awful lot to people.  I commend the witnesses on the work they do and on the profile of the work they do.  What we do not do is put it out there as good as we should.  It is good money being spent in a positive way. </p></speech>

I accept his last point.  We need to be better at illustrating the impact of all these ranges of work and the value given to the people involved as well.  They need to see and hear about it from others.</p> <p>  I refer to the rural social scheme and the issue of insurance.  I have heard about it from a wide number of people as well.  We have a firm role in providing a help desk, a payroll service and training in the social rural scheme.  We are guided by the rules set by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  However, I undertake to ensure we raise it and try to get it addressed.  This issue has been raised with us in Pobal.  I know it is coming more and more to the fore in terms of groups taking responsibility for insurance.  </p> <p>  In respect of the documentation that groups receive, the rural social scheme was mentioned but we could apply it to many schemes and programmes we are involved in.  We are tied again by the regulatory and legislative frameworks.  We cannot do some of these things for the groups.  Mr. Murphy gave an example of the senior alerts where we can take on some of that and take away some of the burden.  However, there are some things, especially relating to health and safety or other items that the groups themselves have to own.  What we need to look at there, and we have done it at times, is providing more comprehensive training and support to groups.  That is something we will be trying to address over the next three years as well.  I refer to Pobal being out there much more, involved in regional seminars, working with groups on particular themes and looking at templates that are there.  </p> <p>  We cannot work through those templates with people but at least we can hopefully provide them with the materials.  We do that on many programmes.  Doing more of that is where we need to concentrate and take away some of that burden from groups.  How we deliver value for money is my first question everyday.  The value of the work going on on the ground across the country is critical.  We are a management and administrative framework to that.  It is incumbent upon us to be as lean as possible in how we provide that service.  We measure the administration costs of the overall programme costs.  Those are declining.  </p> <p>  We also look at better ways of doing our work.  Technology has been extremely important to us over the last number of years.  I refer to online portals and online engagement with groups.  That throws up issues as well, especially in areas where broadband is not particularly strong or people do not have the resources to engage.  However, we have two sets of support available.  Most are online but paper versions are also available to the groups that cannot engage with that.  We ensure we are getting as much efficiency as possible through applying technology to the changes and we are continuing to do that.  There is much more technology that can make us lean into the future.</p> <p>  Most of our resources and staff are actually out on the ground.  The community and early years side of things involves meeting groups and involvement through regional supports.  They are one-to-one supports through the groups.  To lessen the burden on the groups is part of the critical infrastructure.  I will come to Mr. Murphy in respect of the outputs.</p></speech>

It is all very well for a group in a local area to be doing something.  However, the message needs to get out and it needs to be joined with the messages from the other groups around what works, what does not and what they are producing for Government.  We have invested heavily in systems, support structures and in data collection to try to give those messages.  At times, it is not popular locally because we are asking them to give us information.  However, when the benefit is seen of putting that information together to demonstrate to Government the value of their programme, people then see it is all about maintaining investment.</p> <p>  I will use the social inclusion and community activation plan, SICAP, as an example.  That was raised earlier.  There is an information system now in SICAP that allows us not only know what each group is doing but exactly who they are doing it with and to prove that, for example, in terms of the targeting issue that was raised earlier, we know we are working with the most disadvantaged people.  We also know what services they are getting and how they have moved from unemployment to employment.  Mr Leamy mentioned earlier in his opening address that our relationship with organisations like the ESRI is important to us.  We work closely with the ESRI.  It objectively and independently looks at the figures and what is happening.  It has been able to make very strong statements that the programme is working with the most disadvantaged and that it is producing a series of outputs. </p> <p>  I will point members as well to one of the documents going around.  It is called "Kickboxing kindness and going the extra mile".  It is an example of good practice not always being about numbers and figures.  It is about dealing with people with particular types of issues, how local groups have successfully managed to do that and then drawing those lessons out to give elsewhere.  We see that as an important part of our role.</p></speech>

As the labour market gets tighter, our increased focus is going to be on people who find it the most difficult in accessing employment, the longer-term unemployed or people who have a whole series of obstacles to gaining employment.  Part of our informing of policy and Government Departments will be about the focus that needs to be put there.  The recovery will allow us to be far more focused on those who need it most.  That would be in respect of people of all different needs and ages in terms of accessing employment and the various schemes.  I take on board what the Deputy said and it will be to the fore of our thoughts in working with the Government Departments and developing the schemes.</p></speech>

I will make a few general comments and maybe the witnesses can give me a sense of their thoughts on issues that have not been raised.</p> <p>  My first thought is an issue that I have raised at length with the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Michael Ring.  I refer to support for boards, voluntary bodies and voluntary people.  I am happy to hear the witnesses say they are committed to ensuring there is more comprehensive training and support for volunteers.  That is hugely important.  Volunteers and all of those involved in different boards right across the country give huge service and time.  They have to grapple with all sorts of form filling and trying to deal with a burden of responsibility as well.  It is crucial that there is enhanced training and support, as required, for those groups.</p> <p>  Another relevant point I have noticed in the few years I have been in this new role is that the most organised groups are able to benefit most from funding.  While that is important, we also need to look at groups that find it a little bit difficult.  Not every village and town is going to have people very organised, committed to filling out the paperwork and committed then to getting back more questions that require more paperwork.  I see it with regard to funding that has been approved.  I am thinking of Roscommon and Galway.</p><p>I would like to see other areas getting a fair share, but I think the issue comes back to people within those communities being organised, ready to go and having projects that are ready to be submitted.  That all fits under the community services programme etc.  That is an important point, one that I have raised at length with the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring.</p><p> I have some experience of the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, in my area.  We have two rural men's groups within County Roscommon.  They are fantastic in terms of ticking the boxes for social inclusion.  The groups are made up of older men, many of whom are living on their own.  This is an important network and outlet for them on a weekly basis.  However, I am currently of the understanding that these groups do not fit under SICAP.  It goes back to the comments made by Mr. Leamy and Mr. Murphy.  They said it is a question of looking at needs within different communities and at what social inclusion means in different communities.  Certainly, in my view, social inclusion means providing funding and support for those groups.  Those groups are still operating but they are being run on a shoestring.  More individualised criteria specific to communities should fit under SICAP.</p><p> My third point has been stated several times.  It relates to the challenge for the rural social scheme and the T&uacute;s scheme and the importance of these schemes for the people who are participating in the communities.  There is a difficulty with people being taken off schemes and that is a major problem.  We know extra places were allocated for the rural social scheme last year.  That is great but in my area it has been difficult to recruit people.  It is fine having extra places but it is a problem if we do not have people to fill them.  It is obviously positive that we have more people back in employment.  That is great.  However, there is a gap.  Deputy Canney stated clearly that there is a gap, especially with people in their late 50s or early 60s who may find it difficult to get employment elsewhere.  That is certainly a point the Pobal representatives should take from today &ndash; I realise they are aware of it anyway.</p><p> I wish to comment on a more positive level about my recent experience with regard to the seniors alert scheme.  The changes made are having a real impact in terms of the people being able to access alarms more easily.  As the Pobal representatives have said, more support is being given to link people within different areas.  That is important and perhaps it is a template Pobal can use for other programmes.</p><p> My final question is on the presentation made.  I come from a rural area.  The Pobal representatives indicated that, based on the 2016 deprivation index, small towns of between 1,000 and 5,000 residents have been worst affected during the past ten years.  We know that.  The Pobal representatives also attested to the need for further targeted initiatives in those areas.  What future plans does Pobal have to try to target those continuing challenges in towns and villages?</p><p> I will go back to my first point.  I think we need to take a fresh look at how we support communities that are not as well organised as others.</p></speech>

That is part of the discussion we are always having.  There is a call for applications.  We see applications coming from some of the usual groups that are well-organised.  These groups can write submissions well and can meet the criteria or examine the criteria and match it well.</p> <p>  That is why we are relying more on other tools that identify areas of disadvantage and the groups that are most disadvantaged.  The idea is that we are not solely relying on what is submitted to us.  We have other tests.  Senator Hopkins referred to the deprivation index.  The index is one criterion used within some programmes.  We are keen to see it used in more programmes but it is up to Departments to agree to it.  Increasingly, Departments are using the deprivation index to help identify where resources should go.  It is taken into account when examining the appraisal of some of the applications.</p> <p>  Reference was made to some areas that may not have strong capacity.  We have capacity events to support groups.  The work includes building business plans.  For example, under the community services programme, an applicant is required to have a three-year business plan.  Sometimes we might work with a group over a year or two years to improve capacity at pre-development stage.  This can enable groups to apply for the community services programme and they can sustain themselves in the programme.  That is done over a period.  Anyway, I fully accept the Senator's point: we need to continue improving this area and looking for other ways to assess where the moneys should be going.</p> <p>  When we do geographical testing throughout the country there is a reasonable match.  Some areas lose out more than others but there is a reasonable match in terms of the resources matching the areas of disadvantage and where the target groups are.</p> <p>  I welcome the remarks of Senator Hopkins on the seniors alert scheme.  I take the point made by the Senator.  It is a consideration of ours.  We have seen how the seniors alert scheme has worked.  We have taken some lessons from it and we are learning how to apply them to other programmes we are involved in.  We are in the process of doing that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-31a.154" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jerry Murphy" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2018013100002#H00300"><p>Deputy Hopkins specifically raised a point about men's clubs for those over 65 years in the area.  It was the case up to 1 January that they could not apply but now they are eligible, subject to the fact that SICAP funding overall is aimed at addressing disadvantage.  The funding would need to be for those over 65 years in a disadvantaged area.  Disadvantage is the common factor for all SICAP funding.  Anyway, those over 65 years are now included.</p> <p>  This is a good example of the fact that as we have left the economic crisis, the Government has had an ability to move on.  The last programme was focused on getting people into jobs.  The entire allocation was skewed towards working-age people who were unemployed.  However, as we have moved away from that, the Government has been able to broaden the categorisation.  I hope that example will be useful for Senator Hopkins.</p> <p>  The issue of supports for boards and volunteers was raised.  We accept absolutely that it is critical for relevant infrastructure to be supported.  Pobal tries to undertake a series of practical roles.  We produce sets of materials under a general heading of managing better.  They give guidance for voluntary boards about how to carry out the management of Government funding etc.  The documents are currently being rewritten.  At the end of the first quarter, they will be reissued in updated form to include the most recent changes in legislation etc.  We try to ensure that Pobal keeps in mind the types of boards that are applying for funding.  When we write guidance material, we try to ensure it is accessible to the groups that most need the money.</p> <p>  I reiterate my earlier point about the fact that so many more legislative demands arise now regarding data protection, child protection and so on and we have to face up to them.  If we do not, we could potentially be putting groups into a difficult position.  For example, let us suppose a group took on the management of money.  Then, three years later an audit is done and someone says the group did not obey the law.  We have to cover all those areas.  We try to act as a bridge so that there is at least a translation of the materials to make them as accessible as possible.</p> <p>  The scheme to support national organisations operates through Pobal.  It is a Government scheme organised through the Department of Rural and Community Affairs.  The scheme funds several umbrella groups.  One function of these groups is to be as supportive as possible, especially to communities of interest throughout the country that fit under particular types of headings, including headings of disability, educational or young people.</p><p>A range of communities are covered.  This is close to our hearts and the philosophy of what we need to be doing.</p></speech>

I will ask a few questions, although I do not wish to repeat what has already been said.  I value Pobal's work.  Its role is critical.  Community development is close to my heart.  I have worked with communities across County Clare and tried to help them navigate their way through the various issues that arise from time to time.</p> <p>  As Members of the Oireachtas, we have dedicated lines to particular Departments to ask about medical cards, social welfare benefits and so on.  Would Pobal consider setting up a unit that Oireachtas Members could dial?  There are many programmes under Pobal's remit, but Members could target their queries and speak to the relevant person or section.</p> <p>  There are quite a few groups, including some large ones, involved in the community services programme, CSP, in Clare.  There is a cap of 315 groups.  Is that moveable?  Pobal is considering whether to have more programme groups.  The witnesses might take us through the possibility of new groups forming and applying for the programme in their villages of communities.</p> <p>  I welcome the comments on volunteers, voluntary boards and committees and their community development work, which is significant.  Without their input, we would not have the communities that we do today.</p> <p>  I agree with Senator Hopkins about the burdens that have been placed on community groups in terms of filling out forms.  One community could be far ahead because of its people, so I would welcome more training sessions, information evenings and the like to upskill volunteers so that they might get the best out of the system.</p> <p>  Senator Hopkins also asked about the 2016 deprivation index and highlighted small towns of between 1,000 and 5,000 people.  The witnesses stated that further targeted initiatives were needed.  What targeted initiatives have worked to date, could they be expanded or are new ones required?  What should the Department be considering and how could improvements be made?</p> <p>  Has Pobal received contact from the men's shed movement?  It is widespread and large.  The witnesses referred to social inclusion, interaction, mental health and so on, and the men's shed movement encapsulates a great deal of positivity in that respect.  Would Pobal be interested in getting involved and supporting men's sheds throughout the country?</p></speech>

I will need to check, but my understanding is that Oireachtas queries come through that line as well.  We will get the number for the Chairman before the meeting finishes and email it to him.  We deal with many queries on an ongoing basis as well as representations from Members of the Oireachtas.  It can sometimes be difficult for Members to raise individual sensitive issues, so we tend to deal with many queries on that basis.</p> <p>  I apologise to the Senator for not reverting to her regarding initiatives in respect of towns of between 1,000 and 5,000 people.  It may be time to consider more targeted initiatives.  When I was writing my presentation, I was thinking of how we used to be involved in a number of dedicated programmes to small towns or areas within cities or some rural areas, for example, RAPID.  A new RAPID programme is being directly managed by the Department through local authorities.  Our experience of RAPID, especially in provincial towns, was positive.  It was not just about the money.  While money helped, of more importance was the agencies, each of which had a budget head, working together on the issues that pertained to the areas in question.  They were instructed to share resources and focus on the key targets in each town.  They then had to account to an implementation body in the town itself, which in turn had to report to a national monitoring committee comprising all Departments.</p> <p>  I am not saying that we need to replicate them exactly, but these were the types of targeted initiative that worked, especially in smaller areas.  Many areas identified different issues to be addressed, so this model allowed for a bit of innovation and creativity.  There was a small amount of funding to animate that or match-fund something that an agency or community representatives might have devised.  I neglected to mention that a good number of community representatives also sat around that table.  They were informing the process and challenging what they were hearing around the table.</p> <p>  These are the types of targeted initiative that we had in mind, but there could be others relating to, for example, people with disabilities.  We are involved in one under the Ability programme through the Department of Employment and Social Protection.  We were also involved in the Equality for Women Measure, EWM.  That programme tended to be extremely bureaucratic because of the EU dimension, but if there was one without the bureaucratic dimension that focused on gender-specific issues, it would be useful and appropriate at this time.</p></speech>

There have been no such opportunities in recent years because there has been no money, but an additional budget was identified by the Department during 2017.  The process is ongoing.  Thirty-three applications have reached the final stage and the Department is making a final decision.  My understanding is that announcements will be made on new entries in February.  There is no new set of money to follow that up of which we are aware, but we hope that the new entries will bring new thoughts, ideas and blood to the programme.</p> <p>  A number of men's sheds are funded through programmes that are ultimately administered by Pobal.  That it has taken off as a national movement is amazing, as are the supports it offers.  I will focus on the local issue, though, as it may be something that we have not got across enough at this meeting even though it is an important part of our ethos.  Of the moneys that Pobal is involved in designing schemes around or overseeing, a large amount ends up within local umbrella structures that make allocations to groups like men's sheds.  The social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, was referenced as an example.  On average, each local community development committee is allocated approximately &euro;1 million.  All of the roll-outs are handled through local development companies.  While we work with the Department to set the national structure, targets and planning processes and set up the ICT element, decisions are made locally about which groups they want to work with.  A significant number are deciding that they want to work with groups like men's sheds.</p></speech>
