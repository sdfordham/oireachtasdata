During our sessions this week we are hearing from a number of witnesses on the role of the media during the property boom in the lead into the banking crisis 2002-07 and any changes in approach after the crisis.  At our first session this morning we will hear from Dr. Julien Mercille, lecturer at UCD's school of geography, planning and environmental policy.  I welcome Dr. Mercille before the inquiry.</p><p>Dr. Mercille holds a PhD from UCLA and an MA from the University of Kentucky.  His research focuses on global politics, international political economy, US foreign policy, media studies, and the war on drugs, from a critical political economy perspective.  He has published extensively on those subjects in peer reviewed journals, book manuscripts, as well as in the media, and appears on television and radio regularly as an expert in current affairs.  In addition to his academic writing, he is a regular analyst and commentator for publications such as <i>Asia Times</i>, <i>openDemocracy</i>, <i>Truthout</i>, <i>The Irish Times</i>, <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>and <i>al-Jazeera</i>among others.  Dr. Mercille is also author of the book, <i>The Political Economy and Media Coverage of the European Economic Crisis: The Case of Ireland</i>.  </p><p>Before I begin I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and as they have been informed previously, the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>With that said, I invite Dr. Mercille to make his opening comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-25a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Julien Mercille" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015032500002#A00400"><p>I will read my statement and we can take it from there.  The statement analyses the role played by the Irish media in the property bubble in the years leading to the banking crisis.  It discusses also media performance in more recent years.  In particular, the statement addresses the following points about which the committee wishes to hear my views: the role in the mainstream media for scepticism about the sustainability of the housing boom or the broader economy; potential conflicts of interest in news content associated with revenues from property sector advertising; consistent promotion of buying over renting in the media; and the prevailing view that there would be a soft landing in the property market.  So much of the information presented in the statement arose in my book, as the Chairman mentioned, <i>The Political Economy and Media Coverage of the European Economic Crisis: The Case of Ireland</i>in which more detailed and systematic data may be found.<br/><br/>So for the property bubble before the crash, my overarching point is that news organisations largely convey the views of political and economic elites.  It is true that there are many debates taking place in current affairs reporting but they are mostly confined to the range of opinions within the establishment, and thus narrow in relative terms.  Most research on the media focuses on journalists' herd mentality and reporters' lack of training in finance.  However, I use a political economic framework and identify three main factors that account for the nature of coverage of the economic crisis.</p><p>The first is the media's links with the corporate and government sectors, the second is advertising pressures, and the third is sourcing.  I will take the three points one after the other.<br/><br/>With regard to the links between the media and the corporate and government sectors, both private and State-owned media organisations largely convey corporate and political establishment views, but for somewhat different reasons.  Private media entities are large corporations embedded in a for-profit economic system and are thus part and parcel of the broader market economy.  This has several consequences.  First, in order to start and successfully run a media company with any substantial outreach, significant financial investments are necessary, which means that only wealthy individuals and corporations are able to do so.  Second, media firms are integrated into the market and feel the pressure from bankers, shareholders and directors to generate profits.  Links with the broader corporate sector, including political elites, are created and maintained through boards of directors, as well as general business and social interactions.  Independent News and Media, which is arguably the dominant media conglomerate in Ireland, owns numerous newspapers, magazines, radio stations and websites here and abroad.  Just like other news organisations, its board has included numerous individuals linked with the corporate establishment.  The same goes for <i>The Irish Times</i>, whose board has included a CEO of Irish Life &amp;amp; Permanent, a bank deeply involved in the housing bubble, along with members of IBEC and other businesses.  Third, the media have a close relationship with the Government.  News outlets depend on the State for licences and franchises, and so the Government is in a position to exert some leverage over news coverage.  Also, State-owned media are, by definition, controlled by the Government to a greater or lesser extent through funding and appointments of principal officers.  During the boom years, RTE had as chairman a director of Anglo Irish Bank, which epitomised the excesses of the Celtic tiger and property lending.<br/><br/>Thus, because the housing boom was beneficial to key sectors of the Irish corporate and political establishment, it was never seriously challenged.  Rising property prices directly benefited builders and developers, banks, the Government, property firms and, directly, the broader economy thanks to high growth levels.  The Government was able to collect large tax revenues from the property boom through stamp duty, capital-related taxes, income taxes on construction workers and taxes on construction materials.  For example, while total property-related taxes accounted for 4% of Government revenue in 1996, they accounted for over 17% by 2006.<br/><br/>My second point concerns advertising.  Advertising revenues are crucial to today's news industry.  They allow newspapers to be sold for a lower price, making them more competitive.  This affects news content, because corporate advertisers tend not to subsidise television programmes or news stories that seriously question or attack their own business or the political and economic system of which they are a part, which would be directly contrary to their interests.  One particularly clear example of the significance of advertising to the Irish media is the large amount of funding from property advertising received during the housing boom years.  The Irish media went even further in benefitting from property advertising money.  They became owners of property websites, acquiring a direct stake in the growing housing bubble.  For example, in 2006, INM bought <i>www.propertynews.com</i>and the <i>Property News</i>monthly newspaper - the largest Internet property site in Ireland - and, in 2006, <i>The Irish Times</i>bought the website <i>www.myhome.ie </i>for &euro;50 million, along with the website <i>www.newaddress.ie</i>, which aims to make it easier for homeowners to move residences.  Also, most newspapers published weekly supplements about commercial and residential property, glamorising the whole sector, while glowing editorial pieces about a new housing estate were often miraculously accompanied by a large advertisement plugging the same estate, in the words of Deputy Shane Ross, the former <i>Sunday Independent</i>business editor.  Ross also stated that unfavourable coverage of developers and auctioneers in other parts of the newspapers was regularly met by implied threats from property interests that advertising could go elsewhere.  Moreover, an Irish reporter stated that journalists were leaned on by their organisations not to talk down the banks and the property market because those organisations were heavily reliant on property advertising.<br/><br/>My third point concerns sourcing.  Journalists depend mostly on mainstream institutions for their reports because of limited resources, time constraints and a competitive news environment.  Reporters need to connect those institutions that provide a steady flow of news, which in practice means large organisations that have themselves the resources to produce and release such a stream of material.  The Government and corporations are two such sources, with the result that their points of view are predominant in the media.  They can also deny privileged information to journalists who do not adopt the expected storylines, as happened during the housing bubble in Ireland.<br/><br/>As will be seen, during the bubble journalists relied on numerous experts from the real estate and financial sectors for their stories.  The media analysis that follows depends to some extent on whether the bubble could have been identified before it burst and whether the size of the crash could have been reasonably estimated beforehand.  The answer is &quot;Yes&quot; on both counts, although the precision of the analysis is obviously greater in hindsight.<br/><br/>There are two main measures to determine whether property prices are in bubble territory: the price-to-earnings ratio and the price-to-income ratio.  <i>The Economist</i>magazine used those indicators to warn about property bubbles around the world early on.  In 2002, it stated that the Irish housing market had been &quot;displaying bubble-like symptoms in recent years&quot;, and, in 2003, it calculated that Ireland's property market was overvalued by 42% relative to the average of the previous three decades.  In Ireland, the economists David McWilliams and Morgan Kelly identified the problem and warned about it early on.<br/><br/>However, overwhelmingly, the Irish analysts and institutions, including the media, maintained that there was no bubble and that the boom would eventually end in a soft landing.  Indeed, there is a clear discrepancy between coverage of the housing bubble before and after it burst.  Before 2008, the media tended to largely ignore it, and it was only months after it started deflating that reality had to be faced.  Once the housing market collapsed, the media simply could not ignore its downwards trajectory, hence the increased coverage.  I have included two figures showing the number of articles on the housing bubble that appeared in newspapers by year.  On average, <i>The Irish Times</i>had 5.5 times more articles on the bubble per year in 2008&ndash;11 than in 1996&ndash;2007.  Similarly, the <i>Irish Independent</i>and the <i>Sunday Independent </i>had on average 12.5 times more such articles in 2008&ndash;11 than in 1999&ndash;2007.  Moreover, the few articles published during the earlier period often denied that there was a bubble.  For example, there were articles in <i>The Irish Times</i>entitled &quot;Study refutes any house price 'bubble' &quot; and &quot;House prices 'set for soft landing',&quot; while the <i>Irish Independent </i>and <i>Sunday Independent</i>had headlines such as &quot;NCB [Stockbrokers] rejects house value threat from burst bubble,&quot; &quot;House prices not about to fall soon, insist auctioneers,&quot; &quot;Price of houses 'not over-valued' says new report,&quot; and &quot;There is no property bubble to burst, despite doomsayers.&quot;  In particular, between 2000 and 2007, <i>The Irish Times</i>published more than 40,000 articles about the economy, but only 78 of these were about the property bubble, or 0.2%.  This is small coverage for what was the most important economic story in those years.<br/><br/>The residential and commercial property sections and supplements presented articles and glossy pictures encouraging readers to buy as opposed to renting.  Stories described various properties on sale and were virtually indistinguishable from advertisements.  One entitled &quot;There&rsquo;s a billion reasons to buy&quot; introduced new luxury apartments by noting that they &quot;feature quality designer kitchens with integrated AEG appliances [whatever that is] and stone worktops; top notch bathrooms with ceramic tiles, heated towel rails and chrome fittings&quot;.  Potential buyers should waste no time, though, as &quot;numbers are strictly limited &ndash; you&rsquo;d want to stake it fast&quot;.  Articles celebrated Ireland&rsquo;s newly found pride in entrepreneurialism at home and abroad.  One profiled the &quot;ever-bullish Irish property buyer ... looking for the hot new property market&quot;, wherever it is in the world.  Another article stated: &quot;[I]n Victorian times, it was fashionable for the British to suggest that 'the sun never sets on our Empire'.  Now the sun never sets on Ireland&rsquo;s burgeoning property empire&quot;.<br/><br/>The media relied on so-called experts from the financial or real estate industry to describe the market, which thus received almost invariably upbeat analysis.  For example, as late as November 2007, <i>The Irish Times</i>conducted a survey among &quot;property experts&quot; to predict how the market would evolve in 2008.  The six experts selected all held high-level positions with property firms.  Not surprisingly, their forecast was enthusiastic.  A number of journalists simply acted as cheerleaders for the property sector.  Many even persisted in rejecting the view that the market had been in a bubble months after it started collapsing.  For example, in April 2008, the <i>Sunday Independent </i>conveyed the thoughts of a real estate agent who believed that &quot;[T]he time to buy is now.  There is certainly great value in the market at the minute but it doesn&rsquo;t mean people can dilly dally.&quot;  Another journalist wrote a book entitled <i>The Best is Yet to Come</i>in 2007 and claimed that &quot;Far from collapsing, our economy and property prices will do more than hold up.&quot;All that was required to protect Ireland against a crisis was not to talk about it, because &quot;unless we talk ourselves into one, an economic storm is not going to happen.&quot;</p><p>Television followed the same pattern as the print press.  During the boom, RTE sustained a national obsession with houses by presenting programmes such as &quot;House Hunters in the Sun&quot;, &quot;Showhouse&quot;, &quot;About the House&quot; and &quot;I'm an Adult, Get Me Out of Here&quot;.  Leading current affairs programmes such as &quot;Prime Time&quot; also sustained a housing bubble.  Between 2000 and 2007, 717 shows were aired, of which only ten, approximately 1%, contained a segment concerned with the housing boom.  These shows presented a total of 26 guests or interviewees of whom 11 came from the property or financial sectors, four were politicians from the main political parties, four were journalists, academics or researchers, and three were economic consultants.  With respect to their views on the housing boom, only two interviewees said clearly that there was a bubble and that it would burst while the other 24 remained vague, argued explicitly that the housing market was and would remain strong in the years to come, or stated that a soft landing was to be expected if the boom decelerated at some point.<br/><br/>After the crisis, as the property market recovers, especially in Dublin, media coverage has essentially not changed.  By this, I do not mean its content is the same as during the pre-crash years.  The situation is different and we are not faced with a massive national bubble in the market.  Rather, I mean that the media coverage points roughly in the same direction as before 2008.  In general, it is the interests of elites that are mostly reflected in editorials and news stories, while those of ordinary people are often left out.  This is not unexpected, given that the political and economic nature of the media industry outlined above is intact.  News organisations are still corporate or Government-owned entities, advertising still plays a role in generating revenues and journalists still source their stories overwhelmingly from establishment institutions and individuals.  One can find a few articles of a more careful or sceptical nature relative to the ongoing real estate boom in Dublin.  I surmise that the pre-crisis bubble and its negative consequences are still felt strongly, and this may lead to more balanced coverage, although in relative terms this is a minor trend and, overall, a significant amount of critical commentary is not appearing in the media.  The election of a few Deputies with progressive politics has also resulted in more critical coverage when their views are reported.<br/><br/>The fact that media coverage still reflects elite interests may be appreciated by considering analysis and commentary on the following key issues in the housing market.  Approximately 90,000 people are on the waiting list for social housing, and there has been a rise in homelessness.  Austerity has reduced State investment in social housing as capital expenditure for social housing was cut by 80% between 2008 and 2013.  Approximately 118,000 mortgage accounts, 15%, remain in arrears and a number of repossession procedures are ongoing.  So-called vulture funds involving mostly foreign investors are buying up large chunks of the property market.  The Government has facilitated this by encouraging the establishment of real estate investment trusts, REITs, via generous tax breaks.  REITs buy, among other things, property portfolios from NAMA.  Vulture funds raise rents to maximise their incomes before they leave the market, after approximately three years, or whenever their real estate assets have increased enough in value in order that they can sell them back to Irish people at a higher price.  NAMA promotes a vision of property as a commodity, not as a social good, given that it needs rental growth and seeks to maximise commercial returns.<br/><br/>Media coverage of such issues has reflected elites' views and interests.  Coverage has not been extensive and has not foregrounded analysis and opinion that would reflect ordinary people's interests.  Relatively little attention has been paid to progressive strategies to address the problems, such as significant public spending on a social housing building programme, NAMA playing a role more directed towards providing housing as a social good, rent controls, making unfinished estates safe and attractive places to live, converting vacant properties into rental units, mortgage debt write-downs and dealing with the issue of homelessness through a redistribution of wealth and power in society.  The problem is not that nobody has presented alternatives.  The union, SIPTU, has made the case for establishing a social housing REIT.  The youth advocacy group, We're Not Leaving, produced a report on problems faced by renters, including deposit retention and low standards of quality in rented accommodation.  The Nevin Economic Research Institute has argued for establishing and financing an affordable housing strategy.  However, such organisations have not been included in the media to any significant extent.  Instead, we often hear the views of developers, bankers and real estate agents and companies that call on the Government to ease the cost burden of construction in order that more houses can be built by the private sector to allow the market allegedly to solve the problems.  We also still see stories of buyers telling how they are being outbid when they attempt to buy property.<br/><br/>After the crash, the media also presented the Government's crisis resolution policies in a largely favourable manner, again in line with the views of Irish and global elites.  The media enthusiastically endorsed a blanket guarantee and declared it the cheapest bailout in the world.  NAMA was called &quot;bold and imaginative&quot; and the &quot;holy grail&quot;, while <i>The Irish Times</i>claimed it was our &quot;best bet&quot;.  However, there were progressive alternatives.  Strong conditions could have been attached to the nationalisation of banks such as firing their top management, cutting the salaries of top officials, requiring that investment decisions be made with socially useful purposes and establishing strict regulations on banks' operations.  A good bank could have been established, as explained in detail by the economist Willem Buiter in the pages of the<i>Financial Times</i>.  After some hesitation, the media endorsed the EU-IMF bailout in late 2010.  <i>The Irish Times</i>argued that:<blockquote>On one level, intervention by the EU and the IMF is no bad thing.  It means that rational decisions on how we can live within our means will now be forced down the throats of the competing interests who have stymied any genuine national response to the crisis.</blockquote>The accumulation of sovereign debt in Ireland and Europe gave rise to the possibility of default and restructuring.  However, the media described a potential default as a &quot;cataclysm&quot;,<i></i>an &quot;evil day&quot;, an &quot;unmitigated disaster&quot;, &quot;hugely damaging&quot;, a &quot;doomsday scenario&quot; and likely leading to intolerable contagion effects throughout the eurozone.  However, scholarship on sovereign debt restructuring reveals that countries that decide to cancel the repayment of their debts typically suffer only short-term economic costs and that long-term negative consequences are not significant so that, overall, defaulting often yields positive outcomes, for example, in Argentina and Greece.<br/><br/>The media has also strongly endorsed austerity since 2008.  At the outset of the crisis, the media called explicitly for a campaign to educate the public about the need for austerity.  <i>The Irish Times</i>editors complained that members of the public still did not appreciate the possible extent of the economic downturn and the editors asserted that the Government would have &quot;a major job to do in educating public opinion about unpalatable economic realities and the need for civic discipline&quot;.  A study I conducted of more than 900 opinion articles and editorials in the five main newspapers between 2008 and 2013 found the following revealing statistic: only 11% of pieces opposed austerity while 58% supported it and the remainder were neutral.  The articles' authorship was also significant.  More than 200 of the pieces were written by outside writers, not journalists.  Of these, 29% were mainstream economists, 28% worked in the financial or corporate sectors and 20% were political officials in the three main political parties in power during the crisis, including only four from the Labour Party with the bulk from the two dominant right-wing parties.  The overwhelming majority of writers, 77%, came from elite political or economic institutions.  The remainder of authors comprised academics, members of progressive organisations and only 3% were trade union officials.  Thus, a conservative cast of writers expressed their views and interests in the media.</p></speech>

In his opening statement, Dr. Mercille said, "my overarching point is that news organisations largely conveyed the views of political and economic elites".  When a person opens a newspaper, he or she is faced with a multiplicity of issues, articles, reports, etc.  Could Dr. Mercille explain what he means by his assertion?</p></speech>

Some topics are covered more than others, especially business topics, while topics such as homelessness and deprivation do not receive the coverage they deserve if other views were included to a greater extent.  The second part is that whenever a topic is addressed, whether it is homelessness, housing or the financial crisis, the way the topic is interpreted reflects the views of the establishment.</p><p>That does not mean that the media just parrot whatever the Government says.  It means that it reflects the diversity of views within the establishment.  There is a diversity but it is relatively narrow.  There are always exceptions.  One can always find an article that contradicts what I said but there would only be a few articles.  I am talking about general trends and that is very clear.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-25a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015032500002#D00200"><p>Beginning on page 1 Dr. Mercille said, "Private media entities are large corporations embedded in a for-profit economic system and are thus part and parcel of the broader market economy."  He stated on page 2, "Media firms are integrated into the market and feel the pressures of bankers, shareholders and directors to generate profits."  Is he saying these factors affect how the media covers the issue and its attitude to the main issues of the day?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-25a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Julien Mercille" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015032500002#D00300"><p>Yes, it affects it to a great extent.  Media entities are large corporations.  Like any other corporation, if they want to invest in a new project they will have to borrow money, they have to talk to bankers, they have to survive as economic businesses, they have to sell and they have to get advertising.  That leads to a series of consequences for their reporting.  There are many reasons for that but I shall deal with ownership first.  It is owned by large corporations so they have specific interests.  We do not have any problem recognising that.  A trade union paper reflects trade union viewpoints because they are owned by the trade unions.  The same thing applies for the corporate sector.</p> <p>  For advertising, I am not sure whether the Deputy wants me to talk about it right now.  Advertisers will not support publications that are contrary to their interests, by and large.</p> <p>  For sourcing, journalists are under time constraints.  It is much cheaper to send a journalist to a parliament to collect the views of TDs and other officials than to send a journalist for a one-month trip to rural Ireland to look at the effects of poverty which is much more expensive.  By and large, journalists will go to the organisations that have a ready supply of press releases.  Those are, by and large, in establishment institutions and that is what gets reported in the media.     </p></speech>

Can Dr. Mercille relate what he has just told us to how the media covered those issues and covered the property bubble?</p></speech>

A lot of people benefited from that, whether it was the banking sector or the Government through tax revenues or whatever.  Corporate Ireland had a stake in that, so that includes the media for all the reasons I have talked about, whether it is through advertising or the simple nature of the corporate media, or the Government's own media, the Government drew benefits from that, and so it led to favourable coverage in general.</p></speech>

Does Dr. Mercille accept that claim?  Does he believe or not that advertising revenue from the property sector influenced how the property bubble was covered?</p></speech>

As I said, Deputy Shane Ross said there were explicit threats that advertising would move elsewhere if coverage was negative.  Shane Ross is not like a minor journalist.  He knows what is going on.  We had journalists, and there is a study that I cited, that said explicitly "Yeah, we had pressures from our bosses to give good coverage."  The thing is one does not have to find something explicit saying, "The boss made the phonecall to a journalist to tell him to do this and that."  It does not work like that.  Journalists know very well.  In any institution one has rules to play by.  One does not need to be told every day by one's boss that one needs to dress like this or that and not to do this and that.  If one is in an institution for many years one understands perfectly well.  One might not be aware of it but one certainly behaves in that way.  If journalists, during the housing bubble, had consistently produced stories saying the bubble will crash and that it is a bubble and all of that, then they would have had a lot of opposition from the media, as we saw with Morgan Kelly.  In terms of a lot of those dynamics, it is not about finding a hidden e-mail or something that will say explicitly one needs to behave a certain way.  It is just understood within the institution.</p></speech>

I ask him to explain that a little.</p></speech>

Frankly, when I started doing so I was not even sure if it was a commercial advertisement or if it was meant to be a real article.  One cannot really tell the difference and that happens almost every day.  A week or so ago one of the headlines on the front page of the online version of <i>The Irish Times</i>was, &quot;This mansion has added a new bathroom&quot;.  That was the news.  Yes, it does influence.  It meshes with advertising and reporting.  In other words, if I had to write an advertisement I would not write it very differently from the actual article that appeared in the supplements, for example.</p></speech>

Thankfully, "Prime Time" had all of its programmes online.  It removed them after I carried out the study but I do not know if there is a link.  At that time it had them so I looked at that in more detail.  There were over 700 programmes but I did not watch them all.  Thank God, at the beginning of every programme, they say, "We are going to talk about 1, 2 and 3" which meant one just had to watch the first bit.  I saved time like that.  There was very little coverage of the topic.</p> <p>  I wish to make an important point about the media.  When one says that the media sustained the housing bubble, it does not mean that the media every day was saying "There is no housing bubble".  A lot of it is just not talking about it, closing one's eyes and saying "Yes whatever.  There is something going on."  "Prime Time" is a good example because it did not talk about the bubble too much.  One had stories about health care, tragedies, political elections or whatever, but few news items on the bubble.  When the bubble was covered, like I said, it was mostly by relying on experts from the financial sector, for example.</p></speech>

In terms of the figures Dr. Mercille gave here in regard to the selection of commentators, where they came from or their viewpoints, does he contend that it conveyed a particular view that does not challenge the bubble?  Is that what he is saying?</p></speech>

There is a housing bubble and don't buy a house."  One could always imagine that.  It does sometimes happen where one has people in institutions that break the rules.  By and large, one can assume that they will talk for their own interests.  One should not just assume that and one should just look at what they say.  In the case of "Prime Time", one can watch the video and see that they do not challenge.  Either they say it is fine, there is no bubble or they just remain vague about it.  There is an institutional association in what they say and it is very clear.</p></speech>

The paper is entitled  "From Boom to Bust: A post-Celtic Tiger analysis of the norms, values and roles of Irish financial journalists."</p><p>It relates to interviews given, for example, by a former group business editor from decades ago of Independent newspapers.  In essence, it is summed up in this way:<blockquote><br /><br />The commercial viability of virtually all media organisations depends on the smoozing of advertisers.  The timid business hack finds himself regularly having to pull or pedal lightly on copy that would otherwise antagonise advertisers.</blockquote>Is it the contention of the witness that the way the property bubble was portrayed was a factor?  A major issue during the bubble was the inflation of house prices for ordinary people, as opposed to investors, that was incredible by any standards.  Was that challenged in the course of the bubble?</p></speech>

Usually it is not too hard to explain that to students or people in Ireland and it is pretty obvious because of property supplements.  There are other examples.  RTE has a radio show about banking sponsored by Ulster Bank.  Do we really think there will be critical views on that show about banks?  Maybe there will be a bit but one can listen to it.  It is about dynamics.  One must listen to the programme or read the article - that is about the dynamics -  but the explanation is pressure from advertisers.</p> <p>  What was the other part of the question?</p></speech>

When I say the media had very little coverage of the bubble, it is not that they were unaware of the rise in prices.  There were terms such as "affordability is not very good right now" or indications that people are finding it harder to buy houses, or there is a boom.  If one is to be serious about an analysis, one must say there is a bubble, which is a dangerous thing.  One must go beyond just saying it is hard to buy a house these days.  That is not real analysis and is rather superficial.  Much of the media discussed the other aspects.  In other words, there is no way one could really know there was a bubble by reading the media.</p></speech>

After the bubble burst, how did the mainstream media cover the aftermath and particularly the austerity programmes that were implemented as a result of the crisis?  In his introduction, Dr. Mercille referred to vulture funds.  He discussed the buying of tranches of residential developments and referred to NAMA.  He indicated that "media coverage of such issues has reflected elite views and interests and has not foregrounded analysis and opinion that would reflect ordinary people's interest".  I will conclude on those two points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-25a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Julien Mercille" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015032500002#E00600"><p>With regard to the housing market, right now we do not have a huge national bubble.  The coverage cannot be analysed in the same way we did before.  There is a spike in Dublin prices but it is not a national issue like before.  The media, in general, is the same, as the structure has not changed.  There is still advertising and it still corporate and government-owned.  There are more articles of a careful nature.  When one sees a boom in Dublin, a journalist does not necessarily jump on it as much as before because of the crash.  Perhaps they are a bit more careful.  I have not looked at it in any systematic way.<br/><br/>After the crash, the other issues became more prominent, such as austerity.  When I or others say the media is in favour of government views, it is not something pulled out of nowhere.  The media is very proud about that and says so explicitly.  <i>The Irish Times</i>indicated in 2008, right at the start, that it needed to educate the public about the virtues of austerity.  There is no secret there and it was very successful in that task.  The media performs extremely well in Ireland if it is judged from that standpoint.  It has been very successful in telling people that austerity is the right way to go.  There are crisis resolution points.<br/><br/>One can see reporting about vulture funds and other topics but not to the extent one would see if ordinary people's interests were considered to a greater extent.  There is good reporting but that is a broader point.  In the business press, for example, there is excellent reporting.  <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>has done very good studies on vulture funds because those journalists speak to the business community.  Those people need good information and it is not just a case of propaganda being out there.  Otherwise, a decision as a business leader or government leader could not be made.  There is very good reporting out there but the twist will usually be written for the interests of the elites.  That does not mean it is wrong but it is a particular viewpoint.</p></speech>

My view is that culture has nothing to do with any of that, or at least very little, as I do not want to exaggerate too much.  It is not what drives anything.  People react to economic and political incentives and that is what drives them.  There has been less home ownership in Ireland, for example.  To put it in culture terms is a way to normalise it.  It is like saying that Americans are inherently violent because they go to war all the time.  That is not right.  Incentives were put in place for home buying, such as low interest rates.</p></speech>

The question I am asking him is with a view to backing that up.  We are a democracy.  People vote.  They vote based on views put forward by various political parties.  So, by definition, if the media reflects the views of the particular party in power at that time, at some stage does it not reflect the views of the people and, by definition, the readership?</p></speech>

Again, it is a dominant view in media studies that media content reflects what its readers want to hear or want to read.  That is a conservative interpretation of the media, and the reason is that there is a big discrepancy between the interests of elites and the interests of ordinary people.  So, for example, one often hears that Irish people just wanted to buy houses in the housing bubble years.  Well, maybe at a superficial level, because that has been heard about, but it is not true that what one sees in the media reflects the viewpoints of ordinary people.  For example, people have an interest in having a good health care system or a good welfare state, and the media does not say that.  People did not have an interest in building the whole economy on sand, based on a housing bubble, to make it very unsustainable.</p></speech>

Many of his views are personal.  I will not go to that area because I regard them as personal views.  What we are trying to extract from Dr. Mercille is how the media interacted in terms of our role here, which is the banking inquiry, and particularly in terms of the property bubble.  What is Dr. Mercille's view of an alternative model for the media, specifically with regard to property and the banking inquiry, which would reflect a more balanced view in terms of the way the media presents things?</p></speech>

There is also something called the alternative media, which is smaller.  Much of it is based online.  It is the same in every country.  That is a good model, in my view, for the structure of the media.  So they are not large corporate entities.  They rely on advertising to a small extent or not at all, so they raise their funds, for example, from readers only.  One can see very clearly the result of that if one reads the alternative media.  In Ireland it is not that big, actually, but there are people like Michael Taft, let us say, who writes a blog.  If one compares this with the mass media, the difference is like day and night.</p></speech>

My point is broader.  On the one hand, there is coverage that is relatively positive, sustaining the bubble, and one sees those interests in the property market.  One can conclude or make an interpretation that this would influence their coverage, because they have a direct interest in it.  It is in that way.  It is not the case that the property website manager calls the media organisation and says, "Can you cover me in that way?".  Maybe that happens sometimes, but it is not what I am concerned with.</p></speech>

Dr. Mercille might expand on that idea by commenting on those people and the role they played.  What role did they play?  Did the fact that such people were on these boards have an influence?</p></speech>

Boards mostly play a role in orienting the general direction of the newspaper.  They do not do the reporting on the ground.  If the board of a newspaper is filled with trade unionists, that newspaper's coverage will probably be more pro-trade union.  We would not have an inquiry about that because everybody would understand it.  When the board of a newspaper is filled with people from the banking sector and other elite sectors, the newspaper's coverage will be influenced in that direction.  We cannot stay at that point, however - we need to look at the actual coverage.  There are people in business and in the establishment who care about the truth.  Such people exist.  After we looked at the coverage and saw that the housing bubble was pretty much covered favourably, we examined the interests of the people on the board.  It was clear to us that they drew benefits from the entire process.  We were able to make an interpretation on that basis.  That was one dynamic among others.</p></speech>

Is that what he is saying?</p></speech>

There were directors of banks on the boards of newspapers when journalists were deciding what to write about housing.  I do not think I have ever spoken to those people.  Maybe I did; I am not sure.  It is about making a connection.  The committee has to rely on the actual coverage.  Otherwise, it is a bit more speculative.</p></speech>

He has cited the numbers of articles that were written by various people.  Others of us have not done that.  Is Dr. Mercille satisfied, having done that exercise, that there is a correlation between the profile of the boards of the main newspapers and the profile of their coverage of this issue?</p></speech>

Thousands of articles are published every day.  It is not like every single article links to the interests of a certain guy.  In general, we understand that this is what happens.  If the board of a student newspaper was filled with students, student interests would come first in the newspaper.  We would all understand that very clearly.</p></speech>

People in the latter group could be referred to as the deniers.  Which group was more significant?  Did they have an equal impact or a shared impact on what happened?  The groups are quite different.</p></speech>

It is a good question.  Again, it is impossible to give a clear or precise answer.  I would say that in the case of the housing bubble, people just chose not to talk about it.  The "Prime Time" report is a good example.  Not many of the shows that were about the bubble denied that it was happening.  It is just that there were very few shows about it.  The graph I have presented to the committee contains two figures that show the same thing.  I think I have mentioned that a few articles about the bubble appeared before 2008.  The articles in question were not necessarily critical of what was going on or warning about it.  Many of them said "you may have heard there is a bubble out there, but it is not true - we talked to experts and rest assured it is fine".  This does not even mean they were talking about it.  In most cases, I would say it is a question of denial.  The same point applies to a lot of things.  When was the last time it was on the front page that the US military has been using Shannon Airport for many years?  It is not as if the media is saying "no, the US is not there"; it is just that we do not talk about it.  The same point can be made about deprivation or about the health care system.  We are never told that a great deal of money could be saved by having a public health care system.  Much of it is just not addressed.  When it is, the views of elites are usually taken as a driver.  Again, this does not mean it is wrong or right - it just means this is the viewpoint that is being heard.</p></speech>

Did he experience any of that when he spoke to people?</p></speech>

The job was done for that, so I did not talk to as many people.  I will give another good example that is more about the passiveness.  A senior RTE journalist who was trying to show me that it was not the media's fault, and that it was the fault of the economists or whoever else, once told me how he works.  He said that when looks at his mobile after he comes back from lunch, he might have received 12 press releases from the banking sector.  He said he just copies them down as his article and that is it.  He argued that this shows he is not guilty, but is merely reporting the views of the banks.  That is a very good example of passive reporting.  It is actually a robot view of a media environment in which journalists do not even think, but just copy what they get on their mobiles.  At one level, one could put the blame on journalists and others and suggest that they should think a bit.  However, it is very rational for media organisations to behave in this way because it saves them a lot of money.  As such organisations operate in a profit-driven system, they might go bankrupt if they do not act in this manner.  There are rational reasons behind their behaviour.</p></speech>

The same thing applies to Morgan Kelly.  He is a very serious analyst.  Someone might be on the left, but that does not mean he or she knows anything.  I would rather go with looking for the truth and being progressive.  It is a safer answer here.</p></speech>

A few inconsistencies are not a problem.  One cannot expect someone to have 1,000 articles all sharply in line with the same position.  I do not have a problem with any viewpoint, be it conservative or progressive, as long as it is serious, has quality and is trying to find out something interesting.  In the Irish media one has pub talk discussions or just fillers for the newspapers.  One could have the same conversation with a friend anywhere and it might not be very relevant.  One sees inconsistencies because there is not really a clear viewpoint.  They will just talk randomly with people shifting their views pretending they said that.</p></speech>

The lead-up to the property crash and the financial and banking crash happened over a good number of years and was multifaceted with many dynamics.

This is the overarching point because, again, it was a decision of most of people who had a say in this such as decision-makers.  The media rallied towards that.  It was one of the most aggressive measures in Europe to deal with the banks and the media thought it was great.  Some people said Ireland would become a model of financial innovation for others to follow.</p></speech>

The media could have reprinted the article from <i>The Economist</i>or quoted Dean Baker, one of the top economists in the world, who called the bubble in 2002 very systematically and precisely.  He has never been mentioned anywhere in the Irish media.  Why would the Irish media not do a bit of work to find those few analysts?  The Deputy is correct that there were more people among the experts saying there was no bubble.  That is because they are also part of elite institutions, and the media is just one factor in that.<br/><br/>It would not have been hard for the media to do their homework, however.  If it had been a one-time event over six months, one could have argued there was no time.  However, this was over several years and there is no excuse for not having enough time.  If you did not know what a housing bubble was in 2001, you had a few years to learn about it.  Journalists are not just recorders of others&rsquo; views.  They have to think on their own.</p></speech>

The claim is the journalists were not well qualified to cover financial or economic issues.  If they were better trained or went back to school they would have been better.  I would downplay it as an explanation.  Of course the more knowledge one has about economics the better one is at understanding issues and that is fine, but journalists are generalists and cannot be expected to be experts on every topic they cover.  They know enough to study and have a good grasp of some issues and maybe get the right expert to explain to them what is going on if they do not understand.  If all Irish journalists were retrained and made do a PhD in economics in a university anywhere it would not have helped that much because much of the economics profession was not active in warning about the bubble.</p></speech>

It depends on the type of economics they learn.  If they learn progressive or alternative economics from Paul Krugman or David Harvey it would be very different from learning from more mainstream economists.  It depends on what is learned as supposed to learning something.</p></speech>

Is that correct or is it incorrect?</p></speech>

There might be some of that in any institution, whether it is the media, the military or a political party.  Anybody who has been in that institution for a number of years is very well aware of the rules, where you can go, where you cannot go and how far you can criticise this person or that person.  We all know that in our working lives.  Some journalists might be completely comfortable with that and never even realise there are constraints because they agree with them all.  Other, more critical journalists are well aware of that.  They know where the line is and know how far they can go and what the repercussions will be.  I am not in their heads, so I cannot give specific examples of thinking like that, but it is the same in any institution.  There is nothing special about the media in that.</p></speech>

Beyond that, on television, I think it is RTE, there is a classic clip of him getting a lot of flack and criticism for saying there is a housing bubble.  Many real estate agents were given voice to contradict what Kelly was saying.  That is the way the censoring worked, not just by saying: "No you cannot do anything."  He was brought in and then there were a lot of articles saying he was wrong.  That is how discourse works.</p></speech>

When we move to the nexus phase of this inquiry, names will be used and they can be used quite explicitly and in detail.  We have a very experienced and expert research team working on our behalf which is preparing us for the nexus phase where we will be dealing with names.  In this part of the inquiry, which is the context phase, which the members decided to do to give a broader context, we as a committee agreed we would not name individuals as we would do so in the nexus stage.  I would not be trying to create by the back door any illusion that there is a restriction on this committee in not being able to name individuals.  We will be able to do so in the nexus phase.  I would certainly not be putting witnesses in a position this morning and inadvertently trying to tease that out of them when they were forewarned that they would not be doing that this morning.</p></speech>

Dr. Mercille will be familiar with the term "manufacturing consent".  Chomsky's theory is that the mass media takes a position and moves the public from one position to another.  Is there a difference between the publication of a Morgan Kelly article, so that a newspaper can say, "Well, we published that," and what might be considered the manufacturing of consensus, or a broader narrative editorial position that is not reflective of views such as Morgan Kelly's?</p></speech>

It could be the case that the media are really putting a viewpoint but nobody is buying it, or it could be the opposite, with everybody buying it.  It has nothing to say about the audience; it just looks at the media.  We are talking about human affairs, so one always has contrarian views, either whistleblowers or exceptions.  There are critical people in the Irish media, but it is about looking at the trends.  That is what my argument is about and what we based our study on.</p></speech>

On page 19 of his book, <i>The Political Economy and Media Coverage in the European Economic Crisis: The Case of Ireland</i>, he states that the media also have a close relationship with Government, which is able, to some extent, to pressurise them to conform to its viewpoints.  Will Dr. Mercille give the committee his opinion in regard to that relationship, with specific reference to the banking crisis?  Was the Government able to pressurise the media to conform to its viewpoints?</p></speech>

In my study I did not really look at RTE, because it does not have a printed archive.  The general principle is that any Government regulation or legislation surrounding media activities is related to that as well.  I re-emphasise that it is contextual.  The Government will set in place certain contextual constraints or whatever.  It is not that the Prime Minister calls some journalists to say they had better report on him really well.  If the Prime Minister did that, the media might do the opposite, just to show the politicians that they are autonomous and warn them not to push it too far.  That is not to say there are no calls or informal conversations in that regard.</p></speech>

He talked about why some journalists have relied on such reports.  How best can one prevent that type of reliance on State information in the media in the future, if that is a concern?</p></speech>

It has to be more democratic, in a way.  There are alternative media, and the comparison with the coverage in the mainstream media is like day and night.  That is true in any country.  If one had an ideal media structure in the mass media, it would be closer to the alternative media, with no or little reliance on advertising, for example, or funding through foundations as opposed to commercial interests, with the size of organisations kept small as opposed to having big corporations.  All of that would lead to better coverage automatically.  It is much more about the structure.  "Diversity of the media" is a phrase we often use.  The more diverse the media is, the more likely it is that one will hear different viewpoints.</p></speech>

Instead, he said that his conclusions depended directly on the normal workings of the corporate world and not a conspiracy subverting it.  Will he explain that?  I know he has touched on this.  I think Dr. Mercille mentioned that it is not necessarily bosses telling their employees what they can and cannot do.   Will he explain what he means when he says it is not a conspiracy?</p></speech>

A conspiracy is a few guys in a dark room who take decisions outside the normal channels.  The media are not a conspiracy but are institutional.  If one asks any corporate leader, he or she will say what I said - that we have a structure, we have to increase market share, we have to raise revenues and so on.  That leads to certain incentives.  For example, if someone wants to cut costs in a newspaper, will he send his journalists for an hour to the Parliament to collect press releases and write a few articles very quickly, or will he send them to rural Ireland for a month?  It is much more expensive to do the second.  If he did not work in an environment based on profits he could do the second, but if he is competing with other organisations that will cut costs in that way, it leads to a reliance on organisations or the establishment.</p></speech>

I do not believe a word of that.  For example, the media were very rational in their coverage, according to their own interests.  If one judges them from the interests of ordinary people, it is a different thing.  They took the decisions they took because there was a benefit in that; people drew benefits from the housing bubble and from austerity.  It is a very rational thing.  It is not that people are running around like headless chickens and taking measures.  There are some irrational decisions but they are more anomalies.  By and large, it is rational.  People in power would not be there if they were not rational; they would be elsewhere.</p></speech>

I cannot go there.  I have one final question in relation to other forms of ownership, such as trusts.

How are we to understand that a trust has an influence over editorial decision-making when a trust is made up of a number of different people?</p></speech>

It is not the only factor.  Sometimes it does not correlate perfectly.  One could say that <i>The Irish Times</i>is more liberal on social issues and that this could be linked to the fact that it is owned by a trust.  Again, that is only one factor in a range of factors.  If one wants to have a drastically different media organisation, the alternative media provide a very different example.  It is easier to contrast because there is less-----</p></speech>

Is he making a correlation between the political viewpoints and then drawing the conclusion that, therefore, it does not have a negative influence on how it is edited?</p></speech>

There are other factors that could cancel or reinforce that.  It is a bit of a picky dynamic.  A clear opposition in two systems in the form of alternative media versus normal mass media would ensure different views.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's other question of trust or non-trust ownership, the differences are smaller.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions for him arising out of his statement in which he criticises very strongly the Irish media for its opposition to default on sovereign debt.  What in Dr. Mercille's view are the immediate consequences for a country that defaults on its national debt?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-25a.276" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Julien Mercille" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015032500002#M02200"><p>The literature on sovereign debt default is pretty extensive.  The consensus is that for a country that defaults on sovereign debt, there are negative impacts in the short term, although not nearly as many as people tell us.  However, the same does not apply in all cases.  There is no magic rule.  I gave the example earlier of Argentina, which did default.  According to the literature, while the initial impact of that was negative, it was followed by good growth.  Does this mean Ireland should have defaulted?  Default is a broad term.  One can default a little or completely.  Again, Ireland is different from other countries.  The point I was making is that if there is good evidence that the consequences of default would not be that bad, then the idea should at least be up for debate.  It does not mean that default should be called for all over the place, rather it means that it should be considered.</p></speech>

Does Dr. Mercille think that people in Argentina and Greece believe they have typically suffered only short-term economic costs?</p></speech>

Growth there was very striking.  The European media and, in particular, <i>The Irish Times</i>, reported it in a very biased way.  Default by Argentina occurred in 2001.  On the tenth anniversary of that default <i>The Irish Times</i>report in that regard referred to people running around the streets of Argentina with machetes full of blood, which they had used to slaughter cows because they had nothing to eat.  Thus, the image we have of default is blood in the streets and people running around with knives.</p></speech>

Reports of people running around after cows is not serious analysis.  Argentina grew by approximately 8% every year for eight years.  Even half that level of growth in Ireland would ensure re-election of the party in government for the next 20 years.  People would be very happy.  That is not to suggest that because that is what happened in Argentina, the same would happen in Ireland.  However, the issue should at least be on the table for discussion.</p></speech>

We do not have the equivalent of <i>The Guardian</i>in London, for example.  Many other countries have something like that so, in that way, Ireland would be more conservative in the media landscape and perhaps a little more like the US in that regard.  We hear all the time about balanced reporting and fairness and that is what people learn in journalism school but that is not the way to put it.  It is about reporting the truth.  To give an example that is a little out there, one could report in one's article that there are very good things about Nazi Germany and the reasons.  However, if some people do not like it, it would be weird.  It is about telling the truth as far as one can determine it.  Sometimes it is a grey area.  There are various viewpoints and, therefore, it is not just about being balanced.  It is more about telling what people care about and the media are good at that.  When we talk about the influence of readers, the media pays attention-----</p></speech>

There is <i>The Guardian</i>in Britain and further to the left, there is<i>L'Humanit&eacute;</i>in France, which has a strong connection with the communist party there and so forth.  By Dr. Mercille's admission, it does not matter whether a newspaper is left or right wing; the issue is whether the reporting is accurate and logical.  How does Ireland compare on the accuracy of its reporting as opposed to the blend of ideological positions in the mass media?</p></speech>

It was conducted by three academics from Dublin City University and was entitled, &quot;FROM BOOM TO BUST: A post-Celtic Tiger analysis of the norms, values and roles of Irish financial journalists&quot;.  What was the importance of that study?  What were the findings of the academics based on what the financial journalists told them?</p><p>Dr. Mercille will be familiar with another study by Mr. Bourke in 2008 entitled, &quot;Ethical Trends and Issues in Irish Journalism 1973 to 2008&quot;.  In that study, a former group business editor of a major newspaper in the 1980s is quoted regarding the issues touched on by Dr. Mercille in his presentation and discourse with the committee.  He said:<blockquote>Behind every organ of media, there is an owner, manager or agent who seeks to protect an interest.  When those interests become wide ranging and extensive, the scope for comment on these and parallel interests of proprietors becomes increasingly restricted.</blockquote>Does that sum up what Dr. Mercille has said?  Would that be an accurate reflection?</p></speech>

One can always add detail to that but the study the Deputy mentioned was good because it answered all the questions I was asked this morning about giving examples of journalists or editors who felt constrained by property interests or advertisers.

Of course, when the bubble burst, in 2009 and 2010, one could not really deny it.  In those reports, in 2009, 2010, 2011 and after, they are not denying there is a bubble.  They are saying, "The market crashed", or whatever.</p> <p>  The interesting part relative to the Chairman's question might be 2008, when it is deflating but people are still saying, "No, no, no, it is just temporary and it will rise back up".

Indeed, Dr. Mercille would have been a major source for this statement were it not that the committee had already heard from him for two hours already.</p><p>I will endeavour to mention other researchers whose work I am drawing upon, but I should also note that a fully referenced version of the statement has been furnished to the committee, with a works cited list, and I will also be making a link to that public on social media later today.<br/><br/>Print and broadcast media in Ireland played a difficult-to-measure but almost certainly significant role in the inflation of the property bubble and the legitimisation of risky behaviour by the financial services sector in the lead up to the crisis of 2007 and 2008.  It did so partly by ignoring or marginalising scepticism about these phenomena.  I will focus in my statement on the newspaper industry and I will argue that this socially destructive role should be understood not necessarily as a failing of Irish newspapers but, to some extent, as a feature, one that flows predictably from commercial media's structural relationship with the corporate forces that benefitted from the bubble.  While this relationship is of very long standing and continues to some extent to this day, I will further argue there were certain aspects of the development of newspapers in the 1990s and early 2000s, which were particularly acute here in Ireland but also experienced elsewhere in the world, that made them especially vulnerable to domination by those forces and weakened the capacity of journalists to play the critical, adversarial and investigative role that most of them do undoubtedly value.  Within journalism and in research about journalists, that value is often referred to under the rubric of &quot;professionalism,&quot; a term that encompasses a set of principles and performances that supposedly drive journalists to seek the truth impartially and to question the powerful doggedly.  The values are captured in such largely symbolic documents as the National Union of Journalists Code of Conduct and the code of practice of the Press Council of Ireland.  I will not endeavour to romanticise the journalism of an earlier age, which had plenty of its own problems, many of them involving the limits and shortcomings of professionalism itself.  However, over the last 30 years or so, those principles have been widely understood to be increasingly at risk all over the world, with particular features of the media landscape endangering them.  Daniel C. Hallin, a leading American scholar of journalism, has written, &quot;For the most part I don't think journalistic professionalism is breaking down from the inside, by journalists becoming less committed to it; instead [Hallin continues] I think professionalism is being squeezed into increasingly smaller niches within the media field.&quot;<br/><br/>It is my contention that in Irish newspapers we can literally see that squeeze occur over the period between about 1990 and 2007, as the physical construction of newspapers changed.  There was an inscription of an unquestioning pro-business ideology, in practice, onto increasingly large advertising-heavy portions of the newspaper - indeed, sections that owed their existence precisely to advertising, including the ever-growing business finance, property, and lifestyle sections, dedicated to the advertising of, respectively, recruitment, real estate, and consumer goods and services.  Even the most scrupulous of newspaper editors, I contend, came to see those sections as a realm of, at best, what one might call &quot;professionalism lite&quot; where soft treatment of the rich and powerful was expected.  Even if one worked in the niches where full-blown professionalism still held sway - the journalists who filled news pages and provided political coverage, for example - it was hard to miss the message that was embedded in that big colourful product about your employer's relationship with financial institutions, property interests and other corporate bodies.  Those supplements were, after all, paying the bills.  When The Irish Times Limited infamously paid &euro;40 million for <i>myhome.ie</i>in 2006, it appeared to confirm the company's dedication to what increasingly looked like its core business - the advertising of property sales.<br/><br/>There is a piece of research that has already been cited today in which a group of Irish financial journalists, speaking on condition of anonymity to a team of academic researchers who published their findings in 2010, discussed this relationship.  One of them said, in that research by Fahy, O'Brien and Poti:<blockquote>Much of the mainstream media seems to me to be very conflicted because of their reliance on real-estate and recruitment advertising.  That doesn't mean reporters consciously avoid writing bad news stories, but it's hard to run against the tide when everyone is getting rich.</blockquote>Another stated explicitly that journalists &quot;were leaned on by their organisations not to talk down the banks [and the] property market because those organisations have a heavy reliance on property advertising&quot;.<br/><br/>In 2006 I interviewed dozens of journalists about <i>The Irish Times</i>at that time.  One of them, who was retired from that newspaper, said:<blockquote>In the mid-1980s ... we had a series investigating the truth behind buying and selling property.  Can you imagine that now?</blockquote>That was in 2006.  Now, the idea that certain parts of the Irish newspaper industry were professionally compromised territory was already in the air as early as the 1980s.  The former business editor from Independent Newspapers, cited in that same research that we have discussed, and to whom one of the Deputies has already referred, recalled a lunch from that period where journalists and stockbrokers gathered to mark the appointment of a new president to the Irish Stock Exchange.  The journalist recalled the event to a researcher many years later.  He stated:  <blockquote>The lunch went well and all the proprieties were observed, until, during the port, the topic of mutual dependence came up in the conversation.  &quot;What do you mean mutual?&quot; a rubicund and slightly tipsy broker ventured.  &quot;The business pages are ours.  We own them.&quot; </blockquote>The editor continued his recollection:<blockquote>Trudging back to the office, however, I admit an icy feeling was coursing through my veins.  Maybe, the chap with the English public school accent was right.  He was implying that we [journalists] were lazy, dependent and largely uncritical.  More chillingly still, maybe our employers (who shared the same gentlemen's clubs with the brokers) were happy with such an arrangement. </blockquote>That was in the 1980s.  By the time of the Celtic tiger, this compromised turf of business and financial journalism had expanded many times over, both in the volume of pages produced and in the number of journalists employed.  In that research cited earlier, the author summarised the views of several of the Irish financial journalists whom they interviewed, and this is an extensive quote from that research:<blockquote>According to journalist F, because of the need for regular contact with financial sources, &quot;some journalists are reluctant to be critical of companies because they fear they will not get information or access in the future&quot;.  Journalist E ... believed that some journalists had become &quot;far too close to their sources&quot;: They viewed them as friends and allies and essentially became advocates for them.  Their approach was justified editorially because many developers and bankers limited access to such an extent that it became seen to be better to write soft stories about them than to lose access.  Extremely soft stories would also be run to gain access too ... Journalist B criticised daily financial journalism for being &quot;almost entirely press release and stock exchange disclosure based[.]&quot; ...</blockquote>The report continues: &quot;... Journalist F noted [that] it was &quot;well known that some PR companies try to bully journalists by cutting off access or excluding journalists from briefings&quot;.<br/><br/>The sort of ambivalence that this engenders about telling good tough stories while maintaining source relationships is not unique to financial or property journalism; it is present throughout journalism.  However, as the role and prominence of those sorts of journalism increased in the 1990s and early 2000s, their particular compromises of professionalism played a proportionately bigger role in newspaper coverage of these important areas of the economy and society.  Their growth was not inevitable, nor was it unique to Ireland.  It was part of an international development in the newspaper industry that sought to diversify papers' content and appearance to make them more attractive to advertisers and, to a lesser extent, to readers.  In the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s this came to be known as &quot;total newspapering&quot;, with a de-emphasis on news and - this is the &quot;total&quot; part - an effort to break down the traditional barriers between editorial and commercial considerations.  A study of this phenomenon, also known as &quot;market-led journalism,&quot; in the 1990s carried the cautionary title, &quot;When MBAs rule the newsroom.&quot;  This was already worrying journalists cited in British research during this decade:<blockquote>Among journalists there are fears that the delicate balance between the self-interest of capitalist media owners and the &quot;public interest&quot; motives of journalism has been upset ...  Some journalists have come to believe that the news is being stolen from them.  </blockquote>This market orientation does not express itself merely in the growth of financial and property journalism but in the explosion of entertainment, lifestyle and consumer-oriented sections and stories.  As one scholar summarises it - again, I quote this from Hanitzsch:<blockquote>When market orientation is high, journalism gives emphasis to what the audiences want to know at the expense of what they should know ...  Audiences are not addressed in their role as citizens concerned with the social and political issues of the day but in their role as clients and consumers...</blockquote>These developments in newspapers did not happen by accident or in isolation.  They were a vital cultural component of the larger global development of politics and economics over the last several decades that we have come to call neoliberalism.  The great historian and student of that phenomenon David Harvey writes: &quot;Neoliberalization required both politically and economically the construction of a neoliberal market-based populist culture of differentiated consumerism and individual libertarianism.&quot;<br/><br/>It is important to note that I do not believe we should blame most journalists either individually or collectively for this situation.  Nor have journalists been its obvious beneficiaries.  Even in Ireland, where the booming economy helped newspaper circulation and profitability to remain healthy past 2000, a journalistic culture of increased workloads, casualisation, rapidly changing technological expectations and declining real rates of pay was in place throughout the industry even before the wider bust of 2007-08.  When I did that series of interviews with newspaper journalists in 2006, many of them told me that their capacity to engage in critical scrutiny of Government and business was overwhelmed by the day-to-day pressures of filling ever more space in print and online.</p><p>The job of careful consideration and analysis of events was largely left to a small coterie of editors and senior political writers who were generally believed to have risen to those posts through a combination of caution and conservatism.  As research outside Ireland has also suggested, journalists who continued to feel that they should be doing hard-hitting, critical scrutiny of powerful institutions felt disempowered from doing so.  It is not surprising that a reputable transnational &quot;scorecard&quot; of journalism's coverage of the financial crisis found that in Ireland, most stories were episodic and short of analysis.  These conditions have, if anything, deteriorated further in the intervening years of collapsing circulation and desperate digitisation.  <br/><br/>Such conditions also provide the context for the increasing power of the public relations industry.  As noted above, the capacity of PR officers to give and withhold the information that hard-pressed journalists require in order to do their work gives them an inevitable influence over content to the benefit of their State and corporate clients.  An even more insidious form of PR influence comes in the form of &quot;flak&quot;, which is the negative attention and pressure that comes upon journalists when they attempt to report on sensitive stories.  In theory, flak can come from any side of a story.  In practice, most of it comes from the sides that can afford to generate it at a volume and with a social standing that catches the ear of editors.  <br/><br/>For reasons of space, and because it was not a specific part of the brief, I have not greatly addressed the question of media ownership in this statement, although I am happy to do so hereafter.  The enormously high concentration of media ownership in this State is, of course, a major danger and fundamental public concern.  However, ownership of media cannot tell the whole story about it.  <i>The Irish Times</i>is owned by a trust but has not been immune to the commercial pressures discussed here.  RTE, which is genuinely dominant media outlet in this State, is owned by the people of Ireland but its role in broadcasting non-news and current affairs based &quot;property porn&quot; in the Celtic tiger years certainly bears scrutiny.  It is worth saying that both RTE and newspapers did break many scandals although they were less likely to raise systematic questions about the state of the economy and the housing market.<br/><br/>The committee has asked me to address potential conflicts of interests among media organisations.  Based on much of what I have said here, it is tempting to conclude that there was no real conflict of interest at all but rather a congruence of interests between media organisations and the developers and financiers who were advertising with them cashing in handsomely on a speculative bubble.  While there would be some truth in such a conclusion, it would also be excessively simplistic because journalists and the organisations that employ them do also have an interest in producing strong stories that challenge conventional thinking, afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted.  Indeed, nothing in what I have said here should be interpreted to mean that they do not sometimes do precisely that.  The purpose of this analysis is not moral condemnation but to understand why, in the specific context of Celtic tiger Ireland and also beyond that context, the structural congruence might have been stronger and more influential than the sense of ethical conflict.  While much of the professional practice of journalism is conducted with an acute awareness of &quot;how it should be done&quot;, nonetheless, a host of other influences determine the shape and content of the journalistic product leading to biases in favour of, for example, &quot;talking up&quot; the economy and the market, home ownership, property investment and the soft landing.  How this happens is complex and contingent located where newspapers find themselves - at an intersection of daily events, longer term history, commerce, design, technology, routine, process, pressure and, not least, economic and political power.  This intersection is traversed by the workers in a newspaper on a daily basis. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-25a.343" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Harry Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015032500002#S00500"><p>I will do my best to answer that question.  In the absence of other clear professional markers, a code of conduct - an idea that journalists are truth seekers who try to be impartial and who challenge powerful institutions - defines journalism, at least as far as many journalists are concerned.  In another sense, it could be argued that some of that is also window dressing - a kind of high language that masks the chaotic reality of producing programmes and publications on a daily basis.  In other words, it could be argued that it is a myth or a series of myths that does not necessarily have a lot to do with the day-to-day publishing of a website or magazine.</p> <p>  As the Chairman suggests, they are in some sense codified.  The National Union of Journalists code of conduct is guidance for its members.  The code of practice of the Press Council of Ireland has somewhat more weight.  It is a voluntary code publications are encouraged to sign up and give their commitment to and encompasses fairness, balance, respect of the rights of the people about whom they write and accuracy.  The Office of the Press Ombudsman and the Press Council were set up primarily by the newspaper industry in some ways to fend off more statutory regulation that was threatened to some extent by these Houses.  They are essentially voluntary codes, although there is some statutory backup for the Press Council.  In effect, this is an element of protection for communications with the Press Council.  They have fairly weak enforcement methods.  Publications are not obliged to sign up to them.  In order to take a complaint to the Office of the Press Ombudsman, people need a certain standing in respect of the story.  They cannot simply complain that a story is inaccurate.  They must complain that it is inaccurate and that its inaccuracy affects them.  Property editorial and journalism that is hard to distinguish from advertising, which were discussed this morning, do not really come up in respect of the Office of the Press Council.  </p> <p>  Broadcasting is a very different story.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, has real and significant powers in terms of the regulation of RTE and the private broadcasting sector and has a code of fairness, objectivity and impartiality in news and current affairs which it is often quite aggressive in enforcing.  Broadcasters are generally quite knowledgeable about the requirements they have under that code.  The code relating to the press is a far less powerful instrument.  </p> <p>  My interest is less in these assertions than in structural facts.  Just as light-touch regulation in the economy was not a mistake but was built into the system of breaks and incentives that were established here to attract and reward capital, light-touch journalism to some extent was a predictable feature of the changing face of the industry since the 1980s.  It does not require a conspiracy to undermine the standards codified in some of those documents we have talked about - just a set of institutional changes that made those standards less significant in many areas of journalistic work.  </p></speech>

On the media studies page which I have already mentioned, we did a full page exploration for young people on the issue of media ownership.  We had a large photograph of the proprietor of the rival organisation in question.  That particular page and some of its statements came under attack in that rival publication.  One of <i>The Irish Times</i>editors came to me the following week after that and said &quot;Maybe it is a good idea to not pick a fight with that particular organisation in that particular way.  Carry on but let us not go there in terms or raising questions about ownership of a rival organisation.&quot;</p></speech>

I was editor of a supplement called Education and Living.  Its purpose was to cover the education sector.  There was a long term hope in the paper that it would attract advertising, particularly recruitment advertising for the education sector.  Occasionally there were discussions about finding ways to do stories which would make the supplement fit the needs of the sector, so it would understand that while it is good to advertise in Friday's business section, they should also advertise in Tuesday's education section.  The myth of the firm wall between editorial and advertising, that nobody from one side ever looks into the other side, is just that, a myth.  The discussions certainly took place, but I cannot say that it ever impinged directly on my practice except for the example I give.</p></speech>

That advertiser approached the managing director of the newspaper directly.  Consequently, the journalist's employment was terminated within 24 hours.  Examples of this are not copious.  For the reasons discussed previously, journalists usually understand the lines that they need to be careful about crossing, but that is a good example of someone who crossed the line and paid with his job.</p></speech>

At times they have and at times the guidelines tend to fade.  For most of the time I was in <i>The Irish Times</i>we had a very active ethics committee comprising editorial staff from the paper, and a close eye was kept on who was paying for trips and who was paying for lunch.  There was a strong feeling that journalists should pay their own way or they should not take part at all in certain activities with potential sources or potential subjects or stories.  I know that some newspapers continued to try and hold the line on that sort of activity.  To be honest, the overwhelming practice in the industry is fairly lax in that respect, whether or not there are written codes in place that suggest it.  The code of practice of the Press Council of Ireland does not make specific reference to it.</p></speech>

I believe it is fair to say that the majority of journalists working in the property area would not be engaged in anything remotely resembling corrupt practices.  Conflict rarely arises in the relationship between property developers, estate agents and the journalists working in those areas.  There is not really any need for the showering of gifts, there is a shared interest in property journalism as traditionally understood in the property supplements.  There is a shared interest in the promotion of property sales.  I believe that in some respects, property journalism sometimes gets bashed a little too hard in these discussions.  It is a genre in itself and in some ways can feature some of the most beautiful writing in journalism.  Most readers understand what property journalism is and can see it for what it is.</p> <p>  My concern about property supplements is not so much the journalism that was in them, or the relationships that existed between individual journalists and the interests represented there, but the insidious effect their very existence had on larger aspects of newspapers.  For example, it is one thing to have property supplements saying that one should buy a beautiful home in Ballsbridge, but it is another thing to have the business advice column treating homes and houses as just another asset class that people are invited to invest in.  I believe in some ways that is more insidious.</p></speech>

As I was saying, the correlation is a sort of virtuous circle; that the journalists who are known to write nice things were invited along and they might be given a sample product, a nice lunch or whatever.

Certainly, if one picks up a business supplement of an Irish newspaper one will find interesting critical analysis of the activities of business people, within a certain critical framework that I would describe as a narrow ideological one in the sense that we were discussing earlier with Dr. Mercille.  There is real critical journalism in business and education supplements.  We did not have a client base in the same way-----</p></speech>

Sometimes the distinction can be a little unclear.  I picked up <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>the other day.  It is a wonderful newspaper, but as one flips through it there are certain pages that focus on this or that and one can see they have essentially been designed as ad bait.  When one sees something like that, there is an element of a pretty direct correlation between the advertising and the editorial.  On the other hand, I think that, by and large, for instance in a business supplement in the <i>Irish Independent</i>or <i>The Irish Times</i>, I do not think the journalists are looking down to the bottom of the page to see who made the larger ad in order to determine who gets the better coverage.</p></speech>

One sets up a subject matter where one believes there will be a sectoral interest in advertising with that particular subject.  Sometimes one does it in partnership with an outside institution.  The phenomenon of special reports is essentially a series of opportunities by which newspapers and outside bodies form a kind of partnership to produce pages that will then attract advertising from particular sectors.  It is very widespread and it is seen as somehow okay because it says in very small writing that it is a special report.</p></speech>

It is done specifically for that purpose.  The great international example of a kind of scandal around this area was when <i>The Los Angeles Times</i>in 1999 did a supplement with a big convention centre in Los Angeles, the Staples Center.  It was a very large magazine of 168 pages.  It was ad bait.  It was designed to attract lots of advertisers to that supplement.  That would have been fairly commonplace, but then it emerged that the profits from the sale of advertising for that supplement were actually being shared between the newspaper and the Staples Center itself.  That was seen as somehow crossing an ethical line that the supplement itself did not.</p></speech>

On page 2 of his statement, Mr. Browne talks about the print and broadcast media ignoring and marginalising scepticism about the property bubble and lending practices of financial institutions.  Is he able to tell us a little bit more about that, because it is very specific and they are quite strong terms?</p></speech>

I have not done the research the previous witness has done in this area so I will be speaking more in generalities.  I believe that journalistic professionalism in its purest version would call journalists not only to say, well, what does the Government say or what does the leading expert in the leading Irish university department have to say on this topic.  I would say that real journalism means that one goes and finds the dissident.  One goes and finds the voices of those who are critical of the status quo.<br/><br/>The idea of journalism as a challenge to power can only happen if one is seeking out the expertise to challenge that power, and if one is seeking out the voices.  Dr. Mercille has covered some of this ground.  One had <i>The Economist</i>not <i>Red Pepper</i>saying in 2002 that the Irish economy was clearly overheating and that there was a bubble in property here.  One had, by and large, Irish journalists working in the area choosing not to make that the main topic of conversation on television programmes and in newspaper articles for as long as that bubble was to continue.  To some extent I think the burden of proof is on the other side, if the Senator does not mind me saying so; that in effect journalistic institutions would need to show that they systematically sought critical voices and to amplify and understand those reputable voices, mostly from outside the country, that were raising these fundamental questions about the state of the economy.  I am not necessarily talking about who got an article on their desk and said, &quot;No we are not taking that, it is too critical of the economy&quot;.  I am talking about what I think is a fundamental journalistic duty, which is always to look for the other voice, the other perspective.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-25a.402" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1129" speakername="Susan O'Keeffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015032500002#U02700"><p>Indeed, Mr. Browne referred in his submission to, "Even if you worked in the niches where full-blown professionalism still held sway (the journalists who filled news pages and provided political coverage, for example)".  Is Mr. Browne making a difference between the full-blown professionalism of those journalists and the sort of journalists who were writing on the property pages, or am I misunderstanding him?</p></speech>

What I am saying is that even in those areas where one was not under the same direct commercial pressures or there was not the same expectation, for instance as there would be if one was being profiled in the business supplement of a major Irish newspaper, one can usually be pretty sure that it will be a nice, soft piece.  That was certainly true, but probably a little less true since the collapse.  Maybe we will get to that.  It was certainly true during the time of the Celtic tiger.</p> <p>  What I am saying is that in addition to there being areas of the paper that did not come under the same sorts of commercial pressures, the people who worked in those areas none the less would get the message that those commercial sections put out.  We may talk a little bit about how much money those sections were actually worth, but they were very significant.  We were told repeatedly that those sections paid the bills in a newspaper.</p><p>One comes to understand that it is where interests lie.  That is not to say, of course, that political journalism is somehow immune to the same kind of source relationships and sensitivities that business or property journalism has.  I do not want to come to Leinster House and pretend it is a big revelation that sometimes journalists are given a story in exchange for soft coverage.  It is something I bet happens around here sometimes.  That is the distinction I was making.</p></speech>

If somebody came up with a contrarian view, would better journalism have pursued a more contrarian view or to see if the person was correct in what is put out there?</p></speech>

To some extent, journalism that reduces itself to recording the claims of one side and then the other side but does not investigate the reality of those claims, or seek more sides - as there are generally more than two sides to every story - is lacking.</p></speech>

As I indicated in my opening statement, that signalled that this would be the core business.  To some extent, that is not unreasonable as a suggestion.  The main revenue source for newspapers up until very recently has been advertising, and within the advertising spend, approximately two thirds was from recruitment and property.  They were roughly equally balanced, as I understand it.  It was clear that by 2005 or 2006, newspapers were having trouble getting into this new online area.  The Competition Authority had no problem with <i>The Irish Times</i>taking <i>www.myhome.ie</i>as there was no competition issue because the newspaper had failed to bring its role of advertising property through print into the online sphere.  In effect, the signal was just an amplification of the signal from a 48-page property supplement, which were in evidence since the late 1990s.  That is fundamental to how those newspapers survive economically.</p></speech>

Will he draw that out?  Many people listening and watching would not understand the relationship here, where the public relations person interacts between journalist and client.  I have an understanding of it and I have experienced that flack.  Perhaps it would be useful to explain that a little.</p></speech>

PR does the flack for a person and it is part of the job.  When an organisation employs a PR person, it is not just to produce press releases, organise briefings or take journalists to lunch where necessary.  It is also in the expectation that where there is negative coverage or potential for negative coverage, the PR person will work to fend it off, minimise it or block it if possible.  This might entail telling an editor it is not a good idea.  An issue I have experienced personally and which Deputy Clare Daly has raised in the D&aacute;il relates to the BBC World Service doing a short item about U2's tax affairs and the perception of that in Ireland.  I have written a book about one of the members.</p></speech>

The PR people I dealt with were great and it would be a real slur against public relations to suggest that somehow it is the opposite of journalism, the evil empire or the dark side.  I know that on a Thursday afternoon, when I could really do with a photograph for page three of my supplement, there were a couple of PR companies that would be pretty good at giving me a call and saying there was a nice story and a picture that could probably be used.  For the most part, PR people do their job well when they understand how journalists need to do their job.  There may be insidious behaviour, with information being fed on behalf of a corporate client, but in some respects it was not a destructive force that prevented me from doing stories that flack has potential to do.</p></speech>

Most journalists I know are pretty ignorant about who sits on the board of their organisations.

These are the normal workplace relationships.  That kind of high-level stuff is not what may be encountered.</p></speech>

In none of those cases did I regard the demand being made as particularly onerous or problematic.  Rather, it was one which flowed naturally enough from a set of relationships among elites, as we mentioned earlier.  It was understood on those rare occasions that part of our job was to occasionally directly serve those interests when they were brought to our attention.  The more insidious part is the extent to which we did not know we were being asked to serve particular interests but our work was being guided in ways that served those interests nonetheless.</p></speech>

I apologise for drifting into Bono and other issues.  My overall assessment is made in the opening statement.  I reiterate that we should distinguish between the interests of media institutions and those interests, including commercial interests, that we have discussed, as compared with the interests of journalism.  It is possible, although slightly romantic, to make a distinction as to what we do as journalists.  I have done my best journalism in the 13 years since I stopped working full-time within a media institution.</p><p>I think we can say that it is possible to do journalism despite the larger interests of those organisations and that we, as journalists, do our best journalism when we are not worried about those interests and when the institutions make space for us to do that work.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions.  On page 5, Mr. Browne briefly refers to ownership issues in the media in general and media outlets, and he has referred to the fact that he did not go into any detail on it, but does he believe that ownership factors had an impact on the coverage or lack of coverage of the issues that were prominent before the housing bubble came to its ultimate collapse?</p></speech>

In other words, the wider interests of the individuals and companies that owned major media outlets in the State are not necessarily easily made congruent with those of the property industry.  We did not have large property developers who owned newspapers.  Anglo Irish Bank, to name one randomly selected institution, was not a major shareholder in any of those companies, which is not to contradict the point I made earlier about the basic structural relationship that arises from the advertising that that sector brought to bear in property and also in recruitment.  The financial sector was a huge source of funds in recruitment advertising in newspapers, so I think that there again remains that structural question but it is not a direct consequence of the specific ownership of any specific media company.</p></speech>

Is Mr. Browne stating there that RTE had a particular agenda in running those particular programmes that he referenced or that they were just reflecting the kind of wider view of the public at the time of interest in property-related matters?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-25a.430" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Harry Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015032500002#W00600"><p>That is a very good question and I think that while RTE is not entirely immune to commercial considerations, it clearly is a dual-funded broadcaster and it gets considerable financing from advertising.  Some of those programmes would have got sponsorship from building societies and things like that so there would have been some direct agenda, yes, an agenda that matched up advertising with content, in those areas, which were non-news areas, non-current affairs areas.  I am not suggesting that RTE invented that agenda particularly for commercial purposes.  As the Deputy suggests, it was part of a wider cultural phenomenon and one that arose directly from the economic interests of the institutions that were trying to encourage people to get on that ladder, keep buying, get on that ladder, keep buying, soft landing, etc.</p></speech>

He notes that PR officers have, "The capacity to give and withhold the information that hard-pressed journalists require in order to do their work gives them an inevitable influence over content, to the benefit of their state and corporate clients."  Does Mr. Browne think that that power ever works in reverse in the sense that PR persons are reliant on the journalist to get their particular point of view across in a publication or in broadcast media?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-25a.432" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Harry Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015032500002#W00800"><p>I think I understand the Deputy's question.  He is suggesting that, in a sense, the journalists can get more out of a PR because of what they have to offer, that, &quot;No, you are going to have to give me more on that story, you are going to have give me another angle, I need more information, because you are trying to get me to cover and I have potentially got three minutes on the news that I can do with this and if you want that three minutes you are going to have to give me more.&quot;  Sure, of course, the relationship is clearly a two-way stream and, again, one does not have to go far beyond the precincts of these premises to understand how that kind of relationship can work.  The PRs do not hold all the power.<br/><br/>There is a very good book about the recent history of American journalism by John Nichols and Robert McChesney called <i>The Death and Life of American Journalism</i>, I think, and it has a chart in the back that traces the employment in the PR industry and the employment in journalism from about 1980 to 2008.  In 1980 the two bars are roughly equivalent.  There are just about the same number of PRs working in America as there are journalists.  As one moves through the 1980s and 1990s the PR bar keeps growing, the journalism bar wobbles and starts to shrink and by 2008 there are about three or four times as many PRs as journalists in the United States.  That indicates to me a kind of a change in the ecology of this entire relationship and one in which the capacity of journalists to scrutinise the kind of information that is coming from this vast apparatus of public relations is weakened and the capacity of the PRs to kind of push information on journalists who have more and more that they have to try to deal with, contend with, and publish is strengthened.  So although the Deputy is right in suggesting that the power clearly can work both ways and journalists do have what one might call currency in the transaction, they nonetheless find themselves, I think, increasingly on the less pleasant end of that transaction.</p></speech>

There was a time when it would have been considered once one moved into PR there was no going back.  I think nowadays most people who go into PR probably do not want to go back because the money in journalism is so much poorer than it is in public relations.  Speaking as a journalist who sometimes writes press releases for causes and organisations that I support, I am delighted, as I am sure any of the committee members would be, when journalists cut and paste my press release and put it straight into the paper with somebody else's name on it.  That is great but it is not very good for journalism.</p></speech>

Is that not just life?  In all fields of activity one must have courage, one must have convictions, one will encounter obstacles.  I know it is a wrong analogy but let us say that Kerry footballers and Kilkenny hurlers are not exactly waiting to hand over the titles next year, so are journalists being a bit self-pitying when they say things like that?  Go on and do the story and stop worrying about who will not like it.</p></speech>

Essentially, the changing structure of journalistic employment means that it is more dangerous and difficult to try to do those sorts of things.  The fact is that the journalists that I interviewed, many of whom were saying those sorts of things for that research in 2006, were for the most part staff journalists in national newspapers, so they would not have had quite the same pressures that I have just referred to but, nonetheless, would have felt the heavy hand of how many stories they have to file on a given day.  One needs to file three times a day now with the online thing.</p><p>There is a sense that one can stand up for oneself.  Hopefully, that is part of the ethics that journalists are supposed to carry into the field.  However, the reality is, as in any institution, it is a risky proposition.</p></speech>

He also referred to the growth of PR to being four times the number of journalists in the United States.  I recall Mr. Browne&rsquo;s distinguished predecessor, the late Paul Tansey, with whom I worked to reduce air fares in and out of this country.  We regarded the PR outfits in the airlines as our enemies and were quite proud to treat them as such when we took them on.  What has happened since in that now journalists reprint PR hand-outs as if they were real news?</p></speech>

The real change in the direction of the empowerment of PR is, as I outlined, the changing ecology of the information flow.  PR is referred to as the enemy and there is talk of going to the dark side when journalists cross over to PR.  It is one of the few acceptable ways within journalism for us to actually say we have this ethics element, we are not PR, we wear this badge called journalism which scrutinises information critically and just does not cut and paste it.  Otherwise, journalists would sound self-righteous but at least we have PR to compare ourselves to.  There is this very closely related industry that is somehow ethically different that we use as a way of flying our own flag.</p> <p>  The fact is that the access that PRs can control is very important to journalists.  If one does not have that access and one&rsquo;s rival in another publication does, then one&rsquo;s editor will ask if one offended the PR.  Some editors would be delighted one offended a potential source in some way and tell one to keep offending him.  Other editors will say they would prefer if they had that story the other newspaper had.</p></speech>

At the same time, we are talking about human beings with relationships which are in some respects ongoing and necessarily have a social component.  Again, I do not have to go far beyond this building to ratify that.  The full quote from that lunchtime story includes a bit where the journalist said to the broker who claimed they own the business pages, that the hell they did.  That was an instinctive pushback from the journalist at this bald assertion by the broker.  It is possible to have an antagonistic challenging relationship with someone one must deal with regularly.  It is difficult but it is possible.</p></speech>

I have no particular inside information about this.  An editor would reject an article because of the overwhelming consensus among Irish elites in 2006 and 2007 - probably in some sense a stronger consensus in that period when things looked like they might be a little bit shaky - that we need to hold the line and not talk down the economy.</p> <p>  There is no question that newspaper editors have a keen sense of their responsibility.  "Responsibility" is sometimes a dangerous word to use in journalism.  The best journalism is often quite irresponsible, saying what needs to be said and finding truths that need to be told.  If I were to put myself in the mindset of an editor who would reject that piece - I hope I would never have been that editor - I would have done so on the basis that it was irresponsible, undermining of the economy and in itself a potentially dangerous act to publish it.  That is how I would imagine an editor would justify it to himself or herself.  Of course, I am trying to put myself in a position.  Clearly, we know it was one of the most important prescient pieces of journalism at the time.</p></speech>

In a sense, it was a critique of a large swathe of professional and academic economics in Ireland and, of course, of the media for its insistence on not recognising what <i>The Economist</i>had recognised many years earlier and what David McWilliams was writing.</p></speech>

I was doing a very long piece for <i>The Dubliner </i>about the political direction of <i>The Irish Times</i>and the question of whether it had essentially moved to the right in the course of the years of the boom.  In so far as it related to how that political orientation was related to its structural relationship with corporate interests, it is relevant.  The general view of the people I interviewed inside and outside <i>The Irish Times</i>is that there had been a perceptible move to the political right in the outlook of the paper during that time.  The general view was that this largely reflected an entrenchment of the view of Irish political elites in a more conservative and neoliberal direction during the Celtic tiger period.</p></speech>

Does he think that the newspapers provided adequate space for contrarian views in the lead-up to the crisis?  Does he think the coverage properly reflected the balance of views that were in society in terms of property and housing?</p></speech>

Did it reflect the balance of views that were available among the usual voices one would draw upon?  The coverage probably did reflect that balance.  Did it reflect contrarian views?  No, it did not.  This goes to the question of how it is that journalists measure what is a valid view to seek out and report.  There has been some discussion here about the extent to which the economics profession called it or did not.  I know economists who still argue about this quite a lot.  I think I said earlier in response to Senator O'Keeffe that there is a duty to go beyond reflecting the views that are extant among the elite voices in society.  I grew up in a liberation theology household in the US.  My father, who had been a priest in New York, was always quoting the Conference of Latin American Bishops of 1968 which said that the Catholic Church should have a preferential option for the poor.  In some respects, journalism should have a preferential option for the poor and in this case, for the marginalised and dissent.  It should be looking for the voice that is challenging the elite perspectives.  It should be seeking not just the educated views of economists, but the direct experience of people.  Again, that is a romantic view of what journalism should be that is distinct from the interests of the institutions that largely sustain journalism.  It is also one that should at least in part be a guide.  In retrospect, it would have meant that Irish newspapers could be holding their heads up a little higher than they are able to do here this afternoon and tomorrow about how well they covered the underlying structural problems in the economy.</p></speech>

Mr. Browne said he does not believe adequate expression was given to those contrarian views.  Were they out there seeking an opportunity to be heard and were they not given the platform?</p></speech>

We know the example of Professor Morgan Kelly.  This was a piece from a very senior and estimable academic that was nonetheless rejected on the grounds that it was dangerous and offensive.  I go back to my point that newspapers should be actively seeking contrarian views but I think that the people who could have offered those views probably could have done better.  People sometimes point to the ESRI reviews and say that if one reads them very carefully, one can see that they were calling the bubble.  We should not have had to read them very carefully.  They should have been calling it louder and should have been offering those op-eds to the newspapers.</p></speech>

I gave a one-word answer but it was in subtle ways that still need to be teased out by more research.  Obviously, there is what a newspaper says in its editorial but there is also the kind of news it chooses to cover and the kind of voices it chooses to amplify.  Those choices tended largely to reflect the structural relationship between the media organisations and those commercial sectors.  Dr. Mercille has probably done more of the close research that bears that out.  There is more to be done in that area.</p></speech>

To what extent does he believe that this takes away from the capacity of journalists to engage in critical analysis of stories and that the emphasis is on getting the story out there?</p></speech>

If one looks at the book I referred to earlier or <i>Flat Earth News</i>by Nick Davies, which is based on research from scholars from Cardiff University, there is a clear sense in which journalism has become more like what Nick Davies calls &quot;churnalism&quot; in recent years.  I am always surprised by how much the public does not realise the extent of the crisis print journalism in particular finds itself in.  The fall in circulation is only outstripped by the fall in advertising revenue.  <i>The Irish Times</i>has wound down the pension plan so I will get something like 40% of the pension I was promised when I left the newspaper in 2002.  <i>The Irish Times</i>has done this because of the trading situation in which it finds itself.  We talk about newspapers being large companies.  <i>The Irish Times</i>is now quite a small company.  The advertising revenue in all national newspapers in 2014 is less than half of what it was eight years ago and this is from digital as well from print.  Digital advertising is still a relatively small proportion of that.</p></speech>

However, there was also a sense that it was a fit and that there were obvious synergies to be had.  In effect, <i>The Irish Times</i>represented the pinnacle of the traditional print advertising for property and hoped to bring that reputation and revenue capacity onto a new platform.  I cannot say I had a million conversations about in 2006 when it took place, but there was a mixed view.  From journalists there was some concern in the sense that this was a non-editorial product being acquired.  It is one thing to have a big property supplement.  It is another to have a website which is, essentially, just the advertising part of a property supplement.  It is not like buying a local newspaper, which <i>The Irish Times</i>had done, or buying a glossy magazine, which <i>The Irish Times</i>did.  This was actually taking something which was really a non-editorial product.</p></speech>

Fundamentally the business of newspapers is selling readers to advertisers and, to a smaller extent, selling newspapers to readers.  In the memoir of a former editor of a national newspaper, he referred to research done in his newspaper and that two thirds of the advertising revenue was property and recruitment which were roughly equally spread.  Recruitment is not to be overlooked and was a source of a vast area of relationships with the financial industry, in the same way that the property sections reflected relationships with estate agents.  The recruitment sections, to a great extent, represented relationships with finance as well as with other industries.<br/><br/>For example, in 2001 there was a huge downturn in advertising revenue in newspapers, in particular <i>The Irish Times</i>, which was based fundamentally on a fall in recruitment rather than problems in the property market.  If one breaks it down, two thirds plus of revenue in newspapers comes from advertising.  Of that, two thirds comes from recruitment and property together.  One gets a broad picture of the situation.  If one looks at the steady rise of that through the boom and then the collapse since, one gets another sense of how important it has been to newspapers.</p></speech>

What the interviewee suggested - he was not off the record but I will refrain from mentioning his name - that the balance of forces within the newspaper was such that in the mid-1980s when he edited a critical series on property, the commercial side of the house could come in and say, &quot;Don't do that.  Why are you doing that?&quot;, and the editor would say: &quot;This is our area.&quot;  That hard wall is widely seen as having been, to a certain extent, breached in both directions.<br/><br/>One of Mr. Gageby's successors writes in his own memoirs that he sometimes regrets that he did not take more of an active role in the management side of the company, as opposed to just the editorial management of the newspaper.  I mentioned the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>earlier.  When a new publisher came in there in the 1990s, he said he was going to take a bazooka to blow away the wall between commercial and editorial considerations.  That was a more dramatic view of a kind of an idea that was widespread within the newspaper business at the time that said the editorial side has to think business, the business side has to think editorial and we are all in this together.<br/><br/>It was possible for a time in many national newspapers here for senior journalists to do an MBA and get funding from the newspaper to do it.  In some respects, for people outside journalism that might seem perfectly normal.  One is a manager within a company and one's company wants one to get a better qualification in management.  From the point of view of a journalist, it is more problematic because an MBA is training in a certain kind of ideology as well as being a training in the capacity to manage.  That breach was much more widespread by the 1990s and beyond.</p></speech>

Can I ask Mr. Browne his view on the elite, to speak in very strong terms?  On one occasion a very senior politician spoke about suicide.

It is almost a question about human psychology as much as it is about journalism, because at some level it seems to me that particular politician in question went too far.  There was a gut reaction among a lot of people who said: "We are not going to let him say something like that.  We are going to say the things."  In other words, instead of the effect being that those people should all commit suicide if they are so negative about the economy and making people shut up, the effect was to make people think it was important to say something.</p><p>It is, perhaps, important to say something now, to be in solidarity with the people who are being accused of being depressing about the economy.  There is not a simple answer in that regard.  At the point of the unravelling of the crisis it probably had the effect of sparking more critical journalism rather than suppressing it.</p></speech>

Features such as casualisation, declining rates of pay, etc., in other areas of the economy were routinely referred to as a race to the bottom.  In Mr. Browne's view was a race to the bottom being manifested within the media organisations during this period and, if so, how does this relate to how coverage of the bubble was treated?</p></speech>

Some journalists continued to do well throughout the period in question and to some extent have done well since.  The fact that journalism is characterised by certain structural changes that in ways resemble other industries should in some ways be seen as an opportunity for journalists.  I say that not as a booster.  Journalists who know the world of casualised labour, the world of falling wages and the world of precariousness may be in a better position to write about those realms than are journalists who are comfortable professionals-----</p></speech>

They are also in a more vulnerable position in so far as the institutions in which they might hope to earn a living writing about precariousness and low wages are themselves vulnerable because they have interest in maintaining their precarious position.

What are the implications of this process for, for example, how the property bubble would be covered?</p></speech>

The journalists who write for them could, if they were freelance journalists, be working on the property supplement one day and have to put on their ethical hat a little bit crooked because they would be aware of the need to report in a particular way for the property supplement.  Without bashing them, because they did some beautiful writing, some of the masters of euphemism in property supplements are extraordinary literary achievements.  The journalist would then have to straighten his or her hat again when required to work on the news pages.  This sort of compromise on a daily or weekly basis among journalists is not something that can be sustained as an ethical stance or as a way of pursuing what is, I think, a vocation rather than only a trade.  Absolutely, it has huge consequences.</p></speech>

In Mr. Browne's experience and based on his academic studies, does the media bear no responsibility or some level of responsibility for the development of the bubble and the subsequent damage done?</p></speech>

There is no sense in which scholars accept the notion that if one injects a 48-page property supplement into the blood stream of the readers they are all going to turn into mad property buyers.  There is nothing as straightforward as that.  There is no question that the property supplement was itself seen as an index of the boom, as was the case in regard to the recruitment supplements.  It is impossible to gauge precisely the effects of the journalism.  It would be ridiculous to suggest it had no affect whatsoever.  It was a huge part of the cultural manifestation and cultural conversation that happened that had deeper structural economic roots.</p></speech>

I have my own questions about philanthropic foundations and the agendas that they might bring in funding journalism.  I do not see philanthropy as a cure all.  The amount of money involved is nothing compared to what the market can bring or what the State can bring.  Ultimately, what we want is a plural media.  We want space for alternatives, something that brings us past mere professionalism and understands that journalism should be challenging and can be partisan and still be honest.</p><p>It seems to me that the distinction I was making earlier between journalism and the commercial institutions that support it, is one that is worth pulling apart.  I do not think we have to concede that, just because the institutions have these structural relationships to power, journalism itself is doomed to being dominated by stenography for the power.</p><p> It happens in many places around the world where media get public support.  One does not have to look beyond Ireland, of course.  The most important media organisation in this country is one that gets paid for out of the licence fee.  That is a model that is in place in large parts of the world.  It is the best media organisation in the country by some distance as well.  It has many, many faults but it does an awful lot of things and it does a good 30% of them very well.</p></speech>

Short of a perfect society, I think that some mix of market and public support is necessary and important.  We see it in Finland, for example, and people are always citing Scandinavian examples.  There are hundreds of euro per capita spent on direct and indirect subsidies to publications.  So not only can we talk about licence fees to public broadcasters, we can talk about, as already exists in Ireland, lower tax rates for newspapers - VAT on papers is low here for example.</p></speech>

I grew up in the United States and the American in me is very resistant to ideas of state controls, even though the United States was one of the first countries to introduce subsidies for media and made it much easier to publish and distribute newspapers going back to the late 1700s and 1800s.  I support those kinds of things, but on the idea that one would ban this or restrict that, I think I would prefer to see a situation where we are using carrots rather than sticks, where one incentivises non-profit news production, for example, with various kinds of breaks and various kinds of subsidies.  We are a long way from having that discussion and obviously this is not exactly the forum for it.  I think there are a lot of better ways to run a media system than the one that we have got at the moment.</p></speech>

I again thank Mr. Browne.  Earlier during my questioning he outlined an instance where somebody was given real estate for positive commentary.  Did I understand him correctly in saying that?</p> <p>  In modern times raw news reportage has given way to views and opinion, which is in the period we are looking at here.  In Mr. Browne's view, does it amount to cheerleading the property boom?</p></speech>

Some of the views and opinions may be quite critical of property booms and other aspects of neoliberal rule.  It is not necessarily the case that it is all cheerleading.  </p></speech>

The first relates to Mr. Browne's reference to some research, stating that a reputable transnational "scorecard" of journalism's coverage of the financial crisis found that in Ireland, most stories were episodic and short of analysis.  Does he have anything further to add to that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-25a.544" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Harry Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015032500002#BB01400"><p>Yes, "episodic" essentially means that it talks about what happens on the day instead of giving an analytical or thematic framework of understanding for them.  To be honest, it characterises most coverage of most stories, partly because of the constraints and pressures we talked about earlier.  It is one of the richest areas of study of journalism.  It is one of the areas where we find that there is actually a difference in how people read and receive stories depending on whether they are given real analysis and thematic understanding or whether they are merely told what happened today.</p> <p>  This analysis was an article by a series of scholars who looked at the coverage of the crisis in many different countries and found that in Ireland and most other countries as well, the coverage was largely bitty.  It was not to say it was all positive.  Obviously - we have not really talked about this - the crisis really did bring about a huge swing to the negative pole in how journalism talked about the economy, talked about the banks and talked about the property market.  However, it was without rich analysis.  It was largely the latest emanation of crisis.</p></speech>

Was there any influence by senior politicians exercised over newspapers, over journalists, during the time Mr. Browne has been working and observing?</p></speech>

I would not necessarily have been in on discussions with senior politicians.  One would know that certain politicians had a good relationship with the political editor, the editor or whatever, but mostly I would consider that to be normal institutional relationships - exactly what one would expect from institutions that are important parts of the functioning of an information system in a society.  Yes, senior politicians care what is in the newspaper; that is good.</p></speech>

I will not be pushing him to give "Yes" or "No" answers, but I want to bring proceedings to a conclusion.  I ask him to answer the following questions succinctly.  Was Ireland unique in the 2002 to 2007 period with regard to how the media covered growth in the property sector?</p></speech>

The end of the bubble has been incredibly damaging to media.  In terms of editorially, there has been a kind of extended episode of breast beating about how bad it was that journalists had succumbed to the orthodoxy of the bubble.</p></speech>

The period since then has not necessarily been characterised by a really pluralistic critical journalism; it has just been characterised by a different orthodoxy.</p></speech>

Deputy Eoghan Murphy referred to this in his closing question.  Could this happen all over again in the financial sector?  While that is a question for people who deal with regulation of bankers, given Mr. Browne's expertise in media I ask this.  Are the media structured in a way that this whole thing could happen again and we would see these massive supplements, albeit maybe in a different technological format - online or whatever?</p></speech>

I think that fundamentally if it did happen again, probably for better or worse the institutions we are talking about would be less important than they were in the period the committee is studying, but they could certainly continue to fall into many of the same traps because they continue to have many of the same structural relations to the industries and the sectors, and the interests that represent them.</p></speech>

Is there any particular learning from this period that Mr. Browne thinks has not been acted upon or needs to be acted upon going into the future?</p></speech>

That is what I would say.  Certainly, as I said in answer to Deputy Murphy, I do not feel comfortable with suggesting that there is a new regulatory framework needed - in terms of a restrictive one.</p><p>Nor do I think the commercial media are currently in a position to reshape themselves somehow to avoid the pitfalls they came into before.  It is all very well to ask what would be done in that respect but we are in our current situation.  It is not a terribly good one for journalism.</p></speech>

I will deal with the issues I have been asked to address, with specific reference to the Irish Examiner and our editorial policy on the economy and the property boom from 2002 to 2007, as referred to in the invitation from the committee.<br/><br/>I would first like to give a brief introduction to the <i>Irish Examiner</i>.  It is a broad-based mid-market newspaper, publishing six days a week, with an increasingly active online presence across many platforms.  I have been editor since 2001.  While we have a respected national profile, our circulation is significant in Cork and Munster, where we have the largest readership of any daily newspaper.  My role as editor is to lead a great team who make it happen every day.<br/><br/>A trusted newspaper must inform honestly and accurately.  It must ask questions and challenge where questions need to be asked and answers found.  It must present a broad range of diverse opinion and it must know and engage with its readers.  If it does all of these things successfully, it generates enough income to pay the wages of its employees, contributors, contractors, suppliers and shareholders.  That income is derived almost exclusively from two revenue streams: the cover price of the newspaper, and advertising.<br/><br/>I turn now to the specific area the committee asked me to consider, our editorial policy on the economy and the property boom and the approach to reporting on the property market and the Irish economy.  As far as the <i>Irish Examiner</i>is concerned, during the period in question we approached reporting on the economy and the property market in the same way that we approach reporting across the broad spectrum of the newspaper.  We endeavoured to ensure our reporting was accurate and reflected the facts.  The newspaper reflected all shades of opinion during these years, including prominent warnings going back to 1999 and throughout the Celtic tiger era that the property boom could not last forever.</p><p>What our coverage did at the time was reflect the preoccupation with property in a country experiencing an unprecedented boom.  We reported what was happening and what authoritative institutions such as the Central Bank, the Economic and Social Research Institute, the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development stated about what was happening.<br/><br/>No newspaper lives apart from its readers, and their preoccupation with and enjoyment of the financial benefits of that era were reflected in our columns.  Nobody who lived through that period, proclaimed throughout the world by our political leaders as an economic miracle, was immune from the spirit of the time.  It was the prevailing narrative of the political, banking and property establishment.  At the time, we had little or no reason to believe that key figures in our financial regulatory infrastructure were not functioning as they should have been in the best interest of the State and its citizens, and nor was there a level of transparency around the regulatory process for the banking system that would have allowed us to access information that subsequently emerged after the crash, too late, when the damage was done.  Believe me when I say that had I or any of my colleagues in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>been able to access that critical information about the real state of our financial institutions and their methods of operation in those years and months leading up to the bank guarantee, I would have published it.  It would not have been enough to have been privy to that inside information; I would have had to be able to prove it in a court of a law.  Publishing what one knows to be true does not mean one cannot be successfully sued for libel.  That is a point worth remembering when people question why the media does not publish what the dogs in the street might know.<br/><br/>Turning to the property market specifically, aside from reporting property news and commentary in the main newspaper, we introduced a weekend section with a property element in the mid-1980s.  This was a period of deep recession in Ireland and a world away from the property boom, but property editorial was of interest and was important to our readers, just as it is today.  That weekend section also included the usual mix of features, including television highlights and generally softer-focus content suitable for relaxed reading at the weekend.  In the mid-1990s, due to the increasing popularity of the sector and as the economy improved, the property element became a standalone publication, focusing on residential homes, which continues to this day.  In 2001 we introduced a commercial property section for Thursdays.<br/><br/>The purpose of the weekend property magazine is to provide readers with factual information on property for sale throughout the country, but primarily in the Munster region.  In essence, it is a mix of properties for sale, with a brief factual description, in addition to larger spreads for more distinctive and striking properties for sale that we think may be of interest to readers.  It also has sections on interior design, home improvements, gardening, antiques, etc.  It has been an important forum for informing readers of the types and costs of properties available for sale, along with additional advertising from furniture and home interior companies, DIY and gardening businesses, etc.<br/><br/>Advertising in the property section was an important and valued source of revenue during the Celtic tiger years - as it was before and still is - but it is important to stress that advertisers did not seek to influence the editorial policy of the newspaper, and the fact that such advertising was an important source of revenue certainly did not hinder our warnings over several years about the dangers of a financial crash.  In my entire time as editor of this family-owned company, the owners never once sought to interfere editorially.  The family has been publishing newspapers since the 1800s and I am in the privileged position of being the beneficiary of its strong belief in editorial independence.  That is important in the context of what the committee is seeking to establish with regard to the media during the period in question.<br/><br/>During that time, our property-related coverage reported factual information such as rising property prices, ESRI and Central Bank reports, pronouncements of leaders in their fields and Government-related interventions in the property market.  Although many of the articles published during this period mirrored the widely held view of the majority of commentators at the time - in particular, a prediction of a soft landing - it was not all one-way traffic.  Many articles containing opinion contrary to the prevailing view of the property market were also published in our newspaper.  As far back as 1999, we reported on spiralling house prices and warnings from the then Governor of the Central Bank, Maurice O&rsquo;Connell, that banks were &quot;lending too much money too easily&quot;.  A year before Morgan Kelly warned in 2006 of an imminent crash, the historian Ryle Dwyer wrote a column for the <i>Irish Examiner</i>headlined &quot;Why the housing boom could collapse like a ton of bricks.&quot;  In his article, he wrote &quot;The threat posed ... is patently obvious, yet it is being largely ignored, even though it threatens the social, financial and political fabric of society.&quot;  Warning consistently over many years, he drew parallels with the speculative property boom that caused the economic collapse of Japan.  He further stated &quot;Is anyone so foolish as to think that what happened in Japan couldn't happen here?&quot;.  That was in February 2005, over three and a half years before the State&rsquo;s guarantee of the banks and almost six years before the bailout by the troika.  Between Maurice O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s warning in 1999 and Ryle Dwyer&rsquo;s in 2005, we published many articles, including editorial commentary, which questioned the viability of the boom, and particularly the danger to the economy posed by the property bubble.  In 2004, we asked whether the glowing economic predictions of the time were based on sound financial principles, on the speculation bubble or on overly optimistic aspirations.  I have supplied the committee with some sample editorial coverage of these warnings over the years.<br/><br/>With regard to the contribution of the media to public understanding and debate around fiscal budgetary policies and their applications, in addressing this section I wish to restrict my response to the newspaper for which I have responsibility and knowledge rather than presenting a critique of the media generally.  During the period covered here, the investigative eye of the newspaper was trained on those ultimately responsible for the fiscal and budgetary policies of the State, namely the Government.  Critical analyses of the policies of the Government formed part of the opinion editorials of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>during the property boom.  As referred to earlier, the threats of rapidly increasing house prices and a failure to put on the brakes were published in the newspaper as early as 1999 and continued throughout the boom years.  There was no change of editorial policy during those years.  Our approach as a newspaper has been to accurately report the news and comment objectively on the facts as far as they were available to us.  Alongside that, I continued our long-standing tradition of providing a platform to all shades of opinion, including those with which I might have strongly disagreed.<br/><br/>Much of the information on the causes of the crash that have subsequently come to light as a result of various reports and the work of this inquiry to date were not only not in the public domain in the lead up to the banking crisis but were inaccessible to us.  Our reporting was influenced by the information available to us.  We had articles, editorials, columnists and commentators who, as the Celtic tiger roared, argued, in effect, that it was out of control and would end in tears.  They argued that there was something fundamentally wrong with the fact that somebody on a &euro;40,000 salary was eligible for a &euro;400,000 loan to buy a house.  Nevertheless, the predominant public sentiment in political, financial and property circles was that at worst the boom was going to end with that oft-quoted soft landing.  That predominant sentiment found its reflection in media coverage of the time in our newspaper and everywhere else.<br/><br/>A daily national newspaper such as ours is necessarily general in nature, with a mix of news, sport, business and features between its covers.  We are not a <i>Financial Times</i>or a <i>Wall Street Journal</i>staffed by a big team of financial forensic experts.  We are reliant on agents of the State to be competent, professional, open, honest and reliable in what they do and say, and then we report on that.  Our reporting on the economy during the period in question was as balanced, diverse and well informed as was possible given the information available to us, which was not all of the information available to various agents of the State.  If we were guilty of anything - and I believe we were - it is that we believed and accepted that institutions such as the financial regulatory authorities were doing their jobs and doing them competently, with due diligence, appropriate compliance policies and proper political and departmental oversight, all of which we believed were designed to ensure the stability of our economy.  From what we know as a result of the Honohan, Regling-Watson and Nyberg reports and the contributions of others to this inquiry, it appears to be obvious that our trust in these various arms and agents of the State was, to say the least, misplaced.<br/><br/>I acknowledge that there was insufficient critique of the frequent claims that there would be no crash and our so-called economic miracle would continue to be an example to the world.  We should have more rigorously challenged the predictions of analysts and economists, including those who contributed to our newspaper and those who had direct or indirect associations with financial institutions.</p><p>While this is an accusation that could be levelled at many editors and publishers throughout the world, much better resourced than my own organisation, it remains a matter of personal regret.  That said, it is with the benefit of hindsight which has been conveniently available to an earlier witness, Dr. Julien Mercille, but not to those of us living and working here at the time.  Even if we had been more questioning of the positive analysis and predictions for the economy and if we had even more contrarian voices to highlight, I doubt very much that it would have gone any meaningful way towards preventing the property bubble or the crash.  We still would have been unable to find out the true state of banks and their own regulation and we would still have been faced with an alignment of authority in the form of the IMF, the ECB, the European Commission, the international credit agencies, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Central Bank and the ESRI who were all of the view that our economic fundamentals were sound with the IMF giving Ireland a clean bill of health as late as 2006-2007.  It is difficult to envisage how any media organisation could effectively challenge such a formidable consensus.</p></speech>

I now invite Mr. Murphy to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-25a.573" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015032500002#KK00300"><p>On foot of a request from the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis in Ireland the <i>Irish Examiner</i>has nominated me to appear before the committee to discuss item 2, business model and sources of revenue, including from the real estate sector 2002-07.  I was the CEO of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>from October 2002 to June 2010 when I was appointed group chief executive of the then holding company of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, Thomas Crosbie Holdings Limited.  I was not the CEO of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>for the period from July 2010 until October 2011 at which stage I resumed that role in addition to my other responsibilities.<br/><br/>As the committee will be aware, the <i>Irish Examiner</i>is a daily morning, mid-market newspaper, produced six days per week which circulates in broadsheet format in the Republic of Ireland generally but its core area of circulation is in the Cork and Munster region particularly.  In addition, the <i>Irish Examiner</i>has an established increasing online presence now but in the period 2002 to 2007 all of this was in its infancy and, as such, was being established.  The <i>Irish Examiner</i>had no online property business in that period but had associated companies under the then parent company Thomas Crosbie Holdings Limited, called Recruit Ireland Limited, a recruitment support company, and <i>breakingnews.ie</i>, an online news publisher and contents indicator to third parties.  Thomas Crosbie Holdings Limited also had an online motoring site, called <i>motornet</i>.  <br/><br/>I wish to address the areas on which the committee has asked me to comment, namely, business model and sources of revenue.  As CEO of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>I have the task and pleasure of leading a great team of people who are responsible for producing, publishing and administering the best possible newspaper we can six days per week, 52 week per year.  I had eight direct senior management reportees at the time for the following role-functions: advertising sales, circulation sales, distribution and administration, editorial, finance, human resources, marketing, and production and IT.<br/><br/>Mr. Tim Vaughan has been the editor of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>since 2001 and is a highly regarded and experienced journalist and editor.  Mr. Vaughan has responsibility for all editorial matters pertaining to the <i>Irish Examiner</i>and his brief is to continue, as his predecessors did, to produce the best possible newspaper he can for our readers.  The brief of the editor and the board continues to be to publish as he views appropriate without fear or favour.  While he must be aware of influencers, given the nature of his role he has to remain steadfastly independent of such influences for purposes of editing the newspaper.  This has been the philosophy of the Crosbie family as handed down from generation to generation and remains the ethos of the newspaper to today.<br/><br/>The second item is the importance of property related revenues within the overall revenue mix.  In common with most, if not all, quality newspapers, the <i>Irish Examiner</i>has two main income streams, the first from circulation sales in the form of cover price and the second from advertising sales.  Circulation revenue is the mainstay of the revenue base but increasingly advertising revenue has become and remains vital, more particularly since 2007 when newspaper circulation volumes declined.  The ratio of advertising to circulation revenue in the period averaged 60:40.  <br/><br/>In any newspaper the key advertising sectors are to a greater or lesser extent property, recruitment, classifieds and run of paper.  Run of paper advertising typically is the larger display type advertisements often used by retailers, telecommunications companies and motor dealers <i>et al.</i>Increasingly today digital advertising revenues are becoming more important but in the reference period they were insignificant.  The <i>Irish Examiner </i>published a commercial section every Thursday within the newspaper for many years, including the period 2002 to 2007.  It also published a residential property section from the mid-1980s, which moved to a stand-alone publication on a Saturday from the mid-1990s, given the high level of home ownership in Ireland, relative to the rest of Europe, and the ever-increasing interest in property, furniture and interiors that the Irish population displays.  Advertising revenue is of vital importance to fund the current 300 jobs in the <i>Irish Examiner </i>and the continuing role of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>and the wider industry, so sales from all sectors is a critical success factor for newspapers.<br/><br/>Property advertising in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>is in relative terms as important today as it was at the height of the Celtic tiger but so are recruitment revenues, retail sector revenues and all advertising sector sales.  However, in the period 2002 to 2007 property advertising was consistent and strong.  Having said that, it reflected only a small but important percentage of our overall revenues in the period.  While it represented a greater percentage of our advertising revenues, internally we accorded it no greater importance over any of our other advertising sales sectors or over our circulation revenues.  To illustrate the point, we tend to allocate the same headcount and editorial space to property in our publications today in 2015, as we did at the height of the market in 2007.<br/><br/>The third point is the engagement in property related commercial activity.  In 2006 the <i>Irish Examiner</i>moved from Academy Street in Cork to new rented headquarters in Lapp's Quay, Cork.  The Academy Street building housed a 35-year old printing press that was no longer fit for purpose.  This printing press had no commercial utility or value.  It was therefore decided to sell this building, leaving the old printing press <i>in situ </i>for economic reasons and to move to a more modern office block in the city.  Printing was then outsourced.  It is also worth remembering that work practices were changing in the industry and, in particular, that it had become increasingly difficult to operate the type of scaled printing and distribution business we had from the premises in the centre of Cork city.  The Academy Street building which was owned by the company for more than 150 years was sold for approximately &euro;40 million.  This transaction was not unique and it followed a similar pattern of other newspapers, both here and abroad, who moved from city centre locations to new locations and-or who outsourced their printing. <br/><br/>In a separate property transaction around this time another city centre premises owned by the company, the <i>Irish Examiner, </i>which was used in the business as a parking garage and store for newsprint was sold for approximately &euro;2 million.  These are the only property related transactions of any significance that I am aware of that the <i>Irish Examiner</i>participated in during this period.  I was not involved in any way in these decisions which I understand were based on commercial considerations rather than on speculation in the property market.  These matters were negotiated at a holding company level at Thomas Crosbie Holdings Limited at the time. <br/><br/>The fourth point is the relationship between the editorial and sales functions.  There is a clear distinction between editorial and the sales functions of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>as referred to in section 1 and as fostered at management level by the management team and myself.  The concept of editorial independence is fostered by everybody in the company and is well understood in our marketplace.  However, editors today must have a commercial sharpness and awareness to ensure the best opportunity for their newspapers which is why they can prosper.  By way of example, this is practised in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>by: the editor ensuring that there is timely and adequate communication, where relevant, to the circulation and advertising managers of his planned editorial activities to ensure there is the best possible opportunity to maximise the sale of newspapers and, where relevant and appropriate, the sale of advertising; and similar communications with the marketing managers so that appropriate in-paper signposting and, where appropriate, advertising slots can be purchased on radio and television.  While the commercial side of the house will never dictate editorial policy we, like most newspapers worldwide, produce commercial supplements and features which are advertising led and are clearly labelled as such to ensure that no confusion arises in relation to their origins.<br/><br/>We have also published specifically themed editorial booklets covering topics as divergent as suicide, infertility and eating disorders.  While these are open to sponsorship and advertising, editorial content is sacrosanct and cannot be influenced.  The suicide booklet was produced without advertising or sponsorship at a financial loss but we published it in order to provide a public service as neither the HSE nor any other State agency had published anything like it despite the huge numbers dying by suicide.  </p></speech>

Before I invite the lead questioners perhaps I can put a question to Mr. Vaughan and to Mr. Murphy on which both of you may wish to comment.</p><p>In his opening statement, Mr. Vaughan refers to the preoccupation with property in a country experiencing an unprecedented boom and that we were proclaimed throughout the world by our political leaders as an economic miracle.  He states that it was the prevailing narrative of the political, banking and property establishment.  Could he elaborate on that for the committee as to what he is indicating there?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-25a.576" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Vaughan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015032500002#LL00200"><p>The three points are three separate statements from my opening statement.  The first part discusses the point that the coverage in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>reflected the preoccupation of most Irish people at that time.  It is as simple as that; I do not mean to say any more than that.  Regarding the second part, I think it is widely accepted that our economic miracle, so called at the time, was widely described as such by our own Government and by journals and publications from New York to Shanghai to Beijing.  The final part of my statement relates to the widely held belief that everything was rosy at the time - that was the predominant view as the committee has heard before today and again this morning.  The numbers of dissenters from that view were few.  I do not mean to say anything more than that.</p></speech>

I will deal with the second part of the question first.  At the peak, the number of staff working in the property advertising sales area would have been three sales executives.  They dealt with property advertising in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>.  That is now down to maybe two people, with holiday and sickness cover coming from a pool of other staff.  I believe there were two people working on the editorial side of the property supplement and property matters generally.  That is now probably down to one and a half at his stage.  Regarding pagination, at the height of the market the Saturday property supplement would have run from 48 to 64 pages and occasionally 72 pages.  It is currently approximately half that.</p></speech>

Up to March 2013, it was owned by what I will describe an investment holding company called Thomas Crosbie Holdings Limited which went into an insolvency process.  <i>The Irish Examiner</i>is now owned by another investment holding company called Landmark Media and in neither of those scenarios did the <i>Irish Examiner</i>file its own accounts.  It always prepared consolidated accounts.  The information pertaining to the <i>Irish Examiner</i>as a single entity has not been available for many, many years.  The information the Chair seeks is not in the public domain anywhere and it is important I state that.  I am very mindful of the purpose of the inquiry and in an effort to assist the inquiry I am prepared to say that the relationship between property advertising in the 2002 to 2007 period was, on average, approximately 7% of our total revenues in that period.</p></speech>

He also explained the move from Academy Street over to Lapp's Quay.  We will move to the end of the crisis period, or the expansionary period.

When the dust settled after the property collapse, was the <i>Irish Examiner</i>as an entity a net beneficiary or was it at a net loss?  What were the consequences for the newspaper?</p></speech>

The <i>Irish Examiner</i>as a newspaper brand has been in existence for over 170 years.  It is a very strong, well recognised brand with strong affiliations in its target and core areas.  I believe newspapers generally are going through a difficult time now with a transition in place in terms of moving from the traditional business models into the new business areas of digital-type operations.  I have no doubt that the brand will go from strength to strength.  I do not know if that answers the Chairman's question or not.</p></speech>

I reviewed the various articles Mr. Vaughan gave us copies of from 1999 to 2012.  Many of the articles and editorials from 1999 up to mid 2007 are very cautionary in tone and refer to concern for property investors.  In June 2004, it was stated that a property bubble was a danger to all.  In May 2007, there was an editorial with the headline, &quot;Construction worries - Housing fear may be well founded&quot;.  On 8 July the title of the editorial was &quot;Property dilemma - House prices prediction is a real worry&quot;.  One editorial, on 7 August 2007, seems to be out of context.  The headline is &quot;Property market - Soft landing to cushion fall in prices&quot; and the editorial finishes by stating:<blockquote><br /><br />The demographic trend, with the great influx of people from abroad, has underpinned the need for extra housing, and the Government has taken realistic steps to assist affordability with the increase in mortgage interest relief.  These factors would suggest the desired soft landing in relation to property prices.</blockquote>As editor, this is Mr. Vaughan's domain.  Where did this editorial come from?  It appears to be out of step with what came previously.</p></speech>

There were other articles which I did not supply.  I was giving a snapshot of the time.  The overriding attitude of the newspaper in editorials and commentary was cautionary.  That editorial was an exception.</p></speech>

The committee has heard from Professor Alan Ahearne.  Although he was raising flags in 2005, in July 2007, after there had been many high-profile warnings, he wrote:<blockquote><br /><br />Of course, Ireland's housing market at the moment is not crashing - it is correcting gradually downward.  That is good news.  The second piece of good news is that in the experiences of other rich countries, housing busts rarely lead to serious problems for banks.</blockquote>There has been much diversity and many changes of opinion over time.</p></speech>

There is a perception of the media that it might be no harm to debunk or explain.  There is much talk of the media as one homogenous entity acting in unison and in self interest, and there was much of this from Dr. Mercille this morning.  However, categorically, this is absolutely not the case.  Geographically, the <i>Irish Examiner</i>is based in Cork, and is the only newspaper based outside Dublin.</p></speech>

I will start on the issue of the reliance of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>on income from property related advertising.  Mr. Murphy indicated 7% of the total revenues of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>were accounted for by property related advertisements.  I appreciate Mr. Murphy is not required to give us commercial data in that sense.  However, he put on the record in his opening statement that the ratio of income was 60% from advertising revenue and 40% from circulation.  Therefore, if 7% of the total revenues were from property related advertising, then in the region of 11% or 12% of advertising revenue came from property related advertising.</p></speech>

To be helpful, I have given the committee certain types of information.  I have now given the committee two types of information in respect of our advertising base.  As I have said, that information is not in the public domain.  I am genuinely trying to be helpful to and co-operative with the inquiry.  Behind me are representatives of the press from every newspaper in the country.  I would prefer not to put the matter further than that.  I do not think that I should allow myself to be sucked into giving more detailed information.</p> <p>  There are two or three other entities to follow us, tomorrow, I believe.  To the best of my knowledge, what differentiates Mr. Vaughan and myself from the individuals who will follow us is that, from a newspaper standpoint, three of the four individuals are retired.  Furthermore, as I understand it, the fourth person is now in a different position to the one he occupied in the 2002 to 2007 reference period.  We have access to the information.

I am keen to discuss the issue of the Chinese wall between the editorial side and the commercial side.

These articles were to varying degrees critical of, questioned or contrary to the views that were popular at the time.

What did Mr. Murphy mean by this?  Who is he referring to as influencers?  He referred to influences as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-25a.660" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015032500002#NN02400"><p>Deputy McGrath has probably already asked Mr. Vaughan about what is an influencer in a newspaper.  I imagine if Mr. Vaughan walks down St. Patrick's Street in Cork tomorrow and he is leisurely, he could meet four people, for example, a reader of the newspaper, a purchaser of the newspaper, an advertiser of the newspaper or, dare I say it, a politician.  If he stopped and spoke to the four of them, I have no doubt that the conversation would inevitably go to something that was in the newspaper that day, that week, that month or whatever.</p> <p>  Our view is that we engage.  Cork is rather different place to live and work in than Dublin, for example, in terms of population size and the size of the city.  We interact with people on an ongoing basis.  It is rather difficult to avoid.  I suspect Deputy McGrath knows that himself.  Any one of those people could be an influencer, if that is the correct terminology.</p> <p>  For example, I might meet an estate agent.  That person may say to me that he would love to get an iconic property featured in the weekend supplement but cannot.  That is not a complaint or editorial influence in any way.  It is a matter of a person trying to advantage his client in some way.  However, the editor might be of the view that the newspaper covered the next-door property two months previously.  He may have no interest because he may be of the view that there is nothing particularly iconic about the property.  A motor dealer could be in the same situation.  He may say to the editor that he wants to get his new marque reviewed by the newspaper motoring correspondent but that he has be unable to do so.  The editorial view may well be that either the newspaper has done the brand previously or it will do it next week or it will do it with a different dealer.  There are 100 possibilities.  All of these things are influencers.  Do I believe any of these influencers function in a way that has a detrimental effect on the brand or the editor's ability to edit the newspaper?  Not at all.</p></speech>

There are certain features or articles written about properties which are advertised for sale in the supplement.  How do they get chosen?  I presume they are advertisement-led.  Will Mr. Vaughan set out from an editorial point of view what influences the selection of the individual properties that feature?</p></speech>

He is in constant communication with people in the market about what is coming up and what is interesting.  His prime focus is to get properties that are interesting to readers.  These may or may not be advertising and they may or may not be houses for sale, yet they may feature.  There is not a situation whereby if someone advertises, he must get editorial coverage.  That does not happen.</p></speech>

Mr. Barker would frequently have had phone calls on a Saturday, when the supplement came out, or on a Monday from people who were unhappy with aspects of what was reported.  It is not PR.</p></speech>

Looking back, if I could do it again I would seek out more contrarian views - more dissenters - but the fact of the matter at the time is that they were not there.  It never once happened that somebody had a valid viewpoint which was contrary to the prevailing mood and I refused them access to the newspaper.  In fact, I would have welcomed it.  There is plenty evidence down through the years of us presenting that contrarian view, but such voices were not there.  There was David McWilliams, as is frequently quoted, and there was Morgan Kelly at the later end of 2007.</p></speech>

One of the things one has learned since then is to get more of those voices and to seek them out.  They are there now.  We did not have the Constantin Gurdgievs or the Brian Luceys who are there now.  That is one change since the crash.  They are available now, but they were not then.  They did not feel the need to speak out - or maybe they did not.</p></speech>

Can Mr. Vaughan elaborate on that?  Is it his view that too deferential an approach was taken within the media - that it was not challenging enough?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-25a.674" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Vaughan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015032500002#OO01200"><p>It is not so much that it was deferential.  As I said at the end of my opening statement, there is an alignment of what would have been perceived as authority from all of those institutions, including the IMF.  If the IMF, which has vast experience of looking at economic booms and busts over the years, gave us a clean bill of health in 2006 and 2007, I find it difficult to see how the Deputy could validly or effectively challenge that.  If, in addition to the IMF, one includes the ESRI, the Central Bank, the ECB and the European Commission, it is difficult to see how any newspaper, especially a general newspaper such as ours, in which we give more coverage to sport than to business, can effectively challenge that.</p></speech>

Is there a policy, from an editorial perspective, on the acceptance of hospitality and gifts by journalists from people who may be the subject of their writing, whether it be those in financial institutions or those in the property industry?  Is there a company-wide policy for people who are involved in journalistic output to maintain their absolute independence and integrity?</p></speech>

The <i>Irish Examiner</i>is a member of the Press Council.  Principle 8 of the NUJ's Code of Conduct states that a journalist &quot;[r]esists threats or any other inducements to influence, distort or suppress information and takes no unfair personal advantage of information gained in the course of her/his duties...&quot;.  We do not have a written policy, but it is there.  There is the ethos of the newspaper, which goes back as long as I have been with it.  A journalist might get a bottle of wine or something like that at Christmas, or perhaps it might include lunch.  I was once taken to lunch by the Irish Bankers' Federation to persuade me to stop me eating at the banks, but I do not think the lunch was very successful from that point of view.  There is no such thing as taking gifts apart from what I would say is normal corporate-type Christmas stuff.</p></speech>

Before we move on, I wish to put a question to both witnesses.  During the expansionary period, or bubble period, between 2000 and 2007, did either of the witnesses ever sit down with their counterparts in any of the other major media, such as newspapers and radio and television broadcasters, to discuss the property market explicitly either in terms of advantages to be made commercially or concerns they may have had?</p></speech>

It might come as a surprise to some people that editors rarely, if ever, talk to each other.  Newspapers do not co-operate.  There is very little co-operation.  In fact, I think the only time in my 14 years as editor of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>that all the newspaper editors were in one room was when the Press Council was being established and launched, and even then there were some editors who wished they were not in the same room as some other editors.  It does not happen.</p></speech>

On one occasion, a reporter was asked how much it would cost to keep a court case out of the newspaper, which is not an unusual request.  The answer was quite clear: &quot;It would cost me my job.&quot;  There is a very strong ethical sense in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>.</p></speech>

The function of the newspaper, as I see it, is to report the facts on events.  We give them context and provide analysis of the same events or different events, and we open our columns to diverse opinion, opinion that I might or might not disagree with.  Sometimes I disagree strongly with it.  We must have opinion, but it should be informed opinion.</p></speech>

I wish to ask Mr. Vaughan about the written opening statement he gave to the committee.

They may be unhappy with the position of the advertisement in the newspaper, they may be unhappy with wording of it, they may be unhappy with some editorial coverage relating to it, they may be unhappy that they did not get an adequate or appropriate response to the advert or they did not get the price they sought.  It may be the case that they would threaten to withdraw their advertising.  I come back to my earlier point that people typically do not advertise for the newspaper's benefit.  They advertise for their own benefit, a mutually beneficial transaction.</p></speech>

The importance of this might not be appreciated.  There is a commercial imperative.  One has to stay in business and make a profit, but I enjoy that privilege.  The same pressures which might apply elsewhere do not apply.  I do not come under that pressure.  Advertisers might be unhappy or other people might be unhappy.  Every day there is somebody unhappy with something that appears in the newspaper.  That is part of the business, but you do what you do and hold the editorial line.</p></speech>

Based on the testimony of other witnesses and evidence laid before the inquiry, there seems to be a general acceptance that Ireland is a house-purchasing nation.  Before, during and after the crisis, we continued to be a nation in which the most desirable type of accommodation for the majority of people was a purchased home.  During the 2002 to 2007 period we saw massive increases in the cost of homes, with properties that once cost two to three times the average industrial wage going up to eight or nine times that wage.  Property affordability was such that mortgage terms grew from an average of 20 to 35 years and so forth.  Newspapers such as the <i>Irish Examiner</i>were reporting this dynamic because, as Deputy Murphy said, that was the type of thing that people walking down Patrick Street were discussing.  What is Mr. Vaughan's view of the impact, if any, of the reporting of increasing house prices during the pre-crisis period from 2002 to 2007, as carried in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>and other mainstream news titles, and the concept of the housing ladder?  Was the presentation of what was happening in the housing market adding to the frenzy and encouraging people to purchase now, because if they did not do so they would not be able to afford to later on?</p></speech>

Speaking on behalf of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, I would say that buying a house is very personal choice and we would never have encouraged people to buy.  Obviously we carried property advertising, but I do not think we contributed to the frenzy to which the Chairman referred.</p></speech>

The <i>Irish Examiner</i>does not produce those publications either.  Could Mr. Vaughan outline why it does not?</p></speech>

He also said that it is cheaper and easier for a news organisation to send somebody down to the D&aacute;il to talk to a politician than to investigate what is happening in rural Ireland because it is more expensive.  He obviously does not know what we do because I had my special correspondent doing exactly that for a week or ten days, looking at the state of rural Ireland.  We do it all the time.  I think we seem to have missed his radar.</p></speech>

Mr. Vaughan has expressed his view that it is not a homogenous sector but that employment levels are greatly lower than in the PR sector.  Does he agree with Mr. Browne's assertion that PR officers in general control the agenda of the media?  He asserted that because of the ability to deny access for interviews and a number of other factors which in effect mean they have a great deal of control, at least, of the media agenda.</p></speech>

I would agree that it is an industry that has mushroomed.  It is highly paid, highly lucrative, and presents a greater challenge to journalism than heretofore.  There is a protective layer around much of the corporate world by PR companies.  Journalists have to go through them to get information but a good journalist will always find ways around that and they will not accept the PR line, at least in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>.</p></speech>

He says on page 4, "Advertising in the property section was an important and valued source of revenue during the Celtic tiger years ... but it is important to stress that [it] did not seek to influence the editorial policy of the newspaper".  That is Mr. Vaughan's quote.  Before political parties had strict limits put on the amounts of money they could receive, developers, beef barons, banks, and corporate donors gave substantial sums of money to political parties and sometimes to leading members of those parties who always loudly protested that this had no influence whatsoever on the policies they promulgated or whose interests they advanced.  It is true to say that very few people in Ireland believed them.  Should they believe the media when they make a similar claim?  When millions of euro are coming in from developers, for example, for property supplements, is it likely that one of those major developers would be challenged seriously on an issue?</p></speech>

As my colleague, Mr. Murphy, outlined, the proportionality of property advertising in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>was not of the magnitude that some people might have thought.  It was not at 50% or 60% where people might think there might be more pressure.  I have never come under pressure from a property developer.  There were some issues in relation to an editorial but I do not agree with the view that money can influence the editorial in our newspaper.</p></speech>

That doesn't mean reporters consciously avoid writing bad news stories, but it's hard to run against the tide when everyone is getting rich.</blockquote>Does Mr. Vaughan recognise that as an influence?</p></speech>

Did Mr. Vaughan ever consider launching a major project of investigative journalism to expose the level of profiteering that was going on behind that to investigate, for example, who was buying the land and then selling it a few years later for massive gains, how that affected the prices of the homes that were built on it and the detrimental social effect that would have on the people who were buying?

Mr. David McWilliams was giving very informed opinion on his views of the way the economy would go from 2001.  That did not become a fact until after the crash.

It has underlined, if ever it needed to be, the importance of investigative journalism.  There are some changes that will be beneficial going forward.  For example, the Central Bank of Ireland was not under the Freedom of Information Act at the time and that is an important development.  We focused on property largely for purchase during those years and perhaps we should have looked more robustly at, and campaigned for improvements to, legislation governing rental accommodation.  The whole issue of social housing policy went a bit under the radar as well and it should be addressed.</p></speech>
