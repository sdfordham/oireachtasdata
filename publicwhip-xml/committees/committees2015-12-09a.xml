This meeting is convened for the purpose of consideration of the Horse Racing Ireland Bill 2015.  I welcome the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, and his officials this morning.  A grouping list has been circulated to members and I propose that we proceed with those groupings and take them as they arise and then section by section, in the normal way members deal with Committee Stage.</p></speech>

For the information of Deputies Ferris and &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, amendments Nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 23, 62 and 63 are all out of order.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2015120900002#B00700"><p>As this section is meant to define the Bill, I cannot understand why harness racing would not be defined as part of horse racing.  I do not understand why the amendment can be ruled completely out of order and not even permitted to be discussed.  It does not augur well for the efforts made in recent months by the joint committee in meeting representatives of harness racing and with Horse Racing Ireland that an attempt to define harness racing as racing is not being accepted.  I cannot find a reason for this and I ask the Chairman to explain this to me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2015120900002#B00800"><p>The effort here is to try to find out what is horse racing.  Some members are curious as to why the definition of horse racing cannot include harness racing, because anyone who ever has been involved in organising video horse races for charity will have seen films of harness racing in America.  Members seek an explanation as to the reason the fact of pulling a small vehicle behind the horse eliminates it from being horse racing.  If it is not allowed under the Bill, that is fine because members will bring up the issue again next week and can approach in another way.  However, I am a little puzzled because, for instance, flat racing is allowed, and that is straightforward because it is pure, in that X number of horses start at one point and finish at another.  In addition, horses are allowed to jump over jumps.  However, what is being indicated here is that for some reason it is not horse racing if the rider sits in a small vehicle as opposed to on the back of the horse.  That is what the disallowance of these amendments appears to be stating.  Can members get a more detailed explanation from whomever - I do not know who it is - disallows amendments?</p></speech>

This is not about the vehicle but about the horse.  As I understand it, the type of horse used is a non-thoroughbred horse and, in its inception, the Horse Racing Ireland Bill pertains to the thoroughbred industry.</p></speech>

This is not really relevant to the Minister because he did not disallow it.  Who decides on disallowances?</p></speech>

These amendments seek to broaden the definition of horse racing to include non-thoroughbred horses and thus provide that other sporting disciplines, such as harness racing, be recognised as horse racing.  The Minister should note that the committee is undertaking work on this issue, through which it perhaps is a little more than halfway.  Representatives of Horse Sport Ireland, HSI, and Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, will appear before the joint committee next week.  I do not wish to delay the meeting on-----</p></speech>

Were Members to table an amendment on Report Stage to the effect that horse racing need not be done by thoroughbred horses, would that then be allowed?  Would it then be necessary to allow harness racing?  Is it possible to get advice from the Bills Office as to whether this would be possible?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2015120900002#B01700"><p>First, the disallowing of the amendments had nothing to do with my office.</p><p>I understand a decision was made by the Bills Office that the understood definition of horse racing involved a horse and a rider, and there may have been some issues around thoroughbreds and non-thoroughbreds.  Either way, the office ruled it out of order.  I have said before that I am sympathetic and am trying to be helpful to the work of the committee in its attempts to examine the regulation, management and structure of harness racing in Ireland and to build an industry around the sport.  It makes a lot of sense to me on a series of different levels, including regulation and animal welfare.  This is a successful sport and an industry in other countries.  I do not see why we cannot do something similar here.  However, I understand what the Bills Office has done here.  This Bill is specific to Horse Racing Ireland and is being introduced to deal with an existing structure and industry to try to improve transparency following the recommendations of a report into the industry.  I am more than happy to consider a similar report into the potential of the harness racing industry, get consultants to look at it and respond to the questions and aspirations raised here in order to progress it properly, but I do not think the way to achieve what the committee wants is to force it into a Bill.  According to the Bills Office, it cannot be done that way anyway.  If it is to be done, let it be done properly.  Let us consider how the appropriate governance and regulatory bodies would work to promote integrity and to ensure the correct systems are in place for drug testing, welfare management, licensing and so on.  Much of that structure is there already, but decisions are needed on how funding should be made available to the sport and at what level.  It needs to be balanced against all of the other sport horse sectors within the overall horse industry in Ireland, which is a huge sector.  I am happy to have an open conversation and work with the committee.  We are happy to put some money into a report, but I do not believe we can have a prolonged conversation in the context of this Bill, given the decision made by the Bills Office.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2015120900002#C00200"><p>We have a draft report that needs further input because of a request from representatives of the harness racing industry to come before the committee.  As a result, the report has been delayed until after we meet Harness Racing Ireland and Horse Sport Ireland next week.  In good faith, the committee should try to get that completed and over to the Minister's office and to the Department so that it can perhaps form a basis for another Bill, but I do not want to delay the proceedings today.</p></speech>

It is a major step in the right direction.  We will prepare a report over the Christmas period and, please God, we will publish it before the banking inquiry report.  I take it that the D&aacute;il will continue sitting until the banking inquiry report is completed, so we will have until the end of January 2016.  I presume that whoever is in the Minister's shoes after the election will be able to take up where the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has left off and will take on board his sensible approach to how this should be progressed.  On that basis, the amendments have achieved their purpose.</p></speech>

One of reasons this legislation is being introduced is that we asked Indecon to report on the industry, its structure and its governance, and Indecon made some pretty clear recommendations about the composition of the board.  One of those recommendations was to reduce the representation of the racing regulatory body from five to three members and to put in place three public interest board members, one of whom would be a representative of the horse racing industry in Northern Ireland.  They would be ministerial appointments.  At the moment it is a large board and the only ministerial appointment is the chairman.  This composition was felt to be a weakness and not in the public interest.  This body spends very large amount of public money - the guts of &euro;60 million per year - and the idea that there would be no one on the board with a public interest role other than the chairman appointed by a Minister was seen as a weakness by Indecon, so it proposed the change.  I have had many meetings with the Turf Club.  This piece of legislation has allowed an honest discussion and the Turf Club has not been happy with some of the things the Bill is trying to do.  There have been a lot of compromises.  Not all of Indecon's recommendations have been accepted, but the change to the board nominations is one that will be accepted.  The Turf Club has not raised this with me as an issue.  It may have raised it with Deputy Ferris but not with me.</p><p>We are trying to rebalance the board and ensure that, as a body that manages such a large amount of public money each year, it includes an appropriate number of public interest members, if one likes, one of whom will be from Northern Ireland.  I am proposing to make the change recommended by Indecon.  While I understand where the Deputy is coming from, the purpose of the Bill is to make changes and improvements, as opposed to maintaining the <i>status quo</i>. </p></speech>

I enjoy point-to-point racing more than anything.  The Minister has made clear to all the relevant parties that he does not propose to interfere with point-to-point racing, other than by providing that Horse Racing Ireland will collect moneys that will be subsequently returned through the racing regulatory body.</p> <p>  One of my great friends, who was involved with his wife in point-to-point racing, died last week.  The Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee plays an important role in this aspect of racing and must be allowed to continue to issue and register hunt certificates.  Regulations are in place for point-to-point steeplechase meetings.  Hunt certificates are issued by the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee and these are certified by the master of the hunt.  I have done this myself and it is necessary to provide various documents, including registration papers for the horse.  Subscription fees are also paid to the hunt.  The certificate is issued and only registered by the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee when it has carried out the relevant integrity checks, for example, with regard to passports, flu vaccinations, horses' qualifications under point-to-point regulations, identification of the horse owner, handler and so forth.  The issuing of the certificate is an integrity issue.  A problem does not arise with the Minister's proposal to ensure full transparency with regard to money.  Various proposals have been made regarding ways to collect the money, including online.  I am not very well informed on these matters, however.  </p> <p>  I have never doubted the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides.  If he is committed to maintaining the current position, this should include providing for the change I have proposed to the certification process.  This provides for the exclusion from the proposed process of the certifying of hunter certificates.  That would be a simple amendment which would not create a fuss.  It gels with the thrust of what the Minister is intent on achieving, namely, ensuring pont-to-point racing remains within the ambit of the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee.  I hope he will see fit to accept it because while it is not earth-shattering, it is important.  </p> <p>  The Bill proposes to substitute section 10 of the original Act with a new section.  It follows that section 10-----</p></speech>

I understand the thinking behind these amendments and the Minister is also aware of concerns raised about this matter.  He assured us in discussions that the proposed changes in this regard are a paper exercise, as it were.  Given that the Minister will not always be in that office, we must safeguard against what future Ministers could do.</p></speech>

I have discussed this matter with various people who are passionate about point-to-point racing.  I have also been to many point-to-point races and I spent a great deal of time around horses when I was growing up.  We are not changing the structure of point-to-point racing, which is a success story. The system works and the sport is predominately run by volunteers in local hunt clubs, which feed into a national steeplechase committee.  We are not attempting to change any of the structures for making decisions on fixtures, the management of local events and so forth.  What we are trying to do across the industry is to have more transparency in terms of how money is raised and spent.  We are trying to create a concept of a single portal whereby all the money comes into one efficiently run office controlled by Horse Racing Ireland because it is answerable to me, the Oireachtas, including the joint committee, and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The only change and the only area in which HRI will become involved is that it will assume responsibility for the registration process for hunter certificates, as advocated in the Smith &amp;amp; Williamson report.  I sometimes refer to it as the Smith &amp;amp; Wesson report, which may be because I also have responsibility for defence.  This change was recommended in the report as a means of achieving a more efficient administrative structure and cost savings.</p> <p>  Deputy Penrose's concern is shared by others.  The role of the local hunt club will remain the same.  The only change is to the office to which cheques are sent, which will be a central administrative office.  Rather than having two offices, one operated by the Turf Club and a second one operated by Horse Racing Ireland, which are located within a few hundred metres of each other, we are seeking to introduce one administrative function.  That is the only change.  Everything else remains the same.  </p> <p>  Another of my amendments will, I hope, provide some reassurance.  Amendment No. 44 is a better way of achieving the objective sought by Deputy Penrose.  It amends the section on the rules of racing.</p><p>We propose to change that to state: "to maintain the existing nature of point-to-point steeplechases including making and enforcing the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Regulations for point-to-point steeplechase as made by the Stewards of the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee."  We are trying to reinforce the point that this is the committee which sets the regulations and controls the sector.  Deputy Penrose is talking about making a regulation, but this is amending the general functions of HRI.  The change proposed by the Deputy refers to the broader roles of HRI across racing as a whole.</p><p> HRI has some role in point-to-point racing.  It provides prize money, controls bookmaking activities and pays for the integrity services that are provided by the Turf Club.  The existing role that HRI provides or supports in point-to-point racing will not change.  The core management system, functioning and structure, and success, of point-to-point racing is not being undermined by anything we are doing here.  It is simply an administrative function that we are looking to change, moving from having two offices to having one office.  That is it.</p><p> I reassure anybody listening who is passionate about point-to-point racing and who thinks we are somehow undermining it in the Bill that nothing could be further from the truth.  We are trying to ensure that the racing sector as a whole, including point-to-point racing, is strengthened and that there are transparency and modern management structures in place so that we can fully account for and stand over the way in which money is raised, managed and allocated.  In fact, the funding stream stays the same.  The money automatically goes from that administrative office back into the Turf Club anyway, and that is guaranteed later on.  One will see strong language in that regard.  This is nothing more or less than an administrative efficiency issue.</p><p> I intend to deal with the points Deputy Penrose seeks to make in his amendment in my amendment No. 44 because my advice is that we can deal with it more comprehensively there.  I have met the Turf Club and interests from the point-to-point racing sector about this and we will deal with the concerns in the amendment.</p></speech>

Otherwise, the game goes dead.</p> <p>  I accept the bona fides of the Minister in what he is trying to achieve.  Let us start with that, but as a barrister I am not completely convinced that what is contained in amendment No. 44 can override what is contained in section 5, which is the new section 10(1) and (2)(a).  I ask that legal advice, perhaps from the Attorney General, be sought on this.</p> <p>  In this regard, there is confusion - I am not saying the Minister's officials are confused but the whole place might be confused - because issuing and certification are different functions.  The national hunt committee issues a certificate, the master of the hunt certifies it and then it goes back for certification by the national hunt committee.</p></speech>

All that is changing here is that when one registers a hunter for point-to-point racing, one sends the cheque to the administrative office.  We are now asking it to do all the administration from an efficiency point of view.  Everything else stays as it is in terms of local hunt clubs going out and visiting, ensuring that everything is done appropriately, etc., and giving the certification that goes with that.</p> <p>  My understanding of what we are doing is that when one registers the horse as a hunter, instead of sending one's cheque to the Turf Club, one sends it to this single administrative office.  This is really about efficiency, because the money automatically goes back to the Turf Club as it would have.  This is almost like an outsourcing to a new administrative office so that we have a single office for registration across racing for all horses.  That was a strong recommendation from Smith and Williamson and it merely makes sensible efficiencies.</p> <p>  The initial discussion was whether HRI should be involved in a more active way in the scheduling of point-to-point racing, but we scrapped all of that because of arguments that Deputies Martin Heydon, Martin Ferris and Willie Penrose were making that racegoers think that point-to-point racing works.  The Deputies did not want to change that structure.  Such racing is run by local hunt clubs which are made up of members who are strong and passionate about what they do.  As a result, we are not changing any of that and we are simply now focusing on the administrative processing and achieving greater efficiency in that system.  That is the intent.</p> <p>  If, as a barrister, Deputy Penrose is saying that the wording we propose is not consistent with that, I want to hear about it and we will get advice from the Parliamentary Counsel to reflect it.  However, I want to be clear about my intention here.  We want to support strongly the current structures for point-to-point racing because they work but we also want to ensure that the changes we are making right across the Bill are about sensible management, efficiencies and administration.  The only relevance to the point-to-point racing sector contained in the Bill is the registration of hunters in terms of getting the hunter certificates.</p></speech>

That is fairly powerful stuff.  The Minister is saying that amendment No. 44, for want of a better word, overrides the governance aspect.  I am concerned about that, and I must be honest with the Minister.</p> <p>  No doubt the Minister has a good understanding of it but not everybody has an understanding of it, and this is the problem.  There are two or three steps in it and everything is grand until somebody from HRI comes down on one of the point-to-point races or calls up to state the HRI's understanding of it when the matter is laid down in law.</p> <p>  I cannot understand for the life of me why "certifying" rather than "issuing" cannot be included in the Bill.

The section dealing with the rules of racing, which, essentially, are the functions of the racing regulatory body, is the section in which we are putting the reinforcing language on point-to-point racing.

Following the advice of both Indecon and Smith and Williamson, we are trying to provide a single office whereby cheques and moneys come in and flow out to the various different parts of racing thus providing more transparency and efficiency.  To delete a section and say that one seeks to provide a single structure for the administration and financial management of the Irish horse racing industry undermines the thrust of what we are trying to do.  Again, having spoken to a lot of people, most people have settled in their minds what we are trying to do here and they are happy enough with it.  There is strong language in our own amendments to reinforce the message that the money that was coming in for the Turf Club, in the past directly, is now coming through a single administrative office and that will continue to come into the Turf Club without undue delay.  We have used strong language to describe the matter which we will debate later.  I cannot accept the amendment as there is an explicit provision later in legislation which reinforces the independence of the Racing Regulatory Body.  In many ways it strengthens the body's independence when compared with the present situation.  The body has primary legislation which forms the basis for its independence in law.  This legislation strengthens the Racing Regulatory Body.  It separates the body from the HRI in terms of function and reliance.  It gives the body independence in terms of providing integrity services for the industry.  I do not see how having a sensible and efficient administrative office dealing with registration and payments would undermine that situation and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

Several people working in the industry have concerns about this aspect and that is why I tabled my amendment.  It does not augur well if there is a suggestion that the confidence or whatever of the body will be undermined.  I  withdraw my amendment.</p></speech>

The concern of the Turf Club, if we are honest, was that by having a collection agency within the HRI that somehow HRI could hold on to that money for a period and use it as influence over the Turf Club or something like that which would be a totally unacceptable situation.  My amendment No. 47 reads: "after &ldquo;pay&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, without undue delay or any set off, counterclaim or deduction,&rdquo; which is language that came from the Turf Club and we were happy enough with such language.  My amendment deals with the issue that Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has raised which is a legitimate issue that we want resolved.  Amendment No. 47 deals with the matter and uses language that we have discussed with the Turf Club which I hope that he can accept.</p> <p>  In terms of amendment No. 15, I reiterate that we are streamlining the income stream of the HRI and the Racing Regulatory Body only.  Other income streams in horse racing will not be affected by these provisions.  In addition, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 16.</p> <p>  Obviously it is up to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v but I suggest that I have dealt with the thrust and purpose of his amendment in amendment No. 47.

We have debated certification already but my amendment would put the issue beyond doubt.  It would clarify and make sure that everybody understands their roles.  On line 19, it states &quot;including the registration of hunter certificates&quot; which means the activity will now be given to the HRI which is part of the problem.  Point-to-point steeplechase regulations stipulate that hunter certificates must be issued by the relevant Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee, INHSC.  The master of the hunt certifies the application and then it goes back to the INHSC which registers the hunter.  That function has been taken away from the committee.  Let me outline my problem with the Bill.  On page 9, line 16, it reads:</p><blockquote>(b) the provision of registry office services including the following activities&mdash;(i) naming of horses,</blockquote> <p>which is grand but the provision continues:</p><blockquote>the issuing of horseracing passports and registration of matters relating to racehorses, including the registration of hunter certificates.</blockquote></speech>

That is why I was hoping the issuing and certification of the hunter certificates would be dealt with in the way I asked the Minister to deal with it.  Perhaps the Minister would review the issue with a view to accommodating what we are trying to achieve.  I think there is some misunderstanding of the roles.  They are very finite and very technical.  One might say it is the one body that is doing everything.  It starts with X, goes down to Y and goes back up to Z within the one body.  I ask the Minister to consider it.</p></speech>

The issuing of the certifications stays with the local hunt club.  The registration of a hunter, in the first place, is a separate issue.  That is what goes nationally at the moment into the turf club offices and will simply go to this new administrative office.  All of the existing functions of local hunt clubs stay the same.  Whether we use the language "issuing" or "certifying" is a matter for legitimate discussion.  I will use the wording to achieve the outcome we both want to achieve.

The registration office functions have moved to HRI and are governed by both HRI directives and the rules of racing.  To insert the wording proposed is incorrect and would not reflect the situation post-2001.  In other words, what is being proposed essentially switches power back in a way that reverses the thrust and decision and legislation in 2001 so I do not propose to accept the amendment.  If accepted, it would mean that the turf club would be the regulatory body for the office that is managing the charges, the collection of licence fees and so on.  Obviously, that needs to be done in a way that complements the rules of racing but essentially that body has to be answerable to the Comptroller and Auditor General and to the Oireachtas.  The turf club has a role but it is not the regulatory body.  If one was to insert the words "in accordance with the rules of racing" it would become the regulatory body for that administrative function.  I do not think that is what we are looking for here.  I understand that this office needs to be run in a way that is consistent and complements the rules of racing as opposed to anything else.  I think the wording proposed potentially goes too far so I am not proposing to accept it.</p></speech>

We got into this argument previously.  It might be a bit Jesuitical but it is important.  This is extremely important for the local committees.  I agree the services should exclude the issuing and registration of hunter certificates.  Leaving the registration of hunter certificates with the HRI is not consistent with the tone and tenor of the statements the Minister has made here and I accept them.  It is a matter of wording and it may be a matter of understanding the particular functions.  The issuing of the certificate goes first to the person, then to the master of the hunt and then back to the INHS committee as the Minister said.  I was hoping that process would remain the same notwithstanding that HRI has all the other functions.  I want to recognise the important role the tremendous activists in the point-to-point steeplechase area have played and the service they have given.  We should not denude them of something to say we have achieved a big centralisation pot.  Centralisation is not the panacea for everything.  There are lots of things about centralisation that we wish we had never done and I do not think we should rush to do it in this regard.  I urge the Minister to look at this issue again.</p></speech>

None of the payments going to local hunt clubs at the moment is changed.  The only thing that has changed is that the registration of a hunter that would have gone to the national hunt committee is going to the new administrative office and then going back to the national committee.  It is an administrative issue.  None of the payments that would have been going to local hunt clubs is being taken away from them and their role is not being changed or undermined.  The issuing of certificates still stays with the local hunt club.</p><p>Instead of going to the national hunt committee, the registration of a hunter certificate will now go to this new administrative office which then pays the national hunt committee.  The provision is part of the process of streamlining the functions of Horse Racing Ireland and the racing regulatory body.  The amendment, as proposed, would return the registration of hunter certificates to the racing regulatory body, which is what we are trying to change for the purposes of efficiency in administration.  I cannot accept the amendment.</p><p> We will look at the other matter concerning issuing, certifying and so on to ensure we get the right language to protect the local hunt clubs which, I understand, is the main concern of Deputies.  If we were to accept the amendment, essentially we would be doing nothing and there would be no change.  We would simply be leaving it as it was in terms of the registration and associated administration.  This is precisely what we are trying to bring some efficiency to.</p></speech>

We are trying to clarify what &quot;consultation&quot; means.  Does it mean a person or body has to get approval or does it mean that they simply have to consult?  Before I make decisions I consult all manner of people but certain decisions rest with me at the end of the day.  Those in Horse Racing Ireland need clarity on the level of consultation they must have before making a decision.  Obviously, the racing regulatory body also sought to understand what level of consultation would be involved or what &quot;consultation&quot; means in terms of interaction with HRI when it comes to making changes in the rules of racing.  The wording we have put in place is, &quot;HRI may dispense with such consultation where it considers there is an urgency to make the directive and shall inform the Racing Regulatory Body accordingly.&quot;  The inverse language applies as well.  In other words, if those in the racing regulatory body need to change the rules because of something urgent, they can do so.  In normal circumstances they would be expected to consult to ensure the process works.  However, if they have to make a decision, they can get on with it and make it happen quickly.  The same applies for those in HRI if there is some crisis that needs to be dealt with.</p></speech>

I do not see the logic in that.  The race fixing committee is made up of officials from HRI.  It is an independent group, albeit made up of HRI members.  If the committee has a view on a matter, it can be overturned by the HRI board.  I do not see the merit in it.  I am recommending the text &quot;shall be bound by any recommendation&quot;.</p></speech>

I will set out the explanation I have and perhaps elaborate on it a little.  The legislation ensures all interests of the horse racing industry are represented on the board of HRI.  Setting horse racing fixtures is one of the primary functions of HRI and final decisions in this regard need to be ratified by the board.  I am seeking to ensure consensus and cannot accept this amendment because it undermines the inclusivity I seek in respect of horse racing in Ireland.  What we are saying is that the fixtures committee is essentially a sub-committee of HRI.  A sub-committee cannot dictate to the overall committee.  It is a little like the set-up in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The main board makes the final decision at the end of the day, regardless of the recommendation coming through.  Normally, the board will follow it, and in practically every instance the recommendation from the fixtures committee will, I expect, be endorsed by the overall board.  However, there may be some reason in the broader interests of the industry for the board to take a different view.  At that point, I believe we should accept that the board of HRI is legally responsible for standing over the decisions it makes.  This issue will arise in other cases as well.  The sub-committees feed into the board and make recommendations.  However, the HRI board is the only body that has full representation of the entire industry and its interests.  The board will get recommendations from sub-committees, but those recommendations cannot be binding.  If they were, we could have a bizarre situation whereby the fixtures committee would be forcing the board of HRI into a position where it has no wish to be in the interests of the industry.  One would have to think of very unusual circumstances where that could be allowed to happen.  Ultimately, we are appointing a board that is representative of the entire sector with ministerial appointments and a chairperson.  The board will be answerable to the Oireachtas and the Comptroller and Auditor General and so on.  Essentially, the buck stops there and the members of the board must have the final say.</p> <p>  I understand the point Deputy Ferris is making.  He is suggesting that if the race fixtures committee makes recommendations, because it has examined the issue in detail and so on, these recommendations should be binding.  However, let us consider the governance structure around boards and sub-committees in any semi-State or State agencies, for example, Bord Bia.  Bord Bia has multiple boards feeding in and making recommendations to the board itself.  Ultimately, however, the buck stops with the chairman and the chief executive when it comes to making decisions.  That is what we need in this case as well.  It is a standard governance model that works.</p></speech>

The people who are charged with the responsibility are on the fixtures committee.  One would assume they have a hands-on approach and that their recommendations should be binding.  People sitting on boards are usually divorced from the reality in many instances.</p><p>People who sit on boards can, for political or other reasons, use their influence to undermine the committees they have put in place.  The people who are charged with the responsibility should be the ones whose recommendations are binding.  I will withdraw the amendment and revert to it later.</p></speech>

It is a recommendation body and works closely with the board.  This is not a case of the board sitting on high above the race fixtures committee, which understands what is happening on the ground.  It is the opposite.  They interact with each other.  The committee advises the board on finalising decisions for fixtures.  I am unaware of any incident in which the HRI board disagreed with the race fixtures committee.  They work hand in hand.  This is about ensuring a focus group feeds into HRI to ensure the fixtures are right.  Were the situation different, I would understand the Deputy.  If there was a prawn sandwich brigade making decisions on fixtures and ignoring the people on the ground, that would be one thing, but that is not how this structure works.  It cannot work like that because of the way it is designed under this legislation.</p></speech>

While that is grand, I do not understand why the membership of the race fixtures committee should be limited to members of HRI.  Section 19(3) of the 1994 Act reads, &quot;The membership of the race fixtures committee referred to in <i>paragraphs (b)</i>to <i>(d)</i>of <i>subsection (2)</i>may include persons who are not members of the Authority.&quot;  Deputy Ferris has tabled a worthwhile amendment on this important matter.  We must reflect upon it.  The committee will have a limited gene pool.  The Association of Irish Racehorse Owners, AIRO, will have members on the HRI board, so they could be on everything, including the race fixtures committee.  The association could have two, three, four or five people involved.  They have a good level of expertise across various areas, so there would be a lot of work involved.</p><p>In July 2014 or whenever it was, we had a good debate and I did not believe that the Minister would propose this provision.  Currently, owners are represented on the race fixtures committee.  I do not understand why their involvement is being limited to only one person.  What if they want to put forward someone else who has relevant expertise?  There is much involved in the race fixtures committee and it is not as simple as the Minister claims.  I have seen some stuff coming from HRI to the small racecourses that I was not impressed by.  I will discuss that with the Minister.</p><p>Demands are being made everywhere, for example, for a great deal of money.  My main crib with HRI is that the State is providing it with money, the guts of &euro;60 million.  That is grand, well done and we are getting good value for it, but HRI is not very good at raising its own money.  It raises money from racetracks.  According to letters I have received, if a course does not have &euro;3,500 in sponsorship for a race, it will be moved out of prime time.  I take grave umbrage at this type of language.</p><p>Be that as it may, this is why the section is important.  The race fixtures committee deals with the eligibility of horses that run in races.  This provision is too restrictive.  Racehorse owners used to have two representatives on that committee.  It has always been an active and vibrant committee.  Anyone selected to it has the necessary expertise.  People would not be members otherwise.  It has many functions in terms of performance criteria at racecourses and so forth.  I would like to think that the committee's membership would not just be confined to the HRI board and that if someone wanted to nominate someone else in his or her stead who had the expertise, it would be allowed.</p><p>I am raising this matter now because I failed to table an amendment to that effect, although I wanted to.  I concentrated so much on media rights that I nearly forgot this.  The Minister should consider this amendment.  There is nothing to be lost.  It would not be earth shattering in terms of the overall structure.  We should not confine committee membership to HRI.  Board members would deal with everything then.  Deputy Ferris was right in that there will never be any disagreement.  The board members are on the committee that sends a matter back to the board.  D&uacute;irt bean liom go nd&uacute;irt bean l&eacute;i, that is grand and away we go.  We should widen the membership and not be afraid of the additional expertise of, for example, the owners.</p></speech>

HRI has a large board with a broad representation.  There will be three members from the Turf Club and breeders, owners, trainers, stable staff and the betting industry will be represented.  My role as Minister will be to try to fill knowledge gaps or add more to the board.  It is a large board, larger than I would have liked.  Indecon's recommendation was for something smaller.</p> <p>  Any good board sets up a sub-committee within the board to advise it on certain matters.  That is how these situations work.  The board, which has a broad representation, sets up a fixtures committee comprising people from that board with appropriate skill sets and tells them to consider fixtures and revert with recommendations.  We are not discussing an outside body setting fixtures that needs the approval of HRI.  We are discussing HRI board members doing the jobs they are nominated and appointed to do, those being, administering horse racing and providing efficiencies, transparency, accountability and so on.  They are answerable for these to the Oireachtas, the Comptroller and Auditor General and elsewhere.  Deputy Penrose is right in that a major part of that role is setting fixtures, as these determine much in terms of sponsorship, media rights, when in the season races are run, which has an impact on horses' training profiles, and so on.</p><p>It is a contentious area, but I want somebody who is answerable if they make a mistake, so that I get the reasoning behind how we schedule racing and when we put together events like champions weekend and so on.  It involves a very significant amount of public money in terms of prize money and so on.  I want to be able to talk to the chair of HRI and ask him or her to explain to me the thinking behind various decisions.  I want people to understand in a practical sense that HRI, as a board, has responsibility for all these things.  One of the big responsibilities it has is race fixtures, because-----</p></speech>

It is not the case that we have an isolated satellite body that is working on fixtures.  It is really a subcommittee that is set up by the board with appropriate people on it who have relevant knowledge.  It makes recommendations to the larger board, which ultimately holds the responsibility.  That seems a fairly good governance structure and it is a fairly standard one, across a whole series of other areas.  If we deviate from that and have one or two outsiders coming in, to whom are they answerable?  They are not answerable to me.</p></speech>

When we look at the likes of jockeys and qualified riders, there are people other than stable staff employed in the horse racing industry.  What about trade unions?  Is there any avenue for somebody from a trade union to get on to the board if the constituency is so rigidly determined by HRI?  It depends on the ideological position it adopts or what it tries to pursue or represent and people can be blocked.  Constituencies should be determined by the sectors themselves; let them select that person.  As a board, HRI will have ultimate control over everything anyway, but it should be flexible and open-minded enough to accept somebody from a constituency determined by the services sector.</p></speech>

Some of the comments that have been made here are very reflective of comments one would hear in the industry in general, that HRI is the big baddie, that it is not flexible, it does not listen and it has its own agenda.  That perception is out there in the industry and it has been reflected by some of the comments here this morning.  Surely everything we are doing is about challenging that perception and making the board more accountable.  I accept the Minister's point that we always listen to experts from outside and the grass is greener on the other side, but those experts are not answerable to anybody.  It is not about accepting that there are deficiencies in the board and looking for somebody from outside to fix our problems, but instead having confidence in the people appointed to this board, by the Minister and others, and trusting them to do the job.  They are then answerable for that.  There are safeguards in this because if the Minister of the day is not happy with the decisions made, he or she can ask questions, and HRI is the accountable body that will come before the committee and answer for its actions through its chair.</p></speech>

If, for example, there were multiple representative bodies and they could not agree, what would happen?  Somebody needs to put together a constituency and a mechanism for electing or nominating members of this committee.  The idea of the industry services committee is to identify and improve the requirements of those employed in the industry and represent the interests of such workers.  I was very insistent that we would have a services committee like this, because there are about 14,000 people working in the racing industry in Ireland.  Many of them work incredibly hard and we need to make sure their interests are part of our thinking and of HRI's thinking.  The membership of this committee does not have to comprise HRI members.  This involves people working in the industry, including jockeys, qualified riders, stable staff, and so on.  My concern is that if we do not state that HRI shall determine the constituencies and method of election of members of the industry services committee, then who determines it?</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned jockeys and persons other than stable staff employed in the racing industry.  That is not a problem, but the size of that constituency should be determined by the sector itself.  If Horse Racing Ireland decided to limit it, it has the power to do so.  There is nothing here to prevent it from limiting the services sector and the services sector is bigger than jockeys and stable staff.  There are people who are providing services to racehorse owners and who are members of trade unions.  There are trade unions associated with it.  All of this can be blocked, unless it is left to the sector itself to determine it.  I am quite certain that any sector within Horse Racing Ireland will have the greater good of the industry, from its position, in mind.</p></speech>

That is also a structure that could be influenced by people within the industry who are not part of HRI and who may want to have a strong voice through the services committee.  They may get their way in a manner that is far less transparent.  At least if HRI does this, it has to come before this committee and explain the basis for determining the constituency and the election of members.  It has to stand over it.  If it is blocking somebody out, it will be exposed.  If the industry itself does it, it is not answerable to anybody.  If it would help, I could insert something on Report Stage that would state something like "HRI shall consult widely" before determining the constituencies and method of election.  Something like that might go some way to address what Deputy Ferris is saying, but he should not forget that most of these sectors are represented on the board.  I want to have somebody who can come in here and answer to this committee, or to me on the phone, regarding the basis for deciding the constituencies and method of election, rather than a group of people who are not answerable to anybody except, perhaps, their own representative body.</p></speech>

We proposed that a member of the stable staff should be on the board.  I think that is the reason for the extra board member.  It will be a nominee of the stable staff representative organisation who is accepted by HRI in the first instance.  Is it the case that the sub-committee will have to contain that person in any event?  The Bill provides that "the industry services committee shall [...] [include a representative of] stable staff" who will be the nominated member in this example.  I hope the Minister knows what I am trying to say.  I cannot say too much.  I am just pointing that out.</p></speech>

It is great that there is now a voice for stable staff on the full board of HRI.  Deputy Ferris is talking about the services committee, which will make recommendations to HRI and express concerns on behalf of the services sector in horse racing, etc.  We want to make sure that functions well.  All I am saying is that at the end of the day, somebody has to determine the constituencies so that people can be elected or appointed.  I think HRI is the only body that has the legal accountability to do this.  If it would be helpful, we could require HRI to "consult widely" across the sector before making a determination.  I think that is as far as I can go.  I am willing to look at that in advance of Report Stage.</p></speech>

I think that if we use this legislation to require the owners to have priority status on the board without requiring others to have the same status, it will provide an imbalance.  We have to trust that HRI, as the broad representative body it will be, will make sensible decisions and will answer for those decisions.  That is a fairly consistent theme I am advancing throughout this legislation.  As a publicly accountable body that administers a large amount of money, HRI has to make all sorts of decisions about media rights and fixtures, etc.  I was going to say "fixtures and fittings", so I must be thinking about flooding.  Quite frankly, we need to trust HRI to get on with the job rather than prescribing to it exactly who it should be appointing by picking out and prioritising representative bodies.  While I take the point made by Deputy Ferris, I would be surprised if there was no representative of racehorse owners on this committee.  I think we should trust HRI to make balanced and sensible decisions and to stand over them.</p></speech>

Horse Racing Ireland, HRI is answerable to this committee and will continue to be so.  The important role of the owners also needs to be borne in mind by HRI in everything it does.  The owners fund a very significant portion of everything that happens and are a key constituency.  While I can understand the difficulty with legislating specifically for HRI, in broader terms I think all the members of the joint committee would feel very strongly that the role of owners always needs to be remembered and maintained.  After the horse and greyhound fund, their very valuable input is crucial to all the jobs that are involved in the racing and breeding industry.</p></speech>

Owners buy the horses and pay the entry fees, the trainers' fees and the fees to HRI which first got my attention, and there was a flood of stuff into me about it, which is what got me angry with HRI.  There are people with substantial expertise who are on the owners committee.  I happen to have been an owner myself and was a member of the Association of Irish Racehorse Owners, AIRO.  An owner may not be a board member because of the way the board is set up.  Somebody who goes for election might not be the best Deputy, and the curate could be better than the parish priest.  We may not have the person who is representing the particular owner's interests.  By small owners I mean one and two person set-ups.</p> <p>  I do not understand why what worked in 1994, section 19(3), will not work now.  There was never a complaint; the owners were happy.  Willie Penrose might be the representative on the board but Deputy Martin Heydon might be the best person with the deep, intense, comprehensive knowledge of ownership and all that goes with it - fixtures, sponsorships, courses and all that.  These people go around to all the courses.  They keep those courses going.  If the owner does not have the horse, close down the course.</p> <p>  I know myself from outside of owners that there is intense interest in this amendment.  The Minister would not believe it.  There is a need to ensure it is not restricted and that fixtures do not just have to be by board members.  There is expertise.  Of course the board has to deal with it, but there are going to be some members of the board on this fixture committee.  Outside expertise is what we often get in to help us.</p></speech>

Just to clarify for Deputy Penrose, we have not skipped anything.  We have done everything through the various amendments, with them being moved, withdrawn and so forth.  We are on amendments Nos. 31 and 32 which are being discussed together.  I think the Deputy had already expressed an interest in media rights.</p></speech>

That is the only issue.  The view I have taken so far has been that HRI is responsible and answerable to the joint committee and elsewhere.  It needs to make sensible, balanced decisions and we should trust it to do so rather than prescribe to it who should be on the committee.</p> <p>  I take the point that others have made.  Nothing happens without owners of horses paying the bills.  We are talking about the negotiation and management of media rights, which is a complex area in which we should be raising a lot of money for horse racing in the future.  It requires specific expertise.  This is what will fund a lot of the racetracks throughout Ireland as well as a lot of the prize money and the promotion of racing.  We need five people on the media rights committee who know what they are doing.  Prescribing who those people are or where they come from is a bit of blunt tool for primary legislation.  I would rather have the HRI board members in here and give them a bit of a grilling in terms of the basis for their five appointments to the media rights committee.</p> <p>  It is a slightly different approach.  I do not disagree that owners are very important to the overall mix.  Whether one is an owner or someone with other interests in the racing industry, the most important thing is that we get right the issue of media rights and that we have a committee that makes good recommendations and ensures we are not missing any opportunities.  Ultimately this is an opportunity to raise a lot of money for the sector.  I do not want to get distracted by other issues.  I take the point that people are making, but I would be very surprised if one of the five was not a racehorse owner.  I want to put a bit of faith in HRI to make a balanced decision.</p></speech>

If he cannot imagine HRI not doing it what is wrong with tying it down?  Stranger things have happened.  Bodies can make very strange decisions at times, everyone asks the Minister why he does not do something about it, and the Minister says the Act leaves it to the body to make the sensible decisions.  The sensible thing is to put it in.  It is not conceivable, if the board operates properly, that it would not have a racehorse owner on the committee, so it is not tying it up in any way that is unreasonable.  Therefore it is safer to have it in the legislation just in case some HRI board decided not to put a racehorse owners representative on the committee.</p></speech>

This is probably the most representative board or group of any sector or industry in the country bar none.  It is prescribed in legislation that it has to be that way.  Of a board of 14 people, the Minister appoints only three.  They are probably better qualified to make the decision than we are in terms of media rights.  Sometimes when politicians try to prescribe in primary legislation who should be on what committee or who should be doing what, it may not be the wisest thing to do.  That is all I am saying.  I will have a look at it for Report Stage if the Deputy wants but I want to put a bit of faith in a board to which I am going to be appointing three members plus the chair and on which every other element and stakeholder in the racing industry also has representation.</p></speech>

Deputy Penrose outlined in his very articulate way the issues about the contribution of racehorse owners and what they bring to the industry.  Without them there would be no industry, let us put it that way.  If it were up to the board to nominate somebody, and the Minister says it is inconceivable it would not nominate anybody from the racehorse owners association-----</p></speech>

Does it pick somebody it wants on the board or does it ask the racehorse owners association to nominate somebody?</p><p>That is why reference is made to a body from the Irish racehorse association, which again refers to determination.  It goes back to the Association of Irish Racehorse Owners to determine who represents it, because the amendment would copperfasten the fact that it will know it has somebody on the board.</p></speech>

Ultimately, HRI has a responsibility to put a structure in place that can negotiate the best possible deal for the racing industry for media rights.  The IRFU has to do that for rugby.  It is proposed to put in place a media rights committee, comprising five people who know what they are doing.  My inclination is to trust the board, which ultimately has to stand over any decisions made and deals done and signed off on.  It will have to engage in consultation, something that we will come to later, in terms of racecourse owners.  It is a group of five people who need a certain skill set to get a good job done in a fairly complex area - that is, media rights - which is constantly changing.</p> <p>  I will consider the issue between now and next week when, it is to be hoped, Report Stage will be taken.  We should not prescribe the areas or elements of the sector that the people concerned should come from.</p></speech>

It concerns deals regarding media rights.  In recent years the collective, rather than the individual parts, of the racing industry has become far more valuable.  The Irish racing industry is a powerful negotiating tool in terms of the media because of the standard and quality of racing here.  We need to make sure that we harness that to get the maximum financial value possible out of negotiating media rights collectively.  </p><p>The sector involves racing across multiple different racecourses across the country and it is in the interests of everybody to get the best deal we can.  The allocation of that money once it comes in is a different issue, in terms of who gets it.  Everybody wants to make a case for their priorities and so on.  The current approach towards media rights seems to be working reasonably well.  We are trying to develop a language in the Bill that ensures that everybody who has a stake feels he or she has some involvement in the finalisation of decisions.  </p><p>We propose to insert the following: &quot;[A] contract or arrangement referred to in subsection (1) shall not be made by the media rights committee without the agreement of the board of HRI and representative of executives of authorised racecourse.&quot;  The Association of Irish Racecourses, AIR, is the representative body of racecourses.  We examined the wording and tried to get it right.  I met representatives at a senior level in AIR.  Deputy Penrose has raised issues in this regard and we have tried to develop a language that will ensure everybody feels he or she is part the decision-making process before a final agreement is made by HRI.  This language achieves what we are trying to do.  It means there will not be an agreement of the board of HRI without consultation with the representative body of authorised racecourses.  That ensures it has a say, which it should have, in the final outcome of how media rights are negotiated.  It is to be hoped people will support that.</p><p>Before members get hot under the collar, I will point out that the process will involve a bit more than consultation; it has to agree to it.</p></speech>

This is a very important amendment.  My worry is that the representative body of authorised racecourses includes some very powerful bodies, and the voices of smaller racecourses might be overcome.  I hope that is not the position and that ordinary racecourses have their voices heard.  It is important because property rights and legal issues are involved.</p><p>If something is not done in a fair manner, I would be the first to kick over the traces.  If I had to, I would take a court case on my own for the people involved, because it is very important that the voices of small racecourses are heard.  No one should think there is a free lunch.  From 2001, HRI was clamouring for media rights, and it got them.  Small racecourses are not run on a free <i>gratis</i>basis.  They pay money to HRI for every meeting.  As I said earlier, there is now a demand for more money.  The money may trickle down to racecourses, and it should, particularly the smaller ones that have felt excluded.  </p><p>The Minister has worked hard on the wording and I will seek an assurance from the representative bodies of racecourses that if, for example, there are to be three representatives on a board, one from smaller racecourses should be included.  The owners of racecourses should be properly represented in order to achieve this agreement.  I do not want things being circumscribed by someone who is very intelligent and will try to get around the thrust of what we are trying to achieve today.  </p><p>I read out the percentages at a previous meeting.  Nobody has contradicted them, which means they stand uncorrected.  I was correct.  I spent some time researching the figures.  I said section 10, which deals with the distribution of income from media rights, must be deleted, and I am glad it has been deleted.I wanted a fair shake-up.  Before media rights were an issue, every course was in the same situation, which was very important.  It is the lifeblood of racecourses.  Large racecourses can negotiate major sponsorships and are in the public eye and constantly on television.  Smaller racecourses such as Kilbeggan, Ballinrobe and Roscommon have to scrabble for attention and work hard to try to survive.  I am not ashamed to articulate on behalf of such voices today.  We have done a good day's work.  The Minister is dealing with the issue, which I have acknowledged.  I accept his and his officials' bona fides.  They have worked very hard.  I will now cast my eye wider and make sure the voices of smaller racecourses are heard.</p><p>I thank the Minister very much for listening.</p></speech>

More succinctly, I note that hunter registration has an important integrity role.  That has been overlooked in the debate, although not purposely.  It should continue to be done by the National Hunt committee.  I appeal to the Minister to look at the issue with the parliamentary draftspeople.  I accept that the money will be paid through the HRI at the end of the process and go back.  I have no problem with that.  It will be like a circular board and land back where it was meant to go.  However, I understand the Turf Club made a recommendation to the Minister some weeks ago about the Smith and Williamson recommendation he wants to implement.  The Turf Club says the same thing can be accommodated and achieved while allowing the Irish National Hunt steeplechase, INHS, committee to issue and register hunt certificates and carry out the integrity checks regarding passports, flu vaccinations, the qualifications of horses and verification.  That can all be achieved if the Minister looks at it again.  We have not divided as a committee and are trying to work through this with the best interests of the horse racing industry at heart.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the matter again while accepting that this is a step forward from where the Bill originally started.  I am glad it is there but I appeal to the Minister, strongly and wholeheartedly, in respect of the other aspect of the matters I have raised, particularly the importance of the integrity role hunter registration plays.</p></speech>

I have no problem.  If it is the correct wording, I will change it.  Amendment No. 50 is a minor amendment to the wording that allows HRI to take into consideration the receipts of the racing regulatory body when determining its budget for the year, but it allows it some additional flexibility in this regard where particular needs arise.  We need to show some flexibility in this area.  The racing regulatory body needs to run itself and has some functions outside integrity.  It is a reasonable amendment.</p> <p>  Regarding amendment No. 51, as part of any budget process, likely income and expected expenditure must be calculated in order that the budget can be agreed with HRI.  It would not be prudent to permit deductions from current income for expected future expenditure.  This would be likely to give rise to difficult budget negotiations, if not completely undermine the budgetary process.  It would be wiser to leave the existing budgetary arrangements intact and the only effect of subsection (2) would be that HRI would have information from its receipts which it may use in subsequent budget discussions.</p></speech>

However, we also need to ensure we maintain appreciative independent functions for the Turf Club in order that it is not cut to the bone and there is leeway such that it does not impinge on its integrity services.</p></speech>

There is a binding arbitration process if either side is unhappy with the outcome of the budgetary discussion, although it has never been used.  The budget for the racing regulatory body and the Turf Club has increased significantly this year and last year.  The role of the racing regulatory body is vital to racing into the future, given that in the industry, if one does not have integrity, one has nothing.  In the betting industry there is a need for proper, robust integrity services.  The racing regulatory body and the Turf Club need to funded properly to do this job.  It also needs to make its case for funding and this needs to be transparent.  There must be a process to ensure it is being done with a sense of value for money, which it is.  We also receive much voluntary support and activity through the Turf Club.  We have a good structure for the administration of racing and integrity services.  It has proven itself.  However, we must constantly examine it, modernise and ensure we have the right accountability, transparency and efficiency structures.  This is what the discussion between the Turf Club and HRI will be about in terms of getting the funding it needs to do the job.  In case it breaks down, we have an arbitration process and body to ensure there is an outcome that takes account of all the factors.</p></speech>

When I put forward the amendment, I did not realise it would be a slam dunk.  I am glad there is an arbitration board to deal with disputes and budget overruns.  My amendment only provides for an extension or subset of it and it should not create any hassle.  I am sure the Minister and officials will be delighted that somebody has proposed a simple amendment on which they will not have to do much drafting work.  This is about the cost of the integrity service and it concurs with the Minister.  It provides for situations in which additional or unforeseen costs or overruns arise in the racing regulatory board rendering it unable to carry out its functions and giving rise to a dispute with HRI.  If they cannot resolve such a dispute, we need a mechanism whereby somebody takes an independent, objective view of the matter and arbitrates on whether the level of service provided was required.</p><p>As the Minister said, the racing regulatory board is obliged to provide integrity service to the highest possible standard to ensure the rules of racing are fully and fairly enforced to the benefit of horse racing, breeding, owners and punters.  Without integrity, we would have nothing.  The amendment provides for a fall-back position whereby the Minister could step in and appoint a senior counsel to arbitrate in the event of such a disagreement.  It is a simple way to ensure there are no disputes.  I do not anticipate it would ever be used.  As the Minister said, what is there has not been used.  It is always good to have the horse firmly bolted in in order that it does not escape.  I am ensuring the legislation is watertight in the event of any dispute.

There needs to be a responsibility for accountability when a budget is agreed.</p><p>Let us not forget, this is public money.  We cannot have a situation like with the HSE where, year after year, a budget is agreed and then it comes back halfway through the next year looking for more.  Next year it will not be legal and the significant increases in budget we have seen halfway through a year, through Supplementary Estimates, will not now be facilitated.  We have an arbitration process and a fair budget negotiation process and we should stick to what is in the Bill, which has been painstakingly put together to get accountability and the right balance.  To introduce this would bring something else into an area that is already catered for.  I am trying to be helpful in areas where the Deputy is raising issues but this is already catered for.</p></speech>

There have been a number of criticisms of the Irish Government in relation to this case, which I do not propose to reiterate as this is not a political issue.  It is important that Mr. Halawa's legal team be allowed to appear before the committee so that we can discuss with them what they believe can be done, as was done by the Australian Government and Prime Minister.</p></speech>

The Department officials have already outlined to KRW following receipt of its opinion, that the Government believes that the wording of Law 140 is such that it cannot be allowed in Ibrahim Halawa's case until the trial proceedings have concluded.  Based on extensive representations of Ibrahim Halawa's case at the highest level, the Egyptian authorities are unlikely to consider the application of this law under Ibrahim Halawa's case until the trial proceedings have concluded.  We have supported this and I have agreed to have an informal meeting with the legal team.  I have no problem doing so.  The committee has taken a keen interest in this case, as has the Taoiseach.  He has met President el-Sisi more than once, including at the COP meeting last weekend in Paris, at which time he again raised this issue with him.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, have also met the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Mr. Shoukry.  There have been extensive representations in relation to this case.  Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have also visited Ibrahim Halawa 48 times.</p> <p>  We are all interested in this case.  Ibrahim will be 20 years old this month and he has spent over two years now in prison.  We believe that Ibrahim's best interests lie in the law taking its course.  As politicians and parliamentarians we need to be mindful, in terms of what we do, that we are not seen to be intervening in the legal affairs of Egypt.  We need to be very careful in that regard and I urge Senator Daly to act with caution in this matter.  I propose that the committee meet informally with the legal team.  I do not want negative publicity on Ibrahim Halawa's future emanating from this committee.  Let us call a spade a spade on this.  With the permission of the committee, as chairman, I will informally meet with the legal team-----</p></speech>

The fact that there appears to be no problem about meeting informally with the legal team but there is a problem with meeting with them formally indicates to me that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade might be upset with what the legal team would have to say about its performance.  Why is it that it is okay to meet the legal team informally but not formally?  Is it because, as I have outlined to colleagues, the motion calls for the Irish Government to take the same approach as the Australians in seeking the release of Mr. Halawa?</p><p>The strategy the Australians employed was to use Law 140 to secure their citizen's release while he was awaiting trial.</p></speech>

The best way to handle this case is with diplomacy behind the scenes, as is happening with the involvement of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and our diplomatic team.  We need to support them but having the legal team here in public session would harm the young man's case, as Deputy Eric Byrne said.  At this stage, we need to continue and, if possible, increase the behind-the-scenes contact that has been taking place.  Our diplomatic corps has been very supportive of this young man and I have every confidence that the contact the Taoiseach has had will bring about the desired result.  We all want to see this young man back in Dublin with his family and continuing his studies.  Hopefully that will happen in the very near future.</p></speech>

I have no confidence whatsoever in the legal system in Egypt.  It is a sham trial of a huge number of people.  The case has been cancelled on a number of occasions on the basis that witnesses have not turned up.  It is an absolute joke to see the legal system in Egypt and I do not see how anyone can have any confidence in it.  The Chairman said the law will take its course but there is no law relating to this country.  What is happening is an absolute joke.  People are being arrested and held, as in this case, for years.  This young man was 17 years of age when he was arrested.  On 19 December, he will be 20.  He was on hunger strike at one point for 40 days and the last I heard was that he was still on hunger strike.</p> <p>  I do not see the harm in bringing in the legal team, the members of which believe that the direction the Irish Government has taken in this case is wrong.  I would like to hear formally what they actually say.  I do not see what harm it would cause if we, as a committee, felt so strongly about the case that we formally met with individuals and groups involved with it.  People have argued that we should do it on the quiet and that this is in the best interests of Ibrahim but we have already taken this approach and he is still in jail.  I urge the Chair and other members to think again.  I have formally met the Australian legal team on the Peter Greste case and the information they gave me was the opposite of what we were being told in this committee.  We were told he was no longer charged but the legal team told us he won his case and the Egyptian authorities appealed the ruling, meaning he was still formally under charge.  Ibrahim has also been formally charged but we seem to be getting conflicting information and there is now an urgency to this case.  I do not know of any other Irish citizen who is facing the death penalty and there is an onus on us to do everything we can to save this young man's life.</p></speech>

We risk damaging his prospects of ever getting out of that jail.  He may have been there for two years now but he could be there for his whole life.  We have taken the Government-to-Government and Minister-to-Minister approach.  We have taken the diplomatic route and our Taoiseach has met Egypt's President.  It is the Egyptian state versus Ibrahim's legal team and if we formally invite the legal team, which is on the opposite side to the Government we are trying to persuade, it can do nothing but damage his case.</p></speech>

If we leave Ibrahim to be the subject of a show trial in a sham legal system, which is designed to do nothing but instil terror in the citizenry and opponents, it would be an incredible abdication of our responsibility as fellow citizens and as the political authority which is supposed to protect the rights of our citizens.</p><p>At the least, we should hear what his legal team has to say about the ridiculous, nonsensical and cruel process he is being put through and what we can do to help.

We are all here in the interest of getting this young man out of prison.  Deputy Boyd Barrett was not here at the start of this meeting so let me say that we have acted with responsibility on this issue.</p> <p>  The question was asked why the Taoiseach does not lift the phone.  Not only did the Taoiseach do that, he met President el-Sisi twice.  He met him last week at the COP21 meeting in Paris also and outlined the case.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, has met the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Shoukry, and our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has met him twice.  I also met the foreign Minister.  Everything possible has been done at Government level in this regard.  The Government has carried out all the steps outlined in the legal opinion and has followed the same steps the Australians did in the Peter Greste case.  We have acted with honour on this issue because we want to try to get this man freed.  We want to act in his best interest, not to play this out in a so-called courtroom here.</p> <p>  We are doing our best for this young man.  Our embassy staff in Cairo are doing their best and they have met him 48 times since he was incarcerated.  It is wrong that he is more than two years in prison and we all agree on that.  We are all here for the same reason, to get this man released.  However, we believe this is the best way forward.  The case is coming up on 15 December and we hope some result will be achieved at that and that the young man can be home in the new year.  That is our goal.  It is the goal we all want.</p></speech>

I have been involved in similar situations previously and at no time were there public meetings on the issues, although there were numerous informal meetings held with legal teams dealing with the people imprisoned.  I am strongly of the same opinion as the Chairman, that the way to deal with a situation of this nature is to do so discreetly, using all the available resources - the resources available to this committee, to the Government, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  This is in train.</p> <p>  We can second-guess those in the front line dealing with the situation and suggest the issue be dealt with in a different way, but that is not how courts work.  Democracy means different things to different people, particularly in different situations and different countries.  Not all countries observe the same democratic rules that apply in some countries.  We like to think ours is a highly sensitive democratic society.  I believe the approach taken so far is the correct approach and that we should continue in this manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.449" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1159" speakername="Mark Daly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015120900002#D00800"><p>I have circulated a copy of the legal opinion, but I know members may not have had the opportunity to read it.  There are a number of discrepancies in regard to what we have been told at this committee in this regard.  This has nothing to do with the court case in Egypt and we are not asking the Government to do anything in this regard.  We are asking for information on what happened in regard to law No. 140.  The document I circulated lists six key points written by the legal team.  It states that, to date, the Irish Government has maintained law No. 140 cannot be applied to Mr. Halawa until Egypt's criminal proceedings against him have concluded.  This has been said repeatedly here in this committee and the same message has been e-mailed to us time and again.  However, it is clearly not the case.  The legal opinion indicates that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, has incorrectly said that Peter Greste was not, strictly speaking, in the course of trial proceedings when he was returned to Australia and that law No. 140 clearly allows for the transfer to Ireland of Mr. Halawa prior to the final judgment being given in his case.  The Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ms Julie Bishop, noted on Mr. Greste's retrial that he is now back in the position of an acute person awaiting trial.  Again, we were told that Ibrahim Halawa could not be dealt with until after a trial, but that was not the case for Peter Greste.  We were given different information in this committee by our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We were told we had to wait until after the trial.</p> <p>  The opinion of Ibrahim's legal team is that it is clear the Irish Government could still do more to secure Mr. Halawa's release.  It would be great if we could hear in public session what more we could do.  We urge the Government, under Taoiseach Enda Kenny, to take the same approach as Australia in seeking the release and return of Mr. Halawa.  To save everybody the bother of having to read the entire document, I will explain our request.  While we note the Irish Government's discussions with the foreign prosecutor for Egypt, it is clear the Government can still do more in regard to securing Mr. Halawa's release.  We note that Peter Greste was released only after repeated public requests made by the Australian Prime Minister to President el-Sisi, the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs to her counterpart in Cairo and sustained efforts by the Australian ambassador.  We urge the Government to do this.  The Australian process related to law No. 140, which relates to a presidential decree and has nothing to do with a court case.  It secured the release of Peter Greste prior to a trial.</p></speech>

I will accede to an informal meeting with the legal team as a matter of courtesy.  Given that it has requested a meeting with us, we should accede.  I am disappointed there was a vote on this because everyone on the joint committee wants to see this young man freed.  That is our goal.  Some of us feel that the best way forward is not to deal with it as if the joint committee were a court of law but rather to address it in the way that is in the best interest of Ibrahim Halawa.  The world is watching us today on live television.</p></speech>

I feel really sick in my stomach that anyone should think today's debate has aided one iota the early release of Ibrahim Halawa.  Anyone who thinks that is sick in the head.  I resent deeply the use of this poor man's situation as a political football.</p></speech>

My concern remains that we have been told different things at different times by our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in relation to what can and cannot be done for Ibrahim Halawa on law No. 140 and the presidential decree.  Other countries have succeeded but we have failed to do for our citizen what the Australians did for Peter Greste.  The reason I want to see the legal team here has nothing to do with the Egyptian legal system or the trial there.  It is about what our Government should be doing in the same way as the Australians.  If one reviews the correspondence we have received from our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, there are consistent discrepancies on law No. 140 and what can and cannot be done.  I am disappointed that we did not want to meet in public session because if there is criticism, let it be heard in public.  My concern is that the Government members do not want to hear the criticism of our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in relation to what it should and should not be doing on this case.</p></speech>

I extend a very warm welcome to him this morning and apologise for the delay as we had matters to attend to within the joint committee itself.  It is timely to have Dr. Sabella here today.  I welcome also our good friend, the ambassador and head of the Palestinian mission in Ireland, H. E., Ahmad Abdelrazek.  We have an opportunity today for the joint committee to hear a first-hand account of the current situation in Palestine, in particular in view of the recent escalation of violence.  The format of today's meeting is that Dr. Sabella will make an opening statement followed by questions from members of the joint committee.</p><p>I remind members and those in the public Gallery to switch off their mobile phones.  They must ensure they are completely switched off for the duration of the meeting as they do cause interference even in silent mode with the recording equipment in the committee room.  The meeting is being broadcast live on Oireachtas TV across various media platforms.<br/><br/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l)</i>of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if witnesses are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.532" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Bernard Sabella" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015120900002#G00200"><p>Allow me first to thank the Chairman and members of the joint committee for extending this invitation.  The reality on the ground today points to this cycle of violence as having had a toll of 120 Palestinians killed, including 30 children, some as young as 14, and thousands injured.  On the Israeli side, according to Office for Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, 17 Israelis have been killed and more than 160 injured.  The immediate reason for the current cycle of confrontation was the provocative visits in September during the Jewish high holidays of right-wing religious Israelis, including some politically influential persons, to the Noble Sanctuary, al-Haram al-Sharif, where the mosques of al-Aqsa and the Rock are found - the golden dome in Jerusalem.<br/><br/>Some of these visitors, contrary to the <i>status quo</i>of this Muslim holy site, used their visit to pray on the holy compound.  This led to fears and anxiety among Palestinians that the real intention of the visits is to eventually divide the holy compound and thus to go counter to the <i>status quo</i>.  The Islamic religious authorities allow visits unhindered to the holy site but not to use the visits to provoke the Muslim faithful.  In addition, the Israeli authorities have imposed access restrictions on entry of Muslims to the holy site and increased the number of visits by senior Israeli officials and prominent right-wing figures, which further reinforced the fear that the real intention is to change the <i>status quo</i>of al-Haram al-Sharif.  As a result of confrontations, dozens were injured and damage was caused to the holy site.<br/><br/>There is an indigenous Christian community in the Holy Land, which altogether between Israel and Palestine totals between 165,000 and 170,000 indigenous Christians.  They are Palestinians who speak Arabic, celebrate Christmas and who are 100% Palestinian.  They feel Palestinian like myself, despite the name that sounds either French or Italian.  However, we are bona fide Palestinians.  The heads of 13 officially recognised churches in Jerusalem came out with a statement in which they said:</p><blockquote>We condemn all threats of change to historical (<i>status qu</i>o) situation in the al-Aqsa Mosque (Haram al-Sharif) and its courtyard, all buildings, and in the city of Jerusalem.  Any threat to its continuity and integrity could easily lead to unpredictable consequences which would be most unwelcome in the present delicate political climate.  Muslims have the right to free access and worship to the al-Aqsa Mosque.</blockquote> <p>As this confrontation continues, the change in open-fire orders by the Israeli authorities and the increase of minimum sentences for stone throwing and the imposition of heavy fines on parents of minors who commit these offences have all led to a worsening of the general climate not simply in Jerusalem but across the entire occupied Palestinian territory.  As a result hundreds of Palestinians have been killed, thousands have been injured while scores of Israelis have been killed and more than 100 have been injured.  Some of the implemented open-fire orders amount to extra-judicial killings, as pointed out by human rights organisations, both local and international, and by UN special rapporteurs on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory - Makarim Wibisono and Christof Heyns.<br/><br/>However, aside from this religiously motivated development, the overall situation in the Palestinian occupied territories drives Palestinians, particularly young people among us, to despair.  We are also desperate.  Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank continues unabated and the refusal of the Israeli Government to desist from housing expansion in these settlements and the construction of new ones has been the primary cause for the impasse in the political process.  In addition, there was violence by Israeli settlers on the night of 31 July 2015.  Two young settlers fire bombed the living room of the Dawabsheh family in the Palestinian village of Duma in the Nablus region, which is north of Jerusalem, and this resulted in the tragic immediate death of Ali, an 18-month old baby and the death of both his father Sa&rsquo;ad and his mother Riham, who succumbed to serious burns on 8 August and 7 September, respectively.  This has have left all of us in Palestine and those of goodwill worldwide, including some key Israelis, in a state of shock.<br/><br/>All these developments dim the hope not only of the political process but also of the two-state solution.  The recent decision of the EU to label settlement products, which is commended, has been countered by an Israeli Government decision to stop discussion on the political process with EU institutions.  Clearly, there is a lack of political will and leadership among the Israeli authorities and this is being reflected on the ground with further escalation and continuing confrontation.  According to the UNOCHA Humanitarian Bulletin monthly report of September 2015 in the occupied Palestinian territory, the Deputy Secretary General of the UN, Mr. Jan Eliasson, said:</p><blockquote>The crisis would not have erupted if Palestinians had a hope of a viable state of their own. The de-escalation of violence together with urgent and real progress towards a negotiated two-state solution are crucial. </blockquote><p>The UN Security Council expressed grave concern and called for "the exercise of restraint, refraining from provocative actions and rhetoric, and upholding unchanged the historic status quo" at the al-Haram al-Sharif, the Noble Sanctuary.  It must be noted that past UN resolutions have declared Israel's unilateral annexation of east Jerusalem, which is the Palestinian Arab part of Jerusalem, unlawful.</p><p> We are certainly a people who want life and love freedom.  This love is reflected in our desire to exercise our inalienable rights to end occupation, establish our own Palestinian state and live side by side with Israel in a normal and mutually respectful relationship, not one of occupier and occupied.  This is the most elementary right if we are to proceed towards a life of independence and dignity.</p><p> Our Palestinian people are thankful for all of the political, economic, educational support that Ireland and its great people and Government have given us.  I have been a teacher of sociology at Bethlehem University for 25 years.  There was a special ten-year or 15-year arrangement between it and University College Dublin, UCD, under which Irish and Palestinian educators worked together side by side.  For some time, I was a part of that process.  We appreciate this aspect of Irish-Palestinian co-operation.</p><p> I repeat my thanks to the distinguished Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade for inviting me to address its esteemed members.  We trust that their continued support to Palestine and its cause is essential for our legitimate struggle towards ending occupation and establishing our own state.  We hope that, through this process, we can reach a real peace in our region.  Shukran min Filistin, thanks from Palestine.</p></speech>

He depicted the significant loss of life in recent times, the injuring of so many people and the poor and desperate conditions in which people are living.  One of the central tenets of the presentation related to the additional problems arising from the expansion of Israeli settlements and construction.</p> <p>  As Dr. Sabella is aware, the D&aacute;il and Seanad passed non-binding motions more than a year ago recognising the state of Palestine.  What significance does Dr. Sabella believe would formal recognition by Ireland and other EU member states have?  Could that help to unlock the negotiations in the Middle East peace process?  It would afford greater parity of esteem and status in the negotiations.</p> <p>  A theme in Dr. Sabella's final sentences was that the realisation of a two-state solution was becoming ever more difficult.  Is it becoming more distant?  Individually, the EU's member states have the competence to give recognition to the state of Palestine.  If a large number of them recognised it formally, would that provide major leverage in support of Palestine's just demand for a peaceful co-existence with a neighbouring state?</p> <p>  I thank Dr. Sabella sincerely for his contribution.  I also welcome the ambassador and his colleagues.</p></speech>

We have traversed this subject many times.  Unfortunately, I fear that we will continue doing so.  I have always held the view that as long as any discussion or negotiation is suspended, there can be no progress.  Everyone resiles to his or her respective position, past ills are reintroduced and there are reprisals and counter-reprisals.  The UN and, in particular, the US and the EU, both of which have influence in the area, should apply all possible pressure on the various parties to bring about an ongoing discussion whereby grievances could be aired and presented to an independent arbitration body of some standing.  This small initiative would at least begin a process.  It may well be a process about a process or a discussion about a process, but at least something would be happening.  A political vacuum will cause the fermentation of the ills that have beset the area for generations.</p> <p>  I do not want to go on because we have all spoken about this issue many times.  We must congratulate those who, like our visitors, have made a positive contribution down the years and continue to do so.  Not everyone does the same thing at the same time, although that would be a help.</p></speech>

What measures can be implemented to ensure that the historical <i>status quo</i>is enforced and respected?  There has been political cover from the Israeli side for some of the actions in question.  There is documented evidence of Israeli security forces and citizens carrying out extrajudicial killings.  Will Palestine bring legal cases at an international level against those involved?  </p><p>Regarding the labelling of settlement goods, our guests know that the EU recently introduced labelling regulations.  These are a welcome first step but much more can be done.  Should the EU ban goods from illegal settlements entering it?  Due to the dire situation caused by the occupation and human rights abuses, the national elections in Palestine have been postponed.  I understand that there are complex political and security issues but has there been any movement towards holding the elections in the near future?  What impact will the so-called transparency Bill, under which members of NGOs will be tainted as foreign agents, have on Palestinian groups as well as Israeli NGOs?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.540" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Bernard Sabella" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015120900002#H00800"><p>I will answer Deputy Smith first.</p><p> On the question of recognition, I feel that Europe should do more.  We get frustrated because we feel that Europe is a supporter, financially and politically, of the Palestinian cause, not because there is any love between Europe and Palestine but because there is an interest in finding a solution to the problem between the Israelis and the Palestinians.  Recognition could be an excellent way of putting pressure on Israel to end the political impasse.  As mentioned, as long as the political impasse continues a two-state solution will not be possible.  There are people who would argue that a two-state solution is no longer possible.  If the Israelis are ready and willing to give us equal voting rights, then we, as Palestinians, will support a one-state solution.  However, we will not agree to a so-called security controlled system to control Palestinians at all times.  In the long run, control will not work.  It will lead only to a repeat of these cycles of violence every three or four years.  In other words, we would live ten years in relative quiet and calm but this would then be followed by a cycle of violence which lasts for two or three years and so on, while the Israelis continue to expand their settlements.  There can be no two-state solution.  Therefore, recognition by Europe of a Palestinian State - I speak in this regard of recognition not only of parliaments but of governments - could be a way forward.  We cannot continue as we are.  </p><p> I subscribe to Deputy Durkan's suggestion in regard to the establishment of an independent body through which the UN, US and EU could bring pressure to bear to stop this political vacuum and get things moving.  The only way to halt the violence is to return to political negotiations.  Israel needs to agree to stop expansion of its settlements and to return to political negotiations.  We are not asking for anything that is above and beyond the ability of Israel to deliver on but it does not wish to do so.  Therein lies the problem.  Israel also needs to respect the integrity and sanctity of the holy sites.  My colleagues in the Palestinian Parliament often quote the violence against the church in Tiberias, which, I think, is run by the German Dominicans or another religious order.  Two Israeli Messianic Jewish youngsters burned down that church.  We must respect the integrity of each other's holy places.  If we do not do that we play with fire, and we play with fire internally.  The situation then escalates into confrontation between the two states.  </p><p> There have been no legal cases against those who committed extrajudicial killings.  This situation is further complicated by the fact that social media has been instrumental in illustrating the criminality in some of these cases of extrajudicial killings.  People are affected by this.  During a recent visit to Bethlehem a taxi driver, who was approximately 25 years old, told me that on the previous night the Israelis went into a hospital in Hebron and killed the cousin of a person they sought to arrest, who was injured and being treated in the hospital.  The taxi driver, who had never finished high school, asked me if it was acceptable to the world community that Israeli people could go into a hospital to arrest an injured person being treated in that hospital and in the process kill his cousin?  The scenes of that arrest and killing were shown on Facebook.  I have seen them.  This type of activity heightens emotions.  </p><p> Israel needs to also respect basic international human rights obligations.  It cannot hide behind the argument of terror.  The question of recognition is more important now as we are all fighting the terror that is ISIS.  Islamic State, or what in Arabic we call, Daesh, is a threat to all of us.  Whether or not Europe believes it, we have shared values.  For example, Christians and Muslims in Palestine have lived together for years.  They have attended school together and have worked together in hospitals, government offices and in the Palestinian Parliament.  We share the views of an Islam that is open and tolerant and acknowledges others.  In my view, it is important that Europe, in its fight against terror, also recognises that the Palestinian issue, in terms of friction and conflict, exists not only in the Middle East but worldwide.  We share with Europe the will to fight terror.  We are against terror.  That is the position of all in the Palestinian Legislative Council.</p><p> We are hoping to have elections but elections in Palestine are not like elections in Ireland.  I understand the next election in Ireland will take place in March.  I wish everybody good luck.  In Palestine, issues that must be factored into the holding of elections include whether Israel would allow us to hold an election, if Hamas, our rivals in Gaza would participate in the elections or even agree to them, or if the current situation of conflict and confrontation would allow for the holding of the elections.  There are many issues arising that make it difficult for us to hold elections.  Any decision in that regard will not be one for Palestine alone.  I was elected in 2006, when I won one of two Christian seats for the city of Jerusalem.  I was supposed to finish my tenure as a parliamentarian four years later in 2010 but I am still there five years later.</p><p>It is not acceptable to me and to most of my colleagues in the Palestinian Parliament.  We are anxious to go forward and hand responsibility to the younger generation.  We have a problem in that regard.</p><p> On the question of transparency and NGOs, unfortunately some in the Israeli Government wish to use the transparency argument to control NGOs, even Israeli NGOs, that call for a political solution and support non-violent means and measures, such as boycotting settlement products</p></speech>

His diplomatic team in Ireland does wonderful work.  Its members are forever lobbying us politicians, so Palestine is well represented by its embassy staff.</p> <p>  This is a complicated issue that has been torturing me for years.  We had a very good Palestinian colleague, Dr. Yousef Allan, who died in office in this country.  He was the forerunner for the creation of the embassy.  I took part in the Palestinian elections in 1994.  During the first Palestinian Authority elections I was based in Jenin.</p></speech>

We also met Yasser Arafat in Tunis.  We saw developments taking place in Ireland, and the Irish Government was very sympathetic to the Palestinian cause.  We opened many doors, and I applaud Dr. Sabella's recognition of Ireland's role on the Palestinian issue.  We pride ourselves on having made a great deal of progress for the Palestinian cause at various international bodies.  I congratulate the diplomatic team from Palestine.  The Palestinian flag now flies freely among the flags of the nations of the world at the United Nations, which is an important step forward.  Dr. Sabella will have noticed the row that was caused by the Israelis in reaction to Palestine's membership of UNESCO, which Ireland was instrumental in pushing.  I also congratulate Palestine on its rather belated arrival on the International Criminal Court, ICC, which again has caused Israel to think twice.  Palestine has done wonderful work in the diplomatic arena, not just in Ireland but throughout the world.  Its embassy staff throughout the world have a greater status than they had heretofore.</p> <p>  My problem, now, is that while we wish to recognise the state of Palestine, how can we recognise a non-existing state given the conflict between Fatah and Hamas?  Let us call a spade a spade.  Hamas controls Gaza while Fatah controls the West Bank.  There is a single government but is it acting as a government?  I am putting the ball back in the Palestinian court by asking Dr. Sabella to advise me on when he thinks it will be possible to create unity of purpose between Hamas in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.</p> <p>  Dr. Sabella mentioned people becoming sceptical as to whether there can be a two-state solution given the intrusion by the Israelis with the building of settlements.  Is there a plan B if there is no two-state solution?  Is plan B a unitary state?  Is it too much to hope that there would be a state that would give equal recognition to Palestinians, Jews, Moslems, Catholics and so forth?  Speaking of religion, I compliment the religious people, some of whom are from Ireland, who go to these very troubled areas and act as witnesses and observers.  They are religiously motivated, which is fine, but they are a peace corps element out in the field.  I congratulate them.  Some of them, tragically, have lost their lives, including an American lady.</p> <p>  Palestine has made much progress, helped by Ireland, in the EU.  Labelling the origins of goods and the fact that produce from the occupied territories cannot be labelled as Israeli goods is another indication of that.  The diplomatic movement is happening, and it is growing in strength and respectability in the world.  However, to return to Hamas, Fatah, the West Bank and Gaza, how can we be convinced that the unity of purpose exists so governments can feel confident enough to applaud the state of Palestine?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.546" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015120900002#K00500"><p>I was forcibly struck by Dr. Sabella's comment that Palestine is powerless to go ahead with elections and that its right to hold elections depends on many forces outside, despite the right of the Palestinian people to have elections.  Some of the points he made were made by the committee recently when it met an Israeli delegation.  One point was that Palestine is not the enemy and that there is even more potential for Palestine and Israel to work together given the other very serious threats in the Middle East.</p> <p>  I met some of the Bethlehem students a few months ago.  It is always disappointing to hear about their colleagues who are not allowed to travel.  Other governments could do more to ensure that students have the right to travel and visit other countries.  What has been shown up is the ineffectiveness of what is happening at the United Nations, regardless of what resolutions are passed and the reports from the special rapporteurs.  How can we get the peace process back on track?  It appears from what Dr. Sabella said that seeking recognition is one of the ways forward.  It is easier for the EU to provide funding.  While that is necessary and very important, it is probably the easier option for the EU rather than bringing these matters to the fore and doing something tangible about them.</p> <p>  I have been in Aida Camp several times, so I was appalled to hear about what had happened recently.  We met youth groups and the cultural groups.  We met Al-Rowwad and I am aware of its commitment to peace.  Its slogan is "Beautiful Resistance".  Its members were here in this Parliament and we met them several times.  There was an amazing concert in Liberty Hall in which they did their dabke dancing.  One meets people and one knows their commitment to working together into the future, but then one sees the way in which they are treated.  I have written to the Israeli ambassador about that.</p> <p>  I have some questions on the role of the Palestinian Legislative Council.  One is about Palestinian prisoners.  There are over 5,000 who are in prison for six months under renewable sentencing.  Can the council play a role in that regard?  The threats to the Bedouin arise occasionally when one sees the land grabs for the settlements.  There have not been many successful cases in the Israeli courts about that.  There are tensions among some of the Christian communities because they feel under threat from certain elements within the Muslim community and from ultra-Orthodox Jews.  The Israeli delegation spoke about their suggestions for the Al-Aqsa Mosque.  Is Dr. Sabella hopeful about that situation?</p> <p>  My final question is about a Palestinian poet, Ashraf Fayadh, who is in jail in Saudi Arabia under sentence of death.  Has his case been taken up with the Saudi authorities?</p></speech>

We do not hide our problems.  The problem is that we are divided.  The division is costing us solidarity and causing the lack of developing a Palestinian plan of action that would further strengthen our presence in the international arena.</p><p>As I said, the problem with the elections is also true with the division between Fatah in Ramallah in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza.  Regional and international players are actively pursuing the division of Palestinians into this and that group.  I was in Brussels with Mr. Azzam al-Ahmad, the Ramallah Fatah group's chief negotiator with Hamas.  Whenever our President, Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, tries to approach the Hamas camp, there is always a problem with Hamas, in that it does not want to go forward and subscribe to what all us Palestinians subscribe to.  We need to find a solution to the problem.  It is very important.  Our Arab brothers can help us with it.  They can listen to the Irish Parliament saying Palestinians need to unite.  I ask the committee members to mention this as an important policy requirement whenever they talk to representatives of Arab states.  Although there is a will among us to come back together, the intervention of some states in the region prevents us from doing so.</p><p> On the witnesses, I must mention a special group administered by the World Council of Churches, namely, the Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme for Peace in Israel and Palestine, EAPPI.  Maybe the committee referred to it.  I always see these people at checkpoints in Bethlehem, Jerusalem, Hebron and elsewhere, where there is much tension.  They wear jackets with their EAPPI symbols.  They are witnessing, taking note and, eventually, reporting to church groups and others in Europe, the US, Canada and elsewhere including Australia and New Zealand.  They are doing a good job and are to be commended.  Again, it is a kind of solidarity with the Palestinian people and it also reflects the need for peace and justice in our region.</p><p> How can we restart the peace process?  I am at a loss.  I do not know how.  We appeal to Israel to move.  Problems include the US support to Israel.  Although Mr. John Kerry tried so much to open up possibilities and opportunities for renewed negotiations, now even the Obama Administration recognises that we cannot do anything before the end of Mr. Obama's term in office.</p></speech>

Without the EU's support in all areas, we could not go on in Palestine.  The committee referred to the UN's ineffectiveness.  Sometimes, we have an ambivalent relationship with Europe, which we discuss among ourselves.  Some people get upset when some of us say what I am about to say.  In one way, we love Europe and like its approach and support.  On the other hand, we think Europe refrains from taking bold decisions that would impress even on the US the need to go forward.  The US puts a veto on what Europe can and cannot do.  The Israelis are also implementing such a veto.  We want Europe to move forward.  We want a solution.  We want to live as normal people and normal neighbours.  I live in Jerusalem, and just across the street is a Jewish neighbourhood.  I want to live normally with these neighbours.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.552" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Bernard Sabella" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015120900002#L00500"><p>Life is a mixture of fear, anticipation and going about as normally as one can.  People on both sides must continue living, taking buses and travelling about.  We must say it as it is.  Young Palestinians and many Israelis are afraid because of the cycle of violence and confrontation, which is a result of a political impasse.  We do not know where we are going.  We try to mix, for example, and there is a major debate in Palestine about whether we should celebrate Christmas and light Christmas trees in all Palestinian towns, as we usually do.  This may surprise many Irish Members of Parliament.  Muslims and Christians celebrate Christmas together and participate in activities around Christmas time, which is beautiful.</p> <p>  Now, because of what is happening and because people have been killed and hundreds, if not thousands, have been injured, there is sadness and mourning, and we must consider whether we should light up the Christmas trees.  Many voices are saying we should light up the Christmas trees and not allow the crisis to hold us back.  Christmas is an occasion for joy not for adults, but for children, and we do not want to take the joy from Palestinian children, Muslim and Christian alike.  It is not easy.  It is difficult.  There is a feeling among young people in Palestine that they are targeted, and this makes them afraid.</p> <p>  A question was asked about the PLC and prisoners.  Recently, our colleague Khalida Jarrar was sentenced to 15 months in prison.  The accusations against her are political.  She has not committed any violent act, but is being punished for her position on Israel and her expressed views against the occupation.  We find it utterly unacceptable that a Palestinian member of parliament is targeted.  There is a practice in Israel of administrative detention, which, unfortunately, we inherited from the time of the British Mandate for Palestine.  Anybody who is not to the liking of some Israeli authorities finds his or her way to prison under administrative detention, which is very unfortunate.</p><p> On the question regarding the Christian community, our experience in Palestine is that it has been a model of co-existence between Christians and Muslims.  What the Christian community is concerned about is that we have seen a shift from a national identity to a religious identity, not only in Palestine but across the Middle East.  That is a little bit problematic because for some, among both Muslims and Christians, this religious identity seems to say that we are two separate communities.  We are not two separate communities and the overwhelming majority of Palestinians, Muslims and Christians alike, subscribe to the view that we are one community.  We have an important saying in Arabic which emerged from Egypt, and its meaning in English is "Religion is for God, but the homeland is for everybody."  We subscribe to this view. </p><p> What is happening in Iraq and Syria with Islamic State is problematic, and politicians and policy makers in Palestine do not hide this.  We are worried about it because it drives fear among people.  What this extremist, terrorist group is doing to Yazidi, Christian and other communities in Iraq and Syria is reflected in our fears.  I must stress, however, that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians subscribe to the view that our state is for all citizens, is open and does not discriminate.  We in Palestine are proud that our Government has Christian Ministers.  I do not like to use the term "Christian Ministers," and do so only to make my point.  We also have Christian ambassadors.  A recent study on Christians in Palestine, which was carried out by a Lutheran church in Bethlehem that is Palestinian rather than imported, pointed out that 45% of all non-governmental organisations in Palestine working in human rights, social media and so forth had been founded or are directed by Palestinian Christians.  We are fully integrated in our society and we do not have any problem.  However, Muslims and Christians must together face the fears caused by Islamic State, a terrorist organisation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.554" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1026" speakername="Olivia Mitchell" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015120900002#M00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank Dr. Sabella for his presentation, which provides a clear view of the Palestinian position.  Dr. Sabella stated that young people in Palestine are in despair.  I fully understand the reason that would be the case because, as the years go by, the possibility of a two-state solution appears to be disappearing.  Every day, the settlements expand and the chaos in Gaza worsens.  Gaza is more than a cause of despair, as it is difficult to see how it can ever be addressed.  I can see that it is in Israel's interest to allow the political impasse to continue indefinitely while it gradually increases its hold.  Even in Jerusalem, the incident at Al-Aqsa mosque is symptomatic of Israel's attempts to increase its grasp on the city, including by buying up property.  It is difficult to determine what the Israelis want.  Do they want a two-state solution?</p> <p>  How does one break the impasse and bring Israel back to the table?  Dr. Sabella stated that Europe should do more and should recognise the Palestinian State.  Israel's response to the measure taken on the labelling of products was to stop talking to the European Union.  If we were to decide tomorrow to recognise the Palestinian State, would that decision make Israel talk to us?  I ask this question because I am puzzled. </p> <p>  I am very interested in the war in Syria, which brings something new to the equation.  Dr. Sabella expressed concern about the growth in religious identity.  Could this development be used to bring Israel to talks?  The Palestinian question has been used by sympathisers of ISIL, albeit not by ISIL itself, almost as a justification for the growth of ISIL.  Does this provide an opening?  The Syrian war is consuming the Western world, which has taken its eye off the Palestinian question.  Can a connection be found that could be used to bring people back to the negotiating table?  I know this is a big question but perhaps Dr. Sabella will give us his thoughts on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.555" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015120900002#M00300"><p>I thank Dr. Sabella for his presentation, which I very much appreciate.  As always, I also thank Mr. Abdelrazek.  In the case of Khalida Jarrar, one thing the joint committee, as fellow parliamentarians, should do is make representations to the Israelis, making clear that it is outrageous and disgraceful that a person has been imprisoned for no other reason than her political views.  Then again, everything Israel does <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the Palestinians is disgraceful.</p><p>At this stage, does Dr. Sabella not believe that Israel has no interest in a reasonable or just settlement and is playing the world community in whatever way it can, either by ignoring it or pretending to negotiate?  Is it not the case that Israel has only ever been interested in creating facts on the ground to expand the territory of Israel and destroy any hopes of Palestinian self-determination?  My strongly held view has just been confirmed.</p><p>On an autobiographical note, the only reason I am involved in politics is that I was in Bethlehem on Christmas Eve 1987, having visited al-Fawwar refugee camp the previous day with Palestinian friends with whom I had been working on an Israeli moshav at the Dead Sea.  We were chased around Bethlehem and there had been shooting and large-scale conflict in the refugee camp, which was terrifying and shocking.  I chose to get involved in politics when I returned to Ireland.  Since then, all I have seen is that the position has become progressively worse, despite all the hand-wringing and tokenistic concern shown for the Palestinian cause.  Is it not time to be more robust and call Israel for what it is, namely, a rogue state?  Is it not pointless to try to negotiate with Israel because it is not interested in negotiating?  Should we not treat Israel and characterise its behaviour in the same way that we treated and characterised apartheid South Africa?  If we do not do so, are we not assisting the Israelis and, if one likes, the enemies of Palestine, by allowing the conflict to be characterised as an intractable fight between Arabs and Jews?</p><p>It suits them; that is the way they want to present it because if it can be presented like that, people in Europe just switch off and say, "Well, that is the sort of stuff that goes on in the Middle East".  We need to break through that narrative and say this is not about Jews versus Arabs, religion, or a clash of civilisations.  This is about a racist aggressive rogue state.  I would be interested in Dr. Sabella's comments on this.  It is also about a network of despotic states in the region that are also determined to crush their own populations, including the el-Sisi regime in Egypt, the Saudi regime or other regimes in the Gulf.  They have always been about crushing their own people.  Israel is the most extreme example of this.  The West has played at best a duplicitous game because it has always continued to support Israel.  It continues to trade with it and treat it as a normal state despite its flagrant human rights violations.  It also continues to arm and support the worst elements in the Middle East against the Arab population.</p><p> In that context, as a way of breaking through that cul-de-sac, do we not now need to start to talk about one person, one vote, the one-state solution, the one Palestine, because it cuts through that narrative, which suits them?  The history of partition of any land has always been civil war and perennial fighting.  It has become apparent that the two-state solution leads to a perennial fight over where the boundaries are to be drawn and that fight never ends.  Would it not be better to cut across that by talking about one person, one vote as the way to reframe what is at stake in Palestine?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.557" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1159" speakername="Mark Daly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015120900002#N00200"><p>I also wish to voice concerns about Khalida Jarrar and her continued administrative detention.  Irrespective of her background and politics, she is entitled to due process.</p> <p>  General McChrystal said, "for every innocent person you kill, you create ten new enemies."  That obviously seems to be the case not only in Palestine and Syria but throughout the Middle East.  As a policy it is obviously self-defeating.  What Dr. Sabella said in his contribution is obviously depressing because things have got worse.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about facts.  People are passing motions and having meetings but, in reality, the Israelis are creating facts in terms of the settlements.  The facts are that when Ronald Reagan was US President, there were only 30,000 illegal settlers in the West Bank.  Now there are more than 500,000 and the number continues to grow.  The Israelis are continuing a policy that started after the Second World War when they arrived on the beaches at Tel Aviv and from there have expanded ever further into the West Bank.  They have now done so to such an extent that the process will become irreversible.  That is the concern.  Israel puts people into an area and claims they will not move while insisting that those who currently form the indigenous community there must do so.  Obviously, the retort to that is that they were there generations, centuries and millennia ago.  The history of the Holy Land is such that so many people have been there previously the entire world might be entitled to claim some piece of it.</p> <p>  I have been there and do not know where it goes next because Europe is doing nothing and the US is not being allowed to do anything by the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC, and other Israeli lobbies in America.  It is hard to see where it goes because they do not need to negotiate with the Palestinians.  They have what they want and they will continue to get more.  Unfortunately, the lack of unity within the Palestinian community in the different groups in Gaza and the West Bank appears to be the perfect textbook policy of divide and conquer.  As long as Palestine is divided, they will continue to conquer.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Mitchell that the Palestine question has been used by terror groups.  We Palestinians currently have nothing to do with that.  Therefore, I think we need to work together.  I commend the committee on inviting me here today.  This is one of the things the committee needs to continue doing.  Furthermore, we would like to see committee members come to Palestine to meet our people.  Some of the members have already done that.  It is a good strategy because it sends a message to the Israelis that we are not alone.<br/><br/>We have a lot to do internally.  We need to rework the unity.  We need to go forward to unity government at least at the beginning.  Such a government would prepare elections and prepare to go back to one entity.  Palestine is one entity.  It is not Gaza and Ramallah.  We have considerable responsibility there.<br/><br/>I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett that the situation has become worse.  While he and others might argue that we have to call Israel by name, others would argue the opposite and suggest being soft on Israel because when one is soft on Israel, it is willing to consider improving the living conditions of Palestinians.  That is not the whole issue.  The issue is that the living conditions are improved for ten years but there continues to be control, oppression and occupation, and young people continue to have frustration and disappointment.  What should we do?  We have thousands of young people who are out of work.  They have no future.  What should we do?  The Palestinians need to be allowed to have their own state and work out their own problems.  I am not saying we do not have problems or that we are perfect.  We have problems.  If we are not allowed to work out our own problems and to develop our own economy, which Israel is not permitting, we will continue to have problems.<br/><br/>I welcome the recent suggestion of the Israeli politician Mr. Peretz - not Mr. Peres - that first need to move on a political solution with the Palestinians.  In order to prove his point he said that if the Palestinians in east Jerusalem had voted for a mayor of Jerusalem the mayor of Jerusalem today would have been a Palestinian.  This means that if the 300,000 Palestinians in east Jerusalem had participated in municipal elections - I think approximately 120,000 of them are allowed to vote by age - then we would have a Palestinian mayor of Jerusalem because he expected us to vote <i>en bloc</i>together.  He argued that the Israelis also need to dismantle some settlements.  He suggested that at least 80,000 settlers should be returned to Israel and that their small settlements be dismantled in order to allow for a political solution with Palestinians.</p><p>I have brought him into the picture to show that some Israeli politicians are aware of the same things that have been discussed by the distinguished members of this committee today.  We need Palestinians and Europeans to encourage mainstream Israeli voices who call for practical solutions, not for ideological solutions.  From the Israeli point of view, an ideological solution would mean the annexation by Israel of the West Bank.</p><p> I will conclude by bringing to the committee's attention an experience I had with a group of master's degree students in Jerusalem.  All of the students in question are Palestinian and most of them are Muslim.  Seven of them are Muslim and one is a Christian.  They were working with me on understanding relations among religions in Jerusalem.  When we discussed the relationship of Judaism to Jerusalem, they told me they were not convinced by some of the material they had read.  They said they wanted to arrive at an impression of what the relationship of Judaism to Jerusalem really was; therefore, they invited a Jewish rabbi to come to speak to them.  They told me they should also have invited a Christian priest to speak to them about Christianity.  The Christian student said they should have invited a Muslim sheikh to come to speak to them.  I am not talking about politicians because I know politicians engage in sweet-talking.  I am talking about real young Palestinian people: students, young people who do not go to school and young people who are working.  They are interested in arriving at a point where we will have true peace in the Holy Land between Israelis and Palestinians.  I think Ireland, its Parliament and people have a role in contributing to this.  I ask the Irish people to keep us in their minds.  I wish them all a merry Christmas and a happy new year.</p></speech>

I think Palestine is always on our minds.  The committee has taken a very keen interest in the Middle East peace process and the conflict in Israel and Palestine.  Members of the committee have visited Palestine, Jordan and Israel.  We met the Palestinian Foreign Minister and chief negotiator when we were in Palestine.  Obviously, it is a difficult and challenging issue.  As Dr. Sabella said, the people on the ground and children ultimately suffer.  I agree with him that the European Union needs to take a stronger role in brokering the peace process in the Middle East.  I echo his words of hope in that regard.  I know that the new EU High Representative, Federica Mogherini, has visited the region on one or two occasions.  Obviously, Ireland has a special interest in the matter.  The committee's interest is reflected in the fact that it is included in our work programme.</p></speech>

We are joined today by Mr. John Hennessy, who is the national primary care director of the HSE;  Ms Anne Marie Hoey, who is the assistant national director in primary care reimbursement and eligibility in the Primary Care Reimbursement Service;  Ms Siobh&aacute;n McArdle, who is the operations manager in the Primary Care Reimbursement Service; Mr. Kieran Healy, who is the head of customer service in the Primary Care Reimbursement Service; and Mr. Ray Mitchell of the parliamentary affairs liaison division of the HSE.  I thank Mr. Mitchell for all the work he has done in liaising with the committee during the 2015 calendar year.  This is not our last meeting of the year, as we will have another one tomorrow.  Mr. Mitchell is always available to the committee to help to co-ordinate our meetings.</p><p>This afternoon, we will consider developments in the administration of the medical card service over the past year.  I welcome Ms Anne Marie Hoey, who has taken up her duties in the role previously held by Mr. Paddy Burke.  I thank her for being in attendance this afternoon.  We had hoped to have this meeting earlier, but there was a mix-up with the dates.  That has been rectified today.</p><p>I wish to advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

The Primary Care Reimbursement Service and national medical card unit delivers a wide range of primary care services across 12 community health schemes, including the medical card scheme, to a population of over 3.66 million.  These services are provided by more than 7,000 primary care contractors and involve 77 million transactions, with an associated expenditure of &euro;2.397 billion, each year.  As of 1 December last, some 1,729,000 medical cards and 409,000 GP visit cards were in circulation.  Since 1 December 2005, there has been an increase of 573,273 people with eligibility under the GMS scheme.  This represents an increase of 33.2% on the 2005 level.  Since 2011, the national medical card unit has provided a centralised medical card assessment and processing service.  This enables a single uniform system of medical card application processing.  The unit replaced the different systems that previously operated through more than 100 offices across the country.  It enables a streamlined and standardised work process and ultimately ensures a more consistent and accountable medical card processing system.</p> <p>  It is important to note that the administration of the health service requires achieving a balance between ensuring those who meet the criteria for full or limited eligibility under the GMS scheme receive their medical cards or GP-visit cards in a timely manner and are treated in a sensitive and compassionate manner at all times, and ensuring there are processes and controls in place to ensure there is robust accountability for the expenditure of public funds.  In the summer of 2014, the HSE commissioned two reviews: the medical card process review, which was undertaken on behalf of the HSE by Prospectus-Deloitte; and the report of the expert panel on medical need for medical card eligibility.  Both reports were publicised in November 2014 by the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister of State with responsibility for primary care, mental health and disability, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.</p> <p>  I will confine my opening remarks to a short update on the progress in implementing the recommendation of those reports.  This will be of particular interest to the committee.  The recommendations contained in the reports fall broadly into a number of key areas, the first of which relates to communications.  During 2015, the national medical card unit has engaged in communications to gain a full understanding from our customers of their experience of making an application for a medical card.  A randomised survey was undertaken in June involving 900 customers who had made applications for medical cards in the previous 12 months.  Some 75% of those surveyed were granted eligibility and 25% of them were not.</p><p>The overall summary of the responses demonstrated a very good level of satisfaction with the service.  The majority of respondents, regardless of their outcome, found the information on the medical card website appropriate and helpful.  Respondents found the advice they got from local health offices supportive and found their telephone interaction with the national medical card unit, NMCU, to be very good.  The survey found that 86% of applicants completed their application form without assistance.  Of those who required assistance with the application process, 14%, the main sources of assistance was the HSE local health office, the GP surgery, the public representative's local office or by direct contact with the NMCU contact centre at lo-call 1890 252 919.</p><p> In responding to the findings of the customer survey and the national medical card process review report, the NMCU has commenced a further series of briefing sessions on the medical card scheme with public representatives and their staff, local health office staff, medical social workers and allied health professionals within the acute hospital groups and with GPs and their staff.   These briefings will continue throughout the country in 2016.  Briefing sessions have also been undertaken to date with a number of other stakeholders, including each of the four regional fora and the national patient forum.  The findings of the customer survey will inform the development of a strategy for the NMCU which will be finalised in the first quarter of 2016 following a public consultation process.</p><p> The second area I want to touch on relates to the medical card application process.  The medical card process review report of 2014 made a number of recommendations to improve the processing of medical cards at the NMCU.  In implementing these recommendations, the NMCU has carried out a review of the processing of medical cards at all stages using a Lean methodology, and the NMCU continues to implement recommendations arising from this initiative.  The unit has introduced real-time analytics to enable the unit to manage effectively the throughput of applications and amendments required by applicants to their applications, which can include change of doctor and the addition of new babies, and we receive up to 19,500 pieces of post per week.  The NMCU has developed a quality control division, undertaken continuing training and development of its staff, and extended its utilisation of information technology through initiatives such as an online registration process for GP-visit card schemes and the internal scanning of customer documentation.</p><p> On information technology, our ICT systems are continually being improved and refined to support the processing of medical card applications.  The NMCU has initiated two major ICT-based projects to be delivered in 2016.  The first of these is an enhanced online application system whereby applicants will be able to apply online and attach any supporting documentation required.  The turnaround time for applications received online will be enhanced.  This service development will significantly improve the overall experience of customers.  The second project relates to the enhancement of the interface with the Department of Social Protection in regard to payments made by that Department to medical card applicants, obviating the need for customers to provide details of Department of Social Protection payments with their applications in future.</p><p> On the clinical advisory group, CAG, following a recommendation in the report of the expert panel on medical need for medical card eligibility to consider medical conditions and their prioritisation or suitability for medical cards, the CAG was established by the director general of the HSE in January 2015.   The group is working on developing an assessment approach to support the existing medical card application process which will enable the medical officers and deciding officers at the NMCU to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the burden of illness on an individual or a family.  This refinement is being tested and validated with customers with a view to it being recommended to the HSE in the first quarter of 2016.  Since September 2014, the number of medical cards awarded on the basis of the exercise of discretion has risen from 71,222 to 95,887 on 1 December 2015.  Eligibility awarded on the basis of the exercise of discretion is currently not reviewed, pending advice from the clinical advisory group.</p><p> Further recommendations from the report of the expert panel have been implemented, including the granting of a medical card and a GP-visit card to the individual with the index condition only in the family.  Eligibility granted to applicants certified clinically as being terminally ill is no longer subject to an eligibility review.  Medical cards for children under 18 with a diagnosis of cancer and where a means test is not conducted were introduced in July of this year.  Three further new schemes were introduced at the NMCU in 2015: the GP-visit card scheme for children under six, the GP-visit card for people over 70, and eligibility in accordance with the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act 2015.  A user-friendly online registration system is available for the GP-visit card scheme for children under six and the GP visit card for those over 70.  To date 204,251 children and clients have registered for the under-six scheme and 47,594 people have registered for the GP over-70 scheme.</p><p> I thank the committee for its continued support of the HSE&rsquo;s efforts to improve the medical card system.  I and my colleagues will endeavour to answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

On the figures for those who have taken up the under-six and over-70 schemes, 204,000 and 47,000, respectively, does the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, have projected figures?  How far short of what was expected are these figures?  Is it the case a significant number may not have taken up the scheme to date?  This information would be helpful.</p> <p>  I welcome the advances signalled in the area of information technology.  The enhanced online application system is welcome.  I also welcome the interface with the Department of Social Protection, which will eliminate the need for applicants or clients to provide details of their social protection payments.  These developments are to be delivered in the coming year and are welcome.</p> <p>  The expert panel made a number of other recommendations in its report published in September 2014.  I note medical officers and deciding officers at the NMCU are being enabled to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the burden of illness on an individual or family.  This will be very much part of the assessment.  Is it the case that the NMCU is seeking the green light for that refinement in 2016 from the HSE?  The other two initiatives are current and, I presume, approved, but Ms Hoey said this refinement is being tested with a view to it being recommended to the HSE in the first quarter of 2016.  What has the pilot programme shown and does the NMCU anticipate a favourable response to the recommendation?</p> <p>  Removing the means test for medical cards for children under 18 with a diagnosis of cancer is a welcome and important development.  Does the PCRS have an opportunity to encourage further consideration of the medical need assessment rather than means or income stream assessment?</p><p>That is the case currently and I would argue it should be expanded.</p><p> The thresholds for qualification have been parked for many years.  Although the representatives from the HSE, in their opening remarks, indicated that there has been a significant increase in the number of people who have medical cards in the ten years since 2005, has the qualification threshold increased over that period of time?  I doubt that it has but the delegates can correct me if I am wrong.  The threshold figures are unacceptably low in respect of the full medical card and the GP-visit card.  Does the primary care reimbursement service have the wherewithal to recommend or would it even consider recommending that this particular barrier to access be revisited?  I would much rather assessment on the basis of medical need.  However, would the service recommend an increase to the thresholds if the alternative option of assessment based on medical need is not possible? </p><p> I also wish to deal with capacity in Finglas and the post office, PO, box number.  We will have the anticipated addition of children from six years to 12 years in the last quarter of 2016 to the scheme.  This is clear given the funding of &euro;10 million for a scheme that would cost &euro;39 million over a 12-month period.  With the addition of the under-sixes and those over 70, does the HSE have the physical capacity and office space to accommodate the movement towards, it is hoped, at least, initially, universal free GP access?  This will be done incrementally and will add additional work throughput.   Does the HSE have the necessary physical space and staffing?  What will the impact of schemes for the under-sixes and the over-70s be?  Does the HSE anticipate more in terms of need?</p><p>Are the 2014 figures relating to the primary care reimbursement service available?  The only figures I can access are those from 2013.  What is the status of the 2014 figures relating to the performance of the funding stream to general practitioners, for example, through the primary care reimbursement service?  Are the delegates in a position to answer the question?  Perhaps I am wrong but I was endeavouring to establish this recently and was unable to isolate the information I needed.  Are the delegates in a position to help me in this regard?</p><p> I thank the delegates for today's report.  I am responding positively to the elements I believe are welcome and will make a difference and I am trying to be encouraging in respect of the areas I would like to see the service develop.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.582" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/960" speakername="S&eacute;amus Healy" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015120900002#DD00200"><p>I welcome the HSE representatives and thank Ms Hoey for her presentation.  As the public representative with the highest number of contacts with the medical card unit, I wish to compliment the staff there.  They are always courteous and helpful and that applies across the board.  As a former public servant and as a trade unionist who represented public servants for more than 30 years, both locally and nationally, I would expect no less.</p> <p>  This service should never have been centralised.  It is uniquely appropriate that this service would be locally based.  The public, applicants and their representatives should be able to have face-to-face access to officials dealing with the applications.  This is the biggest difficulty with the current system.  There is no method for an applicant or anyone acting on behalf of an applicant to have direct contact, be it face to face or over the telephone, with the official dealing with an application.  This should be possible and, if available, would solve a huge amount of the current problems affecting the system.  Is this being considered by the HSE?  </p> <p>  I welcome the clinical advisory group and the examination of the burden of illness on an individual or family.  The issue of applications for a discretionary medical card on the basis of medical need has been difficult from the beginning.  There is no doubt the situation has improved but this area of the system needs to be dealt with urgently.  I would like to see the proposal being brought forward sooner rather than later.  It is still one of the areas in the system which is particularly difficult for applicants and their families.  Currently, when dealing with the renewal of a medical card, a review form is sent to the medical card holder.  It would be helpful if a medical certificate could be forwarded with the review form where the application was granted previously on a discretionary basis given the medical need.  This would short-circuit the need to send the certificate later and avoid further delay.</p> <p>  The system whereby cards are made available to individuals with a terminal illness is working well but it can give rise to difficulties for applicants, their families and some doctors who do not wish to certify an illness as being terminal.  The situation could be helped by having direct personal contact between GPs or individuals acting on behalf of applicants and the person dealing with an application.  This has occurred in the past because I have been involved in such cases.  I was able to speak to officials and the process was accelerated and the applications in question ultimately proved successful.  This contact is vitally important and its availability needs to be widened.</p> <p>  There appears to be a difficulty in terms of the self-employed, particularly those with small incomes.  The delegates may not have an answer to my question today but they might revert to the committee with it.  I understand the HSE takes one view but the Revenue Commissioners take another one and, to date, the twain have not met.  The Revenue Commissioners say the form 11 is a single-sheet form but the HSE say it is a multi-sheet form and we have stalemate.  Perhaps the delegates will examine the issue and revert to the committee on it.</p> <p>  I understand the unit gets 19,500 items of mail per week but I receive regular complaints about information not being received even though they have been sent by registered post.</p><p>What is the situation in that regard?</p><p> Like Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, my understanding is that thresholds have not been increased since January 2006.  They need to be reviewed. </p><p> We raised the question of refunds for the taking of bloods by general practitioners, GPs, with the former Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, who solved the problem and medical card holders who were charged for the taking of blood by their GPs were refunded.  That seems to have come to a halt again.  Could that be clarified?</p></speech>

According to the report, "Eligibility granted to applicants certified clinically as being terminally ill is no longer subject to an eligibility review".  I have come across cases where to my surprise applications were refused.  I accept that people were over the qualifying criteria, people aged over 70.  The same discretion does not seem to have been applied.  In two or three cases the application was refused and a GP only card was issued.  In one case there were reports from four consultants indicating that this person had serious medical difficulties.  It is great to be able to talk to someone in the unit but we do not get to talk to the person who makes the final call.  I am concerned about how decisions are arrived at.  I know of two or three cases which should have got over the line.  In one case, the person has died since.  I made the call six months ago and all my information was correct but the person was refused a medical card.  Can Ms Hoey clarify how the call is made and what discretion there is to make it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.585" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1004" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015120900002#EE00300"><p>On page 2 of the presentation there is a reference to 86% of applicants being successful and not needing help.  People coming to my office need help.  The most common complaint I get is that the application is sent back and they have to start all over again within three months, getting bank statements and so on.  They find that very difficult.</p> <p>  It always surprises me to read that 1.729 million people have medical cards and 573,000 have the general medical service, GMS, card.  That is 2 million of the 5 million living in Ireland.  It is a large number but sometimes when I am knocking on doors or am in my office listening I get the feeling that nobody has medical cards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.586" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Marie Hoey" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015120900002#EE00400"><p>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about the numbers projected in respect of cards for those under six and the over-70s.  When the schemes went live, it was projected that 276,000 children under the age of six would be eligible for the scheme and approximately 40,000 people aged over 70.  A total of 204,000 under sixes have registered for the scheme.  Children under six continue to register.  The number of people over 70 has exceeded the initial projections.  The uptake for registration for that scheme was very positive from the beginning and more people turn 70 every month so the numbers have increased.</p> <p>  The assessment tool is being developed by the clinical advisory group.  It will be designed to try to enhance the current process by enabling people to describe the burden of illness as it affects the individual or the family.  It will support the existing application form without overburdening people with additional work to complete that.  To date the assessment tool has been tested at a couple of focus groups and is due to be further tested at focus groups with patient representatives next week.  My understanding is that the clinical advisory group will take on board the feedback from the focus groups and in its report in quarter 1 of 2016 will recommend to the health service executive, HSE, that it be adopted for use.</p> <p>  The card for children under the age of 18 diagnosed with cancer was implemented last July.  The clinical advisory group made that an interim recommendation but, as its work progresses, it will take into account how that burden of illness is assessed for all cohorts.</p> <p>  The thresholds are set by the Department of Health and the national medical card unit in the HSE implements those thresholds.  In respect of capacity in Finglas if GP-visit care is extended from under six to under 12-year olds, approximately 93% of people registered online over the past few months for the card for under sixes, which reduces the volume of paper work for us to process.  If that trend continues with the extension of the card, that reduces the number of staff needed to process paper applications.  I am confident that we will have capacity, albeit with a small uplift.</p> <p>  Deputy Healy asked about centralising the service and having face-to-face contact.  We work on that continually in our interaction with the community health organisations.  The centralised system has benefits but we cannot do that in isolation.  We have to work with local areas and the intelligence available there.  Members of the public go to their local areas for advice and support in completing application forms.  </p> <p>  We are holding meetings throughout the country with local health office staff, with GPs and with local representatives and their staff to ensure everybody is fully briefed on the scheme, how it operates and can provide the most up-to-date advice and information to members of the public who come to local offices.</p></speech>

For individuals who want to speak to somebody about the processing of an application, the first point of contact would be through our call number.  If a query cannot be resolved at that stage, it will be transferred to our customer relations department which is managed by Mr. Kieran Healy.</p> <p>  Deputy Seamus Healy welcomed the burden of illness initiative.  The plan is for the clinical advisory group to bring that recommendation forward in quarter 1 of next year.</p><p>On the review form and the medical form going out together, we take that as a very positive recommendation.  I would certainly take that away with me.</p><p> In the context of self-employment and form 11, we have them working and realise there can be some differences in understanding in respect of the form.  We have been working with Revenue to resolve the matter and have a common understanding.  We are confident at this stage that we do have a common understanding, which we will certainly impart to any applicant in terms of exactly what is required.  We do not want to overburden people unnecessarily on that.</p><p> Regarding documentation not received, we have made a number of improvements to address the issue.  I mentioned earlier that we have undertaken a lean methodology looking at all of our processes.  We are putting in place very robust systems for the management of the volume of documentation which we receive on a daily and weekly basis.  Over the summer months, we also introduced scanning whereby all additional information received into the unit is scanned at the point of entry and linked with the person's application, cutting down on unnecessary handling of documentation by any more people than would be necessary.</p><p> Senator Colm Burke referred to people who are terminally ill.  Obviously, I am not familiar with the individual circumstances of the cases but am happy to discuss same with him offline.  On the question of how decisions are arrived at, we take into consideration all information that is provided to us, which can include comprehensive medical reports or reports from hospital social workers.  Some reports can be much more explicit than others.  Sometimes we may not know the full circumstances.  Our medical officers will make contact with the person's general practitioner or public health nurse, depending on whether the person is in a hospital or community setting, and try to gather all the information on that patient and take it into consideration.  The medical officers with all of the information and deciding officers with all of the financial information will then come to a decision.  The numbers for discretionary cards over the last year would indicate that we are applying a very sensitive and compassionate approach to all of the information that is presented to us.</p><p> Deputy Mitchell O'Connor mentioned the numbers that did not require help.  The survey was undertaken in June of this year and was of 900 people who had made applications over the previous year.  The results of the survey indicated that a number of people said they did not need help; nevertheless, those who said they did need help identified the most likely places where they would get it.  That is why we are embarking on the briefing sessions throughout the country with all of the various cohorts to make sure that anybody who is contacted for information has the most up-to-date information available to them.</p></speech>

The question about charging for bloods and phlebotomy was raised by Deputy Seamus Healy.  We are all aware of that problem.  There are general practitioners out there who are charging medical card holders.  Our position on it is pretty clear.  We believe it is not permitted under the contract and is not an appropriate way for general practitioners to deal with the issues and concerns they have.  We have written to all general practitioners, I think twice in the last two years, to remind them that they are not permitted to charge medical card holders under any circumstances.  Where clients and patients have brought this to our attention, we have refunded them and, in turn, withheld the amounts from the future payments due to those particular general practitioners.  It is a matter with which we are dealing under the negotiation process for the contract review with the IMO under the framework agreement.  It is not something I think is appropriate in terms of an approach to negotiating a new contract.  I say that with particular reference to the fact that medical card holders are the most disadvantaged sector of the community.  It is not at all appropriate that they would be charged.  We can remind general practitioners again of their obligations under the contract in that matter.</p></speech>

The first report of the clinical advisory group is being worked through at the moment.  The first report made eight recommendations and we have been dealing with them.  The first was the approvals for medical cards for children with a cancer diagnosis.  Other recommendations called for more flexibility in reviewing eligibility and we are working through those.  The operation of the long-term illness scheme, which is a bigger issue, will require closer liaison with the Department of Health.  Extension of services to public health nursing and home support outside of medical card eligibility is also being addressed, but is a more medium-term issue.  The review arrangements for discretionary medical cards and non-medical benefits are both being worked through by the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, at this time.  We anticipate a further report from the clinical advisory group shortly, which I am sure will address other issues in respect of the burden of illness.  Members will recall that the issue is a notoriously difficult one to grapple with and was of particular difficulty for the Keane review group in the first instance.  It has not gotten any easier but we are still grappling with measures that will hopefully improve the situation for applicants with critical and serious illness.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.600" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1029" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015120900002#FF01200"><p>I thank Ms Hoey and congratulate her on her appointment.  She said that the discretionary medical cards have increased by approximately 25,000 since 2014.  Has she any figures on how many people would have applied and did not get one?  On the over-70s who do not qualify for the general practitioner card, many of whom contact me quite often, under the discretionary medical card people are being told to apply again but for the under-70s section rather than over-70s.  Does Ms Hoey understand what I am saying?  Are there figures available in respect of people who are over 70, who are turned down and who then told to reapply but for the under-70s section?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.601" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1068" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015120900002#FF01300"><p>I welcome all the representatives from the HSE.  It is worth saying that over 1.7 million medical cards and over 400,000 general practitioner cards have been issued.  Over 200,000 children have been registered for the under-six scheme to date and nearly 50,000 people have registered for the over-70 scheme.</p><p>Much work has gone into that and the service should be congratulated on it.</p><p> When I became a Deputy in 2011, there were over 100 offices across the country processing medical card applications.  The centralised, uniform medical card application system seems to be working and to be a lot more organised than the old system.  It had a very shaky start in 2011.  Members of this committee visited the centre in Finglas twice in recent years and have seen at first hand the work that is being done.</p><p> It was stated 75% of applicants were deemed eligible for medical cards and 25% were not.   I am very impressed with this rate.  It was also stated that from 2005 to 2015, there has been a 33% increase in the number of medical cards and GP cards.  Could the witnesses provide a comparative analysis of the figures?  Some 86% of applicants completed their forms without assistance.  To me, this seems to be a very high number.  It was stated 19,500 items of information are received in the post every week.  This seems to be an awful lot of paperwork each week.  How many staff are working on this?</p><p> The number of discretionary medical cards has jumped from 71,000 in September 2014 to over 95,000 in December 2015.  I welcome that increase.  Deputy Byrne asked how many people were refused discretionary medical cards during that period.</p><p> The medical card service has come a long way.  For a long time, every time one looked at a newspaper or listened to a radio programme one encountered medical card problems.  It does not seem to be a major problem now.  I commend the staff involved.  It is nice to see the HSE doing a great job; I am not going to say it does not normally do a good job.  Sometimes it is nice to get a wee clap on the back.  The difference between a clap on the back and a kick on the backside is only six inches.  Well done.</p></speech>

I attended a briefing they gave in the audiovisual room recently at which many issues were covered.  I will not go over many of the issues that were raised today.  I welcome the positive aspects of the presentations.</p> <p>  I wish to refer to a couple of small points on medical card renewals.  There seems to be a problem affecting people on community employment, T&uacute;s or back-to-education schemes.  Some such people have come through our doors.  It has taken them quite a while to sort out their problems.  Even if they take up the schemes, and even if they take up employment, they should be entitled to keep their medical card.  I have encountered a few people who have been without a card for a few months.</p> <p>  With regard to terminal illness, I agree on the point on doctors not being inclined to produce a letter.  I encountered a case recently in which a person was asked for a land valuation.  He had only 31 acres but, given his illness, he would be unable to work that land.  It took quite a while to sort this out.  This brings me back to the issue of direct contact and the ability to speak to a decision-maker face to face.  Had I been able to speak to a decision-maker at the time, we could have sorted the problem within a day.  We have been harping on about a dedicated line for public representatives for a long time.  We just cannot seem to tie this down with the service.  There is such a line for almost all other Departments we deal with.  Will we ever have it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.604" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1075" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015120900002#GG00300"><p>I thank the delegates for attending.  As with Deputy McLellan, I was at the briefing in the audiovisual room.  I note a real sense of calm and, more important, control over what was obviously very much out of control not so long ago.  That is a real credit to all the staff, particularly those in Finglas.  There was a lot of stress among those staff, just as there was among those at the other end of the system.  From what I hear, there is a real sense of camaraderie and of being listened to.  It is a real pleasure to be where we are.  Well done.  I hope that does not sound patronising.</p> <p>  One of the clinical advisory group recommendations that was taken on board this year concerned cards for those under 18 with cancer.  It is very welcome.  How did we do that without changing the legislation?  With regard to other ailments, the legislation had to be changed, yet we were able to proceed without changing the legislation for the under-18s.  Did we just grant them discretionary medical cards?  Did we change the discretionary route we use?  If so, do the delegates envisage a stage where we could deal with 19-year-olds, 29-year-olds or 59-year-olds with cancer or other illnesses in the same manner?  I am quite sure treatment is as financially taxing on the family of a 29-year-old as the family of a nine-year-old.  Could the delegates outline what has been achieved?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.605" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/978" speakername="David Stanton" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015120900002#GG00400"><p>I have three issues to raise.  I join colleagues in congratulating the primary care reimbursement service on the good work it has been doing.</p> <p>  The first issue concerns the justice aspect.  If somebody is declared bankrupt, his income drops.  While he may have a very good job, a certain amount of his income is taken away by the financial institutions, thereby resulting in a net income that is quite low and which can remain so for at least eight years.  I am told gross income is taken into account in a medical card application, which does not reflect the reality.  It might be an issue that has not come across the delegates' bows yet but they might examine it.  The incidence of this problem is increasing and it is causing hardship for people.  Some have informed me the gross income is taken into account by the service, not the real net income after the banks or financial institutions have taken their cut.</p> <p>  Second, I understand that in the case of people under 23 who are living at home and who wish to apply for a medical card, it is the whole family that makes an application.  There is no way in which the individual can make an application on the form as it stands giving the household income.  One way out of this might be to have a different form for such people so that the household income could be included initially rather than having to make two applications.  The current methodology is quite cumbersome.</p> <p>  Third, where somebody with a serious illness and who requires treatment straightaway applies for a card, there might be a delay for a number of months.  In the meantime, the individual incurs significant expenses.  Reimbursement occurs only when the card is granted.  Is there any way of backdating?  I am told it is not possible.  I ask the officials to consider backdating to the time of application, especially if significant expenses have been incurred in the interim by somebody with cancer or some other such condition.</p></speech>

We also met people on the subject of Huntington's disease.  Subsequent to our meeting in January, we wrote to Mr. O'Brien about the issues identified by the group lobbying on behalf of those with that disease.  Fibromyalgia and asthma have also been raised.  It was said to us that kidney transplant patients had their treatment stopped because they were over the income threshold.</p> <p>  The medical card review group reported in September of last year that there was no internationally accepted list of diseases, prioritised according to severity, and referred to the need to move away from purely financial assessments and consider the quality of life of an individual rather than just the disease or condition.  I apologise for being a little long-winded.  With regard to eligibility for ongoing supports, is there any movement that might benefit the people I have just mentioned?  This committee meets their lobby groups and advocates on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.607" nospeaker="true" time="14:30:00" ><p>In particular, I refer to the people concerned about fibromyalgia who have become very exercised recently.</p></speech>

First, I acknowledge the gratifying complimentary remarks on the medical card system.  It was an area that was in a controversial place for quite some time.  Hopefully, we are coming out of that.</p> <p>  On the over-70s medical card and the issue of discretion, I might ask colleagues to comment.  My understanding is that there is no discretionary provision in the over-70s medical card scheme.  One either meets the gross eligibility criteria, or one does not.  There is no question of discretion being applied.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.613" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hennessy" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015120900002#HH00700"><p>That is probably where the dilemma applies.  The test for the over-70s card is a very straightforward one.  If one is pursuing an application for an ordinary medical card with discretionary provision, one needs to supply far more material and information.  That is the reason people are being invited to apply for the full card as opposed to the over-70s.  If one qualifies for the over-70s card, it is much simplier and one avoids the necessity for that complication.  If one happens to be over the gross income threshold, there is no option to apply discretion and to do the test.</p></speech>

Many of us find that the over-70s persons who apply are not necessary looking for the GP card but for the ancillary supports and services, appliances and medication that come with it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.617" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hennessy" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015120900002#HH01100"><p>It was raised by a number of members today and is clearly arising as a particular issue.  We may need to look at our communication material, information and supports around that to make it easier and more understandable for applicants.  We will certainly take that one away and Mr. Kieran Healy can have a look at it.</p> <p>  Mr. Healy might wish to speak about the help and assistance available locally for applicants.  Deputy Healy mentioned face-to-face contact and the importance of having a human being to deal with rather than someone at the end of a phone.  That was always intended to be part of the reform programme in the GMS.  It was intended to re-establish that local dimension and to keep the best of what can be done from a central point and on a national basis while restoring what can be of assistance and help to applicants at local level.  Mr. Healy might be able to speak to that for a moment in terms of some initiatives happening at local level.</p> <p>  The issue of the figures on refusals and appeals was mentioned by a number of members.  We will provide the figures.  We have published figures on the number of applicants refused and on the number and success rate of appeals.  We will be able to help members with those figures.  I thought we had a dedicated line for Oireachtas Members, but that might be confirmed.</p> <p>  We will take away the issue of the grant date for applications and have a look at it.  To be fair, if someone can make a reasonable case that expense was incurred between the date of application and the date of grant, we would need to take a look at it.</p> <p>  The issue of support for groups where harm has been the consequence of medical treatment was raised.  We have been taking a very sympathetic approach to those in any case and a number of very obvious groups come to mind.  I am not as familiar with the particular groups mentioned, but I would be happy to take up those issues and to take the details from the Deputy later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.618" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Marie Hoey" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015120900002#HH01200"><p>A question was raised on the number of applications that are successful and those that are not.  Overall, approximately 80% of all applications we receive are successful.  Approximately 20% are not.  That is just an overall figure in the year to date.  The number of appeals we receive has reduced greatly compared even with early this year and certainly to last year.  We receive approximately 20 to 25 appeals per week on average and approximately 25% to 30% are upheld.  We were asked about the number who apply for a discretionary cards.  People to not apply for discretionary cards as such.  It is as they go through the process that discretion becomes an issue where the person does not qualify on foot of means but there is evidence of a medical condition.  We take that condition into consideration and decide whether a card should be awarded based on discretion.  Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick asked how many staff we have based on the volume of work we process.  Currently, we have 150 staff at the national unit in Finglas.</p> <p>  Deputy Sandra McLellan asked about the number for the dedicated line which is (01) 864 7180.</p></speech>

I was speaking about the decision-maker at the end of the dedicated line.  That is where the problem is.  We have a dedicated line, but we do not get to speak to a decision-maker.  That is the problem.  I have highlighted that before on numerous occasions as have other members.</p></speech>

I ask my colleague, Ms McArdle, to go through what we call the 16 to 25 year olds.</p></speech>

There are two categories within the group, one being dependent or financially dependent upon their parents or guardians.  Within that category are three further categories.  Defined dependants live with a parent or guardian while in full-time education, live with a parent or guardian while earning less than &euro;164 or live with a parent or guardian while in receipt of a social welfare allowance less than &euro;188.  However, people within the 16 to 25 year old age bracket can be deemed to be financially independent where they live with parents or guardians but earn more than &euro;164, live with a parent or guardian while on a full rate of social welfare of an amount greater than &euro;186 or more, or live with parents but also spouse, partner and, or, children.  There are two categories.  It is a complicated number but clients fall into one of those categories and their eligibility is assessed on that category.</p></speech>

We recognise that the good part of processing in terms of centralisation must be matched with a wide footprint nationally so that people can access advice and information on how to apply and the eligibility criteria at local level.  We recognise this.  In terms of the recommendations from both reports, we have already begun an engagement with the staff at a local health office level and staff in the acute hospitals sector, mainly medical social workers who are a first point of contact for people in the hospital setting.  Medical social workers provide advice that a person in particular circumstances should apply for a medical card.  We are endeavouring to do this in particular with local health office staff, but it is not just with them.  We are also inviting local public representatives to come to those information exchange sessions.</p><p>We are also inviting GPs and their staff in order that we can explain the complexity of the assessment process and provide clarity, as we are trying to do today, on some of the complications in establishing eligibility and the documentation required to provide us with a seamless way of assessing the application form.  As we communicate better with local offices and push out the information, we hope it will be more freely available to a wide range of stakeholders, including public representatives who we know have direct contact with the public and those who come to their constituency offices on a daily basis.  The more we can provide clarity on the assessment guidelines and the legislation underpinning what we do, the more we hope the communication approach will improve the information available.</p></speech>

The volume of correspondence is an issue about which colleagues may be able to speak as there are electronic solutions coming on-stream that should dramatically reduce the level of physical or paper correspondence that ties up so much time and effort.  Deputy Regina Doherty mentioned the decision taken on cancer patients under 18 years of age.  The director general exercised his discretion on that issue, probably at the absolute limit of what the legislation permitted under section 45(7) and very much on the basis of a recommendation from the clinical advisory group.  That may be an avenue to which we might take some of the groups mentioned by the Chairman.</p></speech>

At some stage the committee might be notified of the outcome.  There is a dedicated line for public representatives, but there seems to be a glitch between that section and the main section.  For example, if an applicant sends additional information and he or she comes to the office of a public representative a day or two afterwards, the person on the dedicated line for public representatives may know that something has come in but may not be able to identify what.  That is a problem.  If the individual was able to say everything was fine or that X, Y or Z had been left out and something else was required, it would help to streamline the process.</p></speech>

I would like to briefly introduce my colleagues, Ms. Bridget Sleap from HelpAge International, to which we are affiliated and which has worked to advance the human rights of older people for many years, and Ms. Lianne Murphy, our ageing and development officer.</p> <p>  We are here today because we believe that the rights of older persons are not effectively protected by our current human rights infrastructure and that a new international convention on the rights of older people would go some considerable way towards fixing this.  Although many international human rights instruments are universal by nature, older people are rarely specifically mentioned in the instruments themselves or in the recommendations made by the committees established to monitor compliance with them. International human rights law has little to say on issues that are particular to older people, such as elder abuse or support in long-term care.  Similar gaps in how human rights law applied to child protection and adoption, for example, highlighted the need for the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  A new convention for older people would articulate what human rights law has to say about the issues of concern to them and, if ratified by Ireland, would be directly applicable here.</p> <p>  There are many practical instances in which the rights of older people are not effectively protected here in Ireland.  One area of particular concern to Age Action Ireland is the issue of elder abuse, which is a violation of an older person&rsquo;s right to be free from violence and not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.  The 2002 report of the working group on elder abuse describes it as "a single or repeated act or lack of appropriate action occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person or violates their human and civil rights".  Institutional elder abuse takes the form of not meeting the appropriate care needs of older people within institutional settings.  I am sure committee members are familiar with HIQA reports on nursing homes in Ireland which would fit that bill.</p><p>An individual example of this is the recent case highlighted in the media of Mr. Gerry Feeney, an 87-year-old man suffering from Parkinson's disease who spent some time in Beaumont Hospital before-----</p></speech>

I am sorry about that.  In that particular case, the individual was left in a soiled state in public view for several hours.  When his incontinence pad came undone he was left exposed on a hospital ward.  His family advised that he had been traumatised by his treatment.  There are numerous HIQA reports into conditions in Irish nursing homes that highlight similar issues of neglect, and committee members will be familiar with the work done by Deputy Anne Ferris on mandatory retirement, which is also an issue with regard to the right to employment for older people.</p> <p>  I will now ask my colleague, Ms Bridget Sleap, to go into more detail on why we need a new stand-alone convention.</p></speech>

It has a deeply negative impact on older people's lives and results in their exclusion and marginalisation.  Older people throughout the world are subjected to discrimination and denial of rights across every aspect of their lives.  Existing international human rights mechanisms are not effectively protecting older people's rights.  They lack the necessary specificity on how human rights apply in older age and what attention there is to older people is confined to only a few areas of their lives.  As a result, older people remain unaware of their rights and states fail to report on how they are implementing international human rights treaties in relation to them.  National legislation protecting rights is often inconsistent across different jurisdictions and this patchwork of protection undermines the universality of human rights.  The UN open-ended working group, OEWG, on aging was established in 2010 to identify possible gaps in the existing international human rights framework and how to address them, including through new instruments.  After six sessions the working group has reached a consensus that there are serious human rights implementation and protection gaps that need to be urgently addressed.</p> <p>  During the same period we have seen the appointment of a new UN independent expert and the establishment of various regional instruments including the adoption of the Council of Europe's recommendation on the promotion of the human rights of older persons.  Most recently, a UN resolution recognised that the diversity of international policies, standards and mechanisms aimed at protecting older people's rights may lead to inconsistent protection as well as gaps in the reporting and monitoring of existing treaty obligations to older people.  Adopted by consensus and co-sponsored by a broad range of member states, the resolution reaffirms the mandate of OEWG to discuss and present proposals for a new multilateral instrument.</p> <p>  A new international convention has an advantage over other options in that it would establish universal norms and standards that challenge ageism, prohibit discrimination and promote dignity and autonomy in older age.  It would clarify states' human rights obligations and, in doing so, enables us to better understand and claim our rights.  It would provide a more effective way to hold governments to account for their human rights obligations.  Just as important, it would help change our attitudes towards older people and to older age, including our own, to see it as a time of continued human flourishing rather than just a time of loss and decline.  This would be transformative and something that generic human rights instruments have failed to do.</p></speech>

As they may be aware, the Seanad has a public consultation committee and our first report, a few years ago, was on the rights of older people.  We recommended movement towards the development of a treaty for older people at UN level.  I am on record as being in favour of that, and our colleagues in the centres of disability and human rights at NUI Galway have been working in this field.  One of the things we learned during the consultation was that, in the process of moving towards a UN treaty on the rights of older people, the EU group of which Ireland was a part was not in favour.  Maybe it was not that they were not in favour but that they were unconvinced of the need for it.  They spoke about treaty fatigue and asked whether we needed another treaty on the rights of another group of people.  Can the witnesses update us on where the negotiations are in respect of the EU group feeding into the UN?  The witnesses referred to the UN open-ended working group on aging.</p></speech>

It has not ruled out the possibility of a convention but it has said it wants to see existing instruments implemented.</p> <p>  Slovenia, an EU member state, has now come out in favour of a convention, and we have heard that a significant event coming up is the report of the independent expert in September 2016.  Although it is to the human rights council and is, therefore, separate, the outcome of the report on the extent to which existing instruments are being implemented effectively will have a significant impact on some member states' positions, and this may affect the EU position.  There is a diversity of opinion beneath the common EU position and it may well be affected by the independent expert's report.  Some of the arguments they are using, such as treaty fatigue, are similar to the ones used in the discussion on the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities before the drafting stage.</p></speech>

We hope the sub-committee will raise with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade the need for Ireland to take a more positive stance in the OEWG.  As Ms Sleap said, Slovenia has taken a more positive stance than other EU member states.  In November a resolution, co-sponsored by a number of EU member states including Austria and Croatia, was passed at the United Nations agreeing that gaps in human rights law protection existed.  A move in the EU common position, though very slow and gradual, is taking place.  Any pressure that the sub-committee could bring to bear on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to support that would be very welcome.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran said the rights of older persons were not effectively protected in our current human rights infrastructure and that a new international convention on the rights of older people would go a long way towards fixing this.  How does one move from the convention, and its principles and ideals, to practical support for older people on the ground?  We respect the rights of older people, but many of them, particularly those on their own, do not have the necessary supports on the ground.</p><p>How does that lead towards providing practical services for these older people?</p></speech>

That work will continue but in the long term we believe a convention on the rights of older people would be very helpful in terms of protecting those human rights.  Once the convention is passed, and obviously there is no draft text for the convention at present, the issue then would be to hold the Government to account in delivering on those commitments.  For example, Ireland has made commitments regarding another international treaty, the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights.  Ireland has signed and ratified that treaty.  We can use that treaty mechanism to try to hold Ireland to account in delivering on those rights and to put attention on the national and global scale of the failures or successes of the Government in terms of delivering on those human rights commitments.  In terms of a practical difference, if a person in Cork, for example, cannot get home help, an international convention, if it was ratified tomorrow, would not necessarily change that, but we believe a convention would be very important in terms of changing it over the long term and challenging issues of ageism and discrimination and giving us something which we can use to hold future Governments to account.</p></speech>

That is the problem I have with many organisations.  Returning to the second question on institutional elder abuse, I have come across this recently in my local constituency.  From Age Action's experience, is that a widespread issue in nursing homes, hospitals or institutional settings?  Is this the experience of members of Age Action who work directly with older people or is it that every now and again it finds an isolated case?</p></speech>

Last year, 2,600 cases were reported.  The most common form of abuse was psychological, the next was financial while physical made up about 300 to 400 of those cases.  That 2,600 is the highest number that has ever been reported since elder abuse reporting began in 2007.  Our own experience from speaking to people who contact us and raise issues of elder abuse with our information service is an enormous reluctance on the part of people to bring forward these cases.  In many situations, if it is a family member, as the majority of elder abuse cases are, they simply do not want to get a family member in trouble.  They do not want to get the Garda or the HSE involved in family situations.  In institutional settings, it can be a concern over the repercussions of raising those issues.  The problem with elder abuse is the lack of reporting of it.  The fact is that many older people do not categorise necessarily what is happening to them as elder abuse in the first place.  That is why we are trying to encourage people, and we encourage our members and anybody who contacts us, to refer these cases and these situations to the HSE who have case workers dedicated to working on the issue of elder abuse.</p></speech>

She talked about exclusion and marginalisation but I would go one step further and say that ageism and the damage it does to older people and senior citizens shortens their lifespan.  I know many former colleagues, from my previous life as a school teacher, who retired after 40 years service and within a year or two of retiring a very high percentage had died; that was in the past 20 or 30 years.  If ageism is allowed to develop, it will shorten the lifespan of many older people who have much to contribute to society, whether they move on to a new career or get involved in some other way.  That ageism can lead to the death of many good people who want to contribute to society and their country.  Would the witness agree with that statement or is it too harsh?</p></speech>

There is, probably, evidence to support the relationship between ageism and physical health.  HelpAge International is a member of a coalition of organisations.  We did a consultation across 50 countries and asked older people how being treated differently and discriminated against affected them.  They said they were made to feel incompetent, that they were useless and that they were a burden on society.  This had a huge impact on their mental wellbeing as well.  I think it can be harmful in many different ways.</p></speech>

Following on from some of the responses to other colleagues, I am interested to note that the impact of the convention would be more likely to be long term and would have symbolic and declaratory effect.  I am interested in the substance of it.  Mr. Moran said there is no draft text but I assume that work has been done at international level on the content and the substantive rights guaranteed in it.  Can the witnesses outline some of those or the shape of that convention in some way to give us a better sense of it?</p></speech>

An inter-American convention on the promotion of the human rights of older persons was adopted this year and a draft protocol to the African charter on human and people's rights is up for adoption in January.  It is interesting that we can look at those to get a sense of what some of the substantive content might look like and also at the UN open-ended working group.  There is a mix of standards in other international treaties and how they specifically apply in the context of older age and specific measures that states could take to meet their obligations.  That is specific articulation.  The area of elder abuse has already been discussed.  There is also the right to palliative care and long-term care.  These areas of rights that are, perhaps, unique or particular to older age have not been articulated elsewhere but are generated from our interpretation of other rights such as the right to health, social security and social protection.</p></speech>

I know it only too well from our hearings on the abolition of  the mandatory retirement age.  The important question for us today as a sub-committee is how we can help with the open-ended working group to get the whole issue further on the agenda and what the Government can do.  In that context the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was mentioned.  Is the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade working on this issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.677" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justin Moran" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JU22015120900002#C01800"><p>I can only imagine that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would have been allocated lead responsibility for this as an international treaty as part of international negotiations.  A treaty like this cuts across so many other Departments and many different policy areas.  I am sure committee members are conscious of the fact that once it is the responsibility of one Department, the other Departments say it will take care of that and will push that forward and as it is an international negotiation, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is taking the lead.</p><p>We hope the Government will push the EU position forward or possibly consider going beyond it, as Slovenia has done, by supporting a convention on the rights of older people.  The EU action plan on human rights and democracy commits the European Union to increasing awareness of human rights and the specific needs of older people, paying particular attention to age-based discrimination.  There is commitment at EU level, but the difficulty, as Ms Sleap touched on earlier, is not that they are opposed to a convention, rather that they are not necessarily convinced of its merits.  The obligation on organisations such as Age Action and HelpAge is to provide legislators and Departments with information and evidence to support the need for a new convention.  We hope legislators will use their positions to write to Ministers and raise these as topical issues in the D&aacute;il or Seanad to make sure it is taken seriously by the Department and moved forward.  That is what we are looking for today. </p></speech>

We often hear that legislation and actions need to be equality approved and in this context we often think of gender and disability rather than older people.  The culture of respect for older people has changed.  When I was growing up, we called our neighbours Mrs. Coffey, Mrs. Byrne or Mrs. Butler; we never called people by their first name.  There has been a shift in our culture and there is not the same respect for older people that there was 20 or 30 years ago.  Organisations like Age Action are very important.  I know from reading the newspapers and from Age Action's publication that it looks at every single aspect of life and equality proofing regarding older people.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for coming here today.  It is a very important issue.  The sub-committee should agree to ask Senator Zappone to contact the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and any other Department to support the convention. </p></speech>

Age Action recently carried out research to look at the issue of interculturalism in nursing homes and residential care settings.  It looked in particular at care workers who were born outside of Ireland and one interesting thing was the positive experience of many nursing home residents because of the respect for older people and aging that exists in the cultures of such workers.  Perhaps that respect has been eroded somewhat in Ireland but if the convention or suggestions that are being made to tackle ageism will help restore it, it is worth doing.</p></speech>

One of the key issues is that there are privately run nursing homes and a public-run HSE system.  If I was being abused in a public nursing home, the HSE has power and authority, but if it was a private nursing home, I would go first of all to the nursing home owner, make her call the manager and make my complaint, after which nothing would be done.  I have come across hundreds of complaints through HIQA, all of which were typed up and recorded beautifully, yet nothing happened.  There is significant abuse.  I have given a file with over 900 cases of abuse - some very minor, others very serious - to the Garda, which is looking at the issue.  The Ombudsman got involved and since the end of August 2015 the Ombudsman is a notice party to all complaints made, which I welcome.</p> <p>  The rights of people in institutional care is a huge issue.  The problem is that if people are in a home, they are afraid to complain because they may be put out.  There is significant evidence of people being excluded or put out of nursing homes because they or their family complained.  There is also a huge issue of people not being allowed into a nursing home because they have serious medical problems such as dementia.  There are allegations that some nursing homes cherry pick their residents and will not take a person with dementia.  </p> <p>  In some states in America, the residents of nursing homes have a bill of rights, which are aspirational.  It may include eight or ten rights, such as the right to be treated properly and with respect and not be abused.  We need to move into the area of affirming the rights of people particularly those in institutional care.  I acknowledge the significant increase in the quality of care in private and public nursing homes in recent years.  What further steps should be taken, particularly in institutional care, to vindicate the rights of people and protect them when they wish to make complaints?  </p> <p>  Dementia care is a huge issue.  If I open a private nursing home, I should be obliged to accept people suffering from dementia and to have a strategy to deal with it, depending on the number of beds I have.  It is a significant issue.  I hope I am not asking too many questions.</p></speech>

I preface all my comments with my acknowledgement of the significant improvements in quality of care but there are very significant abuses - sexual, financial, emotional and family.  There are huge problems which we need to address.  I am also concerned with the issue of dementia care.  More and more people will suffer from dementia because people will live longer.  The question of dementia-friendly cities, towns, policies and departments is important.  We need to shake up the whole system from its roots.  The issue is respect for everybody.  We have gay rights, gender rights and employment rights, yet we do not have enough dementia-focused policies.  We need to drive that agenda.</p></speech>

It is also important to reflect for a moment on the fact that the convention would apply globally.  The majority of older people throughout the world do not have a state pension, and we are fortunate in some ways it is here.  It is important to look at the benefit it would have in various contexts.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy O'Dowd's comments.  We cannot wait for an international convention on the rights of older people to sort out the problems happening in our nursing homes and residential settings.  If and when the convention comes together, we would like it to contain provisions which enable older people to stay at home, as many do not want to be in a nursing home and many do not need to be there in the first place.  We would also like it to include provisions on their right to a home, their right to choose where to age and the right to age with dignity.  If and when these rights are written into a convention, and when the convention is signed and ratified by Ireland, it will make a difference to older people in nursing home and residential settings.  However, that is down the line and people are in this situation now.  I am happy to speak to the Deputy about this in more detail after the meeting.</p> <p>  We receive numerous complaints to our information line on care and situations in nursing home settings.  One of the most common is about nursing home residents being charged by private nursing homes for services they do not, and in many cases cannot, use.</p></speech>

It made an enormous number of recommendations on improving services and enabling residents to take control and have a little influence over nursing home situations.  There are supposed to be nursing home residents' committees.  How many are there, how do they operate and are they listened to or just talking shops?  These are some of the discussions we need to have.</p> <p>  Ms Sleap will speak on the issue of dementia.</p></speech>

This is with regard to the intersection between older age and dementia.  The convention should contain a clear prohibition on age discrimination and recognition of this intersectional multiple discrimination.  This would expose and address some of the issues being described.</p> <p>  The convention would add to recognising the rights of people in residential or other care settings.  There are some voluntary charters which look at the rights of people with dementia.  There is one in Scotland.  There are also such charters with regard to the rights of residents in care settings.  There is a European charter on the rights and responsibilities of people in long-term care.  These are just voluntary charters and a convention would bring a legal obligation to them.  It would also recognise the third-party obligation of states to address the issue of public and private settings, whereby states have an obligation to protect and respect the rights of people in private settings where the services are provided by private actors as well as by public service providers.</p></speech>

The discussion we are having clearly indicates we have a long way to go to protect the rights of older people, whether with regard to mandatory retirement age, long-term residential care issues, dementia care or elder abuse, which was also raised in the presentation.  My reflection with regard to the question raised initially by Deputy McGrath, to which the Chairman has brought us back, is how, ultimately, the convention would result in practical supports.  It may not be so far down the road because in the process of encouraging Ireland to support the development and writing of a convention, there could be much advocacy and awareness raising in this regard.  The most important aspect is that there could be a parliamentary conversation on what it would mean, why we would need it and where there are gaps, as well as perhaps a national conversation, which would raise a focus on the rights of older people in a way there has not been before.  This might make us create different laws and policies in the process of getting to the convention.</p> <p>  If we do get a convention, and I hope we do, we would have international law to which we must pay attention in our domestic lawmaking and policy-making.  One of the problems, which is why this committee is so important and why we fought so hard to get it established, is that often parliamentarians are not part of the conversation to see how well we do in monitoring these international laws.  The committee tried to examine whether we could have a part to play in supporting the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Justice and Equality in the ratification of the international convention on the rights of people with disabilities.  We were told we could not do so because the law would have to be changed.  Who is doing this then?  It is various Departments and civil servants.  I am not saying they are not doing a great job, but parliamentarians are not engaged in the conversation.  When we are not engaged in the conversation, we do not understand how international law on human rights can help us in our law making to achieve more quickly better long-term residential care or support to people in the community.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Ferris's question on what we can do, we would probably have to write to the Minister for Justice and Equality to write to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade because this is a justice sub-committee.  We could support the witnesses in encouraging Ireland and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which again raises the question why it should be left to that Department, to see the merits in such a convention.  This is the whole point, and the better parliamentarians understand what the merits might be, the better we can encourage this.  That was a comment.</p></speech>

With regard to engagement with legislators, if we look at the points Deputy O'Dowd raised earlier, legislators have practical first-hand experience and knowledge through dealing with constituents, community groups, residents' groups and disability groups, and if this knowledge is not involved in the discussions on international human rights treaties we have the issue we have discussed several times, which is them happening very far away but not really having a practical impact for somebody looking for home care in Cork or a nursing home in May.  If the gap is there, it will not be resolved unless people with experience are involved in it.  Age Action Ireland and NGOs represent older people and people in these settings so we can do some of it, but legislators, politicians and elected representatives are very familiar with it and can bring a level of experience to it.</p> <p>  Comments were made on how the discussion itself could bring about change.  We speak about conventions and treaties, but change comes from changing mindsets.  Unless we have a changed mindset, and an understanding of seeing older people as individuals with human rights and an understanding of how this makes a practical difference, we will not get the convention.  This is where the discussion and the debate, either a parliamentary debate or a national debate, is important.  It is only when minds are changed that people will open up and start to think perhaps we should look at a convention and consider these options and possibilities.  The debate itself will help to change minds, and in doing so will, hopefully, have a knock-on effect on how people create policy today, whether in the Department of Health or the Department of Justice and Equality.  If they are forced to be part of these debates and must engage it will, hopefully, have a knock-on effect on how they deliver services and programmes on a daily basis.</p></speech>

Some of the situations we discovered in terms of human interaction would not have happened to older people 30 years ago.  I think it has got worse.</p><p> I am asking for examples of good practice.  Age Action is working with sister organisations in 76 countries across the world.  Have the witnesses come across a couple of countries that have got both the rights aspect for older people and the services and societal supports on the ground right?  In our context, I have come across a recent example of best practice from a very unlikely source for many people.  The way the Traveller community, which is an ethnic group in this country, treats its senior citizens and older people is amazing.  They have a tradition within their community of ultimate support and respect for the older generation.  It is something from which we, as a broader society, could learn.  From Age Action's point of view, it is working very closely right across 76 countries.  Which one or two have it right or which country has it near enough to right?</p></speech>

There is evidence from South Africa, for example, which has a near-universal non-contributory pension, that this has had an impact on the way older people are respected.  While very different from Ireland, that context also involves economic migration and the impact of HIV and AIDS in changing family structures.  Traditional support systems are also changing.  There is evidence that when older people's rights are respected, this can have an impact on the broader way we live together in society.</p></speech>

For example, we were looking at sheltered housing recently and examples of this in Britain, the Netherlands and Germany, some of which are very innovative.  There is a sheltered housing project in the Netherlands, for example, that allows people to group on the basis of culture.  There are both good and bad sides to this.  It means there is a group of people together who may be very devout in their religious beliefs, so sheltered housing is provided that reflects and enables those belief.  In other cases, it may be a hobby and sheltered housing may be provided for people with particular interests.  Innovative work has been done on specific issues.  The problem is that what Deputy McGrath is looking for is a one-size-fits-all approach, although that phrase is flippant.  He is looking for something that looks at it as a whole and, unfortunately, I do not think there is a country that does that.  If he wants to discuss countries that do sheltered housing or state pensions better than Ireland, we can do that.  There are countries that do that.  We are looking for a country that looks at the culture of older people and that understands, respects and enables it.  It is a search that we are-----</p></speech>

That is the reality.</p></speech>

I briefly touched on the point earlier that in many countries there is no state pension.  When there is no income like that, people step in to look after older people, take care of them and support them.  That can have its own negative aspects, whereby the older person is just seen as a burden.  People think they have to care for them because the state is not there.  What we need is an approach that sees older people not as a burden, vulnerable or dependent but as people in their own right, and which approach enables them to continue to participate in their community, whatever kind of community that might be.</p></speech>

The issue of culture and mindset is coming up repeatedly.  I remember meeting someone from South Korea a few years ago.  They said their culture had been such that older people were respected hugely.  The eldest son in the family had the responsibility of minding the parents and looking after them, but that was changing a little there at the time and they were concerned about that.  It is a moving thing.  We use the term "older people" rather than "the elderly", which is a little more objective than subjective.  A good friend of mine said to me at one stage that she would not go into a nursing home because they were all old people in there, and she was 95.  There are people who are old and who are 55 and I know people who are very active and young at heart at 85.  A good friend of mine is 85 and he is just amazing.  How does one define older people?</p></speech>

It varies so much, and also in terms of our attitudes.  In 2012, there was a Eurobarometer survey across Europe, which looked at the age at which people across different countries, genders and groups thought old age began.  It varied hugely, from early 50s to mid-70s.  For the purposes of a convention, looking at a single chronological age definition will not be that helpful because it will not capture the levels of ageism and discrimination that people experience at different ages.  The Chairman has highlighted one of the key areas of debate around a convention and its purpose.</p></speech>

The State pension kicks in at 66 and there was a time when one might have expected to live into one's late 60s and early 70s.  We are going to be living into our 80s and 90s, which is something to be celebrated.  It is often seen as the pensions time bomb, but it is one of the biggest success stories globally over recent years that people are living longer and healthier lives.  Therefore, the definition of old age is going to change as we live longer, healthier and more active lives.</p></speech>

It has been going up quite a bit over recent decades.  Is the need for proactive respect and support, rather than passive respect and support, something this convention might bring about, that people might begin to think more positively and in a more focused way about support?  Living with dignity is also included, along with empowerment of older people.  Sometimes people go into nursing homes or hospitals and they are disempowered.  What Deputy O'Dowd brought up touched on it quite a bit.  The idea of residents' committees, which were mentioned, brings back the power to the residents in these places.  Will the witnesses comment on the issue of proactive respect and empowerment of people?</p></speech>

It is central.</p></speech>

It is all very well telling nursing home residents that they have a right to a residents' committee and a right to stand.  One has to explain that to them and to support and empower them.  There is substantial work to be done.  Any time I have dealt with international human rights law, there has always been the suggestion that the job is done when one gets the treaty.  The major work comes after that in terms of enabling people to campaign for their human rights, empowering them to do so and ensuring governments realise the treaty is just the beginning of the work.  They must then push this forward and, in a proactive way, deliver the necessary legislative change.</p></speech>

This has been a good debate.  It is a pity that it is not being held in the D&aacute;il Chamber, as many ideas have been floated at this meeting.  All politicians agree that older people's trump card is the power of voting.  Every Deputy is conscious of the fact that many older people are guaranteed to use that power.  As their representatives, the witnesses should encourage it because they are an important part of the democratic process and can use their clout to push the issues for which the witnesses are fighting.  We will listen.</p></speech>

The convention is excellent and will be ground breaking, but we as a country must vindicate each and every one of those rights and, from a political perspective, invest responsibility in one Minister or Department to ensure that all agencies do so and all policies are proofed as regards older people.</p> <p>  The most important point that I can make is that approximately one in ten people in our society has cognition problems, for example, an inability to understand or communicate effectively because of disability or dementia.  Dementia-friendly cities and towns are key to vindicating people's rights.  A major problem is that, if one has dementia, one cannot vindicate one's rights because, by definition, one is not in control of one's own life.  This significant issue must be addressed.  We can write all of this down, print it in glossy booklets and circulate those, but unless someone is driving the agenda, nothing will happen.</p></speech>

I will discuss how the Public Appointments Service, PAS, manages recruitment panels.  By way of assisting the committee, I will read an opening statement, which briefly explains the functions of PAS, sets out some background detail as to our current levels of activity, explains the general process regarding the management of recruitment panels and outlines how PAS makes decisions as regards the operation of specific recruitment panels.</p> <p>  PAS was established under the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.  The Act also established the Commission for Public Service Appointments, CPSA, which acts as the licence-granting authority for relevant public service recruitment bodies.  The commission is the regulator overseeing relevant public sector appointment processes and also publishes statutory codes of practice governing recruitment process to which licensees, such as PAS, must adhere.  Under sections 33 and 34 of the Act, PAS was established to act as the centralised recruitment, assessment and selection body for the Civil Service and other public service bodies.  Under the Act, PAS is empowered to carry out all the procedures necessary to undertake the recruitment, assessment and selection of suitable candidates for appointment and, in so doing, to determine the criteria for selection and the form of selection process to be adopted in accordance with the principles of the Act and the CPSA code of practice.  PAS is independent in the exercise of its functions and, in recognition of this independence, is in receipt of its own Vote, for which I am the Accounting Officer.  PAS has a staff of 127 civil servants, comprising 115 full-time equivalents, and its budget 2015 is &euro;8.9 million.</p> <p>  PAS undertakes recruitment activities across a wide range of roles and on behalf of a diverse range of public bodies.  PAS recruits for the Civil Service, the Health Service Executive, local authorities, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a wide range of other public bodies.  In recruiting for these organisations, PAS recruits to: top and senior management positions; senior specialist positions; medical consultant positions; middle management positions; Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na trainee positions; graduate and technical positions; and clerical and other entry positions.</p> <p>  During 2015, PAS will have run 430 recruitment campaigns, processed more than 55,000 applications, interviewed 7,600 people and recommended 4,300 people for appointment.  Since November 2014, PAS also has responsibility for the operation of the revised process for making appointments to State boards.  As a public service body, PAS is committed to the highest standards of merit-based recruitment practice and to maintaining a high level of compliance with the CPSA codes of practice, as mentioned earlier.  In addition, PAS is very conscious of the general requirements on public bodies to act in ways that are fair, consistent and in accordance with good administrative practice.  PAS operates within a strict legal and regulatory framework to safeguard the core principles of Civil Service employment which have played such an important role since the foundation of the State in ensuring that successive Governments have benefited from the advice and support of an impartial, committed and politically-neutral civil and public service, often during periods of acute economic and political challenge.</p> <p>  PAS prides itself on the delivery of a client-focused and candidate-centric recruitment and selection service.  The values underpinning our work are those of openness, transparency and the making of merit-based appointments.  In addition, PAS has a strong track record of independence and integrity in its work for both clients and candidates.  One of the challenges for PAS in running a complex and multi-level recruitment service on the scale I have indicated, is to ensure that the principle of fairness is maintained while also recognising that a one-size-fits-all process is unlikely to be appropriate across a recruitment landscape encompassing, for example, Secretaries General, consultant psychiatrists, meteorologists and Garda trainees.</p> <p>  PAS has a process in place for the management of recruitment panels, as follows.  First, a recruitment competition is organised and advertised based on a client request and the appropriate sanction being in place.  The vast majority of recruitment competitions are open competitions, which means applications are invited from any candidate who believes he or she meets the selection criteria.  While a vacancy might arise in a specific office, applications are not confined to a specific office.  People can apply from outside the civil and public service or across different sectors of the public service.  Next, a panel is formed following the final, competitive, stage of a selection process.  The intention to form a panel will have been communicated to candidates during the advertising stage of the process.  The panel is the order of merit at the outcome of a recruitment competition.  Placement on a panel is not a guarantee of appointment to a position.</p> <p>  PAS adheres to the highest standards of confidentiality in managing candidates' personal data and panels are confidential.  When a suitable vacancy arises, the client contacts PAS to notify it and candidates are assessed against the relevant criteria for actual appointment.  This process is known as &ldquo;clearance&rdquo;.  Acceptance or rejection of an offer of appointment will generally lead to a candidate being removed from the panel.</p> <p>  Panels of suitable candidates are most commonly established for roles where multiple appointments are anticipated.  Panels are dimensioned based on the expected demand for appointments.  While adequate size of panel is important, so too is ensuring panels are not so large that people feel they are left languishing on panels with no reasonable prospect of appointment.  Short panels may also be formed for more specialised, senior or one-off type appointments in order to provide for the possibility of the first placed candidate rejecting the offer of appointment.  Typically, panels are active for 12 to 18 months and are normally closed when a newly established panel supersedes, unless particular circumstances of the campaign dictate otherwise.  In the interests of maintaining reasonable flexibility, there is not generally a predetermined closing date for a panel.  The exception is some internal campaigns confined to civil or public servants where an expiry date would be set by Civil Service management and would be stated in the relevant circular.</p> <p>  I will outline how PAS makes decisions regarding the management of specific panels.  As stated, PAS provides recruitment services across diverse categories of roles and positions and, in doing so, liaises with a wide range of employing authorities in a client-focused, professional and confidential manner.</p><p>Client expectations and demands require careful management in a resource constrained environment.  Given this circumstance, PAS must carefully manage and schedule its work to meet the expectations of these stakeholders while also maintaining its compliance with the codes of practice and fulfilling its significant duties to candidates.</p><p> As chief executive and the licenceholder from the Commission for Public Service Appointments, I am ultimately responsible for determining the life cycle of a panel, having taken a range of relevant factors into account.  They include the level and specialisation of the post; changes in the job or in eligibility requirements since the last competition from which a panel was formed; the resources invested in generating the panel; the number of people placed on the panel; the numbers appointed from, and remaining on, the panel; the age of the panel; the number of new potential candidates entering the field since the panel was formed; and the degree of urgency in filling a position.</p><p> While there is a high degree of standardisation in PAS processes, I do not believe it would be appropriate to have a single operating template for all panels given the range, level and variety of positions being filled.  I am informed that the Civil Service Commissioners of Northern Ireland adopt a similar position, in that 12 months is the general life of panels but there are exceptions to this general rule whereby some panels have lasted significantly longer.</p><p> Where a candidate is unhappy with any aspect of his or her interaction with PAS, we have a number of routes through which we accept complaints and feedback.  Our targets for customer complaints are set out in our customer service action plan.  I believe our record in responding to queries, feedback and complaints is a positive one and accords with our stated values and principles.  In the case of a candidate who is unhappy with any aspect of a campaign, there is a formal appeal procedure in accordance with sections 7 and 8 of the CPSA code of practice.  Candidates are, of course, also at liberty to raise issues, as appropriate, with the Ombudsman, the Equality Tribunal, the Equality Authority, the Workplace Relations Commission, the Freedom of Information Commissioner, the Data Protection Commissioner or the courts.  PAS also has in place a published policy for the management of panels within our organisation which is widely available to all staff on our intranet.</p><p> I assure the committee that the Public Appointments Service is committed to high standards in all of its recruitment work, which includes the management of recruitment panels.  Should there be any matters relating to panels which the committee believes PAS should address by way of continual improvement, I will certainly give these my full consideration.  I trust this statement is of assistance to the committee and I am happy to discuss any issues arising. </p></speech>

Although I was not working in the Public Appointments Service at the time, there were quite a number of panels created from competitions back in 2008 and early 2009 from which very few appointments were made because no positions were coming up to be filled.  This is a good example to give the committee some knowledge of how it might work.  Imagining that a competition was held in 2008 and appointments made in 2009 under whatever sanctions were still in place, and then that no further appointments were made until 2013 or 2014 when the moratorium was eased, there would not have been further appointments made from that panel.  It would never have been closed but a new competition would have superseded it.  For example, in almost every grade in the Civil Service there has been an open competition over the past 12 or 18 months from which panels have been created.  Many new people might have expressed an interest and wanted to compete but might not have had the time or opportunity to do so back in 2008.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions.  I find it odd that there is no onus on the PAS or the body for which it is recruiting to inform existing panel members that a panel is closed or a new one has been formed.  That should be looked at either by the PAS or somebody else.  I know of cases in which people, perhaps wrongly, presumed they were on a panel, only to find that a panel had superseded them.  One such person was in RTE and should have reasonably expected that the panel was closed as they had been on it for four years at that stage.  They lived under a presumption.</p> <p>  Is it best practice that panels should be closed?  If there were ten positions on a panel and it lasted 12 months, applicants would know that if they did not get the position and another one came up within 12 months, they would be considered for it.  Is that best practice or just a case-by-case position?</p> <p>  A substantial number of job applicants have gone through the PAS offices in the past year; 55,000 applications is a substantial number, and that is without the embargo on all positions having been lifted fully.  Under 10% of those applicants end up going on.  Is it just the quality of the applications and CVs?  Are people who have applied for the wrong position excluded from being interviewed?  I have sat on one or two interview panels where I have been handed papers and had to score out of ten and whatever.  Is it a similar marking system for the interviews?  Does the Irish language come into it?  We had occasion here to begin some work on the Irish language component of selection processes within the Civil Service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.738" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Fiona Tierney" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015120900002#D00600"><p>The point the Deputy raises around telling candidates that a panel is closed is an interesting one.  Just to let the Deputy know, we do not recruit for commercial semi-State bodies like RTE so that would not have fallen within our remit at all.  To be honest, with a panel that lasts for four years, if no appointment has been made from it and there is no really good reason to keep it open, there could be a wider field of candidates within four years or newly qualified people in the organisation who would by then be eligible to apply.  It would be only fair to run another competition.</p> <p>  If I understood the Deputy correctly, he asked whether creating panels was best practice.  In a situation in which it is difficult for client organisations to anticipate how many vacancies they will have over the course of 12 or 18 months, it is probably the most effective and efficient way of running competitions.  There is a cost involved in filling every role and if it is known that there is likely to be a requirement to fill ten positions over 18 months, creating a panel of about 15 people is very effective.  As I said, there is no guarantee that everybody will be appointed.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct in his assessment.  In the Public Appointments Service we handle so many contacts with such a large number of candidates that we are clearly dealing with the very many disappointed candidates who do not come through the process for one reason or another.</p><p>I will address the question of why we lose so many people through the process.  Quite large numbers of candidates are applying for roles and given that we are just coming out of the moratorium, there is a pent-up demand.  Very significant numbers of people applied for the Garda trainee competition and 28,000 people applied for the clerical officer competition in the Civil Service.  Those competitions have attracted very large numbers of applicants.  When it comes to graduate recruitment, we received perhaps 3,000 applications from people who want to join the Civil Service at administrative officer level.  Those candidates are taken through a process of testing which includes testing in a supervised testing environment.  Based on the number of jobs we will be required to fill in the next 12 to 18 months, we use very good predictive models to establish the number of people we would be required to interview to make a panel of 100 people.  We ask how many would have to be interviewed and in order to interview that many people, how many people do we need to bring through to testing.  That is how we work it.  The main costs of our business are interviewing costs from putting together interview boards and organising testing.  They are the main drivers of cost to our organisation.  </p><p> The interview process involves merit and competency based interviews.  We use a marking scheme which is agreed by the interview board in advance.  Candidates can be marked out of ten or 20 for each competency which totals up to a certain number.  There is generally a pass level set by the interview board with guidance from the Public Appointments Service for each particular competition.  For the more senior level competitions, at principal officer level or equivalent across the Civil Service and public service, there are two rounds of interviews, rather than only one.  For the general grades when we are dealing with larger volumes, we would have one competency based interview after which people would be placed on a panel in order of merit.  </p><p> The Deputy asked about the Irish language.  There are demands from clients to fill positions with people fluent in Irish.  We refer to those people as functional linguists in Irish and English.  In the last series of competitions for the Civil Service we administered the new process whereby instead of giving a standard percentage of marks to people who declared a competency in Irish we actually tested it.  That has worked effectively to ensure we have a panel of bilingual people available for assignment.  While a large number of people indicate on their application forms that they are bilingual and capable of transacting business in Irish, there is a significant fall-off once we try to process those people.  There was a significant reduction in numbers for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na trainee, clerical officer and executive officer competitions.  We have successfully put in place panels of Irish speakers for the Garda trainee competition and in the more recent clerical officer and executive officer competitions.  We are currently working on that for assistant principal officer roles and we also have functional linguists at principal officer grade.</p></speech>

We recruit for medical consultants and professional and technical grades across a range of different organisations.  There is legislative provision for us to recruit the most senior levels in some of the regulatory bodies.  Where we have capacity and can organise ourselves to do so, we will recruit for the most senior level position in some of the non-commercial State bodies.  We have done that over the last two years.

We run a separate website, <i>stateboards.ie</i>, which is entirely different from the recruitment process.  Since November 2014, we have been asked to take on board this particular role.  We advertise the vacancies on State boards through a booklet setting out the board, what the vacancies involve, how many there are, the preferred type of candidate and the skills they should possess.  It is not the same as recruitment.  The applications are taken in online and reviewed by a panel of people we put together.  The purpose of the review is to assess whether the applications meet the criteria set out in the booklet.  It is not an interview.  It can be but it is not a competitive process.  The names that meet the selection criteria are then passed on to the relevant Minister for appointment.</p></speech>

Does she have any information about the process in other countries in the European Union?  How would the Public Appointments Service go about extending or closing the panel?  As public representatives, we often hear about issues concerning further medical exams.  In the case of recruitment of trainee garda&iacute; and other similar positions, is that a situation in which a panel would be extended?  Is there a cut-off point for those type of situations?  I presume there is.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh mentioned the Irish language.  My understanding from replies to questions to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is that 10% of the Civil Service deal with questions from people who use the Irish language.  Is that part of the remit of the Public Appointments Service?  Is it something clients would look for in terms of recruitment? </p></speech>

In terms of the practice in other European countries, to my knowledge, the recruitment services in England follow the same process of having panels of appointment to various different bodies.  I can check the situation in Scotland and Wales for the Deputy, if he is interested.</p> <p>  The issue of extending or closing panels does not generally arise.  A panel can be exhausted because we have been good at determining how many vacancies there will be and having that number of people on the panel, so within 18 months all those vacancies will be filled.  Everybody will be gone from the panel.  It could also be because, as Deputy Kirk mentioned earlier, some external events occur and the panel, effectively, becomes closed because we are not recruiting any more.  There could also be an area where there is a particular demand for specialist skills.  For example, we have had lots of requests for accountants across public service bodies.  We will recruit and place people on a panel and wait for the sanctioned vacancies to become available.  If, after an 18-month period, there are still people on the panel and we have not had requests to fill vacancies, we would ask if the panel is moving and look at our workload, the demands for the client and what is happening in the general environment.  We would consider whether there had been other competitions in a similar area that would offer people an opportunity to join the public service and make an assessment on when to run a new competition.  That is generally what happens.</p><p>The question of extending a panel does not really arise.  We do not use the language of saying the panel is closed.  It can be misconstrued by clients when we might advise them that given the last time a competition was held was two years ago, there might be more people in the market who would be interested in applying or qualified for this panel, it might be time to move on and have a new competition.  We do not generally use language like "it is closed".</p><p> I was asked about medical tests.  For many positions in the Civil Service and public service, once candidates are on a panel, they have met all the selection criteria.  They then have to go through what I referred to in my statement as the clearance process, including checking current employer references, doing Garda vetting and completing a medical test.  That process with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is handled by it.  We would pass through the names of the assigned trainees and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would organise their medical tests.  The same applies for consultant positions with the HSE.  We transmit the names to the HSE and it runs that area of clearance in doing the medical tests.</p></speech>

The advertisements on <i>publicjobs.ie </i>and in newspapers will specify that we adhere to all the nine grounds of the Equality Act.  We do not differentiate on the grounds of gender, age, nationality or anything else.  We are blind to age in our office.  When a client Department or agency approaches us to fill a role, age has nothing to do with the assignment process.</p></speech>

Clients want people who are capable of doing the job.  Notwithstanding all that - the Senator can look at it - we have an ageing population in our office.  We reduced numbers very significantly during the moratorium.  In the past two years, we have had permission to take on some new people.  Most of the people who are coming through in appointments from the panels that now exist for Civil Service are quite a bit younger than I am.  We would say it brought great energy and new views into the office - different tastes in music and everything else.  Having a constant flow of people coming through revitalises and creates energy.</p></speech>

Obviously, the Public Appointments Service will not discriminate against someone on the basis of age.

However, we are very careful to ensure that we do not create any barriers to entry for applicants for any competition.  Obviously, there are professions and careers that have really only emerged in the past ten years, including digital media, online marketing, etc.  The qualifications are available through open participation in any of the universities or ITs around the country.  There is no age ban on people taking those courses.  If a client is looking for a particular skill set and an individual has completed the course, age would not really come into it once they have the necessary skills.  I do not believe the educational qualification piece would act as a barrier against particular age.</p></speech>

In the Public Appointments Service, we take an active view of the percentage of applications coming from the different genders, how they progress through the recruitment process and what ultimately emerges with the appointments to ensure there is consistency throughout the process and that nothing is discriminating against people as we go.</p> <p>  That said, publicly available information on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform website indicates that in the Civil Service, entry level grades are predominantly female and the most senior level grades are predominantly male.  We have participation across various cross-functional working groups in the Civil Service to see how we can increase female participation rates in competitions for promotion.  Most of those competitions are now open competitions.  We are seeking ways to encourage women to put themselves forward for the more senior level positions.</p> <p>  Similarly, we are working in co-ordination with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of the more recently advertised campaign for recruitment as garda trainees to encourage women to apply because only one in four of the applications the last time around for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na came from women.

There would be a conflict in what we are being asked to do.  Under the Acts and the Equality Acts, we cannot discriminate on the basis of gender in what we do.  However, we can set a target and have proactive campaigns and this has worked quite well. In the mid-2000s - do not hold me to the date - there was a concerted effort to encourage women to apply for managerial grades in the Civil Service because there is quite a level of disparity.  We were very pleased to see the female participation rate and the results in recent AP competitions, where it is 50-50, which is very encouraging.  At this point in time, 36% of the principal officer grade in the Civil Service is female.</p></speech>

When we deal with this volume of applications and this number of candidates, our people are loath to give advice to anybody.  They will give them facts and will try to be as helpful as they can.  Sometimes they are overly helpful and get themselves in trouble.  Generally, they state the person's position on the panel and the number of positions which have been filled.  We do not really have an indication of what is likely to come down the pipe over the remaining period.  We try to be as helpful as we can to the candidate.  Many of our staff have sat on panels themselves so they know exactly what it feels like.</p> <p>  Appeals relate broadly to the recruitment process itself.  The appeal process is set out by the Commission for Public Service Appointments in various codes of practice.  At any stage of a process, candidates can contact us and ask for information.  They can ask for an informal appeal.  If candidates who went for an interview did not like the result, or the outcome was not what they expected, they can ask for an informal review and will receive their marks and feedback and are told how they performed.  If they are not content with this, they can have a formal review, which means somebody in the office unassociated with anything to do with the competition will get the papers and the file and go through it in some detail.  The person might well speak to the interview board and the candidate, if required.  The person will review all of the paperwork and measure what the candidate is saying against what our standard practices are for a free, fair, open and merit-based recruitment process.  The person will make an assessment and judge on this formal appeal.  If it goes the candidate's way, so to speak, he or she could either go through to the next stage of the competition or be placed on a panel, whatever it might be.  This is under a section 7 appeal, which relates to the candidate's own performance in a process.  There is also a section 8 appeal if a candidate feels the Public Appointments Service is not holding the recruitment process in accordance with the codes of practice.  The person might say it was not done on the basis of merit or it was not fair or transparent, whatever it might be.  In this case, the same process applies, with the difference that if a candidate is not happy with the result of a formal appeal he or she can appeal to the Commission for Public Service Appointments, which will review the appeal and may audit all of the files and issue a report on it.  I hope this answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

The purpose of the board is to oversee the work of the office and guide and advise me on how we do things.  The board meets approximately ten times a year and it is given an update on all the operational activities of the office at each board meeting.  I would not like to mislead the committee; the board does not sit down and look at what panels are open and for how long.

That is a process improvement we potentially could consider putting in place.  It is not part of our current practice and it would be disappointing for us to think many people were not aware of how the process operates.  Clearly, however, the Chairman has knowledge of some.</p></speech>

Obviously, nobody can have expectancy in this regard, as a panel is a possibility and cannot be an expectancy.  That is all I wished to convey and I appreciate the response from Ms Tierney that she will consider the issue.</p></speech>

The focus is on a policy debate on the social aspects of road transport and road safety.  Apart from these discussions, there will be a number of information items under "any other business", including the European Union's aviation strategy.</p> <p>  I would like to begin by mentioning a number of EU road transport developments.  First, as part of a new package of EU road transport legislation that is expected in 2016, the Commission has been undertaking a wide-ranging review of road transport legislation.  The Commission has identified a number of difficulties that member states have encountered in the application and enforcement of existing legislation, and plans to introduce a new road package in 2016 to clarify and simplify existing rules.  This will allow for more uniform application and enforcement of rules and create a framework for a sustainable, cost-effective and interoperable electronic system of road charging across the Community.</p> <p>  An evaluation of the existing legislation has been carried out by the Commission.  The new road package will now go through a number of stages, including public consultation, meetings with member states, consultations on specific topics, and impact assessments, before the Commission presents its proposals in 2016.  My Department will continue to engage on all aspects of the development of the new road package through participation in Commission road transport working groups and ongoing liaison with Commission services. </p> <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s road transport committee has voted in favour of a new draft regulation to supplement Regulation 1071 of 2009 with regard to the classification of serious infringements that may lead to the loss of good repute of a road transport operator and, consequently, the withdrawal of his operator licence.  Infringements are to be uniformly classified as serious, very serious and most serious.  The harmonised categorisation of infringements is important in ensuring more consistent enforcement across member states.</p> <p>  The purpose of the new regulation is to define the degree of seriousness of infringements by reference to the risk of fatalities or serious injuries and to provide the frequency of occurrence beyond which repeated infringements are more likely to be escalated to a more serious level.  Such repeated infringements may lead to the loss of good repute of a road transport operator and, consequently, the withdrawal of his operator licence.  The next step will be to present the draft regulation to the Council and Parliament for decision.</p> <p>  Another point to note is that a regulation has recently been passed by the European Parliament providing for technologically updated &ldquo;smart&rdquo; tachograph machines for recording drivers&rsquo; hours.  Tachographs record the driving time and speed of vehicles and are used to determine compliance with driving time rules.  Since 2006, all new HGVs and buses have been fitted with digital tachographs, which use driver cards to record driving and rest-time data.  The new regulation aims to improve the security, effectiveness, and efficiency of tachograph machines.  The regulation comes into effect from March 2016, and manufacturers will subsequently have three years in which to introduce the new-generation tachograph machines in all new vehicles.  The new machines will allow for automatic recording using satellite technology, eventual remote access by enforcement authorities, and potential interface with other transport technology systems.</p> <p>  I would like to update the committee on the difficulties facing Irish hauliers in recent months at Calais and Dover ports.  A number of Irish hauliers have been fined by the UK authorities for carrying clandestine migrants into the United Kingdom from France.  Fines are levied on both the haulage operator and the driver of the truck when migrants are discovered.  The fines are reduced significantly, or waived, if the operator and driver can show that all necessary precautions were taken to avoid illegal entry of migrants onto their trucks.  My Department&rsquo;s officials have informed the Irish haulage sector of the security measures required by the UK authorities.  We have agreed a process of information exchange with the UK authorities to monitor the situation on Irish hauliers.  A number of fines have been cancelled or reduced where operators or drivers, or both, have showed the UK authorities that the required procedures were followed.  The situation at Calais and Dover has abated considerably in recent weeks.  However, the recent attacks in Paris have resulted in increased security measures generally across the EU and this may have a bearing on the situation.  My Department is continuing to keep a watching brief and to maintain communication with the UK authorities.  My officials are in regular contact with representatives of the road haulage industry.  I have met them myself to discuss this and other matters over recent months and I intend to meet them soon to discuss the latest position.</p> <p>  For the discussion on road safety, I will be focusing my intervention on the specific questions on which Ministers and other attendees have been asked to focus.  I plan to outline briefly the new initiatives Ireland is planning to take in 2016 to reduce the number of fatalities and serious road injuries, especially regarding vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists.  I will be focusing on relevant planned Road Safety Authority activities in 2016.  These will include an education programme, Mobility Matters, rolled out nationally via active retirement groups to increase road safety awareness for older people; a new junior cycle programme to be provided to schools targeting children from 13 to 16 years, with the aim of reducing fatalities and injuries in this vulnerable road-user group; and the development of a new intervention to highlight the danger of low-level speeding, or driving a few kilometres per hour above the speed limit, and the consequences of this for vulnerable road users.</p><p>Mass media campaigns in Ireland will continue to prioritise the issue of driver distraction, as well as focusing on the issues of drink-driving, non-seat-belt-wearing and worn tyres.  Second, a new education campaign is being planned next year to support the introduction of preliminary roadside testing for drugs.  An EU target to reduce serious road injuries would help in providing each member state with a benchmark from which performance could be measured.  Such a target would further facilitate and give impetus to the difficult task of producing a comprehensive set of serious road injury data through the linking of multiple sources of information, such as what occurs in hospitals, in respect of law enforcement and with regard to insurance.  I will also state that it would be beneficial, were each country to have access to a central technical group at European Union level with expertise in this area.  To develop this point further, this follows on from recent discussions in the Council on road safety.  Much of what must be done in this area effectively can be handled at national level through national organisations such as the Road Safety Authority.  However, I also believe the European Union can play an important role in allowing us to understand what is going on in other countries, allowing us to share what we are doing and to learn from what other countries are doing.  If each incremental or small improvement made results in the saving of a single life or the avoidance of a single injury, it is an improvement worth making.  One must be open and must be aware of what can be learned from what other member states are doing.  The Road Safety Authority has pointed out that such a central resource with expertise in the area of international classification of disease, ICD, and health problems coding, data transformations, linking of datasets and data protection would further enhance the process and the ease with which serious injury data can be captured.  Finally, Ireland is happy to examine any measures at EU level that might be of assistance in addressing cross-border enforcement of penalty point or demerit point systems.</p><p> Under the "any other business" portion of the meeting tomorrow, information will be given on a number of items including the EU aviation strategy.  Ireland supports the revitalisation of efforts by the European Commission to advance the aviation agenda, in particular to enhance aviation safety and to address the competitiveness of the EU aviation sector.  The Government will examine the Commission's communication and legislative proposals when they are published.  It is too early at this point to comment in detail on the strategy but I will offer a small number of general observations.  Ireland is highly supportive of efforts to update the basic regulation of the European Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, on safety of the aviation sector, particularly to include provisions for the safe operation of drones.  Extension of the EASA&rsquo;s remit to cover some aspects of aviation security also may be appropriate, in so far as there are essential interfaces between safety and security, but it will be necessary to carefully consider the detail of these proposals.  As for the social dialogue in aviation and the establishment of an EU observatory on jobs and employment, I note work is already under way in this sphere.  The regulations on social issues must be such that they can be clearly understood by operators and do not pose a threat to competitiveness.  It will be important to ensure that discussion takes place in the appropriate fora, in the recognition that labour law applies to all sectors and not just to aviation.   Ireland actively supports EU efforts to negotiate full open skies agreements with third countries.  However, there must be an emphasis on the full implementation of existing agreements and the completion of negotiations on agreements for which the Commission already has mandates.  All these points will be offered in the spirit that the liberalisation of and competitiveness within European aviation, the vast majority of which has been facilitated by the role of the European Union in this regard, has been to the benefit of commuters, of access and of the growth of Ireland and the economy across Europe.</p><p> Other items on the agenda under "any other business" include results of investigations of the crash of the flight MH17, with information from the Netherlands delegation, and election of the council for 2016-19 of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, with information from the Bulgarian, Cypriot, Czech, Greek, Hungarian, Lithuanian, Polish, Romanian, Slovenian and Slovak delegations.  Other items include the state of play on ratification of the Luxembourg protocol on matters specific to railway rolling stock to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment, on which there will be information from the Presidency, rail transport security with information from the Commission on the state of play - this was requested by the French delegation - and the work programme of the incoming Presidency from the Netherlands delegation.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to appear before them and I welcome any question members may have.</p></speech>

Before calling on members, I will ask a question myself.  The Minister mentioned security a number of times in his address, referred to the Paris outrages and mentioned aviation security.  I have read of proposals by airlines to share passenger information with regard to security issues and the possibility of people, who might be going to commit outrages, travelling by air.  What is the up-to-date position on that aspect of aviation security?</p></speech>

My understanding is that it will be considered again by the European Parliament and I understand some Irish MEPs have been supportive of the measure.  My own view is any matters that improve the sharing of information regarding passengers and their travelling by air should be considered positively.  As for what is likely to be considered in this meeting, the more likely areas of focus will pertain to railway station and rail security.  That will follow on from a discussion the Council had in the second half of the last meeting that took place.  This is something on which the Government will keep a monitoring brief but because Ireland only has a single line that crosses jurisdictions, between Belfast and Dublin obviously, and has in place good measures in that regard, it is not a matter that will have a considerable direct impact on Ireland at present.  The other aspect of safety that could be considered could be the consequences of this in respect of what might happen in Calais and Dover, which in turn could have consequences for issues the Government has been raising on behalf of the Irish road haulage industry.</p></speech>

However, he made reference to new technology, that is, to the introduction of up-to-date tachograph technology.  Questions were raised about delays at Calais and Dover but the former in particular, which, if I am correct, resulted in drivers exceeding the driving limits.  Does the Minister have a view on whether this new technology would make it more difficult for drivers because of what is happening at present?  The Minister has stated that the position at Calais has abated considerably.  I acknowledge the Minister focused on the migration issue but I refer to the tachographs and I understand some drivers may have been stopped because they exceeded the driving limits.</p> <p>  Second, the Minister referred to being "highly supportive of efforts to update the basic regulation of the European Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, on safety of the aviation sector, particularly to include provisions for the safe operation of drones".  Are drones operating in Ireland or in Irish airspace?  Can the Minister elaborate a little further on what precisely this proposal will be and on what will be the Irish position in this regard?  The Minister also made reference to road safety and I understand that apart from security issues, most issues the Council will discuss will be about road safety.

I am sure everybody here agrees that any effort or initiative to prevent road fatalities or accidents is to be welcomed and actively encouraged.  There is a fine line to be drawn here, however.  Anybody who drives knows that the modern technology now available in cars can cause a sensation in the cabin of one's car that lulls one into a false feeling of security.  One thinks one is driving at a slower speed than one is driving at.  I hope the Minister understands what I am saying.  The speed of one's car does not always connect with one's brain.  Cruise control has been a great innovation.  I use it all the time, particularly in urban areas.  The speed limits in such areas can be quite complex, particularly around Dublin but also in some other cities in Ireland.  I will give the specific example of the M4 motorway, which I often use.  When one comes off that road at 120 km/h, one is immediately requested to go down to 60 km/h at a stretch of road that leads one to Palmerstown, where the speed limit is 30 km/h.  After one has passed Palmerstown, one travels on a stretch of dual carriageway that has no urban landscape at all but has trees on either side of it.  The speed limit on this 2 km or 3 km of road, as far as Inchicore, is 60 km/h.  From time to time, I see the Garda road traffic corps supervising drivers on the Palmerstown and Inchicore sides of this dual carriageway.  I have no doubt that people are caught speeding at this location, perhaps when they are just a few kilometres over the speed limit.</p> <p>  I understand that the Minister's predecessor embarked on an overall nationwide evaluation of speed limits.  Has this exercise been completed?  I am not saying it should be easier for drivers to speed, but I think there should be a bit more consistency.  If the speed limit goes up and down along a certain route, it is inevitable that drivers are going to get caught.  I have mentioned an inconsistency along a stretch of road that was built primarily to increase traffic speed, or to make travel more efficient for commercial and private drivers.  There is a similar situation on the Naas Road.  The speed limit one has to observe as one comes off the Naas dual carriageway, from the Red Cow as far as this side of Inchicore, goes back down to 50 km/h or 60 km/h.  All I am saying is that drivers coming off a high-speed roadway are being asked to reduce their speed in this way immediately.  I am not suggesting that the Minister has the solution to this problem.  I am raising it in the context of the Council suggestion that we should be more proactive in ensuring those who drive a few kilometres over the speed limit are done for speeding.  I wonder whether that is really the best way to go in terms of compliance.  Perhaps there is some other way around it.  I reiterate that I am in favour of anything that is going to reduce road fatalities.  I am concerned that certain inconsistencies, particularly in the examples I have mentioned, may not be helpful as we seek total compliance with the speed limits.</p></speech>

He has put four different points to me.  I will start by responding to what he said about the issues that have arisen with tachographs as a consequence of what happened in Calais and Dover recently.  He is correct in his identification of the issue that was occurring at that time.  Representatives of the road haulage industry raised this matter with us strongly in different forums.  As the Senator has said, drivers of haulage vehicles were exceeding their legally permissible driving hours as a result of having to deal with the humanitarian issues that were happening at both ports.  A measure known as Article 14.2 was triggered for a specific period of time in recognition of the exceptional circumstances that were leading to these hours being exceeded.  It was triggered by the UK because the consequences of this activity were being felt within its jurisdiction.  This is a delicate matter that needs to be managed.  If a driver exceeds the maximum number of hours, that can contribute to fatigue and lead to road safety issues.  The Article 14.2 measure was triggered for a very specific period of time for very specific reasons.  The period of time for which it was triggered has now lapsed.  As I mentioned in my opening contribution, we are now engaging directly with the relevant UK authorities.  We are asking them to share with us the details of any case in which an Irish haulage company ends up being involved in a matter like this.  We are working with the UK enforcement bodies to ask for the exceptional nature of what is happening there to be recognised.  This is having a significant effect on the Irish haulage industry because so much of our access to the single European market takes place through the UK.</p></speech>

I have to put it on the record that they are working closely with us.  It is understandable that members of the road haulage industry will want to raise with us the kinds of issues and matters of concern that are arising in this context.  I assure the Senator that we are being as co-operative as possible with the industry and the UK bodies on this issue.  We have put a great deal of time and effort into this matter.  I have done so personally.</p> <p>  The answer to the Senator's question about drones is "Yes".  The number of drones in operation in Ireland at the moment is growing.  The Irish Aviation Authority is considering new regulations for their use in Ireland and will make a decision on the matter shortly.  Any new regulations will have to be compatible and in line with EU law in this area.  Specific attention is being paid to the altitudes at which these units can be operated.  Advertising and awareness activity will be in place as we attempt to manage this particular challenge.  I believe that in the run-up to Christmas, we will see more and more of these units being bought for recreational and leisure use.  I have strongly supported the Irish Aviation Authority on this matter.  I think we need to change tack somewhat in recognition of the growing number of these units in this country.</p> <p>  The Senator is right when he says that road safety will be a particular area of focus at tomorrow's meeting.  It has been discussed at other meetings I have attended.  He spoke about drivers who exceed specific speed limits by a small number of kilometres per hour.  The Road Safety Authority is looking at this matter because there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that if one exceeds the speed limit even by a small number of kilometres per hour, it can have a disproportionate effect on the risk of serious injury to other road users.  Next year, much if not all of the focus will be on increasing awareness of existing road traffic sanctions.  We already have robust laws in this area.  Senator Mooney referred to particular roads.  Earlier this year, I completed a review of road speed limits.  We issued further guidance in relation to national roads on foot of that review.  I understand that a review of all existing speed limits in this country will be undertaken over a three-year period.  If I am wrong in that respect, I will revert to the Senator.  Some speed limits were set by the National Roads Authority, which is now part of Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  The vast majority of speed limits were set by local authorities.  The review will look at the issue identified by the Senator, which is whether we need to take measures to ensure the speed limits on national roads that become local or regional roads, or national roads that pass through different settings, are more coherent and continuous.  I appreciate that the Senator has acknowledged that road safety is one of the reasons that speed limits change in the first place.</p><p>These roads can suddenly pass through residential areas, especially in the case of national roads coming into the city centre.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.827" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1022" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015120900002#E00300"><p>I thank the Minister.  Regarding cross-Border co-operation on penalty points and signage, do we make the argument for the northern part of the island on the co-ordination of points? Could the Minister clarify if other countries have similar problems?  How do those countries with similar close proximity borders address the cross-border nature of these issues? Is this State pressing home the subject of penalty points?  The UK might be a problem but we should be co-ordinating penalty points and signage and it should be a priority.</p> <p>   With regard to drug testing, I understand the Minister will introduce a system properly in 2016 but we need to learn from the different standards and results from other European countries.  This is a far bigger contributory problem in accidents than is realised.  Accidents happen out of the blue and the drugs factor has not been addressed in the past.  European countries who have looked at this issue for longer may be able to offer some statistics.</p> <p>  Could the Minister indicate what issues have arisen regarding Shannon Airport and troop movements across Europe and if this ever comes onto the agenda? Is it left for the Department of Justice to deal with? Is it discussed in general and does the Minister get a feel for whether Ireland is overstepping the mark, or if someone else is overstepping the mark?</p> <p>  Perhaps the Minister could clarify whether the Volkswagen emissions scandal and its repercussions will be on the agenda? It seems to have gone off the radar and there is no sign of anyone being prosecuted.  I have not heard anything.  The scandal has had huge repercussions across Europe and the world.</p> <p>  With regard to tachographs, could the Minister say if there are plans to increase the speed limits on tachographs or will the same standards remain?  Has Europe changed its position on those speed limits?  It is said that the tachograph devices will be accessed externally to the vehicle so they can be monitored, which is a good idea.  Some people are wary of the way tachograph limits are set and many are not happy with the limits.</p> <p>  The Minister has spoken on many occasions about the lowering of speed limits on carriageways.  Europe has been of the opinion that carriageways should have a certain speed limit, in Ireland it is 120 km/h.  There is a feeling that the speed limit on the main carriageway should be a little higher compared to other national secondary roads.  Can the Minister indicate if this subject has been discussed? There has been talk of reducing the speed limit to 20 km/h in some residential housing estates.  Would this opinion prevail in Europe or is it thought to be unfeasible and that 30 km/h should be the minimum? It is not clear what approach Europe has.</p> <p>  Cameras are now being used with drones in a big way.  The Minister is correct when he spoke about the possibilities now, given the advances in electronics, for children and all people.  I assume from what the Minister has said that limits may be set on the travel distances and flying heights for drones.  It is an interesting matter.  Can the Minister clarify if there is evidence that the use of these drones has an affect on aviation or interferes with electronic equipment? Air passengers are instructed to switch off certain equipment while flying but is there any evidence to suggest a danger from drones?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-12-09a.828" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015120900002#E00400"><p>I thank the Deputy. I will work through the different questions he has posed.  The UK is the key issue when we seek to deal with cross-border recognition of speed limits.  The Deputy is correct when he said the UK opted out of a convention - I believe it was under the Lisbon treaty but I am happy to be corrected - which created a challenge for Ireland.  A successful agreement has been negotiated on this between us and the British Government which will require legislation.  That will be included in the Road Traffic Act 2016 for which Cabinet approval will be sought next week.  When that legislation is in place it will be enacted by the D&aacute;il during the first half of 2016, which will then give primary legislative underpinning to the new arrangement between Ireland and the UK.  Much work has been done between us and the Northern Ireland Executive on the technical matters and that work is ongoing.  However, the new legal framework will be in place early in 2016 depending on the formation of the new D&aacute;il and other matters.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Ellis's comments on drug testing.  The evidence of Professor Denis Cusack from the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, supplied to this committee and on which he has spoken publicly, says that drugs are a significant factor in accidents on our roads, especially when combined with alcohol.  The matter will be a priority for me in 2016.  When this legislation is enacted we can begin work on the practical implementation of the Bill.  I appreciate the support of the select committee here last week in agreeing the Supplementary Estimate which provides the funding to purchase the devices to be used on the roads in 2016.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the Deputy's query on Shannon Airport and the troop movement issue.  During my participation in the transport Council over the last 18 months the topic of Shannon has not come up.  Airport security is an issue that does feature but the particular matter of troop movements in Shannon tends to be something I would deal with domestically, given the specific responsibility I have for that area.  General matters on foreign and justice policy would be dealt with by my colleagues in those respective areas.</p> <p>  The Volkswagen topic has not gone off the boil at all.  I had a meeting in Dublin a few weeks ago with the Commissioner responsible for this area.  The Single Market section of the Commission has responsibility for this area.  Work is now under way to accelerate progress to real-time testing of emissions.  At the last Council discussion on this I emphasised the support the Government has for this process.</p> <p>  With regard to tachographs, we are not making any proposals on the speed limit changes.  The review will be general and the speed limits may be considered.  However, from our national perspective we believe the speed limits currently in place are appropriate.</p><p>The Deputy is correct that remote access of tachograph units may be considered in the light of the review.  I would be willing to consider and support such a facility if evidence was to emerge that it could make a contribution to driver safety and road safety in general.  </p><p> It is left to national governments to decide how to implement speed limits.  A number of other European states have implemented significantly lower speed limits in residential settings than those in place here.  In some cases, they have been introduced by local rather than national authorities.  The Road Traffic Bill 2016 will include provision for lower speed limits in residential areas.  This is being done in response to work undertaken by the joint committee and concerns raised with me.  We are making considerable progress in the roll-out of new signage with lower speed limits in residential communities.  These new limits will apply in what will be known as home zones, for which new signage will be provided to inform drivers of the new limits.  Good work has been done in this regard this year. </p><p> The Deputy is correct on the issue of drones.  Last summer I attended an open day or information seminar organised by the Irish Aviation Authority on remote piloted aviation systems, RPAS, otherwise known as drones.  I met representatives of a number of companies involved in this area and was struck by the significant number of them that were using data capture through video recording on RPAS.  This technology is having a major effect on a large number of industries.  My understanding was that it was primarily used for ordnance mapping.  However, I have since learned that drones are increasingly being used in agriculture, infrastructure safety monitoring and construction.  On my visits to the United States and the Continent earlier this year, I concluded that the development of these technologies would be the next phase in the development of global aviation.  For this reason, we are examining whether appropriate safety and security regulations are in place for drone systems.</p></speech>

I propose that he be allowed to contribute next.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I also welcome his decision to allow different operators to apply to operate haulier training courses.</p><p>Irish lorry drivers have been caught up in difficulties in France.  We are hearing from them that they were being threatened with harsh fines and that wagons were being damaged by stones and other items thrown at them.  Tachograph readings were also presenting a problem because they were being delayed through no fault of their own.  The Minister referred to satellites in the context of tachographs.  Does this mean that a lorry can be tracked at all times by the satellite system to which he referred?  Some haulage company owners can track their lorries.  The Minister's reference to satellites makes me wonder if we are going down the road of satellite monitoring. </p><p>A degree of tolerance must be shown to lorry drivers.  If a driver is within 30 minutes or one hour of Holyhead, it is asking a great deal of him to pull up on the side of the road because he has done a certain number of hours, especially if the ferry is about to leave.  The haulage industry operates within tight time constraints and must be shown a little tolerance.  For example, a driver could be allowed to exceed the limit once per week provided he or she has a genuine reason for doing so.  </p><p>The Minister referred to our European partners and everyone working together.  Is it the case that French drivers are not taking the certificate of professional competence, CPC, course?  I understand French hauliers have refused to take the course which hauliers in other countries take. </p><p>The Minister referred to a new system to be introduced to help younger and older drivers.  A problem arose for people who had obtained their licence some years ago and were then required to obtain a trailer licence.  Through no fault of their own, some of them did not go to school for long.  The idea appears to be that in different towns they sit in the back of a van and take a test pressing buttons.  They are sweating even before they start the test.  Many of them are excellent drivers who could back up a trailer from here to Galway.  However, they are fearful.  Why do we not take a two-prong approach, with some people takiing the theory test and others engaging in a type of apprenticeship, perhaps in Mondelo Park or a similar facility, that would not frighten them?</p><p>Lorry drivers exiting the M7 and joining the M8 and <i>vice versa </i>must pay two tolls.  Drivers have contacted me about this issue because the configuration of these two roads means that they must travel east first before they are able to head west.  I ask the National Transport Authority to examine this issue to ensure some common sense is brought to bear.  </p><p>On aviation and drones, I note that doctors in the Netherlands can send a drone in cases where people have had a heart attack.  Is there a threat that Russia or another country is spying on Ireland using drones?</p></speech>

Is the Department working on specifications, for example, of the size of drones used?  In the Netherlands drones are used to provide rapid assistance for people living in remote areas, which is great.  I presume Ireland and other countries will extend the use of drone technology.  Do specifications apply to drones and must a licence be obtained to use them?</p> <p>  Some months ago someone proposed that lorry drivers test themselves or have a doctor brought to their yard to carry out testing for alcohol and drug use.  I thought at the time that the idea was crazy.  Has it been hit on the head?  Is the common-sense approach of having such tests carried out on the roadside being pursued instead?  The idea of having lorry owners call a doctor once or twice a year to come out and test drivers does not make sense. </p></speech>

We invested a considerable effort in dealing with tachograph readings and the recording of time.  The decision the British Government had to make provided the background to the triggering of section 14.2, which we discussed earlier.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to fines, an issue that has been raised directly with me and my officials.  We have asked representatives of the haulage industry to provide details because we are working with the UK authorities on a case by case basis.  While I consistently state we respect their independence and right to make decisions in these matters, we have drawn to their attention mitigating factors, including current events, which may mean that drivers find themselves in difficulty through no fault of their own.  We have asked the two representative bodies of the haulage sector to share details of specific cases with us.  We will co-operate with the UK authorities to ascertain whether the matters can be handled differently.  We have achieved some success in having fines reduced.  We will continue to work on this issue because it is ongoing, although the problem has abated somewhat compared to the position that obtained earlier in the year.  </p> <p>  The Deputy raised an issue related to the certificate of professional competence, CPC.</p><p>I have just checked with officials who are with me and we are not aware of the matter to which the Deputy is referring.  However, the certificate is a requirement.</p></speech>

My Department is not aware of that point so we will check it and get back to the Deputy on it.</p> <p>  The Deputy has raised the testing issues with me before in the D&aacute;il during the debate on the Road Traffic Bill 2015 and I know it is a matter of concern to him.  It is a matter that causes difficulty to people but all I can say is that anything we do is done with the objective of driver safety and the safety of other road users.  That being said, we always keep measures under review to see if they are proportionate and operating the way in which we intended.  I believe the current system is proportionate but it is a matter we keep under review because the aim is to be effective in making roads safer for everybody.</p></speech>

I will pass the Deputy's view on to it and get a briefing on how it is being implemented.</p> <p>  On the point about drones, I agree with the Deputy.  As I said earlier in response to Deputy Ellis, this is the next phase of development in aviation that will have a tangible effect on all our lives.  The Deputy referred to Holland and the delivery of prescriptions.  Large Internet shopping companies in America have talked about this in terms of delivering goods directly to people's homes.  It is the next wave of development.  Given the sophistication and electoral success of all members here, I will not rule out some of them integrating it into their forthcoming election campaigns.  The Irish Aviation Authority is now looking at some of the matters raised by the Deputy on the size of drones, where they can fly, and particularly the altitudes at which they can fly.  Altitude is one of the key issues.  There will be a register put in place to record these units and the relevant forms will be supplied with drones that are purchased during the Christmas period.  There will be a need to more actively monitor this in the future, given the greater size and use of drones.  </p> <p>  On the Deputy's final point on the testing of new road traffic legislation for small haulage companies, it is a point I acknowledge needs further work and is not provided for in the Road Traffic Bill 2015.</p></speech>

I will go through it briefly as others have covered most of what I wanted to say.  On the issue of road safety and the introduction of the road package for 2016, how is the Minister moving towards the interconnectedness of the penalty point system in different states?  We have the greatest interaction with our nearest neighbour but there is a view that penalty points collected in France, for example, should apply to an Irish person's licence when they come home in order to improve driver behaviour.  Will the Minister indicate whether any discussions have taken place on that issue?</p> <p>  The technology aspect is important.  I concur with the points made and I have spoken with the Minister before about the issues in Calais.  I was there during the summer with the Road Haulage Association, which has been making good headway with the Department and the authorities in the UK on avoiding the kind of sanctions that were in place.  The Minister has provided considerable assurance on that issue, which has been helpful to the industry.   The tailing-off of activity at present is a result of the weather.  The expectation is based on hostilities continuing in the zones of conflict.  The numbers of refugees have been tailing off during the winter period but as spring moves into summer again there will be a continued movement.  It is an issue that needs to be monitored on a continuing basis.</p> <p>  On the road safety issue, the Minister knows that in some European countries there are incentives aimed at improving driver behaviour through advanced learning and back to education driver improvement courses.  Has the Minister a view on the introduction of such a system here whereby if somebody takes part in such a programme, a number of penalty points would be expunged from their tally?  It has been successfully implemented in many countries in Europe and the United States.  What is the Minister's view on it?  Is it something he expects will be part of the overall package in the sense of a broader interconnectedness, rather than a complete harmonisation of policy across Europe?</p> <p>  I concur with almost all of the other speakers on the issue of drones.  It is fantastic technology which has huge benefits but I have some concerns in the short term about the impact on civil aviation.  The Minister has rightly identified the issues around altitudes and locations in and around airports.</p></speech>

Some communities may not have an active retirement group.  Will the RSA have a mechanism to reach out to such communities?  It is a welcome and important initiative.</p> <p>  Is there a possibility that it will be extended to school programmes?  I also welcome the junior cycle programme for 13 to 16 year olds in our schools.  Perhaps the road safety initiative of the RSA could work in conjunction with that.  I became aware recently of the issue of the suitability of side mirrors on bicycles.  It is worth thinking about.  I do not know how feasible it is but perhaps the Minister will communicate it to the RSA.  I believe roadside drug testing will be introduced in 2016.  Will the Minister provide further information on what will be involved in that?</p> <p>  We have to accept the advent of the drone system, which is being introduced so rapidly that legislation and licensing is not yet in place.  Drones are already used in the agriculture and medical industries with good effect.</p><p>These developments were raised with me recently by a person who had been in the United States.  He suggested that they could be extended to the Garda force for the detection of rural crime in particular.  This could be a useful addition to the equipment of our Garda force, particularly for rural Ireland, where we have extensive tracts of remote and isolated areas and people living in fear.  We have seen several examples, and many cases are not reported.  There are marauding gangs going around.  I believe this equipment could be effectively put into operation as a resource.  Will the Minister contact the Minister for Justice and Equality with a view to giving consideration to this option?  I believe this is in operation in the justice system in the United States in some shape or form for crime prevention, surveillance and so on.  I am calling for the matter to be followed up with the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p><p> I have noticed another phenomenon over several years.  We have more trucks and articulated lorries on the road at the moment, which is great.  The economy is certainly on the right track and that is good for everyone.  However, I have noticed the spray effect coming from trucks when travelling on the highway to the House.  I am unsure whether something is missing from these vehicles or the regulations are not being enforced enough.  Anyway, there is a high volume and content of spray.  There is certainly a road safety aspect to this for a driver who may be overtaking these trucks.  It is not common to every vehicle.  However, there may be something lacking in some of the vehicles that would otherwise reduce the effect.</p><p> We have discussed aviation and Irish airspace.  What monitoring is being carried out on aircraft coming into Irish airspace in respect of which prior notice may not be given to the authorities?  There have been several incidents off the west coast in particular.  I presume some aircraft are carrying out surveillance.  Have we any statistics?</p></speech>

Is it fully integrated?  Is it about to be?  What is the position?  This issue is coming up and we have noted the item.  I figured it might be relevant.

Most of the matters relating to the recognition of penalty points within different countries are being handled on a bilateral basis at the moment.  There are different systems in place in different countries.  At the moment I am prioritising how we deal with this issue between ourselves and the United Kingdom.  The details will be contained in the road traffic Bill, which I hope will be published before the end of this year.</p> <p>  Deputy Dooley made the point that we are dealing with a different phase of the humanitarian difficulties in Calais and Dover, as opposed to the end of them, and I agree with him.  Certainly, I have no wish to indicate that I believe the matter has come to an end.  Of course it has not; it is ongoing.  As Deputy Dooley has said, for a number of different reasons it is in a different phrase of intensity compared to earlier this year.</p> <p>  Deputy Dooley made a point on the role of training schemes and how they might lead to reductions in the number of penalty points issued.  He has raised this matter in recent days.  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have to consider all measures that could make a difference.  My initial reaction is that I have no wish to put anything in place that could lead to a reduction in the genuine deterrent that the system of penalty points offers.  Anyway, Deputy Dooley made a point about the need for further study.  I believe the matter should be looked at and it certainly will be.</p> <p>  We have discussed the question of the interface between drones and civil aviation.  I agree with Deputy Dooley that we are going to have to deal carefully with this matter, because we will see more of these units in future.  It is going to require more work and focus.</p> <p>  Deputy Fleming put several points to me.  If an area does not have an active retirement group, I imagine the Road Safety Authority would try to find a different way of making that information available.  Deputy Fleming asked how we could extend this in schools.  As he said, the first phase will involve pupils between the ages of 13 and 16 years.</p> <p>  Deputy Fleming raised the question of information on roadside drug testing.  When we publish the Bill I hope to be in a position to give this information to the Deputy through the explanatory memorandum.</p> <p>  Deputy Fleming made another point about the role of drones in the work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  By virtue of the fact that these units can move quickly and operate efficiently, they could well play a role in future.  Obviously, that is a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner.</p> <p>  Deputy Fleming also referred to articulated lorries and the spray effect.  I will mention the matter to the Road Safety Authority.  I imagine this is one reason the RSA has a focus on the need for a safe distance between vehicles, so that when the spray is generated it is does not immediately get in the way of or reduce the visibility of drivers.</p> <p>  Deputy Fleming put a point to me on airspace.  Sovereign airspace has a 12 mile limit around the jurisdiction, our country.  We have no evidence at the moment of incursions into sovereign airspace.  Of course, activity proximate or adjacent to our airspace is monitored by the Irish Aviation Authority.  I am keen to relay to Deputy Fleming that we have no evidence of incursions into the airspace of our country, our sovereign airspace.</p> <p>  Senator Mooney put a question to me relating to the roll-out of Leap cards.  We sold the millionth Leap card earlier this year.  The next phase of the development of Leap cards will be through their roll-out in cities throughout Ireland, particularly through integration with the systems of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  That is the way we are going to do it and we have plans in place.  This is purely a matter of national competence.  Any discussions that take place in the European Union relate only to information sharing rather than anything else.</p></speech>

They are more at risk of penalty points.  The Minister made reference to being a few kilometres per hour over the speed limit.  Can we consider a system for professional drivers whereby they might pay a fine first time around and get a slap on the wrist second time around if they are only over the limit by a few kilometres per hour?  It can happen.  Everyone is human and this will happen.  These people are at greater risk because they are on the road constantly.  Can this be looked at?</p></speech>

On the issue the Deputy raises, I will ask for information on whether professional drivers, particularly in the road haulage industry, are more likely than other road users to receive penalty points or have sanctions imposed on them.  I am not aware if that is the case.  However, I will check the position on behalf of the Deputy to determine whether there is any basis for introducing the type of change he suggests.  Tachograph devices record speed as well as the periods during which a vehicle is being driven.  Given that this information is captured at all times, I expect that the safety records of professional drivers must be very good.  I am genuinely reluctant to make changes that would reduce the deterrent effect of road safety legislation.  However, I will soon meet representatives of the Irish road haulage industry to discuss other matters.  Perhaps I will ask them at that meeting for their perspective on the implementation of the law.  We may be able to make some progress on that basis.</p></speech>
