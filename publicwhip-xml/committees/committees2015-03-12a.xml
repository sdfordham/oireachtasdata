In our sessions today we will focus on the theme of relationships between State authorities, political parties, elected representatives, supervisory authorities, banking institutions and the property sector.  Later this morning we will hear from the former <i>The Irish Times</i>journalist Mr. Frank McDonald, but in our first session we will hear from Dr. Elaine Byrne, a consultant for the European Commission on corruption and governance.  She is also a journalist with <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>.  During her career she has worked as a governance consultant for the United Nations, the World Bank and Transparency International.  She has also held academic appointments at Trinity College Dublin and the University of New South Wales.  She has published widely on Irish politics and is the author of <i>Political Corruption in Ireland</i>, <i>1922</i>-<i>2010</i>: <i>A Crooked Harp</i>.  She was nominated for three national media awards for investigative journalism for her work on allegations of political impropriety.  She is very welcome.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  As informed previously, the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Dr. Byrne to make her opening statment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-12a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Elaine Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015031200002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation.  It is strange being on the other side of the fence, having reported on you.  In the invitation to appear before the joint committee I was asked to address four areas, namely, a narrative on how the property and banking sectors had interacted with government, elected representatives and the State during the period prior to the banking crisis in Ireland; a narrative on the nature of the relationship between the property sector, banking, government, elected representatives and the State; a narrative on what, if any, controls or structures were in place to regulate any such relationship; and whether being a small country was a factor in terms of any such relationship.  What follows is as a consequence of the extensive research I have done on foot of my book, my work as a consultant and a journalist and a presentation of facts.  I will begin to answer these four very broad questions by first looking at the historical context and the culture of deference which I argue was firmly established before the boom.  I will address these issues, primarily by focusing on political donations.<br/><br/>At the heart of the four corruption tribunals in Ireland in the past three decades - the beef tribunal, also known as the Hamilton inquiry; the McCracken tribunal; the Moriarty tribunal and the Mahon tribunal - were serious concerns about how political action was funded.  These tribunals, in particular the McCracken and Moriarty tribunals, exposed a deferential culture by regulatory authorities towards the banking sector during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.  They also identified a deferential culture by banks towards politics and <i>vice versa</i>.  An absence of political will to enforce regulatory compliance was a recurring theme within the tribunals.</p><p>I will give two very brief examples of this.  Central Bank inspectors examined the Guinness and Mahon bank loan book in 1976 and 1978.  The inspectors expressed concern that &quot;Guinness &amp;amp; Mahon was facilitating a tax avoidance scheme [which] was tantamount to facilitating tax evasion&quot;.  The Central Bank inspectors discovered that one of its own directors had a loan of &pound;416,000 which was secured by a &pound;230,00 offshore deposit in the Cayman Islands.  The response by the Central Bank was to trust a promise made by the then Guinness and Mahon chief executive who promised that the bank would wind down its loan business to Irish residents which was backed by offshore deposits.  This promise was not kept.<br/><br/>Twenty years later, the McCracken tribunal discovered the consequence of this deference.  Ansbacher was the largest incidence of tax evasion in the history of the State.  Revenue subsequently yielded over &euro;112 million in unpaid taxes and penalties from 200 Ansbacher accounts.  This tax evasion was enabled by non-action by the Central Bank, Revenue Commissioners, company law regulators and prosecuting authorities.  For instance, although the Finance Act 1986 empowered Revenue to inspect non-residence declarations held by financial institutions, it did not do so.  <br/><br/>The second example of deference I will give is that of Charles J. Haughey's indebtedness to Allied Irish Bank which spiralled from &pound;188,000 to &pound;1.1. million in a four year period between 1975 and 1979.  The Moriarty tribunal noted that AIB &quot;exhibited a marked deference in its attitude&quot; towards the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il.  On his election as Taoiseach in December 1979, Mr. Haughey's personal overdraft was 77 times his &pound;14,717 gross annual salary.  Mr. Haughey's financial adviser, who also happened to be the <i>de facto</i>chief executive of Guinness and Mahon bank, negotiated a &pound;393,000 write-down of the Taoiseach's debts.  The tribunal described this &quot;somewhat unorthodox&quot; bank discount which amounted to one third of Mr. Haughey's overall arrears, as conferring &quot;a substantial benefit on Mr. Haughey in circumstances referrable to his political office and as an indirect payment&quot;.  Moreover, the Moriarty tribunal established that Mr. Haughey received at least &pound;9.1 million in donations between 1979 and 1996.  The McCracken and Moriarty tribunals revealed a distinctive overlap between prominent financial donors of Mr. Haughey and individuals within the banking and property sectors.  The journalist Colm Keena, in particular, has written and investigated a lot of this overlap.<br/><br/>The purpose of these two brief lessons from the tribunals is to illustrate that a culture of deference between State authorities, political parties, elected representatives, supervisory authorities, banking institutions and the property sector, was already well established by the 1990s.  This culture of deference operated in a context where political parties and individual politicians were particularly financially vulnerable.<br/><br/>The committee asked me to explain the narrative of the relationship between these different entities and I will do so by first looking at disclosed political donations to political individuals and political parties in the three elections of 1997, 2002 and 2007.  What follows is a short explanation of legislation on political funding as a means of describing the nature of the relationship between politics and the property and banking sectors.  The purpose of this is to demonstrate that it is impossible to present a complete picture of how political parties financed their 1997, 2002 and 2007 election campaigns.  Not all donations were legally required to be disclosed.  None the less, the disclosed donations infer a pattern as illustrated in the three graphs in the appendix to this submission.<br/><br/>The Electoral Act 1997 was enacted in response to controversy arising from unorthodox political donations which came to public attention during the course of the beef tribunal.  It emerged that some political individuals and political parties were reliant on donations from the beef industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  This relationship between the beef industry and politics created the public perception that a <i>quid pro quo</i>existed, in other words, that political donations facilitated policy decisions which benefited the beef sector.  <br/><br/>The 1997 Act established new rules for the disclosure of political donations.  For the first time in the history of the Irish State, political donations over a certain limit were required to be disclosed.  The threshold for disclosure of donations to political individuals, including candidates in D&aacute;il, Seanad, European and presidential elections, was &euro;634.87.  The threshold for disclosure of donations to political parties was &euro;5,078.95.  There was no limit as to how much could be donated.  <br/><br/>The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, maintained the disclosure limits under the 1997 Act but introduced a limit as to how much could be donated.  The threshold for disclosure of donations to political individuals remained at &euro;634, however, donations by the same donor must not exceed &euro;2,539 in any given year.  The threshold for disclosure of donations to political parties remained at &euro;5,078.  However, donations by the same donor must not now exceed &euro;6,349 in any given year.  Also of significance was the banning of foreign donations in circumstances where the donor was not an Irish citizen.<br/><br/>The Electoral Act 1997 and the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, required that political individuals, including candidates, and political parties must submit an annual statement of donations and election expenditure to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  I compiled information from the archives of the Standards in Public Office Commission for a ten-year period in order to construct the graphs in the appendix relating to political party funding.  Where I was unsure about particular figures I took the conservative approach and when in doubt I did not include them.  <br/><br/>I will now deal with disclosed donations to political individuals.  Figure No. 1 in the appendix represents all disclosed donations to political individuals between 1997 and 2009.  The period includes the 1997, 2002 and 2007 general elections.  In doing so it must be clearly acknowledged that this figure represents disclosed donations as opposed to undisclosed donations, donations under the &euro;634 threshold.  There are a number of observations that can be extrapolated from this data.<br/><br/>First, disclosed donations to political individuals significantly increased in election years.  That is not rocket science.  Second, Fianna F&aacute;il representatives attracted almost twice as many disclosed donations as all the other parties combined during the 2002 and 2007 general elections.  That Fianna F&aacute;il candidates were the beneficiaries of more disclosed donations than candidates from other parties is not surprising because proportionate to other parties, Fianna F&aacute;il traditionally runs more candidates.  For instance, of the 466 candidates who ran in the 2002 election, 22% were from Fianna F&aacute;il.  None the less, during that election year, Fianna F&aacute;il received two thirds of all funding disclosed which means that candidates from that party were in receipt of seven times more disclosed donations than a non-Fianna F&aacute;il candidate.  Third, it is not possible to break down the sources of disclosed donations as is the case for party donations because the donations tend to be from individuals without reference to business addresses.  I can deal with this in more detail later if the committee wishes.<br/><br/>Political individuals attracted significantly more disclosed political donations than political parties, notwithstanding the 2001 amended rules which introduced a higher donation limit to political parties of just over &euro;6,000, compared to donations to political individuals at just over &euro;2,500.  Disclosed donations to political individuals in 2007 amounted to &euro;855, 995.  Excluding subscriptions from the salaries of elected representatives to their parties, disclosed donations to political parties in 2007 amounted to just &euro;43,693.  It appears that it is more attractive to donate to political representatives than to political parties.<br/><br/>I will now look at disclosed donations to political parties.  Figure No. 2 in the appendix represents all disclosed donations to political parties between 1997 and 2009.  A number of observations can be extrapolated from this data.  Since the introduction of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, which introduced a limit on the value of donations to be disclosed, a pattern emerged whereby all political parties disclosed under the limit.</p><p>For example, the disclosed donations by all political parties in 2001 amounted to &euro;753,523, the year before the 2002 election.  In contrast, the disclosed donations by all political parties in 2006 amounted to &euro;17,000, the year before the 2007 election.  These figures exclude politicians donating to themselves or their own political parties.  There appears to be a deliberate policy by political parties of soliciting donations below the disclosure thresholds.  This is perhaps due to the relatively small difference in the maximum donation that can be accepted by a political party, &euro;6,349, and the amount that must be disclosed, &euro;5,078.  The Fine Gael Party returned a nil disclosure to the Standards in Public Office Commission from 2001 to 2009 and, in fact, made its first disclosure last year.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party, the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party disclosed zero returns in disclosed donations for 2009, the year all three political parties ran substantial local and European by-election campaigns and a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon.<br/><br/>It is impossible to present a complete picture of how political parties were financed in this period.  Of the &euro;10.1 million spent by political parties and candidates in the 2007 general election which was disclosed to the Standards in Public Office Commission, just &euro;1.3 million of the donations was disclosed, with no information available on the origins of the remaining &euro;8.8 million.  That gap allows an unnecessary perception that something unorthodox is happening with political funding, but much of it can be explained by membership fees, annual draws and so forth.  The &euro;10.1 million figure does not encompass all of what was spent during the 2007 election.  The legislation only requires election expenditure in the period between the dissolution of the D&aacute;il and polling day, usually a period of three to five weeks, to be accounted for.  Electioneering prior to this period is not accounted for.  Election campaigning in the 2007 election, for instance, was well under way before May 2007.  The pre-election statement of intent between Fine Gael and the Labour Party, known as the &quot;Mullingar Accord&quot;, was inaugurated in 2004 and accompanied by a billboard campaign.  <br/><br/>I will now look at disclosed donations to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party by sector.  Figure 3 in the appendix represents all disclosed donations to Fianna F&aacute;il, excluding the donations to political representatives or individuals between 1997 and 2007.  They amounted to &euro;1.8 million; 80% of this figure was donated between 1997 and the change of the rules in 2001.  Subsequent to the 2001 Act, the maximum donation a party could receive was limited to &euro;6,349.  As outlined, this is an incomplete picture of how the Fianna F&aacute;il Party was funded because there are no statutory obligations to disclose donations below the legal threshold of &euro;5,078.  Nonetheless the figures do infer trends regarding sources of political donations.  The figures are as follows: some 35%, or &euro;635,970, of Fianna F&aacute;il's disclosed donations were from property and construction interests.  Fianna F&aacute;il received substantial donations in 1998 for the particular and stated purpose of campaigning in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement referendum.  When these are excluded, disclosed donations from property and construction interests amounted to 39%, or &euro;545,818.  A list of property companies and developers who donated to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party can be accessed on the Standards Commission's website.  All of them are on the public record.  Some 20% of the disclosed donations to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in that period came from business interests and amounted to &euro;367,000; 13% came from individuals, amounting to just over &euro;245,000; 9% came from the hotels and catering sector and amounted to just &euro;160,000; 7% came from the motor sector and amounted to just over &euro;122,000; just over 7% came from the food and drinks sector and amounted to just over &euro;126,000, while 5%, or about, &euro;90,000 came from banks and financial services.  This figure does not include, however, donations by individuals who were donating in a personal capacity but who were associated with the banking sector.  Some 4% or just over  &euro;70,000 were from professional services such as solicitors' firms and auctioneers.  Also in that period 34% or almost &euro;89,000 of the disclosed donations of the Progressive Democrats jof &euro;262,000 came from the property sector.<br/><br/>It appears that the property barons of the 1990s and 2000s had replaced the beef barons of the 1980s.  The Opposition did not disclose donations from property interests.  The Fine Gael Party disclosed a sum of &euro;197,914 in donations between 1997 and 2000 from a variety of businesses and individuals - 11 donations in all - but it did not disclose donations above the legal threshold from 2001 to 2009.  Almost two thirds of the Labour Party's &euro;392,000 in disclosed donations came from the trade union movement.  Sinn F&eacute;in was in receipt of almost &euro;1.3 million in disclosed donations in this period, much of it from the salaries of elected representatives, North and South, and organisation such as Friends of Sinn F&eacute;in, Australia and Friends of Sinn F&eacute;in, America.  I can give a breakdown of all the figures for all of the parties, if needed.  <br/><br/>The committee also asked me to look at controls and structures to regulate such relationships.  I will look at them by considering policy.  Irish legislation was criticised by the Council of Europe Group of States against Corruption, GRECO, in 2009 for failing to account for &quot;behaviour of those persons who are close to power and who try to obtain advantages from their situation by influencing the decision-maker&quot;.  Reliance on political donations from a particular sector may facilitate a perception of undue influence by donors over policy-making.  This undue but not illegal influence of vested interests over regulation and policy-making arises where elites have access to insider information which they utilise for their private benefit.  This informal misuse of power occurs where personal relationships, patronage, lobbying, political favours and political donations unduly influence the decision-making process, even if no laws are broken.<br/><br/>Did donors from the property sector have a vested interest in the formulation of policy?  Was the decision-making capacity of political parties eroded by a conflict of interest?  Were key political decisions insulated from critical debate because they were executed within a closed and cartelised system that facilitated regulatory capture?  What did the Honohan, Regling and Watson, Nyberg and Wright reports have to say about policy in this regard?  They offered limited analysis of the policy-making process outside he financial sector.  The Honohan report dedicated just six paragraphs to tax incentives aimed at the construction sector.  The Regling and Watson report briefly described the problem of policy analysis, design and implementation as &quot;unusually severe&quot;, pointing, in particular, to weaknesses in tax policy.  The Nyberg report had five paragraphs on what it termed &quot;advice on economic policy&quot;.  The Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, found that &quot;significant factors contributing to the unsustainable structure of spending in the Irish economy were due to the Government's procyclical fiscal policy stance, budgetary measures aimed at boosting the construction sector, and a relaxed approach to the growing reliance on construction-related and other insecure sources of tax revenue&quot;.  According to the Honohan report, tax reliefs incentive schemes and income tax exemptions for developers and investors included:<blockquote>multi-storey car parks, student accommodation, buildings used for third-level educational purposes, hotels and holiday camps, holiday cottages, rural and urban renewal, park-and-ride facilities, living over the shop, nursing homes, private hospitals and convalescent facilities, sports injury clinics and childcare facilities.  </blockquote>The Regling and Watson report noted that such tax reliefs &quot;directed to the property sector, often in particular regions of the country ... contributed to a more general misallocation of resources as some of the tax concessions seemed to have been granted on an ad-hoc basis in a not fully transparent way&quot;.  The incentives were not necessarily bad, as they brought much needed investment to particular areas of the country.  The problem was that they went on for too long.  As the committee has heard, Mr. Wright has acknowledged in his testimony to the banking inquiry that these policies should have been &quot;grandfathered&quot; or ended earlier.  <br/><br/>Why were reliefs extended twice in the period of their implementation?</p><p>For example, the Finance Act 1994 and Chapter 1, Part 9, of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provided for accelerated capital allowances for hotels.  While this special provision for hotels was terminated in budget 2003, the Finance Act 2003 included transitional arrangements that allowed for the continued availability of a 100% write-off over seven years provided certain conditions were met.  This arrangement was further extended in the Finance Acts 2004 and 2005.  The Finance Act 2006 extended the transitional period by introducing a phase-out period.  Peter Bacon, who has also come before the committee, complied a report for the Irish Hotels Federation which asserted that "The tax allowance scheme allowed hotels to access both equity and debt finance easier than would be the case otherwise ... the total value of tax allowance related to hotels that have not been open seven years at the end of 2009 will be just over &euro;1.5 billion".</p><p> Other incentives of note include the 2000 to 2007 special incentive tax rate for developers.  This sought to free up land for development by taxing proceeds from the sale of land at 20% instead of the higher rate of up to 42%.  Moreover, Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 was amended in 2002 to allow developers to negotiate their way out of providing 20% social and affordable housing in any development through land swap, payments to local authority or the building of equivalent social and affordable housing elsewhere.  It would be helpful if the committee considered the following: a list of the tax reliefs and incentives granted by the Government to developers and investors between 1997 and 2007; the cost of these reliefs and incentives; the reason tax incentives were extended beyond their natural life spans; whether the structure of local government funding facilitated a financial dependency on development levies; whether reliance on such levies, worth nearly &euro;600 million in 2005 and &euro;700 million in 2006, influenced erroneous planning decisions; and the number of politicians, or their close associates, who received interest-free loans or mortgages on favourable terms or who received loans outside of normal lending practices.</p><p> The committee also asked me to look at suggested reforms and controls to moderate these kinds of relationships and I now turn to these.  I have presented eight reforms to regulate such relationships.  First, is independent audit of the capacity and operational ability of oversight agencies, including the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the Central Bank, the Revenue Commissioners, the Competition Authority and other agencies charged with the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of white collar crime.  This approach was taken in the UK after its financial crisis.  In 2008, the UK's Attorney General commissioned the De Grazia review which appraised the Serious Fraud Office, SFO, in regard to two US agencies, which were the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.  These were both well established bodies prosecuting serious and complex economic crime.  The review's 34 recommendations focused on operations, capacity, governance and external relationships.</p><p> Second, I recommend introducing monetary awards for whistleblowers.  This approach was taken in the USA following the economic crisis.  The Dodd Frank Act 2010 established the Office of the Whistleblower.  The Act expanded powers first introduced under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002.  The Securities and Exchange Commission is now authorised by the US Congress to provide monetary awards ranging between 10% and 30% of the money collected in cases where high quality original whistleblower information leads to a commission enforcement action of over $1 million in sanctions.</p><p> My third recommendation is the introduction of a register of liabilities.  Australia, Finland, New Zealand, Poland, Spain and Canada require politicians to publicly disclose any debts they may have.  Ireland only has a register of assets.</p><p> Fourth, I note that the Standards in Public Office Commission's annual report 2013 contains 20 recommendations on reforming our ethics and electoral legislation.  I submitted an additional six recommendations on the draft guidelines on party finance in my submission to the commission in 2013.</p><p> Fifth, I recommend that political parties be required to publish accounts under the guidelines on party finance in advance of the 2016 general election.  The delay by the Government in introducing these guidelines means that parties are not obliged to publish accounts until mid-2016 which may, in effect, be after the 2016 general election.</p><p> Sixth, I recommend the establishment of an independent commission to decide how political activity in Ireland is funded.  The principle that politicians should not regulate themselves is well established.  For example, political actors do not decide constituency boundaries.  Ireland's rules on political funding disproportionately favour incumbents and political parties.</p><p> My seventh recommendation relates to lobbying and seeks registration not only of lobbyists but of why decisions have been made.  I recommend the introduction of a web-based centralised information platform to co-ordinate consultations with individuals, stakeholders and lobby groups.  This would serve to report on input received on policy and detail how decisions were made.  It would improve the openness and transparency of engagement in policy-making by all actors.  Stakeholder and lobbying interaction is recorded by health department in Canada within what they call the Consultation and Stakeholder Information Management System, or CMIMS.</p><p> My eighth recommendation is to stop blaming our small population or geographical size for bad governance.  The committee asked me to examine whether being a small country is a factor in terms of problematic relationships.  The population size of a country is not a determining factor in measuring governance effectiveness.  Academic research shows that poor governance is correlated with the quality of institutions, in respect of which Niamh Hardiman went into considerable detail yesterday, lower levels of investment and growth, inequality, education, democratisation, colonial heritage, religion and an absence of legislative controls.  In Ireland's case, substantial levels of regulation combined with a high degree of State ownership have facilitated considerable political discretion.  These conditions have been at the heart of the majority of governance scandals since the foundation of the State.</p><p> In the appendix to my written submission, I include a table ranking the governance scores of 17 selected countries for 2008.  That year was chosen as the year of Ireland's financial crisis.  Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index, CPI, is a compilation of corruption scores which ranks countries from least corrupt to most corrupt while the World Bank measures good governance using six different indicators, of which four are presented in the appendix.  Although Transparency International and the World Bank use different aggregation methods, they are highly correlated.  The population sizes of the 17 countries is also set out in the table.  While this is a crude exercise, it demonstrates that countries with smaller and larger populations rank both higher and lower than Ireland in the good governance stakes.  Indeed, the table suggests that countries with smaller populations tend to have better governance than countries with larger populations.  To invoke being a small country is to use a bogeyman argument.  It is a lazy explanation for poor governance.  Many small countries escaped the economic collapse unscathed while many large ones did not.</p></speech>

I would reply, "So you are saying that Ireland is more corrupt than all of the African countries and countries that have had dictatorships and so forth".  There is a misperception in Ireland about how corrupt we are.  In comparative terms, which one can see in the table I have given at the end of my submission, Ireland ranks about the same as the UK, Germany and Belgium.</p></speech>

At the close of the 1992 general election, for instance, Fianna F&aacute;il was in debt to the tune of &euro;3.5 million and Fine Gael owed more than &euro;1 million.  That perhaps was, in part, due to the turbulence of elections and campaigning in the 1980s.  What I was trying to set there is the context, that by the time the boom came about political parties and political individuals were very financially vulnerable.  In my book I detailed particular individuals and their struggles to finance their elections.  Even if it was a small donation it would have meant quite a lot to those individuals and political parties, which may then have presented a more opportune example or opportunity for individuals and parties to be influenced.</p></speech>

There was the Tully tribunal in 1975 that lasted two hours - the shortest tribunal in the history of the State.  There was also serious allegations on the front page of the <i>Sunday Independent</i>by an outstanding investigative journalist called Joe MacAnthony.  A lot of what we subsequently were to find out was already in the public domain in the 1970s.<br/><br/>In my chapter I argued that the national coalition - the Fine Gael-Labour coalition - and some of their actions, ensured that these things were not fully investigated.  I remember interviewing the former Attorney General and High Court judge, Declan Costello, extensively about this.  In the archives I found a memorandum he had sent to the Government.  Around that time, in the UK, they were looking at introducing conflict of interest legislation.  Mr. Costello brought this to Cabinet, he sat at Cabinet at that time.  The UK introduced much of the legislation which subsequently came into being in the mid-1990s, particularly around conflict of interest but there was a reluctance to introduce it here, and Mr. Costello was very frustrated at that.  Twenty or 30 years later he was still noticeably frustrated that the Government, despite very obvious scandals happening, chose not to introduce legislation which would have regulated some of this behaviour.  <br/><br/>I think the point the Senator has made is that in the 1970s something happened in Ireland that had not happened before, and that was to do with population changes.  There were more people living in urban Ireland, for the first time, than there was in rural Ireland and one had this pressure on cities that one did not have before.  More people wanted to move into cities, more people wanted planning permission and the existing system was not structured for that demand.  A way of getting around that demand and delays in getting planning permission and facilities was that people tended to give money for planning permission or for certain facilities.</p></speech>

Often one finds that the law is catching up to address different concerns that arise.  We must remember that the first legislation directly on corruption in Ireland was introduced in 1995.  With the existence of the Irish State before that period, our legislation on corruption and ethics was derived from British statutes, from 1889, 1908 and 1916.  One had this kind of gap where there was no legislation whatsoever to moderate regulated relationships between different entities.</p><p>Arguably, one could say there was a lot of behaviour in politics in the 1980s and 1990s which, if it were to happen now, would certainly come under corruption legislation.  It was not corrupt because there was no legislation which stated it was corrupt, but just because there was no legislation which stated it was corrupt does not mean that it was not corrupt.</p></speech>

I did not find relevant what the name of a political party was because it was about proximity to power.  There has been a lot of research in other countries where that happens.  I do not believe a particular political party and its membership somehow come from a different genetic pool from other political parties and their memberships.  If political party X had been in power for a long period of time, rather than political party Y, I am not so sure the behaviour would have been that different.  Often when people talk about corruption, it is very easy to do it.  One may talk about individuals and corruption is very sexy; it is very easy to politicise it.  What I try to do, however, is to rise above its politicisation.  I do not believe it is about a particular political party or particular political individuals.  I believe it is about how long these political parties or political individuals have been in power.</p></speech>

For two or three years I sat on the strategic policy committee of Dublin City Council.  From that experience I found that city councillors of all hues and political backgrounds were extraordinarily committed to local government and extraordinarily committed to their city.  Also, there was incredible frustration at the limit to what they could do in local government because of funding issues.  Local government in Ireland has very weak financial autonomy compared to that in other EU countries.  There is a large reliance on central government funding.  In Dublin City Council's case, for a decade there were outstanding fees from the Government in property taxes on State buildings around the city.  Therefore, I think this weak financial base of local government in the 1990s and the influx of money in property development levies gave local government a large dependence on property levies.  I defer again, however, to people who are experts on local government.</p></speech>

On page 238 of the book she quotes Eurobarometer research that the level of trust in government in Ireland fell from 46% to 10% between June 2008 and June 2009.  Is that connected with the work of this committee?  Was it a critical factor?  It is certainly contemporaneous with one of the events at which we are looking.</p></speech>

There were similar falls in the level of trust in other countries like Spain and Greece where they had a deep financial collapse.  I will point again to the mismatch between the perception in Ireland of corruption and how we compared to other countries.  In a survey last year for the European Commission European consultants found that 81% of Irish people believed corruption was widespread.  Some 24% believe the Government's efforts to combat corruption are effective.  I guess this comes back to the analogy I often use about shoes and shoelaces.  In many ways, Ireland has some of the best legislation in the world on governance and ethics.  America and the United Kingdom would give their right arm for the limits on political donations we have and Exchequer funding for political parties.  The US President's recent appointee as ambassador to Ireland is a political appointment, as all appointees are.  Such a concept would be alien to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  There are lots of things where Ireland stands head and shoulders above other countries when it comes to the legislative framework we have in place.  I argue that new shoes are no good unless one has tied the shoelaces.  Despite having very good shoes, or good legislation, what happens is that we trip over the small things.  We trip over implementation, perception and culture, which is quite frustrating.</p></speech>

For the benefit of the committee and people watching, what were these measures?</p></speech>

In the archives I found a memorandum for the Government, which was about six or seven pages long.  I remember sending it to him and we met afterwards.  The tone of the language in that memorandum was so strong and exhibited very deep anger and frustration at the behaviour of politics and political parties in Ireland in the early to mid-1970s and proposals to address it.  At the time there was the Poulson affair in the United Kingdom where similar issues had arisen.  I will give one reform that he suggested, apart from introducing conflict of interest legislation under which councillors or TDs would have to declare, for instance, that not only were they politicians but that they were also directors of property companies or were being paid as consultants by property companies.  He was critical of the Local Government Act 1946 which had repealed the 1898 order obliging local councillors to declare conflicts of interest.  He drew attention to the Housing Act 1966 which had yet to be applied and the difficulties in providing for an offence under the outdated Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act 1889.</p><p>He noted that no legislation whatsoever dealing directly with corruption and ethics had been introduced in Ireland since the British statutes.</p></speech>

To the Irish mind, this could be very controversial.  There have been a number of cases in the last year or two where whistleblowers working within banks have received reward payments of several million dollars and given information about fraudulent practices that had been occurring within their institutions.  I have written several newspaper articles detailing the whistleblowers involved, the fines that have been imposed as a consequence of their information and the money that they have received.  It has worked very successfully in America.</p></speech>

This was a matter pertaining to the sugar company.  The Minister said in the D&aacute;il, "I know it is a widely held view among the professions in this country that dog does not eat dog.  I believe, however, that the taxpayer who paid &pound;1.1 million for this report was at least entitled to one bite".   The tone certainly reminds us of the Minister.  Are professions not being accountable in Ireland a major issue to which he was drawing attention?  Are they ever called to account?  Is that part of our non-accountable society?</p></speech>

I think, until the mid-1990s, politics in Ireland and political behaviour were self-regulated.  In the book, I go through different instances where the suggestion of regulating political behaviour was seen as not trusting politicians and how dare someone suggest such things.  In particular, Ms Eithne FitzGerald, when she was Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs in the early 1990s, received incredible abuse for suggesting that politicians needed to have conflicts of interest and so forth.  The suggestion that to do so would be abhorrent.  We had very much a self-regulating culture in Ireland, whether it was in politics or the church or professions.  Each of the professions has its own organisation that self-regulates behaviour.  As we have seen through the crash, a lot of things were dealt with in-house and probably did not receive the appropriate legal attention that they should have.</p></speech>

If the questions that were asked in the D&aacute;il were answered in the way they are answered here, there would be no need for this inquiry.  Does that indicate a culture of dishonesty in the permanent government?</p></speech>

This was where, over many years, different Deputies were asking very pertinent and direct questions about issues pertaining to the export of beef to Iraq.  At the tribunal, when that particular politician - was it Ray Burke? - was up before it, the response was, "They never asked the right questions, therefore, I never gave them the right answers".  It exposed - this is again going back to what Professor David Farrell would have referred to yesterday - the weakness of the D&aacute;il in respect of getting answers from the Government of the day.</p></speech>

As to the current lobbying legislation, its emphasis is on registering who the lobbyists are, but not necessarily on why Ministers have made particular decisions.  In Canada, this works quite well.  In its legislation, when amendments have been made, one will see it.  A friend who works at a senior level in the Canadian Government explained this process to me.  Every Friday, it will go up on the website of the particular Department - the different legislation, the reasons for the different amendments, links to who gave proposals and all of that.  It is a very clear, line-by-line explanation for why Ministers and decision makers came to make particular decisions on legislation.</p></speech>

The 2008 OECD report on public service in Ireland focused a lot on this question and noted the absence in Ireland of a tradition of what would be known as regulatory impact analysis.  Some Departments now, particularly the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, are very much focusing on this but where one looks at what the unintended consequences of this legislation will be, how much will this particular decision cost and how will it impact other legislation, it is not just about introducing something at will, but looking at the potential effect of that legislation down along the line.  That is a tradition that, perhaps, we could use more effectively here.</p></speech>

That would have involved in 2008 a series of round tables with different actors, including people from the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  From what we gathered, the effectiveness of the Committee of Public Accounts is often based on the relationship between the Chair of that committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General as to what to focus on and what not to.  So, there is very much an informal aspect to it.</p> <p>  I think a lot of agencies, whether it is the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Competition Authority or whatever it may be, are very reluctant to say publicly they need more resources.  If one goes through the cuts that have been made to different agencies that have responsibility for oversight in the past four or five years, some of the cuts have been incredible - 20% or 25% - at a time when their workload has increased.  It seems a very counterproductive effort.</p></speech>

The idea is that one is not just influenced by what shares one may own.  A register of liabilities is what assets one has and what shares one has, as the members all know from doing these forms every year, but it also lists what one's financial vulnerabilities are.  Maybe there is a conflict because one owes a lot of money to a particular bank or institution.  In Canada when I looked at it, in the case of its Minister of Finance, if one goes online, one will see the loans he has.  Not the exact amount of loans, but the loans that he has and his exposure to different banks.  It is a very open and transparent system.</p></speech>

He wrote it in 2006, I think, about a tradition in Ireland.  Dr. Raj Chari in Trinity College Dublin and Professor Gary Murphy have also looked at this.</p><p>In Ireland, tendering and procurement processes tend not to be as open and transparent as they should be.  Journalists often neglect to read the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s reports, which report serious questions of unorthodox behaviour in the way certain tenders and procurement contracts are awarded.  The annual procurement budget in Ireland is up to &euro;17 billion.  Some members would have more information on it than I.

Before President Obama was doing it, the political parties here were deriving the majority of their funding from small donations from many members.  Most people would be surprised at how much money political parties receive from membership fees, national draws and dinners.  The problem is that the public does not see it, and only sees the gaps between the disclosed and undisclosed money.  This creates a problem.</p> <p>  It is not just about having good legislation but about political leadership and the culture that exists.  Ireland has some of the best legislation in the world around political funding.  Approximately six months after a corruption tribunal reported adverse findings regarding a wealthy businessman, the Taoiseach was ringing a bell with him.  That sent a message to people.  Instead of the Taoiseach standing up, he sat back and rang a bell.  While we can have great legislation, when the public sees there are no consequences and that there are different rules and regulations for different people, it creates an unfair perception.</p></speech>

It is a bogeyman argument.  As Professor Farrell said yesterday, no matter what electoral system we had, the culture would shape itself around it to determine the choices of what we want the electoral system to be.  I am not convinced that changing the electoral system is the big answer that would solve all Ireland's problems.  However, I would defer to people who would have particular expertise on electoral systems.</p></speech>

What does she believe motivates people who make donations to political parties?  I am not talking about members buying a ticket in a national draw or supporting a church gate collection, but non-members of parties who make donations to individuals or parties.  Is it to support an individual candidate in whom they believe, to support the policies of the party or to influence the policies of the party?</p></speech>

There is a danger that because of the enormous abuses that have happened in the funding of political parties in the past - I mentioned four tribunals that examined this - anybody who donates to a political party is regarded as seeking malign influence.  This is wrong and unfair.  People support political parties and political individuals because they believe in democracy and democracy does not run on thin air.  Money is necessary to fund the salaries of research assistants and so forth.  My research shows that when particular sectors have donated in such large amounts to political parties, it suggests they were doing so because they were seeking influence or they felt it was necessary.  It is not unusual and occurs in many countries.  I referred to beef barons and property barons.  In the 1980s, the beef industry was donating to all political parties because beef was the biggest indigenous industry in Ireland at the time.</p><p>In the 1990s and 2000s it was property, because property was fuelling the economy.  If the same rules and culture were in place now, perhaps it would be multinational and technology companies that would be donating to political parties.  Donations often reflect the make-up of the economy.  Regarding the donations to Fianna F&aacute;il, the property sector, auctioneers and solicitors were prominent donors, as were banks and the motor industry.  They were the industries and sectors of the boom.</p></speech>

I believe she was inferring that those in power will invariably get more donations.  Does that lead her to a conclusion that those who are making the donations are seeking to influence those who hold the reins of power?</p></speech>

There are problems with measuring just perception, and Transparency International and other agencies have acknowledged that.

What is Dr. Byrne's opinion of the various political reforms that have been introduced by the current Government and those that are under consideration by the Constitutional Convention?

In many respects, Ireland has some of the best practice legislation on governance.  However, it is about implementation and culture.  There have been various scandals in the last year, for example, relating to Seanad appointments which present a picture to the public that there is somehow unorthodox influence over appointments in public life, when often these things are regulated.</p> <p>  On the Constitutional Convention, as somebody who was part of the reason that it happened through the "We the Citizens" initiative, I am very disappointed by it.  It was a missed opportunity.  Many of the questions that were presented to the Constitutional Convention were not the big questions of the day.  There is a tendency in the Government to focus on numbers in its reforms, for example, how many local councils there are, how many Deputies there are, what are the salaries of particular individuals, whether somebody should vote at 18 years old or 16 years old and whether the age to be President is 35 years old or 21 years old.  There is a focus on numbers in the reform programme by the coalition, rather than on where power is, which was discussed by the witnesses before the committee yesterday.  I think the Constitutional Convention was a missed opportunity.</p></speech>

We are still waiting on the Standards in Public Office Commission reports.  Again, it is a missed opportunity by the current coalition Government not to have put the guidelines on party finance into place when it could have.  It now allows that political parties are not obliged to make their annual reports available for public consumption until, in theory, after the 2016 general election.  This allows, facilitates and enables the perception that something unorthodox is happening.  Political parties should demonstrate their commitment to transparency, accountability and all those buzzwords by disclosing their accounts.</p></speech>

How does one regulate that?  There are ways around legislation, as there are ways around everything.  One of the detailed recommendations I made to the standards commission was that, in theory, X property developer, or whatever sector he or she is from, could make individual donations to each member of a political party.  In that way, the individual is not donating to a political party but to individuals and, in that way, raising the amount of money he is giving annually to an individual.</p></speech>

Much of this is due to the absence of consequences.  More than 200 Ansbacher accounts were identified in the biggest incident of tax evasion in the history of the State but not one single prosecution for tax evasion.  There have been no meaningful consequences from the tribunals of inquiry.  When people see an absence of consequence, then that enables this culture of shrugging shoulders.</p></speech>

I know from speaking privately to the different individuals in these agencies that, again, they are people very committed to their role of oversight but are frustrated they do not have the resources to do so or that there is no information-sharing.  I have written in articles before how the response to the drugs epidemic, along with the murder of journalists and a policeman in the mid-1990s, saw the establishment of one of the most innovative bodies in the world, one which most countries seek to replicate, the Criminal Assets Bureau.  Yet, after the biggest financial crisis in the history of the State, the response is not an overhaul of how fraud and economic crime are investigated, prosecuted and resourced, as was the case in the US or UK.  That to me is incredible and very shortsighted.</p></speech>

She gave the examples of the Guinness Mahon Bank and the Ansbacher affair and the example of the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey&rsquo;s indebtedness to Allied Irish Bank and the writing off of substantial debt.  Did any other former taoisigh receive favourable treatment from a bank when they were financially vulnerable?</p></speech>

AIB wrote off debts of almost &pound;200,000 in 1993.  That followed the collapse of aircraft leasing company GPA, Guinness Peat Aviation, in which he was a shareholder.</p><p>His write-off, by contrast with that of Taoiseach Charles Haughey, occurred after he had left politics, six years after he had been Taoiseach and a year after he had retired from backbench politics.  That matter, the write-down of Garret FitzGerald's &pound;200,000 debt by AIB, was investigated by the Moriarty tribunal which made the contrast between Garret FitzGerald and Charles J. Haughey.  Charles J. Haughey largely kept all of his assets virtually intact, while Garret FitzGerald sold his family home and virtually everything else he owned in a bid to pay off the money he owed.</p></speech>

In the 1990s and late 1980s the main money was from the beef sector.  That is not to say the party or other political parties did not get money from other sources and other individuals in large amounts also.</p></speech>

On page 4 or her opening statement she refers to the 2007 general election.  I was looking at the members of the inquiry and saw that many of us had been candidates in that election.  Dr. Byrne has referred to the fact that only &euro;1.3 million was disclosed of the &euro;10.1 million spent in the entire election campaign.  Has she analysed the amounts of funding individuals put into their own election campaigns?  I was an unsuccessful candidate and virtually everything I spent on the campaign was money I had saved myself, rather than funding from the party as such.</p></speech>

I am aware that right across political parties individuals would have self-financed their campaigns considerably.  There are people who are still paying off credit union loans and things like that.  This begs the question as to whether the political system is predisposed to attracting people of financial means rather than people who may have less access to money, which prevents people from particular areas of life from entering politics as they may wish to do.  The answer to that question is "No" because it is about what is disclosed to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  What I examined were the facts on the Standards in Public Office Commission's annual register over ten years.  These figures were not put on it.  As I have stressed throughout, all this can do is infer patterns.  It is not a complete picture of how political parties or political individuals have funded their campaigns, which is why I argue that one perhaps might need to have an electoral commission or an independent commission to look at how politics in general is funded to address the questions the Deputy has just raised.</p></speech>

Can this be squared?  How could a funding system be designed that would allow equal access?</p></speech>

There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever of that ever occurring.  Political parties, for their referendums and election campaigns, must raise the money from political donations.  Political parties do not set the rules for where their constituency boundaries should be.  When the national coalition did this in the 1970s, disaster followed and a new system was introduced.  On the same principle, why should political parties decide how political parties are funded?  It does not make sense.  It would allow for new entrants to political life to have an alternative income source.</p></speech>

As I was a child politician, I have been a politician for about 16 or 17 years.  It is all about voluntary disclosure.  Is the commission in a position to investigate thoroughly whether that disclosure is complete?</p></speech>

A balance has to be struck, too.  The members are all people in professional life.  Does one create a system in which absolutely every part of one's behaviour is regulated?  There has to be some trust.  The costs of a false declaration are so high in terms of reputation that one really would have to have a very brassy neck to do such a thing.  The vigilance of the public is also so high.  I urge people to look at the recommendations the Standards in Public Office Commission has made repeatedly in its annual reports.  In particular, it sought what it termed an "inquiry officer", who would have the role of making independent inquiries.  There is no such role.</p></speech>

The Local Appointments Commission and the Civil Service Commission, both established in the early 1920, ensured that the local government positions and Civil Service positions were not politicised, in contrast to America where, when a new President comes in to office, all the civil servants leave.  We do not have that system in Ireland.  As I outlined in the book in regard to the beef tribunal in particular, certainly there have been senior civil servants who subsequently went to work for the individuals they had been regulating.  Therefore, there was this revolving door culture of gamekeepers turned poachers.  It is now in some of the agencies in the State managing some of the property assets as well</p></speech>

A quote from Dr. Byrne's book, <i>Political Corruption in Ireland 1922-2010: A Crooked Harp</i>, which has been mentioned before states, &quot;A corrupt Act can be camouflaged by lawful justification&quot;.  I think Dr. Byrne has referenced events which may have happened in the 1970s and 1980s.  Legislation was not in place at the time but if today's legislation was applied then, it would be questionable to say the least.  In regard to the subject matter that this inquiry is investigating, primarily the banking collapse but many other areas from 1992 onwards, does Dr. Byrne believe that statement holds for that period of time and the subject matter under this investigation, or that it is not relevant to the issues we are discussing?</p></speech>

The Department of Justice and Equality is introducing what is known as a trading in influence clause in the corruption legislation.  That certainly regulates that kind of behaviour.  The answer to that question is "Yes".</p></speech>

Will she explain briefly to the committee the concept of "mediated corruption", who it benefits or who it does not benefit, particularly in regard to the investigations which the committee is taking on?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-12a.201" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Elaine Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015031200002#M01100"><p>This mediated corruption goes back to something that may be undue influence but not necessarily illegal.  The trading in influence provision in the new corruption legislation seeks to regulate that.  GRECO and various bodies looking at Ireland's governance framework for many years have been criticising the absence in our legislation of trading in influence.  With that in mind I will quote the definition of "mediated corruption".  I cannot recall the name of the author but it was in relation to the Keating Five.  The gain that the politician sees is political, not personal, and it is not illegitimate in itself as in conventional corruption.  How the public official views the benefit is improper, not necessarily the benefit itself or the fact that the particular citizen receives the benefit.  The connection between the gain and the benefit is improper because it damages the democratic process, not because the public official provides the benefit with a corrupt motive.  I guess this goes back to my experience of working in the United Nations anti-corruption unit where my boss used to say, just because a behaviour is not corrupt in the legal sense it might be morally corrupt.  If one is advising somebody about their behaviour, one might be within the letter of the law but one might be outside the spirit of the law.  For politicians the tide water mark of expectations is very high and often an unfair one.  It is not just about what one is legally obliged to do but what is also morally expected of one.</p></speech>

In page 103, she states, "This period was distinct from previous scandals because it marked the possibility of the gravest form of corruption, that of State capture within political decision making".  Will Dr. Bryne speak to the committee about State capture and the type of actors involved - we are not discussing individuals - bearing in mind the inquiry's terms of reference starting in 1992?</p></speech>

State capture involves individuals determining what that legislation is, that they would have a greater influence over forming that legislation than an ordinary citizen by virtue of their access to decision makers, perhaps because of influence they have, such as the donations that they have given.</p></speech>

It is about competitive advantage.  Political parties are the same in respect of which party will release all its accounts first and so on.  Political parties, in their annual conferences or Ard-Fheiseanna, release information about their accounts.  However, the difference is that under the draft guidelines, they will be obliged to release that information on particular headings in order that one can compare how much each political party has received and spent under different categories.  One can then make an analysis because if a political party simply releases its accounts and states it got X amount of money from donations, one does not know-----</p></speech>

I refer to particular prominent politicians receiving money on the day of the election, individuals going to their houses and giving them the money, or donations being benefits in kind, being free cars or facilities or whatever it may be.  We often get caught up on the brown envelope thing to the effect that a donation or something like that is a <i>quid pro quo</i>.  Often, however, it is indirect and is a case of doing someone a favour and thereafter, down along the line, that person will return the favour in an indistinct way.  Were one intent on committing corruption, one would no longer be doing it the old-fashioned way.  I mean giving money for a favour committed because these things can be traced.  What the Moriarty tribunal in particular exposed was benefits in kind through different land transactions that may have arisen.  Decisions were made and perhaps down along the line, certain benefits were conferred on individuals.  Corruption is not black and white and is not direct.  It is indirect and these relationships are very difficult to examine.</p></speech>

I started on page 1 and will finish on page 239, which is the final page.  In the last sentence of Dr. Byrne's book, she writes, "Ireland&rsquo;s loss of economic sovereignty in 2010, due to a perception of political failure and the unorthodox influence of vested interests, may yet motivate Irish public life to engage in state building and re-imagine Irish society with an emphasis on the moral duties of citizenship".  Has the body politic done enough to see a positive outcome in respect of that statement?</p></speech>

The book really is a positive story about how the foundation of the State was achieved between two world wars, when most democracies were failing but yet that of Ireland was sustained because in the 1920s, the Government introduced measures that deliberately gave away power.  It introduced concepts ahead of its time about meritocracy, some of which I have outlined.  This was not something that was particular to Cumann na nGaedheal or Fine Gael.  An election poster of &Eacute;amon de Valera in 1917 in the East Clare by-election, uses the phrase to vote for a patriot, not a place-hunter.  That idea of politics, held by the first-generation across all political backgrounds, was one motivated by the words the Senator has just used, namely, by this moral duty to the country.</p> <p>  In many respects, Ireland has a lot of positives and has very robust legislation.  For me, it is immensely frustrating to see such silly mistakes being made, these shoelaces over which we continually trip, about public perception over some of the instances I have mentioned, about ringing bells, appointments to the Seanad or whatever it may be, because it generates such attention that does not reflect the legislative regime that we have.  It is about leadership and culture just as much as it is about legislation.  Those two things go hand in hand.</p></speech>

As did Senator Michael D'Arcy, I liked Dr. Byrne's last sentence and its call to arms, as well as the identification that the last time we lost a Parliament - I think Henry Grattan is one of her heroes - it was due to the mass corruption used to undermine that Parliament.  Can Dr. Byrne relate all these thoughts, as well as her presentation this morning, to what this joint committee should do with regard to banks, their auditors and bank regulators?  What principles would she draw from all her work to help this committee in the future?</p></speech>

In Ireland, we have an implementation deficit, so in terms of principles, it is that we would follow through on the legislation and the eight different recommendations I made.  The eighth one is about blaming a small country.  In other words, it pertains to the culture we have about blaming things that are outside of our control, rather than focusing on the things that are within our control.  One such would be to do an audit of the agencies in this State tasked with oversight, which do great work, and to consider the resources they need as well as to look at the information overlaps.  In addition, we perhaps could now, since the collapse of the economy, take the same approach to economic crime that we took to drugs in the mid-1990s.</p></speech>

Before, anybody could donate, and now an Irish citizen can donate.  I do not think there is anything wrong with Irish citizens donating to Irish public life.  I wrote about this last week in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>.  It is an issue.  I assume the Chairman is referring to Sinn F&eacute;in which is enormously funded by organisations outside the State who are not necessarily Irish citizens but donate under the category of friends of Sinn F&eacute;in Australia - less so now - or friends of Sinn F&eacute;in America.

That is how the fine is moderated.  How one prevents against vexatious complaints is that if the agency that is charged with investigating the information by the whistleblower gets a conviction, then wrongdoing has occurred.  I think that answers that question.  That is how one regulates it.  The information has to be good enough.</p></speech>

Dr. Byrne wrote an interesting comment about stating the obvious and that this was one of the things this inquiry could be doing that was not done by others.

I think that referred to Professor Bill Black's comments, as well as other comments that have been made before the inquiry, that it is not just about looking at the institutions but at the individuals within those institutions.  In that article I made reference to legislation and to Judge Rakoff's comments.  He is a pretty amazing individual when it comes to economic crime and his comments about wilful neglect.  Just because an individual does not know, one also should ask, "Well, should they have known?"  There is a responsibility therein.  One cannot just hide behind this veil of "I didn't know."  The question then arises that one should have known and there is liability therein.</p> <p>  The other piece in that article I referred to was in relation to Europe and penalties that the UK is also trying to bring in on not just fining banks, but fining individual bankers.  There has been research done that since 2008 extraordinary fines have been imposed on banking institutions around the world, but behaviour has not changed.</p> <p>  The governor of the Bank of England, who also happens to be an Irish passport holder, has argued very vehemently, "What has changed?"  We have had an economic collapse.  We have had institutions that have collapsed.  We have had massive consequences to individual citizens, but the behaviour of some of these banks has not changed because it is almost like banks are using fines as a line within their accounts.  There is an inevitability about it, "We're going to get fined and, sure, that's part of life."  So instead of focusing just on the institutions one would also focus on the individuals.</p></speech>

We are focusing on the theme of relationships between State authorities, political parties, elected representatives, supervisory authorities, banking institutions and the property sector.</p><p>I welcome  Mr. McDonald, a former journalist with <i>The Irish Times</i>.  He commenced his journalistic career as a freelance New York correspondent for the <i>Irish Press </i>, subsequently becoming a sub-editor and reporter for the paper.  He joined <i>The Irish Times</i>in 1979.  He was the environment correspondent from 1985 to 2000 and environment editor until his official retirement in January of this year.  Mr. McDonald is also author of several books, including <i>The Destruction of Dublin</i>, <i>Saving the City</i>and <i>The</i><i>Construction of Dublin.  </i>He is joint author with Peigin Doyle of <i>Ireland's Earthen Houses</i>and with James Nix of <i>Chaos at the Crossroads, </i>published in 2005, which documented the environmental destruction of Ireland during the boom years.  He is joint author with Kathy Sheridan of <i>The Builders</i>, which profiles the developers and others in the Celtic tiger period.<br/><br/>In recognition of his work, Frank was conferred with an honorary doctorate by Dublin Institute of Technology in 2006.  He was made an honorary member of the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland of 2010 and an honorary fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 2011 and an honorary life member of the National Union of Journalists in 2014.  Mr. McDonald is very welcome to the inquiry this morning.<br/><br/>I advise the witness that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  The witness is asked to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. <br/><br/>I invite Mr. McDonald to make his opening comments to the inquiry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-12a.271" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank McDonald" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015031200002#R00200"><p>It is fair to say that the close relationship between the construction sector in this country, including property developers, and the world of politics, is well-established not only in Ireland but throughout the world.  It is not an unusual phenomenon.  The Galway tent, notorious in its own way, was our version of it until recently.  Back in the 1960s, the nexus of connection between the construction sector and politicians became evident with the formation of Taca, a Fianna F&aacute;il fund-raising organisation which used to run &pound;100-a-plate dinners to raise money for the party and which were pretty scandalous at the time.  It is known that there were close connections between leading property developers and senior politicians, as the latter could facilitate the former in securing State tenants for planned office buildings, particularly in Dublin, to cater for our growing Civil Service.<br/><br/>Politicians at local level also played a crucial role in facilitating ambitious plans.  Since the 1963 Planning Act came into force in October 1964, it has been a &quot;reserved function&quot; of councillors to make decisions on the content of city or county or indeed, town development plans.  What this meant was that they were in charge of zoning land -- making decisions about which land would be designated for development and which land would not be so designated.  They had the power, in other words, to transform the value of agricultural land anywhere in Ireland, multiplying it by a factor of ten or more.  So there was a lot riding on such decisions.<br/><br/>Between 1963 and 1971, land values in the Dublin area soared by 530% as the scale of the development opportunities became evident and speculators scrambled to buy up land likely to be rezoned for housing, industry or whatever.  The then Fianna F&aacute;il Government established a committee on the price of building land, chaired by a renowned constitutional lawyer, Mr. Justice John Kenny, to recommend ways of curbing such speculation.  It proposed that all land required for development should be designated and then acquired at its existing use value, plus a premium of 25%.  Sadly, over the past 40 years, however, nothing was done to implement this recommendation by any Government in the entire period.<br/><br/>It was inevitable under these circumstances that land speculation would continue and that zoning would become tainted by corruption.  Allegations that &quot;brown envelopes&quot; were changing hands, first surfaced in 1974, but a Garda investigation got nowhere.  Subsequent Garda investigations in the late 1980s and again in 1993 also got nowhere.  The latter investigation, the 1993 investigation, incidentally, arose out of a week-long series of articles in <i>The Irish Times</i>written by Mark Brennock and myself, on suspicious land rezoning decisions in County Dublin.  It led off with a news story on the front page, headed, &quot;Cash in brown paper bags for councillors&quot;.  An advertisement placed by a firm of Newry solicitors offering a &euro;10,000 reward on behalf of then anonymous clients for information that would secure the conviction of persons for engaging in land rezoning corruption ultimately led to the establishment of the planning tribunal, chaired first by Judge Feargus Flood and later by Judge Alan Mahon.  The tribunal heard voluminous evidence from witnesses with first-hand experience of corrupt payments and drew a number of conclusions in this regard that were later deemed technically unsound following a Supreme Court ruling.  However, I have no doubt personally that corruption lay at the heart of Dublin County Council&rsquo;s most contentious land rezoning decisions.<br/><br/>One has to remember that the planning tribunal was dealing only with County Dublin as it then was.  I have no doubt that there has been corruption elsewhere; otherwise, decisions made by elected representatives against the advice of planning officials are almost inexplicable.  After all, we have a political system that is based on clientilism - as the members of this committee know very well.  I would define clientilism as doing individual favours for individual constituents, in effect, turning citizens into clients.  How much more of a step is it really to seek &quot;political donations&quot; in return for performing such &quot;services&quot; as rezoning such-and-such a parcel of land rather than such-and-such another parcel of land?  I would suggest that there is not much of a step between those two things.<br/><br/>Local area plans that were intended to give people more control over what happened in their own areas were turned instead into vehicles for land speculation and the enhancement of land values.  This applied right across the board.  Laois, Monaghan, Westmeath and Wexford, were among the counties that fell victim to this trend.  However, every council in Leinster, it seemed, wanted to secure a slice of Dublin&rsquo;s development.  There was massive over-zoning of land during the boom period.  In some cases, so much land was being zoned under county and local area plans that it could cater for decades of housing development.  In one case, enough land had been zoned in a particular county plan that would have catered for housing demand up until the year 2070.  Every county was making these decisions in disregard for what other counties were doing, or not doing, as the case may be.  Pressures from farmers and other landowners to have their patches of land zoned for development reached fever pitch in 2007, as the property bubble inflated to its full overblown size.  It was little short of a frenzy, as I recall.  There was a sense of &quot;It&rsquo;s now or never&quot; in the air, and some feared that they had already missed the boat or, rather in this case, the hot-air balloon.<br/><br/>Pumping up this balloon for most of the period under review was an array of lucrative tax incentives.  There was the long-established section 23 incentive for buy-to-let apartments or houses, and other tax breaks for the development of run-down seaside resorts - a measure introduced by the Rainbow coalition in 1996 - hotels, multi-storey carparks, student housing and a specific area-based tax incentive scheme called the upper Shannon rural renewal scheme, which applied to all of counties Leitrim and Longford as well as parts of Cavan, Roscommon and Sligo.  In theory, nearly anything developed anywhere within this vast designated area would qualify for tax incentives under the scheme introduced in 1998 by then Finance Minister, Charlie McCreevy.  It is hardly surprising then that among the counties severely hit by the phenomenon of ghost estates were Leitrim and Longford, because not only was there massive over-zoning, there was also massive over-development.  <i>Laissez faire</i>planning policies, largely landowner or developer-driven, created the framework for it all to happen while the advent of motorways facilitated and encouraged the sprawl of Dublin and other urban centres by leading people to imagine that they could live up to 100 km from where they worked and get there and back by car.  In Gorey, County Wexford, for example, more than 70% of new residents were commuting to work in Dublin, nearly 90 km to the north.  The same was happening all over Leinster and even in parts of Ulster.  I would instance Virginia, County Cavan, or Carrickmacross in County Monaghan, which have suburban housing estates that are really part of Dublin, in effect.</p><p>Yet, the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, which were adopted in 1999, had stressed the importance of consolidating the metropolitan area.  In other words, the guidelines were anti-sprawl.  Although if the guidelines were to mean anything they would have to be enforced, incredibly, no effort was made to do this either by local or central Government.  If the suburbs of Dublin were springing up in such unlikely places as Rochfortbridge in County Westmeath, which is 80 km from the capital, it was attributed to market forces and people would come to their senses when houses lost their value, which has happened.<br/><br/>The Government even used escalating house prices in Dublin to promote its controversial decentralisation programme, noting that public servants with homes in the capital would do well on selling them and buying a much cheaper house in one of the 53 locations to which more than 10,000 of them were to be dispersed.  The other beneficiaries were the business communities in the towns where new Government office blocks were to be built, including estate agents, shopkeepers, publicans, providers of other local services and those who had sites for sale.  It was the same with property-based tax incentives.  As more investors availed of these incentives, a whole sector of society had a major vested interest in ensuring the incentives continued for as long as possible.<br/><br/>The banking inquiry committee needs to ask why the property-based tax incentives were continued for so long even though the construction industry was having its biggest, most profitable spree ever.  Although it was perfectly justified to introduce the section 23 tax incentive in the late 1980s when the construction industry was on its knees and desperately needed a lift, to persist with these incentives when the construction industry was leading the boom was the height of folly.  The Government was adding fuel to the fire, stoking an already hot furnace.  The committee needs to ask former Ministers for Finance of the period precisely why they decided that a range of property-based tax incentives should remain in place, given that no public interest reason can be offered to justify such an irrational fiscal policy.<br/><br/>The availability of lucrative tax incentives combined with cheap credit and <i>laissez-faire</i>practices in the banking and planning sectors created and sustained the property bubble.  Bankers also played the role of touts for developers.  Frequently, it was bankers who spotted development opportunities at well located sites and lined up client developers to run with them, with the bank providing the loan financing.  Thus, developers ended up &quot;leveraged up to their eyeballs&quot; as one observer put it.  The banks were counting on these developers as men with the Midas touch to repeat their previous performances again and again as more sites came onto the market, even with eye-watering price tags.<br/><br/>So many of us were caught up in the bubble that we could not see it in perspective or at all.  It became normal that a fairly average semi-detached house could be worth &euro;1 million or more and that the price per square metre of residential accommodation was higher in Dublin than it was in Paris.  Every day, banks sought to persuade us to take out loans for new cars, holidays, home improvements, houses or whatever, and many of us did in droves.  That is why economist Professor Morgan Kelly's warning of an imminent collapse in the property market, published by <i>The Irish Times</i>in December 2006, was regarded by many as being as heretical as Martin Luther nailing his theses to the great west door of the Wittenberg cathedral.</p></speech>

Decisions are made on the recommendations of planning officials who adjudicate on particular applications, after which members of the planning committee vote on whether to grant permission, development control of the function of the council as well as the zoning of land.  It is not unusual for councils to be responsible for the zoning of land, and I have no problem with it.  My problem is that many of those decisions were taken at the behest of developers, landowners or speculators who were in business at the time.  The former chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, Mr. John O'Connor, who subsequently went on to chair the Pyrites Resolution Board, drew attention to it at the end of his term of office saying:<blockquote><br /><br />By law, development should be led by democratic plans but during the boom period developers and vested interests had undue influence on plan making.  Developers had little regard for statutory development plans in buying land and designing schemes.  Banks ignored planning parameters in lending, local authorities failed to vindicate their own development plans and An Bord Plean&aacute;la has had to refuse or amend many poor quality development plans on appeal.  Land values were subverted as well.</blockquote>He went on to say that councillors and management succumbed to development pressures.  The notion was that everywhere should be developed.  Local authorities failed to send the right signals to developers.  There were conflicts between management and planners within local authorities, minimal involvement in planning decisions by local authority architects and An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decisions frequently went unheeded by developers.  I would be more than willing to provide a copy of this to the members.</p></speech>

Does the State accrue any immediate income as a result of the increase in land value as soon as the development plan is put in place?</p></speech>

For example, if one had a plan for a new town, one would zone the land required for the new town, having considered all the factors involved.  The entire area would be designated for development and compulsorily acquired by the local authority.  A master plan would be done for the entire development, and then the land would be parcelled up and made available for development.</p></speech>

Towards the conclusion of your opening statement, you say: "Bankers also played a role of touts for developers.  Frequently, it was the banks who spotted the potential of a well-located site and will then line up one of their client developers to run with it."  That is on page 3.  In general macro terms, not specific situations, how prominent was this approach to property development in the banking market, by your reckoning?</p></speech>

I think that banks and developers were working hand in glove in seeking out sites for development.  A lot of the stuff one hears is apocryphal, of meetings between fellows playing golf and all the rest of it, saying: "Oh God, I saw that site in such and such a place.  It's up for sale.  Maybe you should go and by it."  They would say that to one of their developer clients and that was quite common.  Frequently, it would be the developers who would spot the potential of a site, but frequently, because the banks became so involved in property development and lending funds for that, they had a brace of clients.  Each bank had a series of major developer clients.  Without naming any particular bank, I think it is very well known that this was the case.</p></speech>

It would have been a much more rational and straightforward way to do it, instead of having a situation where everybody was champing at the bit, looking for their particular parcel to be rezoned because on rezoning the land would then be worth ten times as much as it was before that.</p></speech>

I know the final Kenny report had a minority report which expressed some concern that this might be unconstitutional.  Let us not forget, however, that the late Judge Kenny was one of the foremost constitutional lawyers in Ireland.  I cannot understand why successive Governments, of every political hue - I am not blaming any party in particular for this - never ran with that.  They never understood the fundamental importance of having a rational system for the development of our towns, cities and elsewhere.</p></speech>

I think that what happened during the boom period was particularly difficult for councillors, however, because of the frenzy element involved in it on the part of landowners, particularly towards the end of the boom.  Before it became clear that it was the end of the boom, if the Deputy gets my drift, landowners in other parts of Leinster, far outside Dublin, were frantic to have their land rezoned.  Where local area plans were being done for villages in Laois, Monaghan or wherever, this was happening on a widespread basis.  Decisions were being made that were totally irrational from a planning point of view, but which satisfied the urge of the landowners in question to make a huge killing on the sale of land for its speculative value as development land.</p></speech>

The amended planning Act introduced in 2010 essentially required local authorities to justify their planning decisions.  In other words, they had to show cause why particular pieces of land were being zoned and not other pieces of land or whatever.  More control was introduced by the legislation over of the excessive zoning of land that took place in the past.  In other words, zoning had to be driven by need rather than the wish of particular landowners to make a profit, or a killing.</p></speech>

Does Mr. McDonald have any comment to make on the extent of cases where planners would have been overruled by their own management, for example, on cases where An Bord Plean&aacute;la would have reversed the decisions of the planners of local authorities and on cases where An Bord Plean&aacute;la would have decided against its own inspector's report where the inspector would have viewed the site but would have been overruled by the board which could not have had such an intimate knowledge?

An Bord Plean&aacute;la acted, in many ways, as a last line of defence against excessive zoning and I would say, in some cases, crazy planning proposals.  I am talking about skyscrapers, 37 storey towers in Ballsbridge and all the rest of it.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la did not go for that and did not see that those decisions were justified.  In some cases, the board would overrule the report of an inspector.  That happens but, in most cases, the board at least attempts to justify why it is making a decision which was not particularly recommended by the planning inspector who dealt with the case.  I suppose one could not expect that the planning inspectors would, in effect, have a monopoly on wisdom either.  The board could take a more considered view or might give more weight to particular Government policies, with national policy overriding whatever reservations one might have about a particular scheme in that if it complied with national policy, the board would be inclined to grant permission for it.  I am thinking of wind farms, for example, which might be very unpopular locally but the board would say that, on balance, because of national policy to encourage renewable energy, it should grant planning permission for the wind farm.</p></speech>

In the Ireland in which I grew up, the maximum a bank would have lent one would have been two and half times one's salary or whatever.  That was very much an issue of prudence.  The banks were being prudent by not over-lending to people.  In France, for example, it is against the law to lend people more money than they can afford to repay.  That is one of the reasons the French banks did not collapse in the way ours nearly did, without the injection of massive sums of money by the State.</p></speech>

My personal belief, as I said in my statement, is that there was such a large constituency of people who benefited from the tax incentives that, in itself, led to a lot of lobbying.  Whenever there was a danger that the incentives would be phased out, there was heavy pressure brought to bear on the Government by the construction industry to continue the incentives for as long as possible and to roll them over.  There were multimillionaires in this country who were property investors and who ended up paying hardly any tax at all because they were availing of so many incentives, including section 23, multi-storey car parks, hotels, student housing and so on.  I think they had the ear of Government.  That is my impression.  The construction industry realised the boomtime could only be sustained if the tax incentives were sustained because otherwise, how could people have thought it was good value to buy a two bedroom flat for &euro;450,000 if it was not for the fact that they were able to write all of that off against their tax liability?  That is what made the difference in terms of the viability of a particular investment.</p></speech>

Following on from questions Deputy McGrath asked in relation to the tax reliefs, Mr. McDonald stated in his opening statement that section 23 was justifiably introduced at the end of the 1980s.  In his view, were any of the other reliefs justifiably introduced at the start?  He pointed out, as did other witnesses, that they were extended for too long but were any of the other reliefs justifiable in terms of their initial introduction?</p></speech>

I would have to be really convinced about that.  I do not believe they were.  I am thinking, for example, of the seaside resorts tax incentive scheme.  What happened was that vast townlands became designated areas.  The area around Courtown in County Wexford, for example, which included Riverchapel and a vast area, was designated and anything built in that area qualified for the tax incentives, in particular holiday homes.</p><p> The real problem with the scheme was that if the aim was to rejuvenate rundown seaside resorts like Enniscrone, Lahinch or Courtown then the incentives should have been restricted to things such as all-weather playing facilities, swimming pools or other such major elements that would have added value to those places.  However, once housing was included as a qualifying category it then ate up the vast bulk of the tax incentives available.  Something like 85% of all the investment leveraged by that tax incentive scheme consisted of houses.  In effect, those houses were three quarter scale.  The great trick of that tax incentive scheme was to persuade people who lived in semi-detached houses in the suburbs to spend their holidays in semi-detached houses, of a lesser scale, in one of the designated areas.  I do not think it was justified to that extent.  If housing had not been included as a qualifying category the scheme might have been very beneficial.</p></speech>

We now have the local property tax but it is different in that it is collected by the Revenue Commissioners rather than by local authorities.  I have always believed in the old saying, "There can be no taxation without representation" and the reverse of that is also true - there can be no representation  without taxation.  Local authorities should have tax powers.  They do not have that.  Revenue is collecting the money from the local property tax, so the direct relationship which should exist between the citizen and his or her local authority is undermined by Revenue's involvement.</p></speech>

The media were leaving themselves open to the accusation they were cheerleaders for the property bubble, not least because of revenue they were earning from it.  In defence of <i>The Irish Times</i>, I would point out that it not only published Morgan Kelly's Cassandra-like article in December 2006, but it also drew attention to the downsides of all of this in other sections of the newspaper.  Kathy Sheridan and I did a series on the commuter counties about people having to get up at 6 a.m., get on the road by 7 a.m. and all the rest of it, if they were to get to work in Dublin by 8.30 a.m.  I do not think it is fair to say that the media were uncritical of what was going on.  I believe those of us who recognised there was a real problem developing were voicing those opinions.</p></speech>

We had Dr. Peter Bacon in with the committee last week.  He is the author of some very well known reports on the housing sector.  He is of the view that the property market in Ireland was too much dominated by internal forces.  He expressed strongly the view there were not enough publicly rated companies involved in funding the property sector and there was not enough investment in the property sector from outside the island of Ireland.  Does the witness share Dr. Bacon's views on that?   Does he think a broader base of investment might have had a different impact on the direction of the property sector in Ireland?</p></speech>

In his book <i>The Builders</i>, co-authored with Kathy Sheridan, the witness details the careers of many of the largest developers and builders in Ireland prior to the crisis.  Can the witness outline briefly how he would describe their approach to business? Does he believe that their entrepreneurial approach had an impact on the subsequent boom in prices and the difficulties which arose from that?</p></speech>

There is nothing wrong with that and we should not be surprised about it.  That is what they do.  There is no point in building something for sale unless one can get a good price for it and make a profit in the process.  That is the basis of the system we have and the developers operated it.</p><p>Again, they had an unlimited supply of credit available to them.  If they wanted to buy a site for &euro;10 million or whatever, it was no problem to them to get the money from the bank.  Every acquisition was funded separately, sometimes even by a consortium of banks.  The determination would be there then to secure the maximum amount of development on that particular site, so that one ended up with these vast schemes such as the Beacon South Quarter and other places like it.  It was like little pieces of Los Angeles were appearing in south Dublin.  One was left wondering what on earth was going on.</p></speech>

Or was there a belief, as he touched on in his statement, that this was just going to continue, that these people had always turned a profit and would continue always to be lucky?</p></speech>

The warning seen at the end of some advertisements for financial products which says "Markets may go down as well as up" was forgotten during the boom.  Developers forgot it, too.  A massively overpriced asset did not seem massively overpriced to them at the time because they were all caught up in this belief that everything was onwards and upwards.  That was the risk.</p></speech>

In some cases, as I mentioned, more land was being zoned than would be needed for decades.  That is to say, so much land was being zoned that it would take decades to develop it all.  Yet, the plan-making period was supposed to be five years.  Every development plan has a life of five years, so all that should have been zoned was sufficient land to cover that five-year period, perhaps with a possible 20% extra as a landbank in case it was needed.  What was happening, however, was that massive amounts of land were being zoned for development in different parts of the country, particularly in Leinster, because councillors were under pressure from landowners to get their particular parcel zoned for development so they could make the money and go.</p></speech>

There were very substantial allegations made in regard to what was going on in those seven local authorities but the Department of the Environment had no interest in investigating what was really going on.  None of the allegations was effectively examined and a kind of whitewash was thrown over the whole thing.  Do not forget that one of the central recommendations of the planning tribunal was that there should be an independent planning regulator appointed.  That is not going to happen.

The construction industry, in particular, is very well connected, not just with the present Government but also with previous Governments, and very well able to lobby politicians and all the rest of it.  To give an example, there was a case some years ago where the then Government had the option of introducing higher energy performance rating requirements for houses and higher energy performance standards in general.  That initiative was deferred, as a result of which approximately a quarter of a million houses were built during the boom period which have the most woeful energy performance and will all now have to be retrofitted.  The reason that happened, as an FOI request to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government revealed, was that the building regulations were going to have to be changed.  It was going to happen sooner rather than later due to the targets set under the Kyoto Protocol on climate change.  However, the memo went on to say, "We don't want to signal this to the outside world just yet because the next leap in building standard insulation will probably involve making it difficult for the hollow block construction used widely in the Dublin area to survive".  What is that except playing to a vested interest?  So what if there were guys making hollow concrete blocks in Dublin?  They can do something else.  Why was it regarded as being so important that this particular sector be protected?  These guys were building crap houses.</p><p>Let us be clear about that.  These houses were rubbish, from an energy performance point of view, and yet the Department of the environment allowed it to go on and on.  It was only in recent years that we finally caught up with the idea that we needed to have higher energy performance in housing, so that people do not have to spend so much money on fuel and all the rest, and we can cut down emissions.</p></speech>

People were being lent much more money than they could afford to repay which is, by definition, sub-prime.  That is what lay at the heart of the matter.</p> <p>  When we first got the warning signals from the United States, with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and whatever else all basically falling apart as a result of irresponsible lending, in effect the writing was on the wall.  Except that here we were in denial that this was, in effect, what was happening - that money was being lent, on an unlimited basis, for overpriced assets.</p></speech>

Once lands were zoned for development, it became inevitable that services would have to be provided for that land.</p></speech>

In a lot of cases, the checks and balance within the system was that the Department did not provide funding for water and-or water and sewerage.</p></speech>

For example, I was astonished to discover recently that if one wanted to convert a Georgian house in Merrion Square from office use to residential use by, say, putting in five flats or one flat per floor, that one would have to pay a development levy to Dublin City Council of &euro;60,000.  That is when one is doing something that is clearly in the public interest.  It is clearly in the public interest that the Georgian squares of Dublin, on the southside in particular, should be returned to residential use, to the greatest possible extent.  Yet the local authority was screwing the developers who were planning to do so.</p></speech>

If the Department or local authority were dissatisfied with a zoning there was another method in which the funding was not provided.</p></speech>

What more particularly happened was that eventually a Minister for the Environment decided to avail of the powers that he had, to call in a draft local area plan, county plan or whatever for review by the Department and that started happening.  I think it was in 2003 or 2004.  It was the first time that the power was actually used.  If I am not mistaken, I think it was by Dick Roche, then also by his successor, John Gormley, and that was pretty much it.  That was a check and balance, if one likes.</p></speech>

I would defend it on the basis that it makes for a more compact urban environment than we would have otherwise.  If we were to build at the rate of eight to ten houses per acre, which used to be standard in the past, we would have housing everywhere.  There was a strong argument for higher densities.  That does not mean high rise; it just means building to a higher density than we were used to in the past.  It sustains local services.  If one has-----</p></speech>

There is still a belief that people have a right to do whatever they like with their own land.  They ask who these planners are to come and tell them that they cannot.  That is a particularly prevalent and deep-rooted view that exists pretty much right across the country.  That makes it very difficult for planners to point us in a more rational direction.  If there is not a consensus on the need for planning - planning essentially involves making tough decisions about what we are going to do and what we are not going to do - it is an issue.  We are not used to being told we cannot do things.  We do not want to be told we cannot do things; we want to be told we can and that, if one has a half-acre site, of course one will get planning permission to build on it.  That is why we have 500,000 houses all over the countryside in Ireland.</p></speech>

He then moved forward to the Galway tent, where developers socialised with senior Fianna F&aacute;il politicians.

He wrote a series of articles at that time referring to Dublin county.  The headline of one of those articles alludes to "where it is possible to boost the value of parcels of land beyond the dreams of avarice", and another headline reads, "Cash in brown paper bags for councillors".  In that series of articles, Mr. McDonald termed the 72-member Dublin County Council as a rezoning coalition.  What did he mean by that?</p></speech>

I am not saying that Labour was consistently against zoning land.  In fact, there were several cases where they supported in some cases even controversial zonings.  There was a presumption in favour of development in that chamber.  I do not believe that there is any doubt about that and whatever the developers or the landowners wanted to do was, in general, facilitated.</p></speech>

Professional planners were much less enthusiastic about the wilder aspects of development than county managers were.  In counties that had a perception of themselves as having not done terribly well in the past that was their chance to improve their lot, as it were.  In some cases, indeed in many cases, the recommendations of professional planners were overturned by county managers.  In fact, I know of one county manager who said, "Do not be giving me reports recommending refusals."</p></speech>

There was an unwillingness to face up to the maladministration and worse that took place in various counties that were named and were the subject of so-called investigations.

It was normal for property developers to own office buildings or whatever else which would end up being rented to the State.  In the past it was certainly true that connections were used to arrange for State tenants.  In other words, a developer, before embarking on a particular office block, for example, would already have lined up a semi-State company or a branch of the Civil Service to occupy the building, which then made it a complete blue chip or a no fail investment.</p></speech>

If one was working for, say, Dublin City Council and one had grave reservations about what was going on in the council chamber, what could one have done?  Planners and other public servants would have tipped us off about things coming up because they were so appalled by what was going on.  I am delighted they did this.  It is very gratifying to know that there are public servants who are concerned about the public interest and the public interest being subverted to serve private interests and profit.  It was very dispiriting for the planners, in particular in County Dublin but elsewhere also.  They saw rational planning being thrown out the window for the cause of somebody or other who owned a particular parcel of land to make a few bob.</p></speech>

In fact, Dr. Elaine Byrne records that the secretary in the President's office was quite cross about this.  Was it an own goal by Mr. Justice Kenny?  I have never seen a report stating that if one is worried that what is being recommended is unconstitutional, one should ask the President to refer it.  If one is in a favour of something, one leaves it up to the President to decide.</p></speech>

The minority report specifically raised the issue of whether the proposed measure was constitutional.

I think &euro;1.9 million was paid in 1989 because planning permission had been refused.  That meant the officials in the council had to undertake the rezoning which Mr. McDonald strongly and rightly criticised.  I am trying to think of an analogy.  If people apply to get into medical school but do not get in, they do not have a right to compensation from the dean of the medical school.  How did this arise in the property market?</p></speech>

It was built into the 1963 Act.  I think it was in it to vindicate the property rights people had under the Constitution in order that if a local authority refused planning permission for a development, one could sue it for compensation on the basis that it had devalued one's property.  There were several notorious cases where a case would then go to the State property arbitrator and the decision would either be upheld or the amount of money involved would be reduced.  There are several very good examples of where this happened, about which Senator can find out.</p></speech>

There was an incentive for them to grant planning permission because they would get, say, &euro;60,000 or &euro;200,000 in development levies in return.  It became one of their major money-spinners during the boom period.  Many of these levies, as we now know, were not paid, however, because the market had collapsed and the developers had gone to the wall or whatever.</p> <p>  It was not just development levies.  The other factor that played a crucial role in determining whether something was permitted or not was the long-term benefit to the council of the rates revenue that a development could generate.  For example, every shop in the huge complex of Dundrum Town Centre is paying rates to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  The council, not surprisingly, facilitated that scheme even though it contributed to the death of the Main Street in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</p></speech>

Every Friday, there would be a huge supplement with loads of ads for jobs for chief executives and God knows what else.  Every Thursday, one would have the property supplement.  At one stage, <i>The Irish Times</i>property supplement was so large it was in two sections.  There was a 12-page opening section and then a 48-page follow-up section as there was so much going on.  It became a major revenue earner for the media, including <i>The Irish Times</i>.  As I said, whatever about perceptions of this leading to a cheerleader situation for the property boom, we were offsetting any such perception by carrying relatively critical pieces about how Dublin was developing and other issues that were the downsides of the boom.</p></speech>

First-time buyers were panicked into buying at ridiculously inflated asset values like &euro;450,000 for a two-bedroom flat for example.  One of the problems we have in this country - it was certainly the case during the boom - is that we accept far too many things as normal that are not normal.</p></speech>

The purpose of this inquiry is not just to look at the past but to look into the future and see what lessons can be drawn.  With regard to my earlier engagement about how the planning laws deal with one-off housing, it is commonly noted that the Irish people have a love affair with property.  There is a high percentage of home ownership compared to other similar countries.  Was that the case and does it still hold despite the crash?  Given that this is in our DNA, to use the term Mr. McDonald used earlier, how might this be responded to best to protect the public interest in the future?</p></speech>

One of the nicest letters I ever received was from the EBS saying that my loan was paid off.  That happened two years ago and I thought that it could not be happening at a better time.  The devotion to the idea of property ownership is related to the cultural and historical legacy of Ireland, and history of dispossession and fear of dispossession, which is something that makes the rental market such a minority thing.  It is quite normal in Switzerland, Germany and other continental countries for people to rent rather than buy because it is more convenient for them and they do not fear being thrown onto the street.  Here, there is a fear that people have no security if they rent so they need to buy.  As to what can be done about it, we are talking about a cultural shift, which takes time.</p></speech>
