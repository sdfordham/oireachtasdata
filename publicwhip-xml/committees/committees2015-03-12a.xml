Correspondence has been received from the HSE on its appearance before the committee.  It relates to what was reported in the media on the responses to the Comptroller and Auditor General's questions.  I understand the HSE has not finished its work with the Oireachtas and Mr. McCarthy.</p></speech>

The representative of HSBC in London is not available.  The correspondence from HSBC includes the statement that the representative of HSBC London is not available.</p></speech>

Does it mean that the bank cannot make representatives available?  Does it mean that they are not available at this moment?  Will they be available at a further moment?  Would it be more appropriate for somebody from Geneva to attend?  I know that London is the location of its headquarters, but the events took place in Geneva.  It seems to be stating they have no information and that anybody in London who might have it is not available.  I am not sure whether it means that they are not available at this moment to come to us or whether they might be available to come in the future.</p></speech>

There is no information to be had from this representative because they are not aware of the issues involved.  We also asked at the last meeting that a letter be sent to HSBC in the United Kingdom to ask if the individual who had attended the UK public accounts committee meeting would be available to attend our meeting.  That is my understanding.  To refer back to the letter of 9 March, it states that if we have specific issues, we can raise them in writing and that HSBC will consider them.  It also states a representative from London is not available.  That is the background to the matter.</p></speech>

Is it a matter of the representative from London not being available at this time, or is it that it does not intend to make a representative from London available under any circumstances?</p></speech>

As I said, that person attended the UK public accounts committee hearing.  We are now told that it did not happen.  I agree that that is not acceptable.  However, in the light of what Deputies Joe Costello and Shane Ross have said about the person in London not being available, we will have to establish by way of correspondence if they will make themselves available to attend a further hearing.  I cannot address the fact that the letter was not sent.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-12a.35" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/953" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015031200002#B01800"><p>Whatever the response to the letter would be, it is not relevant.  The relevant fact is that we asked for this letter to be written and it has not been written one week later.  Second, I do not understand why we do not have a representative of HSBC in Dublin today.  The letter from HSBC states it thinks it could not assist, but I it might be able to do so.  I received a telephone call from one of the members of staff here and was asked to take the second slot after Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins today, which is fine, in putting questions to the Revenue Commissioners and, as I thought, the HSBC representative.  When I rang the secretariat the day before yesterday, I asked if a representative of HSBC was coming to the meeting and was told "No."  The reason given was that it would not be appropriate for them to come and sit in on the meeting.  I then said I would like the representative to be here and asked the secretariat to request that they attend.  I note that HSBC has not refused to come to the committee; the correspondent just states it does not think it can help us.  I believe it could.  I was assured that the staff would get in touch with the Chairman about whether they were to come.  I do not know what happened after that, but it is my understanding that it was quite clear that they would be coming.  It now appears that they are not.  What happened?  Did the staff get in touch with the Chairman?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-12a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015031200002#B01900"><p>The arrangement made at the last meeting was that we would invite representatives of the Revenue Commissioners to the meeting and we understood HSBC Dublin was agreeable to sending a representative but that the representative would not know the details of the issues to be raised.  I suggested we have the representative of HSBC Dublin attend the meeting in order that at least that person could hear at first hand the concerns of members and the response from the Revenue Commissioners.  To refer again to the letter of 9 March, HSBC stated that, given the fact that it was not aware of some of the issues involved, it would assist where possible but that specific questions would have to be put in writing.  What Deputy Shane Ross is raising is the fact that last week we agreed to do this in a particular way.  Now, due to not extending an invitation to the representative in London, that will not happen today.  When members agree to hold a meeting in a particular way and invite specific individuals to attend, this should be adhered to.  That is the message to the clerk to the committee and the secretariat.</p></speech>

However, on the second matter, I was told the secretariat was going to get in touch with the Chairman.  My understanding was that the Chairman was in favour of somebody coming also.  I do not know what happened, but did it get in touch with the Chairman about inviting the Dublin people?</p></speech>

I spoke to Mr. Hearne yesterday and indicated that, rather than have an individual come from HSBC to attend the meeting in the Visitors Gallery, the person should attend and sit with the representatives of the Revenue Commissioners to hear at first hand what was happening.  That was my view and that is my view of what was decided last Thursday at the meeting.  What happened was that, first, the letter was not sent to London as requested and, second, the request to have a person attend obviously was not acted on.</p></speech>

We have a situation where last week we asked for a letter to be written to invite people to appear before the committee.  Does the Chairman see what is happening?  It was not written on the decision of one of the secretariat.  They decided not to write it for some reason.  Perhaps they are too busy.  I specifically asked, as one of the questioners at the meeting today, that a representative of HSBC Dublin be invited.  That is conveyed to the Chairman for him to either endorse or not endorse it.  The Chairman says they should come and the clerk to the committee does not do it.  The committee is being upstaged by the secretariat.  Whether it likes it, it must invite the people we ask to be invited.</p></speech>

If the appropriate person is based in London, not Dublin, that is the person who should come before us.  What struck me was that the Westminster public accounts committee had HSBC personnel before them recently and I know that they received a considerable dressing down from Margaret Hodge, MP, the Chairman's opposite number in London.  I want that letter to be written.  In addition, it is really important that HSBC send somebody who could usefully address the questions we want to ask.</p></speech>

It also makes it clear that HSBC is prepared to answer specific questions.  It then makes a rather ambiguous statement that a representative from London is not available.  Whether such a representative is not available at this time or whether it is not prepared to make a person available is not clear.  The tenor of the letter we will now send to London should be that we wish to have a representative from London who could actually answer questions and would have the relevant information.</p></speech>

What happened might have been a blessing in disguise, as we now have the Revenue Commissioners before us and will have ample opportunity to bring in representatives of HSBC once we hear what the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has to say.  In all honesty, the volume of work being progressed by the Chairman would keep five or six clerks very busy.</p></speech>

As we have sent a detailed report to the committee in response to questions raised in early February, I will not go into that level of detail.  However, I would like to give an overview of Revenue's offshore investigations, of which the investigation into HSBC's Swiss account holders is part.  I should state my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality, as provided for in section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  </p> <p>  By way of context, it is important to be aware that, prior to receiving the information from the French tax administration, Revenue had identified the use of offshore accounts as a serious tax risk to the Exchequer.  A dedicated branch, the offshore assets group, was set up in 2001 and its main purpose was to uncover and confront the use of offshore accounts by Irish resident individuals.  To date, the offshore assets group has secured in excess of &euro;1 billion for the Exchequer.  From 2002 to 2012, we obtained 20 High Court orders against financial institutions in seeking details of transfers to and from offshore accounts in other jurisdictions.  In 2009 specific orders were directed at transfers to and from Switzerland.  In March 2010, when Revenue became aware that the French tax administration had come into possession of information on accounts held with HSBC Swiss, the then Chairman immediately wrote to it, requesting data related to Irish residents.  The French administration provided us with this information on 23 June 2010.  The data contained information on accounts of individuals and corporates, with more than 98% of the total funds identified as being related to the funds industry.  As set out in our report, the maximum value of assets in accounts of Irish individuals was $29 million, which at the time was equivalent to &euro;22 million.  A detailed breakdown of the cases involved is set out in the report.</p><p>Each individual and corporate listed was examined and 33 Revenue investigations were initiated following analysis of the data.  Four cases were selected for investigation with a view to criminal prosecution and three cases were successfully prosecuted with one still under way.  Of the 33 investigations, 27 have been completed with the remainder ongoing.  Settlements were made in 19 investigations and &euro;4.6 million was recovered, over 60% of which relates to interest and penalties.</p><p> In conclusion, I am satisfied that Revenue fully investigated the data received from the French tax administration.  I can assure the committee that all of the account details provided were risk assessed by the offshore assets group with a view to investigation to recover any tax due together with interest and penalties.  Suitable cases were also prosecuted.</p><p> Revenue has a considerable track record in tackling serious tax evasion.  Since 1998 we have conducted a series of special investigations which yielded in excess of &euro;2.7 billion in tax, interest and penalties.  Our approach to tackling offshore tax evasion has been adopted by the OECD as best practice and has been adopted by other tax authorities.  Practical measures are now under way at OECD and EU level to further improve the exchange of information between tax administrations and thereby limit the opportunity to avail of bank secrecy to facilitate tax evasion.  I will be glad to provide any clarification on the details set out in the report, subject to taxpayer confidentiality. </p></speech>

I congratulate Mr. Cody on his new appointment and wish him well.</p> <p>  As regards the 19 accounts that were investigated, Mr. Cody said 60% of that revenue, of the &euro;4 million that was recovered, was to do with interest and penalties.  Do I take it that the other 40% was due to tax evasion, where money was actually not returned here for taxes - as in profits on which the tax was not paid?</p></speech>

In any settlement, if it is deliberate default or gross carelessness there are tax, interest and penalties.

The information is in the possession of the international consortium of investigative journalists, ICIJ, and of newspapers so I have to be very careful.  What we have set out in our report is that there were 19 settlements.  Nine of them were published in the quarterly defaulters list.  To be published in the quarterly defaulters list, there has to be tax, interest and penalties, and the penalty has to be in excess of 15% of the tax liability.  All those nine cases would have met the criteria for publication, so there would be underlying tax default issues in those nine settlements.</p></speech>

We have set it out on page eight of our report, where we talk about the corporates.  The disk we received from the French tax administration was complicated.  It was an extract of records held by HSBC which fell into the hands of the French tax administration in a convoluted way.  When the French sent us the disk, they sent us a kind of index on how we could interpret the data.  It included two amounts from November 2005 and 2006, and a maximum value in the period of the 18 months or so.  There was $6.2 billion linked to the corporates, and of that, $2.6 billion was linked to funds administered from Ireland and $3.7 billion was linked to administrators based in Ireland, accountants or solicitors, to do with the funds industry.  In excess of 98% and closer to 99% of the total money that was on the disk was related to the global funds industry and had practically no relationship to Ireland or Irish taxpayers.</p></speech>

When we consider a case for investigation with a view to criminal prosecution, it does not mean that if we decide not to follow the prosecution - we actually would investigate all the cases.  It is the difference between investigating with a view to criminal prosecution or investigating with a view to settlement.  The 20 cases were all investigated but at the time of the disk, the head of the offshore assets group would have profiled the cases and then referred them to our prosecutions branch to see if there was likely to be sufficient evidence to support a criminal prosecution.  There are criteria under which we judge whether we have a likelihood of sustaining a criminal prosecution in a given case.  We identified four cases where we thought we had a fair chance of getting evidence and following through on a criminal prosecution.  The other 16 cases would have then been taken for investigation with a view to settlement and some of them had no tax issues at all.</p></speech>

After I was appointed to my position, the following Monday week <i>The Irish Times</i>covered the story and the ICIJ had a fairly high-profile, really interesting story.  I was given responsibility as accounting officer for Revenue at the start of January  and was appointed chairman on 1 February.</p><p>Since my appointment I have carried out a restructuring of responsibilities at senior level within the organisation.  This restructuring included a realignment of responsibility for Revenue's investigation and prosecution division.  When the story broke I asked the newly appointed head of IPD, the investigation and prosecution division, to lead a team to review our handling of the data contained on the HSBC disk and to evaluate the investigation that had been carried out.  This team re-examined the data on the disk to evaluate the investigation and the conduct of the investigation that had been carried out.  This review found that a robust approach had been followed.  I wish to add that I have been in Revenue all my life - at least it seems like all my life - but I was very confident that a rigorous approach had been taken to the data.  This was based on Revenue's track records since 1998 in dealing with special investigations, and in particular, on the records of the offshore assets group and such investigations. The principal officer and his team take their work seriously and the data sources regarding offshore accounts are their bread and butter.  They actively seek out new sources of data regarding offshore accounts as evidenced by the number of High Court orders they have successfully sought over the years.<br/><br/>The principal officer in charge of the unit told me a little story about Swiss accounts.  Back in 2009 when we looked for High Court orders directing Irish financial institutions to provide details of transfers to and from Swiss bank accounts, he prepared an affidavit in which he actually incorporated an advertisement that was placed by a Swiss bank in <i>The Irish</i><i>Times</i>, in the midst of our pursuit of offshore accounts.  This was an expensive advertisement in which the bank was saying, more or less, &quot;Do you want to lodge your money offshore with us?&quot;.  The bank's advertisement did not mention tax evasion nor any kind of hint that there was anything untoward about it but emphasised the bank's secrecy in Switzerland.  While we were in the midst of pursuing accounts in the Isle of Man and Jersey, one of the Swiss banks - not HSBC - were advertising in one of our newspapers the advantages of bank secrecy in Switzerland.  We included that advertisement in our affidavit for the High Court order which we were granted.  <br/><br/>When the story broke that the French tax administration had got access to this data, my predecessor immediately wrote to it.  We reported on this in our 2010 annual report and in the 2012 meeting of the PAC, the then Chairman had a short discussion about the HSBC disk with the members.  I think it was Deputy Murphy at the time.  We are very anxious to get these stories of our activities out there because this is what helps voluntary compliance.  Knowing the principal officer and the team in charge of these offshore assets I know that they take their work seriously.  Last week, the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>had an article which stated that a person getting a letter from the Revenue, will look at the top of the envelope to see if it has come from a tax district or if it is the case that it has come from the investigations and prosecution division, that person will get professional and legal advice.  That is the first step that one of the practitioners was recommending a person should do.  The people who are dealing with this are serious about what they do, they are good at what they do and I was fairly confident that they would have followed it through to the end.  I am satisfied but that is not to say that there are not cases currently involved in tax evasion using offshore accounts.  I refer to the work that is happening at OECD level, with the IRS in the US and the Foreign Account Tax Compliant Act, FATCA, and bank secrecy.  Bank secrecy hinders our work.  We are an early adopter of FATCA.  We are very proactive at OECD and EU level in regard to automatic exchange of information.  The work of our offshore assets unit has been the model for most other countries.  We are early movers in this area and countries have followed us. <br/><br/>In preparing for today's meeting I have been reading PAC reports going back over the time of three chairmen of the Revenue Commissioners.  The previous three chairmen have attended this committee and have spoken about our special investigations-----</p></speech>

It seems to me that what he has done since 2010 has been a reasonably good effort at recovering what has been revealed to the Revenue.  Was Mr. Cody aware of any of this before 2010?  I note that in 2009 he made an effort to get court orders about money in Swiss banks.  How aware was he of this problem pre the release from the French authorities of this information?</p></speech>

We started following offshore money really since the DIRT inquiry which revealed the bogus non-residence accounts.  The bogus non-residence process showed offshore bank accounts that were really not offshore at all and that led into a whole raft of investigations.  We set out in the appendix to the report the various different investigations, some of which were onshore and some of which were offshore.  The other issue is the EU savings directive.  We have been actively involved in discussions at EU level which have been in train since the 1990s.  Some member states have been more reluctant to sign up to the savings directive.  During our Presidency we were on the point of getting the savings directive finalised with the final two member states.  The EU Commission on behalf of the Council has been negotiating agreements with Switzerland, Lichtenstein and Andorra.</p></speech>

The cases I am more comfortable discussing are the three cases which were prosecuted.  The criminal prosecutions are a matter of public record.

We regularly receive legal advice on criminal prosecutions and tax.  It is part of our core business.  Approximately 215 cases are going through a process of consideration for prosecution at present.  We are active in this area. The summary of the legal advice is that theoretically it may be possible but practically it would be almost impossible.  Prior to coming here I was thinking about what legislation would be used to prosecute.  The legislation speaks about aiding and abetting tax evasion.  I have a note on the relevant section somewhere.  This would not come under aiding and abetting.  It is very difficult to deal with the operation of a secret bank account in a country where bank secrecy is a norm and the legal standard aided a taxpayer filling out a false tax return.</p><p>The primary offence is the taxpayer's.  The secondary is aiding and abetting.  One has to have the bank with the bank's fingerprints in relation to the tax evasion, and then one has to get evidence to corroborate that.</p><p> I have been reading the Argentinian details.  The members of the committee know this, as well as I do.  HSBC were in front of the PAC in London on Monday.  Apparently the Argentinian authorities were there.  Reading the coverage of the Argentinian matter, they seem to be very concerned about the flow of money from HSBC Argentina to HSBC Switzerland.  They are talking about repatriating the funds.  It is a very different thing from tax evasion.</p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners do not seem to like prosecuting people very much and their record of prosecuting on these issues is sparse to say the least.  As Mr. Cody knows, nobody was prosecuted under Ansbacher.  We have been through that before with the Revenue Commissioners.  On bogus non-resident accounts, I do not know if any action was ever taken against any institutions.  It appears that the small man got it in the neck.  On HSBC, there is a very small number - I think we are talking about four prosecutions.  Is the Revenue Commissioners' legal advice that it is harder to do it in this country than, for example, in the UK?</p></speech>

On the HSBC data, we actually have probably the best record for following through on these particular data because we were ahead of them and also under our disclosure regime, anybody who had a Swiss account before 2002 could not avail of a voluntary disclosure.  In the UK system, they can still avail of a voluntary disclosure.</p></speech>

However, all of them had been dissolved before 2005 and a lot of them had been dissolved in the 1990s.  We profiled them all and we looked for links to Irish individuals - directors.  The reality is that most of them were Irish-registered non-resident.  We are familiar with what was in place up until the 1990s.  There was a facility where one could be Irish-registered and non-resident with no link to the country.</p> <p>  I actually discussed this with the principal officer who leads the offshore assets group.  He looked for a link to Ireland in these dissolved companies.  When he could not find them, he would have had to go to the High Court to get the company reinstated, but he would not have anybody to deal with.  As he said to me, he could have written to somebody in Kazakhstan to see if he could get it, but it would have been a complete waste of our scarce resources in tackling this.</p> <p>  The amount of money in relation to that was actually quite small.  However, to the extent that there are nuggets or gems that are linked to tax evasion in those corporate areas, since 2010 when we got this disk, we have some new technology which my predecessor talked about - technology that we have to link entities.  I have asked the investigation and prosecution team to put all these corporates back into our social network analysis tool and to see if we can get linkages because if there are linkages to tax evasion that we can trace here, the normal four-year limit does not apply and we will still look at. </p></speech>

Some of them have holiday homes in Ireland.  Some of them had a correspondence address in Ireland.  A lot of these accounts had multiple addresses.  What the French administration did was that if there was an Irish address linked to an account - there could have been two other addresses, a UK address or a Switzerland address - they gave us all the information which had a link.  There were clearly non-resident people with no real Irish connection.

From a tax perspective, it is constructed in a way to minimise any opportunity for tax evasion.  We are quite satisfied that it is a legitimate part of the Irish system.  We monitor the low number of Irish investors in the funds industry.  While it is in the funds industry, it does not attract tax, which happens when it is taken out of it and there are special rules in relation to that.  There are 13,000 jobs involved in the funds sector.  It is legally constructed - the tax system - to minimise the exposure to opportunities for tax evasion.</p></speech>

There was a system in place where there were Irish registered companies.  The legislation was changed in the Finance Act 1999 to provide that if a company was Irish registered after that year, even where it had no connection to Ireland, it would become tax resident here.  The system was closed down because there were reputational risks and suggestions that some of these entities were linked to criminality although not in Ireland.  The system was closed down and the companies were dissolved.  A significant number of Irish registered companies did not file with the Companies Registration Office, which carried out a major clean up around the turn of 1999 to 2000.  That removed tens of thousands of cases.  We are talking here about 139.</p></speech>

It was to ensure that the Irish flag could not be linked to a corporate entity that had no physical presence here.  One of the things to mention about the corporates is that 270 are linked to this disc, 185 of which had no entries on either of the three dates that we are talking about.  They had no balance in December 2005, no balance in December 2006 and no maximum value over that whole period of 2005 to 2006.  They were dormant accounts.  The disc was in essence an extract of the bank's customer service record and as such was a whole pile of data.  If the bank had an entity at some stage, the record was still there.  It was not as if the dormant ones were cancelled off the customer record.  Some of the cases were dissolved 20 years before the disc came into our possession.</p></speech>

It is clear that this possession came from a former employee of HSBC Switzerland.  It is in the public domain that HSBC complained to the Swiss authorities, who sought to have the person extradited, I presume that is the term, from France and Switzerland.  Instead, the French authorities decided it was a really interesting disc and gave it to the tax administration to follow up because obviously, the data included a significant number of French taxpayers who were account holders.</p></speech>

While it seems to be existing offshore accounts here, in Argentina they were looking for repatriation of money that came directly from the HSBC branches in Argentina.  This committee has been in communication with HSBC here in Dublin and it has indicated it is unable to help the committee.  Is the Chairman of the view that none of the funds would have come through the local branch here in Ireland?</p></speech>

If one looks at the coverage, some of the HSBC explanation and rationale is that the bank took over a Swiss private bank in the late 1990s and HSBC see it as a different type of entity with a different culture.  I am not here to defend HSBC London but its view is that the bank took over a Swiss private bank and claims that the standards that obtained in Switzerland were not the standards the bank upholds.</p> <p>  From a tax administration point of view, what is really interesting is that the focus on the facilitation of bank secrecy, in terms of the story and the coverage of it, has helped improve transparency.  The Swiss authorities have signed up for the OECD common reporting standard, CRS, which is the next generation of exchange information about bank secrecy.  Were Revenue to appear before this committee ten years ago and were members to ask Frank Daly, as it was at the time, whether he expected the Swiss would sign up to exchange information about bank secrecy, he would have said this would be a really big challenge.  We now are looking at that opportunity.  This raises something about which my board colleagues and I must think, namely, when the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, FATCA, agreement dealing with exchange of information between the US Internal Revenue Service, IRS, and Revenue comes into place, followed by CRS with effect from 2017, to which more than 90 countries have signed up for the automatic exchange of banking information.  There are people who unquestionably have money offshore that involves tax evasion and that is an absolute fact.  Consequently, we must consider how we can leverage international developments to ensure that we get our money.  If there are people who opened bank accounts offshore since 2002, my advice to them is they should be making voluntary disclosures before we find out further about it.</p></speech>

Having watched HSBC representatives being cross-examined by the United Kingdom's Public Accounts Committee and Treasury Committee, the bank has appeared twice already and I imagine the committees are not finished with it, I do not know whether they would add particularly much if they talked about what happened in respect of Irish individuals.

One interesting thing about some of the coverage of what happened in respect of United Kingdom clients is that the Swiss entity was far more proactive, in that its representatives visited high-wealth individuals who had money in London.  They visited them in London in respect of savings directive issues.  The reality is the type of money that was involved in the Irish cases was not massive and I doubt it was hugely on the radar of HSBC Private Bank (Suisse).</p></speech>

Clearly, HSBC Geneva was a small player in that respect.  How can a bank of that nature still secure a licence to operate if Revenue already has prosecuted some people in respect of tax evasion and it is quite clear that the secrecy surrounding the operation was to facilitate tax evasion?</p></speech>

Bank secrecy is the central part of the whole banking area and there is nothing wrong with bank secrecy itself.  It is like taxpayer confidentiality.  If one had one's money lodged in an account in Ireland, that would be kept confidential.  In itself, confidentiality is a cornerstone of the banking system.  The issue here is that at the time about which we are talking, tax evasion was not a criminal offence in Switzerland.</p></speech>

I appreciate that Mr. Cody may feel he is unable to answer some of the questions I wish to ask and I will understand if that is the case.  If a person is a tax defaulter or if he or she has evaded tax, does the Revenue continually monitor his or her behaviour in order to ensure he or she is tax compliant?</p></speech>

We have quite sophisticated technology at our disposal and we have access to a huge level of third-party data sources.  My predecessors also referred to our REAP system when they came before the committee.  We continually risk-rate our cases and one of the clear indicators of risk is previous behaviour.  Built into our risk-analysis system are the results of previous investigations and audits and details of prior non-compliance.  It is one of the factors - it is not the only one - and we would continually monitor the same cases.  Obviously, there are individuals who have engaged in tax evasion and whose activities we have not yet uncovered.  Constant risk analysis and risk assessment in respect of our entire case database are key to our overall compliance programme.  Previous behaviour is one of the factors involved.</p> <p>  We also have a dedicated re-audit programme.  When I used to perform audits in the 1980s and 1990s, one of the issues about which we were always concerned was that once we secured an audit yield in respect of a case and once our work was done, the business involved immediately tried to recover that yield.  As a result, built into our system is a programme of constant monitoring and re-auditing.  Unfortunately, the re-auditing function shows that, on occasion, those who previously engaged in tax evasion and who made settlements reoffend.  In the context of our code of practice, the penalties we imposed are stepped up in respect of those who are discovered to have deliberately defaulted on a second occasion.  In other words, the consequences are more serious.</p></speech>

I presume transfers of this nature would be a possible indicator of someone trying to evade tax.  Does the Revenue have the ability to follow the money in order to determine what is happening or is the level of secrecy within the banks such that it cannot do so?</p></speech>

This brings me back to anti-money laundering procedures and the necessity for banks to know their customers.  Irish banks, other financial institutions and professionals are legally obliged to make reports in respect of what they perceive to be suspicious transactions.  If someone comes in with a bundle of cash and if he or she does not fit into the profile, then the bank, other financial institution or professional involved is obliged to inform us and the Garda.  We receive thousands of reports from financial institutions.</p></speech>

Tax evasion is not always the primary motivator and some of it just relates to criminality.  There is an obligation on financial institutions to report any suspicions they may harbour.  If we receive a suspicious transaction report, we are tightly constrained in terms of what we can do.  We cannot inform anyone that we received such a report but we can use it in our risk analysis in order to determine whether there is a possibility of tax evasion.</p></speech>

Mr. Cody has already answered my next question to some extent.  Will he indicate, however, whether there is a case in favour of the EU putting in place huge trade embargos in respect of tax havens such as Switzerland, the Cayman Islands, the Isle of Man and so forth?</p><p>In regard to some of the tax havens, whether Switzerland, the Cayman Islands or the Isle of Man, is there a need for that sort pressure to be applied to those places?</p></speech>

The directive has evolved and developed.  During our Presidency, two member states had a difficulty with automatic exchange of information under the directive.  Their problems were primarily linked to the fact that their neighbours were exempt from it.  These problems have now been solved and Europe is agreeing an arrangement with Switzerland, Lichtenstein, Andorra and San Marino to increase the exchange of information.  The game changer is the common reporting standard, which is driven at OECD level.  The Swiss have signed up to that and it is now coming.  This is a major development in terms of shining the light on transparency and the flow of money.</p></speech>

The Minister for Finance set out a roadmap for Ireland's international tax strategy in his budget statement.  We are full participants in the BEPS project.  The Revenue Commissioners has a team actively working on BEPS issues, which can only be solved by revising the rules.  The reality is that in a globally trading environment there will always be mismatches, and the system will just keep evolving.</p></speech>

He stated that between 2002 and 2012 the Revenue Commissioners obtained 20 High Court orders against financial institutions.  Did these orders lead to any prosecutions?</p></speech>

In 2004 we offered a settlement opportunity for offshore accounts.  People were given an opportunity to put their hands up and do a deal.  Approximately half of the &euro;1 billion that the offshore assets group secured came from that process.  The High Court orders gave us targets we could follow up.  Some of them were investigated with a view to prosecution, but I do not have figures on them.</p></speech>

We operate in a global environment, however.  Many people who hold bank accounts offshore are also doing business offshore.  They may be paying suppliers offshore.  The international banking system is part of the lifeblood of the economy.</p></speech>

Last Tuesday we published our tax defaulters list, and two settlements on the list were linked to offshore assets.  There is ongoing work, although it is not on the same scale as previously.  In the mid to late 2000s, a significant proportion of our compliance resource across the country was tied up in special investigations.  The investigations were not all handled by the investigations and prosecutions team.  In recent years, the investigations and prosecutions division, IPD, has handled the special investigations.

One of the very interesting aspects of the current HSBC development is that HSBC has said its systems were lax.

There is a framework, which is legalistic, as international tax agreements tend to be.  The Indian authorities recently raised a query about accounts in Ireland in which they were particularly interested as part of an investigation.  Similarly, we ask our partner countries for details.  There is a regime in place, signed off by a commissioner, and an authorised officer to ask the bank for details of accounts, bank statements and transactions.  This is an ongoing part of the normal tax administration and co-operation across frontiers by tax authorities.</p></speech>

I know the job Mr. Cody and the Revenue Commissioners did and we know what was collected in taxes, penalties and interest, but the point remains that HSBC took over the bank and that, without the whistleblower, none of the money would have been collected.  HSBC, having taken over the bank, was aware not only of the culture, as it has admitted, but also of the laws of confidentiality it could hide behind.  What does Mr. Cody think of HSBC's statement that it is ambitious for business or looking to harness its global capabilities to seek companies' growth and explore the possibilities  HSBC Ireland can offer?  Is that one of the well crafted statements that helps it to dodge what is really going on?</p></speech>

Somewhere on the globe there is a bank and funding ended up in these Swiss accounts.  The bank which claims to be above reproach in this regard - perhaps it is - now apologises for a culture as if it has only discovered it.  I find this amazing.  This is not to do with the work of the Revenue Commissioners.  </p> <p>  This emphasises the need to have a representative of HSBC here.  It shows total disrespect to customers in this country and the 450 employees that HSBC representatives have not turned up here and, at least, issued a statement.  I refer to what happened in the earlier part of the meeting when it was mentioned that we had decided to write to HSBC and that it had responded by suggesting it had no information to offer because it was part of the London branch.  A representative of HSBC London is not available, but I do not know, as Deputy Joe Costello mentioned, whether this means a representative is not available permanently or not available right now.  HSBC is headquartered in London.  To go back to an earlier decision of the committee, we should act on it and write directly to HSBC headquarters to request the attendance at the committee of the individuals who attended the committee hearing in the United Kingdom.  If for nothing else, the bank should do this out of respect for its customers in this country.  This must be done and the request must be made to them.  The invitation must be issued immediately to complete the circle.</p><p>I say that by way of comment following our earlier conversation, but I think it is clear from the very constructive exchange we had this morning.  It gives us a deeper understanding of Revenue and it adds to our information.  HSBC could have shared in all of this this morning and could have availed of the opportunity to do something positive in terms of its connection here in Ireland which is not by any means a small entity, given that it employs 450 people.  I read in another part of its website that it is servicing $105 billion worth of assets under its management.  Those are not small figures so far as this country is concerned.  It is important that we act upon the invitation and insist that it comes before the committee.  So far as what Mr. Cody has done to enlighten us in terms of the report, we appreciate it.  We may look at the hearings in the UK and take some notes from what happened there, but I think HSBC has a case to answer in terms of its work in Ireland and what it did in Switzerland.  It is up to this Committee of Public Accounts, now that this matter is before us, to ensure we conclude in a way that satisfies the taxpayer and the tax collector in this case.</p><p> With that I thank Mr. Niall Cody and Mr. Liam Gallagher for coming-----</p></speech>

I congratulate Mr. Niall Cody on his appointment and wish him well.  In regard to the Chairman's point about inviting HSBC to appear before the committee, that is the right thing to do in regard to its obligation to the State and the fact that it is a big employer in this country and manages a huge portfolio of finances.  Following Mr. Niall Cody's appointment, it appears he has carried out a very thorough investigation of this case.  The Swiss banking culture would be recognised as a tax haven for facilitating private accounts from all over the world.  Given that this five-year disk was brought into the public domain by a whistleblower, has there been an indication of any other disk since then?</p></speech>

We pay close attention to what is happening.  We have very good relations with our fellow Revenue authorities and we are always open to information coming to our attention.

Given the technology in place, the fact that the disk is from 2010, the convergence of banking in 2018 and the offshore facilitation by HSBC bank, in Mr. Cody's opinion did any information from the IFSC or any other banking fraternity units within the State indicate - while people cannot move their money offshore - that there could be any facilitation by the whole banking industry here of Swiss accounts?</p></speech>

The type of tax evasion that we are talking about is where taxpayers or businesses manage to siphon money out of their business and keep it off the radar.  We put it in our report that there is something like &euro;3.3 trillion linked to the Irish funds industry either in Irish managed funds or administered funds.  It is a key core part of what used to be called the IFSC.  It is a legitimate business and is a core part of our strategy.  We have no evidence whatsoever that there is tax evasion or avoidance in that particular category.</p></speech>

Mr. Cody and his partners co-operate together on these issues.  Is there a separate case where collectively they look at whether a case should be taken against a bank in terms of breaking the law for one reason or another?  Do Mr. Cody and his partners look at that as well?  Mr. Cody may not be able to do it on his own but collectively with the other tax authorities they may be able to say they have information from which it appears that a law has been broken.  Would they pursue this together in that event?  Does that type of conversation take place?  Is the relationship just on the basis of pursuing tax and the individuals?</p></speech>

In our sessions today we will focus on the theme of relationships between State authorities, political parties, elected representatives, supervisory authorities, banking institutions and the property sector.  Later this morning we will hear from the former <i>The Irish Times</i>journalist Mr. Frank McDonald, but in our first session we will hear from Dr. Elaine Byrne, a consultant for the European Commission on corruption and governance.  She is also a journalist with <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>.  During her career she has worked as a governance consultant for the United Nations, the World Bank and Transparency International.  She has also held academic appointments at Trinity College Dublin and the University of New South Wales.  She has published widely on Irish politics and is the author of <i>Political Corruption in Ireland</i>, <i>1922</i>-<i>2010</i>: <i>A Crooked Harp</i>.  She was nominated for three national media awards for investigative journalism for her work on allegations of political impropriety.  She is very welcome.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  As informed previously, the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Dr. Byrne to make her opening statment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-12a.374" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Elaine Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015031200002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation.  It is strange being on the other side of the fence, having reported on you.  In the invitation to appear before the joint committee I was asked to address four areas, namely, a narrative on how the property and banking sectors had interacted with government, elected representatives and the State during the period prior to the banking crisis in Ireland; a narrative on the nature of the relationship between the property sector, banking, government, elected representatives and the State; a narrative on what, if any, controls or structures were in place to regulate any such relationship; and whether being a small country was a factor in terms of any such relationship.  What follows is as a consequence of the extensive research I have done on foot of my book, my work as a consultant and a journalist and a presentation of facts.  I will begin to answer these four very broad questions by first looking at the historical context and the culture of deference which I argue was firmly established before the boom.  I will address these issues, primarily by focusing on political donations.<br/><br/>At the heart of the four corruption tribunals in Ireland in the past three decades - the beef tribunal, also known as the Hamilton inquiry; the McCracken tribunal; the Moriarty tribunal and the Mahon tribunal - were serious concerns about how political action was funded.  These tribunals, in particular the McCracken and Moriarty tribunals, exposed a deferential culture by regulatory authorities towards the banking sector during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.  They also identified a deferential culture by banks towards politics and <i>vice versa</i>.  An absence of political will to enforce regulatory compliance was a recurring theme within the tribunals.</p><p>I will give two very brief examples of this.  Central Bank inspectors examined the Guinness and Mahon bank loan book in 1976 and 1978.  The inspectors expressed concern that &quot;Guinness &amp;amp; Mahon was facilitating a tax avoidance scheme [which] was tantamount to facilitating tax evasion&quot;.  The Central Bank inspectors discovered that one of its own directors had a loan of &pound;416,000 which was secured by a &pound;230,00 offshore deposit in the Cayman Islands.  The response by the Central Bank was to trust a promise made by the then Guinness and Mahon chief executive who promised that the bank would wind down its loan business to Irish residents which was backed by offshore deposits.  This promise was not kept.<br/><br/>Twenty years later, the McCracken tribunal discovered the consequence of this deference.  Ansbacher was the largest incidence of tax evasion in the history of the State.  Revenue subsequently yielded over &euro;112 million in unpaid taxes and penalties from 200 Ansbacher accounts.  This tax evasion was enabled by non-action by the Central Bank, Revenue Commissioners, company law regulators and prosecuting authorities.  For instance, although the Finance Act 1986 empowered Revenue to inspect non-residence declarations held by financial institutions, it did not do so.  <br/><br/>The second example of deference I will give is that of Charles J. Haughey's indebtedness to Allied Irish Bank which spiralled from &pound;188,000 to &pound;1.1. million in a four year period between 1975 and 1979.  The Moriarty tribunal noted that AIB &quot;exhibited a marked deference in its attitude&quot; towards the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il.  On his election as Taoiseach in December 1979, Mr. Haughey's personal overdraft was 77 times his &pound;14,717 gross annual salary.  Mr. Haughey's financial adviser, who also happened to be the <i>de facto</i>chief executive of Guinness and Mahon bank, negotiated a &pound;393,000 write-down of the Taoiseach's debts.  The tribunal described this &quot;somewhat unorthodox&quot; bank discount which amounted to one third of Mr. Haughey's overall arrears, as conferring &quot;a substantial benefit on Mr. Haughey in circumstances referrable to his political office and as an indirect payment&quot;.  Moreover, the Moriarty tribunal established that Mr. Haughey received at least &pound;9.1 million in donations between 1979 and 1996.  The McCracken and Moriarty tribunals revealed a distinctive overlap between prominent financial donors of Mr. Haughey and individuals within the banking and property sectors.  The journalist Colm Keena, in particular, has written and investigated a lot of this overlap.<br/><br/>The purpose of these two brief lessons from the tribunals is to illustrate that a culture of deference between State authorities, political parties, elected representatives, supervisory authorities, banking institutions and the property sector, was already well established by the 1990s.  This culture of deference operated in a context where political parties and individual politicians were particularly financially vulnerable.<br/><br/>The committee asked me to explain the narrative of the relationship between these different entities and I will do so by first looking at disclosed political donations to political individuals and political parties in the three elections of 1997, 2002 and 2007.  What follows is a short explanation of legislation on political funding as a means of describing the nature of the relationship between politics and the property and banking sectors.  The purpose of this is to demonstrate that it is impossible to present a complete picture of how political parties financed their 1997, 2002 and 2007 election campaigns.  Not all donations were legally required to be disclosed.  None the less, the disclosed donations infer a pattern as illustrated in the three graphs in the appendix to this submission.<br/><br/>The Electoral Act 1997 was enacted in response to controversy arising from unorthodox political donations which came to public attention during the course of the beef tribunal.  It emerged that some political individuals and political parties were reliant on donations from the beef industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  This relationship between the beef industry and politics created the public perception that a <i>quid pro quo</i>existed, in other words, that political donations facilitated policy decisions which benefited the beef sector.  <br/><br/>The 1997 Act established new rules for the disclosure of political donations.  For the first time in the history of the Irish State, political donations over a certain limit were required to be disclosed.  The threshold for disclosure of donations to political individuals, including candidates in D&aacute;il, Seanad, European and presidential elections, was &euro;634.87.  The threshold for disclosure of donations to political parties was &euro;5,078.95.  There was no limit as to how much could be donated.  <br/><br/>The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, maintained the disclosure limits under the 1997 Act but introduced a limit as to how much could be donated.  The threshold for disclosure of donations to political individuals remained at &euro;634, however, donations by the same donor must not exceed &euro;2,539 in any given year.  The threshold for disclosure of donations to political parties remained at &euro;5,078.  However, donations by the same donor must not now exceed &euro;6,349 in any given year.  Also of significance was the banning of foreign donations in circumstances where the donor was not an Irish citizen.<br/><br/>The Electoral Act 1997 and the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, required that political individuals, including candidates, and political parties must submit an annual statement of donations and election expenditure to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  I compiled information from the archives of the Standards in Public Office Commission for a ten-year period in order to construct the graphs in the appendix relating to political party funding.  Where I was unsure about particular figures I took the conservative approach and when in doubt I did not include them.  <br/><br/>I will now deal with disclosed donations to political individuals.  Figure No. 1 in the appendix represents all disclosed donations to political individuals between 1997 and 2009.  The period includes the 1997, 2002 and 2007 general elections.  In doing so it must be clearly acknowledged that this figure represents disclosed donations as opposed to undisclosed donations, donations under the &euro;634 threshold.  There are a number of observations that can be extrapolated from this data.<br/><br/>First, disclosed donations to political individuals significantly increased in election years.  That is not rocket science.  Second, Fianna F&aacute;il representatives attracted almost twice as many disclosed donations as all the other parties combined during the 2002 and 2007 general elections.  That Fianna F&aacute;il candidates were the beneficiaries of more disclosed donations than candidates from other parties is not surprising because proportionate to other parties, Fianna F&aacute;il traditionally runs more candidates.  For instance, of the 466 candidates who ran in the 2002 election, 22% were from Fianna F&aacute;il.  None the less, during that election year, Fianna F&aacute;il received two thirds of all funding disclosed which means that candidates from that party were in receipt of seven times more disclosed donations than a non-Fianna F&aacute;il candidate.  Third, it is not possible to break down the sources of disclosed donations as is the case for party donations because the donations tend to be from individuals without reference to business addresses.  I can deal with this in more detail later if the committee wishes.<br/><br/>Political individuals attracted significantly more disclosed political donations than political parties, notwithstanding the 2001 amended rules which introduced a higher donation limit to political parties of just over &euro;6,000, compared to donations to political individuals at just over &euro;2,500.  Disclosed donations to political individuals in 2007 amounted to &euro;855, 995.  Excluding subscriptions from the salaries of elected representatives to their parties, disclosed donations to political parties in 2007 amounted to just &euro;43,693.  It appears that it is more attractive to donate to political representatives than to political parties.<br/><br/>I will now look at disclosed donations to political parties.  Figure No. 2 in the appendix represents all disclosed donations to political parties between 1997 and 2009.  A number of observations can be extrapolated from this data.  Since the introduction of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, which introduced a limit on the value of donations to be disclosed, a pattern emerged whereby all political parties disclosed under the limit.</p><p>For example, the disclosed donations by all political parties in 2001 amounted to &euro;753,523, the year before the 2002 election.  In contrast, the disclosed donations by all political parties in 2006 amounted to &euro;17,000, the year before the 2007 election.  These figures exclude politicians donating to themselves or their own political parties.  There appears to be a deliberate policy by political parties of soliciting donations below the disclosure thresholds.  This is perhaps due to the relatively small difference in the maximum donation that can be accepted by a political party, &euro;6,349, and the amount that must be disclosed, &euro;5,078.  The Fine Gael Party returned a nil disclosure to the Standards in Public Office Commission from 2001 to 2009 and, in fact, made its first disclosure last year.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party, the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party disclosed zero returns in disclosed donations for 2009, the year all three political parties ran substantial local and European by-election campaigns and a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon.<br/><br/>It is impossible to present a complete picture of how political parties were financed in this period.  Of the &euro;10.1 million spent by political parties and candidates in the 2007 general election which was disclosed to the Standards in Public Office Commission, just &euro;1.3 million of the donations was disclosed, with no information available on the origins of the remaining &euro;8.8 million.  That gap allows an unnecessary perception that something unorthodox is happening with political funding, but much of it can be explained by membership fees, annual draws and so forth.  The &euro;10.1 million figure does not encompass all of what was spent during the 2007 election.  The legislation only requires election expenditure in the period between the dissolution of the D&aacute;il and polling day, usually a period of three to five weeks, to be accounted for.  Electioneering prior to this period is not accounted for.  Election campaigning in the 2007 election, for instance, was well under way before May 2007.  The pre-election statement of intent between Fine Gael and the Labour Party, known as the &quot;Mullingar Accord&quot;, was inaugurated in 2004 and accompanied by a billboard campaign.  <br/><br/>I will now look at disclosed donations to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party by sector.  Figure 3 in the appendix represents all disclosed donations to Fianna F&aacute;il, excluding the donations to political representatives or individuals between 1997 and 2007.  They amounted to &euro;1.8 million; 80% of this figure was donated between 1997 and the change of the rules in 2001.  Subsequent to the 2001 Act, the maximum donation a party could receive was limited to &euro;6,349.  As outlined, this is an incomplete picture of how the Fianna F&aacute;il Party was funded because there are no statutory obligations to disclose donations below the legal threshold of &euro;5,078.  Nonetheless the figures do infer trends regarding sources of political donations.  The figures are as follows: some 35%, or &euro;635,970, of Fianna F&aacute;il's disclosed donations were from property and construction interests.  Fianna F&aacute;il received substantial donations in 1998 for the particular and stated purpose of campaigning in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement referendum.  When these are excluded, disclosed donations from property and construction interests amounted to 39%, or &euro;545,818.  A list of property companies and developers who donated to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party can be accessed on the Standards Commission's website.  All of them are on the public record.  Some 20% of the disclosed donations to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in that period came from business interests and amounted to &euro;367,000; 13% came from individuals, amounting to just over &euro;245,000; 9% came from the hotels and catering sector and amounted to just &euro;160,000; 7% came from the motor sector and amounted to just over &euro;122,000; just over 7% came from the food and drinks sector and amounted to just over &euro;126,000, while 5%, or about, &euro;90,000 came from banks and financial services.  This figure does not include, however, donations by individuals who were donating in a personal capacity but who were associated with the banking sector.  Some 4% or just over  &euro;70,000 were from professional services such as solicitors' firms and auctioneers.  Also in that period 34% or almost &euro;89,000 of the disclosed donations of the Progressive Democrats jof &euro;262,000 came from the property sector.<br/><br/>It appears that the property barons of the 1990s and 2000s had replaced the beef barons of the 1980s.  The Opposition did not disclose donations from property interests.  The Fine Gael Party disclosed a sum of &euro;197,914 in donations between 1997 and 2000 from a variety of businesses and individuals - 11 donations in all - but it did not disclose donations above the legal threshold from 2001 to 2009.  Almost two thirds of the Labour Party's &euro;392,000 in disclosed donations came from the trade union movement.  Sinn F&eacute;in was in receipt of almost &euro;1.3 million in disclosed donations in this period, much of it from the salaries of elected representatives, North and South, and organisation such as Friends of Sinn F&eacute;in, Australia and Friends of Sinn F&eacute;in, America.  I can give a breakdown of all the figures for all of the parties, if needed.  <br/><br/>The committee also asked me to look at controls and structures to regulate such relationships.  I will look at them by considering policy.  Irish legislation was criticised by the Council of Europe Group of States against Corruption, GRECO, in 2009 for failing to account for &quot;behaviour of those persons who are close to power and who try to obtain advantages from their situation by influencing the decision-maker&quot;.  Reliance on political donations from a particular sector may facilitate a perception of undue influence by donors over policy-making.  This undue but not illegal influence of vested interests over regulation and policy-making arises where elites have access to insider information which they utilise for their private benefit.  This informal misuse of power occurs where personal relationships, patronage, lobbying, political favours and political donations unduly influence the decision-making process, even if no laws are broken.<br/><br/>Did donors from the property sector have a vested interest in the formulation of policy?  Was the decision-making capacity of political parties eroded by a conflict of interest?  Were key political decisions insulated from critical debate because they were executed within a closed and cartelised system that facilitated regulatory capture?  What did the Honohan, Regling and Watson, Nyberg and Wright reports have to say about policy in this regard?  They offered limited analysis of the policy-making process outside he financial sector.  The Honohan report dedicated just six paragraphs to tax incentives aimed at the construction sector.  The Regling and Watson report briefly described the problem of policy analysis, design and implementation as &quot;unusually severe&quot;, pointing, in particular, to weaknesses in tax policy.  The Nyberg report had five paragraphs on what it termed &quot;advice on economic policy&quot;.  The Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, found that &quot;significant factors contributing to the unsustainable structure of spending in the Irish economy were due to the Government's procyclical fiscal policy stance, budgetary measures aimed at boosting the construction sector, and a relaxed approach to the growing reliance on construction-related and other insecure sources of tax revenue&quot;.  According to the Honohan report, tax reliefs incentive schemes and income tax exemptions for developers and investors included:<blockquote>multi-storey car parks, student accommodation, buildings used for third-level educational purposes, hotels and holiday camps, holiday cottages, rural and urban renewal, park-and-ride facilities, living over the shop, nursing homes, private hospitals and convalescent facilities, sports injury clinics and childcare facilities.  </blockquote>The Regling and Watson report noted that such tax reliefs &quot;directed to the property sector, often in particular regions of the country ... contributed to a more general misallocation of resources as some of the tax concessions seemed to have been granted on an ad-hoc basis in a not fully transparent way&quot;.  The incentives were not necessarily bad, as they brought much needed investment to particular areas of the country.  The problem was that they went on for too long.  As the committee has heard, Mr. Wright has acknowledged in his testimony to the banking inquiry that these policies should have been &quot;grandfathered&quot; or ended earlier.  <br/><br/>Why were reliefs extended twice in the period of their implementation?</p><p>For example, the Finance Act 1994 and Chapter 1, Part 9, of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provided for accelerated capital allowances for hotels.  While this special provision for hotels was terminated in budget 2003, the Finance Act 2003 included transitional arrangements that allowed for the continued availability of a 100% write-off over seven years provided certain conditions were met.  This arrangement was further extended in the Finance Acts 2004 and 2005.  The Finance Act 2006 extended the transitional period by introducing a phase-out period.  Peter Bacon, who has also come before the committee, complied a report for the Irish Hotels Federation which asserted that "The tax allowance scheme allowed hotels to access both equity and debt finance easier than would be the case otherwise ... the total value of tax allowance related to hotels that have not been open seven years at the end of 2009 will be just over &euro;1.5 billion".</p><p> Other incentives of note include the 2000 to 2007 special incentive tax rate for developers.  This sought to free up land for development by taxing proceeds from the sale of land at 20% instead of the higher rate of up to 42%.  Moreover, Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 was amended in 2002 to allow developers to negotiate their way out of providing 20% social and affordable housing in any development through land swap, payments to local authority or the building of equivalent social and affordable housing elsewhere.  It would be helpful if the committee considered the following: a list of the tax reliefs and incentives granted by the Government to developers and investors between 1997 and 2007; the cost of these reliefs and incentives; the reason tax incentives were extended beyond their natural life spans; whether the structure of local government funding facilitated a financial dependency on development levies; whether reliance on such levies, worth nearly &euro;600 million in 2005 and &euro;700 million in 2006, influenced erroneous planning decisions; and the number of politicians, or their close associates, who received interest-free loans or mortgages on favourable terms or who received loans outside of normal lending practices.</p><p> The committee also asked me to look at suggested reforms and controls to moderate these kinds of relationships and I now turn to these.  I have presented eight reforms to regulate such relationships.  First, is independent audit of the capacity and operational ability of oversight agencies, including the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the Central Bank, the Revenue Commissioners, the Competition Authority and other agencies charged with the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of white collar crime.  This approach was taken in the UK after its financial crisis.  In 2008, the UK's Attorney General commissioned the De Grazia review which appraised the Serious Fraud Office, SFO, in regard to two US agencies, which were the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.  These were both well established bodies prosecuting serious and complex economic crime.  The review's 34 recommendations focused on operations, capacity, governance and external relationships.</p><p> Second, I recommend introducing monetary awards for whistleblowers.  This approach was taken in the USA following the economic crisis.  The Dodd Frank Act 2010 established the Office of the Whistleblower.  The Act expanded powers first introduced under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002.  The Securities and Exchange Commission is now authorised by the US Congress to provide monetary awards ranging between 10% and 30% of the money collected in cases where high quality original whistleblower information leads to a commission enforcement action of over $1 million in sanctions.</p><p> My third recommendation is the introduction of a register of liabilities.  Australia, Finland, New Zealand, Poland, Spain and Canada require politicians to publicly disclose any debts they may have.  Ireland only has a register of assets.</p><p> Fourth, I note that the Standards in Public Office Commission's annual report 2013 contains 20 recommendations on reforming our ethics and electoral legislation.  I submitted an additional six recommendations on the draft guidelines on party finance in my submission to the commission in 2013.</p><p> Fifth, I recommend that political parties be required to publish accounts under the guidelines on party finance in advance of the 2016 general election.  The delay by the Government in introducing these guidelines means that parties are not obliged to publish accounts until mid-2016 which may, in effect, be after the 2016 general election.</p><p> Sixth, I recommend the establishment of an independent commission to decide how political activity in Ireland is funded.  The principle that politicians should not regulate themselves is well established.  For example, political actors do not decide constituency boundaries.  Ireland's rules on political funding disproportionately favour incumbents and political parties.</p><p> My seventh recommendation relates to lobbying and seeks registration not only of lobbyists but of why decisions have been made.  I recommend the introduction of a web-based centralised information platform to co-ordinate consultations with individuals, stakeholders and lobby groups.  This would serve to report on input received on policy and detail how decisions were made.  It would improve the openness and transparency of engagement in policy-making by all actors.  Stakeholder and lobbying interaction is recorded by health department in Canada within what they call the Consultation and Stakeholder Information Management System, or CMIMS.</p><p> My eighth recommendation is to stop blaming our small population or geographical size for bad governance.  The committee asked me to examine whether being a small country is a factor in terms of problematic relationships.  The population size of a country is not a determining factor in measuring governance effectiveness.  Academic research shows that poor governance is correlated with the quality of institutions, in respect of which Niamh Hardiman went into considerable detail yesterday, lower levels of investment and growth, inequality, education, democratisation, colonial heritage, religion and an absence of legislative controls.  In Ireland's case, substantial levels of regulation combined with a high degree of State ownership have facilitated considerable political discretion.  These conditions have been at the heart of the majority of governance scandals since the foundation of the State.</p><p> In the appendix to my written submission, I include a table ranking the governance scores of 17 selected countries for 2008.  That year was chosen as the year of Ireland's financial crisis.  Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index, CPI, is a compilation of corruption scores which ranks countries from least corrupt to most corrupt while the World Bank measures good governance using six different indicators, of which four are presented in the appendix.  Although Transparency International and the World Bank use different aggregation methods, they are highly correlated.  The population sizes of the 17 countries is also set out in the table.  While this is a crude exercise, it demonstrates that countries with smaller and larger populations rank both higher and lower than Ireland in the good governance stakes.  Indeed, the table suggests that countries with smaller populations tend to have better governance than countries with larger populations.  To invoke being a small country is to use a bogeyman argument.  It is a lazy explanation for poor governance.  Many small countries escaped the economic collapse unscathed while many large ones did not.</p></speech>

I would reply, "So you are saying that Ireland is more corrupt than all of the African countries and countries that have had dictatorships and so forth".  There is a misperception in Ireland about how corrupt we are.  In comparative terms, which one can see in the table I have given at the end of my submission, Ireland ranks about the same as the UK, Germany and Belgium.</p></speech>

At the close of the 1992 general election, for instance, Fianna F&aacute;il was in debt to the tune of &euro;3.5 million and Fine Gael owed more than &euro;1 million.  That perhaps was, in part, due to the turbulence of elections and campaigning in the 1980s.  What I was trying to set there is the context, that by the time the boom came about political parties and political individuals were very financially vulnerable.  In my book I detailed particular individuals and their struggles to finance their elections.  Even if it was a small donation it would have meant quite a lot to those individuals and political parties, which may then have presented a more opportune example or opportunity for individuals and parties to be influenced.</p></speech>

There was the Tully tribunal in 1975 that lasted two hours - the shortest tribunal in the history of the State.  There was also serious allegations on the front page of the <i>Sunday Independent</i>by an outstanding investigative journalist called Joe MacAnthony.  A lot of what we subsequently were to find out was already in the public domain in the 1970s.<br/><br/>In my chapter I argued that the national coalition - the Fine Gael-Labour coalition - and some of their actions, ensured that these things were not fully investigated.  I remember interviewing the former Attorney General and High Court judge, Declan Costello, extensively about this.  In the archives I found a memorandum he had sent to the Government.  Around that time, in the UK, they were looking at introducing conflict of interest legislation.  Mr. Costello brought this to Cabinet, he sat at Cabinet at that time.  The UK introduced much of the legislation which subsequently came into being in the mid-1990s, particularly around conflict of interest but there was a reluctance to introduce it here, and Mr. Costello was very frustrated at that.  Twenty or 30 years later he was still noticeably frustrated that the Government, despite very obvious scandals happening, chose not to introduce legislation which would have regulated some of this behaviour.  <br/><br/>I think the point the Senator has made is that in the 1970s something happened in Ireland that had not happened before, and that was to do with population changes.  There were more people living in urban Ireland, for the first time, than there was in rural Ireland and one had this pressure on cities that one did not have before.  More people wanted to move into cities, more people wanted planning permission and the existing system was not structured for that demand.  A way of getting around that demand and delays in getting planning permission and facilities was that people tended to give money for planning permission or for certain facilities.</p></speech>

Often one finds that the law is catching up to address different concerns that arise.  We must remember that the first legislation directly on corruption in Ireland was introduced in 1995.  With the existence of the Irish State before that period, our legislation on corruption and ethics was derived from British statutes, from 1889, 1908 and 1916.  One had this kind of gap where there was no legislation whatsoever to moderate regulated relationships between different entities.</p><p>Arguably, one could say there was a lot of behaviour in politics in the 1980s and 1990s which, if it were to happen now, would certainly come under corruption legislation.  It was not corrupt because there was no legislation which stated it was corrupt, but just because there was no legislation which stated it was corrupt does not mean that it was not corrupt.</p></speech>

I did not find relevant what the name of a political party was because it was about proximity to power.  There has been a lot of research in other countries where that happens.  I do not believe a particular political party and its membership somehow come from a different genetic pool from other political parties and their memberships.  If political party X had been in power for a long period of time, rather than political party Y, I am not so sure the behaviour would have been that different.  Often when people talk about corruption, it is very easy to do it.  One may talk about individuals and corruption is very sexy; it is very easy to politicise it.  What I try to do, however, is to rise above its politicisation.  I do not believe it is about a particular political party or particular political individuals.  I believe it is about how long these political parties or political individuals have been in power.</p></speech>

For two or three years I sat on the strategic policy committee of Dublin City Council.  From that experience I found that city councillors of all hues and political backgrounds were extraordinarily committed to local government and extraordinarily committed to their city.  Also, there was incredible frustration at the limit to what they could do in local government because of funding issues.  Local government in Ireland has very weak financial autonomy compared to that in other EU countries.  There is a large reliance on central government funding.  In Dublin City Council's case, for a decade there were outstanding fees from the Government in property taxes on State buildings around the city.  Therefore, I think this weak financial base of local government in the 1990s and the influx of money in property development levies gave local government a large dependence on property levies.  I defer again, however, to people who are experts on local government.</p></speech>

There were similar falls in the level of trust in other countries like Spain and Greece where they had a deep financial collapse.  I will point again to the mismatch between the perception in Ireland of corruption and how we compared to other countries.  In a survey last year for the European Commission European consultants found that 81% of Irish people believed corruption was widespread.  Some 24% believe the Government's efforts to combat corruption are effective.  I guess this comes back to the analogy I often use about shoes and shoelaces.  In many ways, Ireland has some of the best legislation in the world on governance and ethics.  America and the United Kingdom would give their right arm for the limits on political donations we have and Exchequer funding for political parties.  The US President's recent appointee as ambassador to Ireland is a political appointment, as all appointees are.  Such a concept would be alien to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  There are lots of things where Ireland stands head and shoulders above other countries when it comes to the legislative framework we have in place.  I argue that new shoes are no good unless one has tied the shoelaces.  Despite having very good shoes, or good legislation, what happens is that we trip over the small things.  We trip over implementation, perception and culture, which is quite frustrating.</p></speech>

In the archives I found a memorandum for the Government, which was about six or seven pages long.  I remember sending it to him and we met afterwards.  The tone of the language in that memorandum was so strong and exhibited very deep anger and frustration at the behaviour of politics and political parties in Ireland in the early to mid-1970s and proposals to address it.  At the time there was the Poulson affair in the United Kingdom where similar issues had arisen.  I will give one reform that he suggested, apart from introducing conflict of interest legislation under which councillors or TDs would have to declare, for instance, that not only were they politicians but that they were also directors of property companies or were being paid as consultants by property companies.  He was critical of the Local Government Act 1946 which had repealed the 1898 order obliging local councillors to declare conflicts of interest.  He drew attention to the Housing Act 1966 which had yet to be applied and the difficulties in providing for an offence under the outdated Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act 1889.</p><p>He noted that no legislation whatsoever dealing directly with corruption and ethics had been introduced in Ireland since the British statutes.</p></speech>

To the Irish mind, this could be very controversial.  There have been a number of cases in the last year or two where whistleblowers working within banks have received reward payments of several million dollars and given information about fraudulent practices that had been occurring within their institutions.  I have written several newspaper articles detailing the whistleblowers involved, the fines that have been imposed as a consequence of their information and the money that they have received.  It has worked very successfully in America.</p></speech>

This was a matter pertaining to the sugar company.  The Minister said in the D&aacute;il, "I know it is a widely held view among the professions in this country that dog does not eat dog.  I believe, however, that the taxpayer who paid &pound;1.1 million for this report was at least entitled to one bite".   The tone certainly reminds us of the Minister.  Are professions not being accountable in Ireland a major issue to which he was drawing attention?  Are they ever called to account?  Is that part of our non-accountable society?</p></speech>

I think, until the mid-1990s, politics in Ireland and political behaviour were self-regulated.  In the book, I go through different instances where the suggestion of regulating political behaviour was seen as not trusting politicians and how dare someone suggest such things.  In particular, Ms Eithne FitzGerald, when she was Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs in the early 1990s, received incredible abuse for suggesting that politicians needed to have conflicts of interest and so forth.  The suggestion that to do so would be abhorrent.  We had very much a self-regulating culture in Ireland, whether it was in politics or the church or professions.  Each of the professions has its own organisation that self-regulates behaviour.  As we have seen through the crash, a lot of things were dealt with in-house and probably did not receive the appropriate legal attention that they should have.</p></speech>

If the questions that were asked in the D&aacute;il were answered in the way they are answered here, there would be no need for this inquiry.

This was where, over many years, different Deputies were asking very pertinent and direct questions about issues pertaining to the export of beef to Iraq.  At the tribunal, when that particular politician - was it Ray Burke? - was up before it, the response was, "They never asked the right questions, therefore, I never gave them the right answers".  It exposed - this is again going back to what Professor David Farrell would have referred to yesterday - the weakness of the D&aacute;il in respect of getting answers from the Government of the day.</p></speech>

As to the current lobbying legislation, its emphasis is on registering who the lobbyists are, but not necessarily on why Ministers have made particular decisions.  In Canada, this works quite well.  In its legislation, when amendments have been made, one will see it.  A friend who works at a senior level in the Canadian Government explained this process to me.  Every Friday, it will go up on the website of the particular Department - the different legislation, the reasons for the different amendments, links to who gave proposals and all of that.  It is a very clear, line-by-line explanation for why Ministers and decision makers came to make particular decisions on legislation.</p></speech>

The 2008 OECD report on public service in Ireland focused a lot on this question and noted the absence in Ireland of a tradition of what would be known as regulatory impact analysis.  Some Departments now, particularly the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, are very much focusing on this but where one looks at what the unintended consequences of this legislation will be, how much will this particular decision cost and how will it impact other legislation, it is not just about introducing something at will, but looking at the potential effect of that legislation down along the line.  That is a tradition that, perhaps, we could use more effectively here.</p></speech>

That would have involved in 2008 a series of round tables with different actors, including people from the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  From what we gathered, the effectiveness of the Committee of Public Accounts is often based on the relationship between the Chair of that committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General as to what to focus on and what not to.  So, there is very much an informal aspect to it.</p> <p>  I think a lot of agencies, whether it is the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Competition Authority or whatever it may be, are very reluctant to say publicly they need more resources.  If one goes through the cuts that have been made to different agencies that have responsibility for oversight in the past four or five years, some of the cuts have been incredible - 20% or 25% - at a time when their workload has increased.  It seems a very counterproductive effort.</p></speech>

The idea is that one is not just influenced by what shares one may own.  A register of liabilities is what assets one has and what shares one has, as the members all know from doing these forms every year, but it also lists what one's financial vulnerabilities are.  Maybe there is a conflict because one owes a lot of money to a particular bank or institution.  In Canada when I looked at it, in the case of its Minister of Finance, if one goes online, one will see the loans he has.  Not the exact amount of loans, but the loans that he has and his exposure to different banks.  It is a very open and transparent system.</p></speech>

Dr. Raj Chari in Trinity College Dublin and Professor Gary Murphy have also looked at this.</p><p>In Ireland, tendering and procurement processes tend not to be as open and transparent as they should be.  Journalists often neglect to read the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s reports, which report serious questions of unorthodox behaviour in the way certain tenders and procurement contracts are awarded.  The annual procurement budget in Ireland is up to &euro;17 billion.  Some members would have more information on it than I.

What role did the influence of vested interests have in the banking crisis?</p></speech>

I cannot prove that because X gave a donation to Y, policy Z occurred as a result.  All I am doing is highlighting the extent of donations and policy making that benefitted those sectors, particularly the property sector.  An audit of how much those tax incentives cost the State and the relationships therein would be very helpful.  We can insinuate-----</p></speech>

These things happen behind closed doors.  How can we know why certain decisions were made without access to the information?  This goes back to my recommendation on lobbying.  We do not just need a register of lobbyists and a means of identifying them.  Analysing why decisions were made is the crucial issue.</p></speech>

The unintended consequence, as Des O&rsquo;Malley and others have pointed out, is that it is so heavily regulated that it is very difficult for new political parties or entities to make a mark.  I have spoken to general secretaries of the political parties and many of them model their political funding systems on the Gaelic Athletic Association, GAA.  Before President Obama was doing it, the political parties here were deriving the majority of their funding from small donations from many members.  Most people would be surprised at how much money political parties receive from membership fees, national draws and dinners.  The problem is that the public does not see it, and only sees the gaps between the disclosed and undisclosed money.  This creates a problem.</p> <p>  It is not just about having good legislation but about political leadership and the culture that exists.  Ireland has some of the best legislation in the world around political funding.  Approximately six months after a corruption tribunal reported adverse findings regarding a wealthy businessman, the Taoiseach was ringing a bell with him.  That sent a message to people.  Instead of the Taoiseach standing up, he sat back and rang a bell.  While we can have great legislation, when the public sees there are no consequences and that there are different rules and regulations for different people, it creates an unfair perception.</p></speech>

It is a bogeyman argument.  As Professor Farrell said yesterday, no matter what electoral system we had, the culture would shape itself around it to determine the choices of what we want the electoral system to be.  I am not convinced that changing the electoral system is the big answer that would solve all Ireland's problems.  However, I would defer to people who would have particular expertise on electoral systems.</p></speech>

What does she believe motivates people who make donations to political parties?  I am not talking about members buying a ticket in a national draw or supporting a church gate collection, but non-members of parties who make donations to individuals or parties.  Is it to support an individual candidate in whom they believe, to support the policies of the party or to influence the policies of the party?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-12a.461" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Elaine Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015031200002#H01500"><p>It is a combination of those elements.  There is a danger that because of the enormous abuses that have happened in the funding of political parties in the past - I mentioned four tribunals that examined this - anybody who donates to a political party is regarded as seeking malign influence.  This is wrong and unfair.  People support political parties and political individuals because they believe in democracy and democracy does not run on thin air.  Money is necessary to fund the salaries of research assistants and so forth.  My research shows that when particular sectors have donated in such large amounts to political parties, it suggests they were doing so because they were seeking influence or they felt it was necessary.  It is not unusual and occurs in many countries.  I referred to beef barons and property barons.  In the 1980s, the beef industry was donating to all political parties because beef was the biggest indigenous industry in Ireland at the time.</p><p>In the 1990s and 2000s it was property, because property was fuelling the economy.  If the same rules and culture were in place now, perhaps it would be multinational and technology companies that would be donating to political parties.  Donations often reflect the make-up of the economy.  Regarding the donations to Fianna F&aacute;il, the property sector, auctioneers and solicitors were prominent donors, as were banks and the motor industry.  They were the industries and sectors of the boom.</p></speech>

I believe she was inferring that those in power will invariably get more donations.  Does that lead her to a conclusion that those who are making the donations are seeking to influence those who hold the reins of power?</p></speech>

There are eight different surveys of different groups of population in each country and those are correlated.  There are very few convictions in the world for corruption so it would be very difficult to have a rank that measures actual corruption.  By its nature corruption is clandestine.  There are problems with measuring just perception, and Transparency International and other agencies have acknowledged that.  However, there is also a consistency about these rankings over a period of time and correlated to other indices.</p></speech>

What is Dr. Byrne's opinion of the various political reforms that have been introduced by the current Government and those that are under consideration by the Constitutional Convention?  What impact does she believe these reforms will have on the various relationships between State authorities, parties, elected representatives, supervisory authorities, banks and so forth?</p></speech>

In many respects, Ireland has some of the best practice legislation on governance.  However, it is about implementation and culture.  There have been various scandals in the last year, for example, relating to Seanad appointments which present a picture to the public that there is somehow unorthodox influence over appointments in public life, when often these things are regulated.</p> <p>  On the Constitutional Convention, as somebody who was part of the reason that it happened through the "We the Citizens" initiative, I am very disappointed by it.  It was a missed opportunity.  Many of the questions that were presented to the Constitutional Convention were not the big questions of the day.  There is a tendency in the Government to focus on numbers in its reforms, for example, how many local councils there are, how many Deputies there are, what are the salaries of particular individuals, whether somebody should vote at 18 years old or 16 years old and whether the age to be President is 35 years old or 21 years old.  There is a focus on numbers in the reform programme by the coalition, rather than on where power is, which was discussed by the witnesses before the committee yesterday.  I think the Constitutional Convention was a missed opportunity.</p></speech>

We are still waiting on the Standards in Public Office Commission reports.  Again, it is a missed opportunity by the current coalition Government not to have put the guidelines on party finance into place when it could have.  It now allows that political parties are not obliged to make their annual reports available for public consumption until, in theory, after the 2016 general election.  This allows, facilitates and enables the perception that something unorthodox is happening.  Political parties should demonstrate their commitment to transparency, accountability and all those buzzwords by disclosing their accounts.</p></speech>

How does one regulate that?  There are ways around legislation, as there are ways around everything.  One of the detailed recommendations I made to the standards commission was that, in theory, X property developer, or whatever sector he or she is from, could make individual donations to each member of a political party.  In that way, the individual is not donating to a political party but to individuals and, in that way, raising the amount of money he is giving annually to an individual.</p></speech>

It can be on TV.  In Ireland, is our threshold for accepting unethical or improper behaviour in politicians higher or lower than in other countries, for example the UK?

Much of this is due to the absence of consequences.  More than 200 Ansbacher accounts were identified in the biggest incident of tax evasion in the history of the State but not one single prosecution for tax evasion.  There have been no meaningful consequences from the tribunals of inquiry.  When people see an absence of consequence, then that enables this culture of shrugging shoulders.</p></speech>

I know from speaking privately to the different individuals in these agencies that, again, they are people very committed to their role of oversight but are frustrated they do not have the resources to do so or that there is no information-sharing.  I have written in articles before how the response to the drugs epidemic, along with the murder of journalists and a policeman in the mid-1990s, saw the establishment of one of the most innovative bodies in the world, one which most countries seek to replicate, the Criminal Assets Bureau.  Yet, after the biggest financial crisis in the history of the State, the response is not an overhaul of how fraud and economic crime are investigated, prosecuted and resourced, as was the case in the US or UK.  That to me is incredible and very shortsighted.</p></speech>

She gave the examples of the Guinness Mahon Bank and the Ansbacher affair and the example of the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey&rsquo;s indebtedness to Allied Irish Bank and the writing off of substantial debt.

AIB wrote off debts of almost &pound;200,000 in 1993.  That followed the collapse of aircraft leasing company GPA, Guinness Peat Aviation, in which he was a shareholder.</p><p>His write-off, by contrast with that of Taoiseach Charles Haughey, occurred after he had left politics, six years after he had been Taoiseach and a year after he had retired from backbench politics.  That matter, the write-down of Garret FitzGerald's &pound;200,000 debt by AIB, was investigated by the Moriarty tribunal which made the contrast between Garret FitzGerald and Charles J. Haughey.  Charles J. Haughey largely kept all of his assets virtually intact, while Garret FitzGerald sold his family home and virtually everything else he owned in a bid to pay off the money he owed.</p></speech>

Was the financing of political parties at the time wider than this?  Is Dr. Byrne aware that in the 1990s there was substantial controversy about the financing of the Fine Gael Party relative to the second mobile phone licence and that in 2000, &euro;50,000 each was donated to three major parties, namely, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, by a single business donor?

Dr. Byrne has referred to the fact that only &euro;1.3 million was disclosed of the &euro;10.1 million spent in the entire election campaign.  Has she analysed the amounts of funding individuals put into their own election campaigns?  I was an unsuccessful candidate and virtually everything I spent on the campaign was money I had saved myself, rather than funding from the party as such.</p></speech>

I am aware that right across political parties individuals would have self-financed their campaigns considerably.  There are people who are still paying off credit union loans and things like that.  This begs the question as to whether the political system is predisposed to attracting people of financial means rather than people who may have less access to money, which prevents people from particular areas of life from entering politics as they may wish to do.  The answer to that question is "No" because it is about what is disclosed to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  What I examined were the facts on the Standards in Public Office Commission's annual register over ten years.  These figures were not put on it.  As I have stressed throughout, all this can do is infer patterns.  It is not a complete picture of how political parties or political individuals have funded their campaigns, which is why I argue that one perhaps might need to have an electoral commission or an independent commission to look at how politics in general is funded to address the questions the Deputy has just raised.</p></speech>

Can this be squared?  How could a funding system be designed that would allow equal access?</p></speech>

There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever of that ever occurring.  Political parties, for their referendums and election campaigns, must raise the money from political donations.  Political parties do not set the rules for where their constituency boundaries should be.  When the national coalition did this in the 1970s, disaster followed and a new system was introduced.  On the same principle, why should political parties decide how political parties are funded?  It does not make sense.  It would allow for new entrants to political life to have an alternative income source.</p></speech>

As I was a child politician, I have been a politician for about 16 or 17 years.  It is all about voluntary disclosure.  Is the commission in a position to investigate thoroughly whether that disclosure is complete?</p></speech>

A balance has to be struck, too.  The members are all people in professional life.  Does one create a system in which absolutely every part of one's behaviour is regulated?  There has to be some trust.  The costs of a false declaration are so high in terms of reputation that one really would have to have a very brassy neck to do such a thing.  The vigilance of the public is also so high.  I urge people to look at the recommendations the Standards in Public Office Commission has made repeatedly in its annual reports.  In particular, it sought what it termed an "inquiry officer", who would have the role of making independent inquiries.  There is no such role.</p></speech>

The Local Appointments Commission and the Civil Service Commission, both established in the early 1920, ensured that the local government positions and Civil Service positions were not politicised, in contrast to America where, when a new President comes in to office, all the civil servants leave.  We do not have that system in Ireland.  As I outlined in the book in regard to the beef tribunal in particular, certainly there have been senior civil servants who subsequently went to work for the individuals they had been regulating.  Therefore, there was this revolving door culture of gamekeepers turned poachers.  It is now in some of the agencies in the State managing some of the property assets as well</p></speech>

A quote from Dr. Byrne's book, <i>Political Corruption in Ireland 1922-2010: A Crooked Harp</i>, which has been mentioned before states, &quot;A corrupt Act can be camouflaged by lawful justification&quot;.  I think Dr. Byrne has referenced events which may have happened in the 1970s and 1980s.  Legislation was not in place at the time but if today's legislation was applied then, it would be questionable to say the least.  In regard to the subject matter that this inquiry is investigating, primarily the banking collapse but many other areas from 1992 onwards, does Dr. Byrne believe that statement holds for that period of time and the subject matter under this investigation, or that it is not relevant to the issues we are discussing?</p></speech>

The Department of Justice and Equality is introducing what is known as a trading in influence clause in the corruption legislation.  That certainly regulates that kind of behaviour.  The answer to that question is "Yes".</p></speech>

Will she explain briefly to the committee the concept of "mediated corruption", who it benefits or who it does not benefit, particularly in regard to the investigations which the committee is taking on?</p></speech>

The trading in influence provision in the new corruption legislation seeks to regulate that.  GRECO and various bodies looking at Ireland's governance framework for many years have been criticising the absence in our legislation of trading in influence.  With that in mind I will quote the definition of "mediated corruption".  I cannot recall the name of the author but it was in relation to the Keating Five.  The gain that the politician sees is political, not personal, and it is not illegitimate in itself as in conventional corruption.  How the public official views the benefit is improper, not necessarily the benefit itself or the fact that the particular citizen receives the benefit.  The connection between the gain and the benefit is improper because it damages the democratic process, not because the public official provides the benefit with a corrupt motive.  I guess this goes back to my experience of working in the United Nations anti-corruption unit where my boss used to say, just because a behaviour is not corrupt in the legal sense it might be morally corrupt.  If one is advising somebody about their behaviour, one might be within the letter of the law but one might be outside the spirit of the law.  For politicians the tide water mark of expectations is very high and often an unfair one.  It is not just about what one is legally obliged to do but what is also morally expected of one.</p></speech>

It is about competitive advantage.  Political parties are the same in respect of which party will release all its accounts first and so on.  Political parties, in their annual conferences or Ard-Fheiseanna, release information about their accounts.  However, the difference is that under the draft guidelines, they will be obliged to release that information on particular headings in order that one can compare how much each political party has received and spent under different categories.  One can then make an analysis because if a political party simply releases its accounts and states it got X amount of money from donations, one does not know-----</p></speech>

I refer to particular prominent politicians receiving money on the day of the election, individuals going to their houses and giving them the money, or donations being benefits in kind, being free cars or facilities or whatever it may be.  We often get caught up on the brown envelope thing to the effect that a donation or something like that is a <i>quid pro quo</i>.  Often, however, it is indirect and is a case of doing someone a favour and thereafter, down along the line, that person will return the favour in an indistinct way.  Were one intent on committing corruption, one would no longer be doing it the old-fashioned way.  I mean giving money for a favour committed because these things can be traced.  What the Moriarty tribunal in particular exposed was benefits in kind through different land transactions that may have arisen.  Decisions were made and perhaps down along the line, certain benefits were conferred on individuals.  Corruption is not black and white and is not direct.  It is indirect and these relationships are very difficult to examine.</p></speech>

I started on page 1 and will finish on page 239, which is the final page.  In the last sentence of Dr. Byrne's book, she writes, "Ireland&rsquo;s loss of economic sovereignty in 2010, due to a perception of political failure and the unorthodox influence of vested interests, may yet motivate Irish public life to engage in state building and re-imagine Irish society with an emphasis on the moral duties of citizenship".  Has the body politic done enough to see a positive outcome in respect of that statement?</p></speech>

The book really is a positive story about how the foundation of the State was achieved between two world wars, when most democracies were failing but yet that of Ireland was sustained because in the 1920s, the Government introduced measures that deliberately gave away power.  It introduced concepts ahead of its time about meritocracy, some of which I have outlined.  This was not something that was particular to Cumann na nGaedheal or Fine Gael.  An election poster of &Eacute;amon de Valera in 1917 in the East Clare by-election, uses the phrase to vote for a patriot, not a place-hunter.  That idea of politics, held by the first-generation across all political backgrounds, was one motivated by the words the Senator has just used, namely, by this moral duty to the country.</p> <p>  In many respects, Ireland has a lot of positives and has very robust legislation.  For me, it is immensely frustrating to see such silly mistakes being made, these shoelaces over which we continually trip, about public perception over some of the instances I have mentioned, about ringing bells, appointments to the Seanad or whatever it may be, because it generates such attention that does not reflect the legislative regime that we have.  It is about leadership and culture just as much as it is about legislation.  Those two things go hand in hand.</p></speech>

As did Senator Michael D'Arcy, I liked Dr. Byrne's last sentence and its call to arms, as well as the identification that the last time we lost a Parliament - I think Henry Grattan is one of her heroes - it was due to the mass corruption used to undermine that Parliament.  Can Dr. Byrne relate all these thoughts, as well as her presentation this morning, to what this joint committee should do with regard to banks, their auditors and bank regulators?  What principles would she draw from all her work to help this committee in the future?</p></speech>

In Ireland, we have an implementation deficit, so in terms of principles, it is that we would follow through on the legislation and the eight different recommendations I made.  The eighth one is about blaming a small country.  In other words, it pertains to the culture we have about blaming things that are outside of our control, rather than focusing on the things that are within our control.  One such would be to do an audit of the agencies in this State tasked with oversight, which do great work, and to consider the resources they need as well as to look at the information overlaps.  In addition, we perhaps could now, since the collapse of the economy, take the same approach to economic crime that we took to drugs in the mid-1990s.</p></speech>

I wrote about this last week in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>.  It is an issue.  I assume the Chairman is referring to Sinn F&eacute;in which is enormously funded by organisations outside the State who are not necessarily Irish citizens but donate under the category of friends of Sinn F&eacute;in Australia - less so now - or friends of Sinn F&eacute;in America.  You would ask if that creates a disproportionate influence in political life.</p></speech>

That said, I think it is perfectly reasonable for Irish citizens to donate to Irish political parties.  Sinn F&eacute;in is not the only political party that does it.  Fine Gael regularly has dinners in London.  Fianna F&aacute;il regularly has dinners in Brussels.</p></speech>

What sums does she have in mind?  How would she avoid vexatious or false complaints given that there would be a financial reward for engaging in this behaviour as opposed to just doing it because it is the right thing to do?</p></speech>

That is how the fine is moderated.  How one prevents against vexatious complaints is that if the agency that is charged with investigating the information by the whistleblower gets a conviction, then wrongdoing has occurred.  I think that answers that question.  That is how one regulates it.  The information has to be good enough.</p></speech>

A significant part of this inquiry is to look to the future and draw on lessons from the past to ensure that the type of crisis we had is not visited upon us again.  Dr. Byrne wrote an interesting comment about stating the obvious and that this was one of the things this inquiry could be doing that was not done by others.  I ask her to expand on that and add any other final points in conclusion.</p></speech>

I think that referred to Professor Bill Black's comments, as well as other comments that have been made before the inquiry, that it is not just about looking at the institutions but at the individuals within those institutions.  In that article I made reference to legislation and to Judge Rakoff's comments.  He is a pretty amazing individual when it comes to economic crime and his comments about wilful neglect.  Just because an individual does not know, one also should ask, "Well, should they have known?"  There is a responsibility therein.  One cannot just hide behind this veil of "I didn't know."  The question then arises that one should have known and there is liability therein.</p> <p>  The other piece in that article I referred to was in relation to Europe and penalties that the UK is also trying to bring in on not just fining banks, but fining individual bankers.  There has been research done that since 2008 extraordinary fines have been imposed on banking institutions around the world, but behaviour has not changed.</p> <p>  The governor of the Bank of England, who also happens to be an Irish passport holder, has argued very vehemently, "What has changed?"  We have had an economic collapse.  We have had institutions that have collapsed.  We have had massive consequences to individual citizens, but the behaviour of some of these banks has not changed because it is almost like banks are using fines as a line within their accounts.  There is an inevitability about it, "We're going to get fined and, sure, that's part of life."  So instead of focusing just on the institutions one would also focus on the individuals.</p></speech>

We are focusing on the theme of relationships between State authorities, political parties, elected representatives, supervisory authorities, banking institutions and the property sector.</p><p>I welcome  Mr. McDonald, a former journalist with <i>The Irish Times</i>.  He commenced his journalistic career as a freelance New York correspondent for the <i>Irish Press </i>, subsequently becoming a sub-editor and reporter for the paper.  He joined <i>The Irish Times</i>in 1979.  He was the environment correspondent from 1985 to 2000 and environment editor until his official retirement in January of this year.  Mr. McDonald is also author of several books, including <i>The Destruction of Dublin</i>, <i>Saving the City</i>and <i>The</i><i>Construction of Dublin.  </i>He is joint author with Peigin Doyle of <i>Ireland's Earthen Houses</i>and with James Nix of <i>Chaos at the Crossroads, </i>published in 2005, which documented the environmental destruction of Ireland during the boom years.  He is joint author with Kathy Sheridan of <i>The Builders</i>, which profiles the developers and others in the Celtic tiger period.<br/><br/>In recognition of his work, Frank was conferred with an honorary doctorate by Dublin Institute of Technology in 2006.  He was made an honorary member of the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland of 2010 and an honorary fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 2011 and an honorary life member of the National Union of Journalists in 2014.  Mr. McDonald is very welcome to the inquiry this morning.<br/><br/>I advise the witness that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  The witness is asked to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. <br/><br/>I invite Mr. McDonald to make his opening comments to the inquiry.</p></speech>

It is not an unusual phenomenon.  The Galway tent, notorious in its own way, was our version of it until recently.  Back in the 1960s, the nexus of connection between the construction sector and politicians became evident with the formation of Taca, a Fianna F&aacute;il fund-raising organisation which used to run &pound;100-a-plate dinners to raise money for the party and which were pretty scandalous at the time.  It is known that there were close connections between leading property developers and senior politicians, as the latter could facilitate the former in securing State tenants for planned office buildings, particularly in Dublin, to cater for our growing Civil Service.<br/><br/>Politicians at local level also played a crucial role in facilitating ambitious plans.  Since the 1963 Planning Act came into force in October 1964, it has been a &quot;reserved function&quot; of councillors to make decisions on the content of city or county or indeed, town development plans.  What this meant was that they were in charge of zoning land -- making decisions about which land would be designated for development and which land would not be so designated.  They had the power, in other words, to transform the value of agricultural land anywhere in Ireland, multiplying it by a factor of ten or more.  So there was a lot riding on such decisions.<br/><br/>Between 1963 and 1971, land values in the Dublin area soared by 530% as the scale of the development opportunities became evident and speculators scrambled to buy up land likely to be rezoned for housing, industry or whatever.  The then Fianna F&aacute;il Government established a committee on the price of building land, chaired by a renowned constitutional lawyer, Mr. Justice John Kenny, to recommend ways of curbing such speculation.  It proposed that all land required for development should be designated and then acquired at its existing use value, plus a premium of 25%.  Sadly, over the past 40 years, however, nothing was done to implement this recommendation by any Government in the entire period.<br/><br/>It was inevitable under these circumstances that land speculation would continue and that zoning would become tainted by corruption.  Allegations that &quot;brown envelopes&quot; were changing hands, first surfaced in 1974, but a Garda investigation got nowhere.  Subsequent Garda investigations in the late 1980s and again in 1993 also got nowhere.  The latter investigation, the 1993 investigation, incidentally, arose out of a week-long series of articles in <i>The Irish Times</i>written by Mark Brennock and myself, on suspicious land rezoning decisions in County Dublin.  It led off with a news story on the front page, headed, &quot;Cash in brown paper bags for councillors&quot;.  An advertisement placed by a firm of Newry solicitors offering a &euro;10,000 reward on behalf of then anonymous clients for information that would secure the conviction of persons for engaging in land rezoning corruption ultimately led to the establishment of the planning tribunal, chaired first by Judge Feargus Flood and later by Judge Alan Mahon.  The tribunal heard voluminous evidence from witnesses with first-hand experience of corrupt payments and drew a number of conclusions in this regard that were later deemed technically unsound following a Supreme Court ruling.  However, I have no doubt personally that corruption lay at the heart of Dublin County Council&rsquo;s most contentious land rezoning decisions.<br/><br/>One has to remember that the planning tribunal was dealing only with County Dublin as it then was.  I have no doubt that there has been corruption elsewhere; otherwise, decisions made by elected representatives against the advice of planning officials are almost inexplicable.  After all, we have a political system that is based on clientilism - as the members of this committee know very well.  I would define clientilism as doing individual favours for individual constituents, in effect, turning citizens into clients.  How much more of a step is it really to seek &quot;political donations&quot; in return for performing such &quot;services&quot; as rezoning such-and-such a parcel of land rather than such-and-such another parcel of land?  I would suggest that there is not much of a step between those two things.<br/><br/>Local area plans that were intended to give people more control over what happened in their own areas were turned instead into vehicles for land speculation and the enhancement of land values.  This applied right across the board.  Laois, Monaghan, Westmeath and Wexford, were among the counties that fell victim to this trend.  However, every council in Leinster, it seemed, wanted to secure a slice of Dublin&rsquo;s development.  There was massive over-zoning of land during the boom period.  In some cases, so much land was being zoned under county and local area plans that it could cater for decades of housing development.  In one case, enough land had been zoned in a particular county plan that would have catered for housing demand up until the year 2070.  Every county was making these decisions in disregard for what other counties were doing, or not doing, as the case may be.  Pressures from farmers and other landowners to have their patches of land zoned for development reached fever pitch in 2007, as the property bubble inflated to its full overblown size.  It was little short of a frenzy, as I recall.  There was a sense of &quot;It&rsquo;s now or never&quot; in the air, and some feared that they had already missed the boat or, rather in this case, the hot-air balloon.<br/><br/>Pumping up this balloon for most of the period under review was an array of lucrative tax incentives.  There was the long-established section 23 incentive for buy-to-let apartments or houses, and other tax breaks for the development of run-down seaside resorts - a measure introduced by the Rainbow coalition in 1996 - hotels, multi-storey carparks, student housing and a specific area-based tax incentive scheme called the upper Shannon rural renewal scheme, which applied to all of counties Leitrim and Longford as well as parts of Cavan, Roscommon and Sligo.  In theory, nearly anything developed anywhere within this vast designated area would qualify for tax incentives under the scheme introduced in 1998 by then Finance Minister, Charlie McCreevy.  It is hardly surprising then that among the counties severely hit by the phenomenon of ghost estates were Leitrim and Longford, because not only was there massive over-zoning, there was also massive over-development.  <i>Laissez faire</i>planning policies, largely landowner or developer-driven, created the framework for it all to happen while the advent of motorways facilitated and encouraged the sprawl of Dublin and other urban centres by leading people to imagine that they could live up to 100 km from where they worked and get there and back by car.  In Gorey, County Wexford, for example, more than 70% of new residents were commuting to work in Dublin, nearly 90 km to the north.  The same was happening all over Leinster and even in parts of Ulster.  I would instance Virginia, County Cavan, or Carrickmacross in County Monaghan, which have suburban housing estates that are really part of Dublin, in effect.</p><p>Yet, the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, which were adopted in 1999, had stressed the importance of consolidating the metropolitan area.  In other words, the guidelines were anti-sprawl.  Although if the guidelines were to mean anything they would have to be enforced, incredibly, no effort was made to do this either by local or central Government.  If the suburbs of Dublin were springing up in such unlikely places as Rochfortbridge in County Westmeath, which is 80 km from the capital, it was attributed to market forces and people would come to their senses when houses lost their value, which has happened.<br/><br/>The Government even used escalating house prices in Dublin to promote its controversial decentralisation programme, noting that public servants with homes in the capital would do well on selling them and buying a much cheaper house in one of the 53 locations to which more than 10,000 of them were to be dispersed.  The other beneficiaries were the business communities in the towns where new Government office blocks were to be built, including estate agents, shopkeepers, publicans, providers of other local services and those who had sites for sale.  It was the same with property-based tax incentives.  As more investors availed of these incentives, a whole sector of society had a major vested interest in ensuring the incentives continued for as long as possible.<br/><br/>The banking inquiry committee needs to ask why the property-based tax incentives were continued for so long even though the construction industry was having its biggest, most profitable spree ever.  Although it was perfectly justified to introduce the section 23 tax incentive in the late 1980s when the construction industry was on its knees and desperately needed a lift, to persist with these incentives when the construction industry was leading the boom was the height of folly.  The Government was adding fuel to the fire, stoking an already hot furnace.  The committee needs to ask former Ministers for Finance of the period precisely why they decided that a range of property-based tax incentives should remain in place, given that no public interest reason can be offered to justify such an irrational fiscal policy.<br/><br/>The availability of lucrative tax incentives combined with cheap credit and <i>laissez-faire</i>practices in the banking and planning sectors created and sustained the property bubble.  Bankers also played the role of touts for developers.  Frequently, it was bankers who spotted development opportunities at well located sites and lined up client developers to run with them, with the bank providing the loan financing.  Thus, developers ended up &quot;leveraged up to their eyeballs&quot; as one observer put it.  The banks were counting on these developers as men with the Midas touch to repeat their previous performances again and again as more sites came onto the market, even with eye-watering price tags.<br/><br/>So many of us were caught up in the bubble that we could not see it in perspective or at all.  It became normal that a fairly average semi-detached house could be worth &euro;1 million or more and that the price per square metre of residential accommodation was higher in Dublin than it was in Paris.  Every day, banks sought to persuade us to take out loans for new cars, holidays, home improvements, houses or whatever, and many of us did in droves.  That is why economist Professor Morgan Kelly's warning of an imminent collapse in the property market, published by <i>The Irish Times</i>in December 2006, was regarded by many as being as heretical as Martin Luther nailing his theses to the great west door of the Wittenberg cathedral.</p></speech>

Decisions are made on the recommendations of planning officials who adjudicate on particular applications, after which members of the planning committee vote on whether to grant permission, development control of the function of the council as well as the zoning of land.  It is not unusual for councils to be responsible for the zoning of land, and I have no problem with it.  My problem is that many of those decisions were taken at the behest of developers, landowners or speculators who were in business at the time.  The former chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, Mr. John O'Connor, who subsequently went on to chair the Pyrites Resolution Board, drew attention to it at the end of his term of office saying:<blockquote><br /><br />By law, development should be led by democratic plans but during the boom period developers and vested interests had undue influence on plan making.  Developers had little regard for statutory development plans in buying land and designing schemes.  Banks ignored planning parameters in lending, local authorities failed to vindicate their own development plans and An Bord Plean&aacute;la has had to refuse or amend many poor quality development plans on appeal.  Land values were subverted as well.</blockquote>He went on to say that councillors and management succumbed to development pressures.  The notion was that everywhere should be developed.  Local authorities failed to send the right signals to developers.  There were conflicts between management and planners within local authorities, minimal involvement in planning decisions by local authority architects and An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decisions frequently went unheeded by developers.  I would be more than willing to provide a copy of this to the members.</p></speech>

The entire area would be designated for development and compulsorily acquired by the local authority.  A master plan would be done for the entire development, and then the land would be parcelled up and made available for development.</p></speech>

I think that banks and developers were working hand in glove in seeking out sites for development.  A lot of the stuff one hears is apocryphal, of meetings between fellows playing golf and all the rest of it, saying: "Oh God, I saw that site in such and such a place.  It's up for sale.  Maybe you should go and by it."  They would say that to one of their developer clients and that was quite common.  Frequently, it would be the developers who would spot the potential of a site, but frequently, because the banks became so involved in property development and lending funds for that, they had a brace of clients.  Each bank had a series of major developer clients.  Without naming any particular bank, I think it is very well known that this was the case.</p></speech>

Mr. McDonald is very welcome and I thank him for coming in to us.  May I start by asking him about the Kenny report of 1974, which was the committee on the price of building land?  Mr. McDonald refers to it in his book, <i>The Builders</i>, co-authored with Kathy Sheridan.  Can he advise the committee what the central recommendation of the Kenny report was, and what impact does he believe it would have had if it were implemented?</p></speech>

I think that what happened during the boom period was particularly difficult for councillors, however, because of the frenzy element involved in it on the part of landowners, particularly towards the end of the boom.  Before it became clear that it was the end of the boom, if the Deputy gets my drift, landowners in other parts of Leinster, far outside Dublin, were frantic to have their land rezoned.  Where local area plans were being done for villages in Laois, Monaghan or wherever, this was happening on a widespread basis.  Decisions were being made that were totally irrational from a planning point of view, but which satisfied the urge of the landowners in question to make a huge killing on the sale of land for its speculative value as development land.</p></speech>

The amended planning Act introduced in 2010 essentially required local authorities to justify their planning decisions.  In other words, they had to show cause why particular pieces of land were being zoned and not other pieces of land or whatever.  More control was introduced by the legislation over of the excessive zoning of land that took place in the past.  In other words, zoning had to be driven by need rather than the wish of particular landowners to make a profit, or a killing.</p></speech>

Does Mr. McDonald have any comment to make on the extent of cases where planners would have been overruled by their own management, for example, on cases where An Bord Plean&aacute;la would have reversed the decisions of the planners of local authorities and on cases where An Bord Plean&aacute;la would have decided against its own inspector's report where the inspector would have viewed the site but would have been overruled by the board which could not have had such an intimate knowledge?

An Bord Plean&aacute;la acted, in many ways, as a last line of defence against excessive zoning and I would say, in some cases, crazy planning proposals.  I am talking about skyscrapers, 37 storey towers in Ballsbridge and all the rest of it.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la did not go for that and did not see that those decisions were justified.  In some cases, the board would overrule the report of an inspector.  That happens but, in most cases, the board at least attempts to justify why it is making a decision which was not particularly recommended by the planning inspector who dealt with the case.  I suppose one could not expect that the planning inspectors would, in effect, have a monopoly on wisdom either.  The board could take a more considered view or might give more weight to particular Government policies, with national policy overriding whatever reservations one might have about a particular scheme in that if it complied with national policy, the board would be inclined to grant permission for it.  I am thinking of wind farms, for example, which might be very unpopular locally but the board would say that, on balance, because of national policy to encourage renewable energy, it should grant planning permission for the wind farm.</p></speech>

In the Ireland in which I grew up, the maximum a bank would have lent one would have been two and half times one's salary or whatever.  That was very much an issue of prudence.  The banks were being prudent by not over-lending to people.  In France, for example, it is against the law to lend people more money than they can afford to repay.  That is one of the reasons the French banks did not collapse in the way ours nearly did, without the injection of massive sums of money by the State.</p></speech>

My personal belief, as I said in my statement, is that there was such a large constituency of people who benefited from the tax incentives that, in itself, led to a lot of lobbying.  Whenever there was a danger that the incentives would be phased out, there was heavy pressure brought to bear on the Government by the construction industry to continue the incentives for as long as possible and to roll them over.  There were multimillionaires in this country who were property investors and who ended up paying hardly any tax at all because they were availing of so many incentives, including section 23, multi-storey car parks, hotels, student housing and so on.  I think they had the ear of Government.  That is my impression.  The construction industry realised the boomtime could only be sustained if the tax incentives were sustained because otherwise, how could people have thought it was good value to buy a two bedroom flat for &euro;450,000 if it was not for the fact that they were able to write all of that off against their tax liability?  That is what made the difference in terms of the viability of a particular investment.</p></speech>

Following on from questions Deputy McGrath asked in relation to the tax reliefs, Mr. McDonald stated in his opening statement that section 23 was justifiably introduced at the end of the 1980s.  In his view, were any of the other reliefs justifiably introduced at the start?  He pointed out, as did other witnesses, that they were extended for too long but were any of the other reliefs justifiable in terms of their initial introduction?</p></speech>

I would have to be really convinced about that.  I do not believe they were.  I am thinking, for example, of the seaside resorts tax incentive scheme.  What happened was that vast townlands became designated areas.  The area around Courtown in County Wexford, for example, which included Riverchapel and a vast area, was designated and anything built in that area qualified for the tax incentives, in particular holiday homes.</p><p> The real problem with the scheme was that if the aim was to rejuvenate rundown seaside resorts like Enniscrone, Lahinch or Courtown then the incentives should have been restricted to things such as all-weather playing facilities, swimming pools or other such major elements that would have added value to those places.  However, once housing was included as a qualifying category it then ate up the vast bulk of the tax incentives available.  Something like 85% of all the investment leveraged by that tax incentive scheme consisted of houses.  In effect, those houses were three quarter scale.  The great trick of that tax incentive scheme was to persuade people who lived in semi-detached houses in the suburbs to spend their holidays in semi-detached houses, of a lesser scale, in one of the designated areas.  I do not think it was justified to that extent.  If housing had not been included as a qualifying category the scheme might have been very beneficial.</p></speech>

I believe that was a fatally flawed decision which had the effect, from 1978 onwards, of undermining what little authority the local authorities had.  That is still the case today.  An alternative method of funding from the road tax was unsatisfactory.  We now have the local property tax but it is different in that it is collected by the Revenue Commissioners rather than by local authorities.  I have always believed in the old saying, "There can be no taxation without representation" and the reverse of that is also true - there can be no representation  without taxation.  Local authorities should have tax powers.  They do not have that.  Revenue is collecting the money from the local property tax, so the direct relationship which should exist between the citizen and his or her local authority is undermined by Revenue's involvement.</p></speech>

The media were leaving themselves open to the accusation they were cheerleaders for the property bubble, not least because of revenue they were earning from it.  In defence of <i>The Irish Times</i>, I would point out that it not only published Morgan Kelly's Cassandra-like article in December 2006, but it also drew attention to the downsides of all of this in other sections of the newspaper.  Kathy Sheridan and I did a series on the commuter counties about people having to get up at 6 a.m., get on the road by 7 a.m. and all the rest of it, if they were to get to work in Dublin by 8.30 a.m.  I do not think it is fair to say that the media were uncritical of what was going on.

We had Dr. Peter Bacon in with the committee last week.  He is the author of some very well known reports on the housing sector.  He is of the view that the property market in Ireland was too much dominated by internal forces.  He expressed strongly the view there were not enough publicly rated companies involved in funding the property sector and there was not enough investment in the property sector from outside the island of Ireland.  Does the witness share Dr. Bacon's views on that?   Does he think a broader base of investment might have had a different impact on the direction of the property sector in Ireland?</p></speech>

In his book <i>The Builders</i>, co-authored with Kathy Sheridan, the witness details the careers of many of the largest developers and builders in Ireland prior to the crisis.  Can the witness outline briefly how he would describe their approach to business? Does he believe that their entrepreneurial approach had an impact on the subsequent boom in prices and the difficulties which arose from that?</p></speech>

There is nothing wrong with that and we should not be surprised about it.  That is what they do.  There is no point in building something for sale unless one can get a good price for it and make a profit in the process.  That is the basis of the system we have and the developers operated it.</p><p>Again, they had an unlimited supply of credit available to them.  If they wanted to buy a site for &euro;10 million or whatever, it was no problem to them to get the money from the bank.  Every acquisition was funded separately, sometimes even by a consortium of banks.  The determination would be there then to secure the maximum amount of development on that particular site, so that one ended up with these vast schemes such as the Beacon South Quarter and other places like it.  It was like little pieces of Los Angeles were appearing in south Dublin.  One was left wondering what on earth was going on.</p></speech>

The warning seen at the end of some advertisements for financial products which says "Markets may go down as well as up" was forgotten during the boom.  Developers forgot it, too.  A massively overpriced asset did not seem massively overpriced to them at the time because they were all caught up in this belief that everything was onwards and upwards.  That was the risk.</p></speech>

In some cases, as I mentioned, more land was being zoned than would be needed for decades.  That is to say, so much land was being zoned that it would take decades to develop it all.  Yet, the plan-making period was supposed to be five years.  Every development plan has a life of five years, so all that should have been zoned was sufficient land to cover that five-year period, perhaps with a possible 20% extra as a landbank in case it was needed.  What was happening, however, was that massive amounts of land were being zoned for development in different parts of the country, particularly in Leinster, because councillors were under pressure from landowners to get their particular parcel zoned for development so they could make the money and go.</p></speech>

The construction industry, in particular, is very well connected, not just with the present Government but also with previous Governments, and very well able to lobby politicians and all the rest of it.  To give an example, there was a case some years ago where the then Government had the option of introducing higher energy performance rating requirements for houses and higher energy performance standards in general.  That initiative was deferred, as a result of which approximately a quarter of a million houses were built during the boom period which have the most woeful energy performance and will all now have to be retrofitted.  The reason that happened, as an FOI request to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government revealed, was that the building regulations were going to have to be changed.  It was going to happen sooner rather than later due to the targets set under the Kyoto Protocol on climate change.  However, the memo went on to say, "We don't want to signal this to the outside world just yet because the next leap in building standard insulation will probably involve making it difficult for the hollow block construction used widely in the Dublin area to survive".  What is that except playing to a vested interest?  So what if there were guys making hollow concrete blocks in Dublin?  They can do something else.  Why was it regarded as being so important that this particular sector be protected?  These guys were building crap houses.</p><p>Let us be clear about that.  These houses were rubbish, from an energy performance point of view, and yet the Department of the environment allowed it to go on and on.  It was only in recent years that we finally caught up with the idea that we needed to have higher energy performance in housing, so that people do not have to spend so much money on fuel and all the rest, and we can cut down emissions.</p></speech>

People were being lent much more money than they could afford to repay which is, by definition, sub-prime.  That is what lay at the heart of the matter.</p> <p>  When we first got the warning signals from the United States, with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and whatever else all basically falling apart as a result of irresponsible lending, in effect the writing was on the wall.  Except that here we were in denial that this was, in effect, what was happening - that money was being lent, on an unlimited basis, for overpriced assets.</p></speech>

In a lot of cases, the checks and balance within the system was that the Department did not provide funding for water and-or water and sewerage.</p></speech>

For example, I was astonished to discover recently that if one wanted to convert a Georgian house in Merrion Square from office use to residential use by, say, putting in five flats or one flat per floor, that one would have to pay a development levy to Dublin City Council of &euro;60,000.  That is when one is doing something that is clearly in the public interest.  It is clearly in the public interest that the Georgian squares of Dublin, on the southside in particular, should be returned to residential use, to the greatest possible extent.  Yet the local authority was screwing the developers who were planning to do so.</p></speech>

If the Department or local authority were dissatisfied with a zoning there was another method in which the funding was not provided.</p></speech>

What more particularly happened was that eventually a Minister for the Environment decided to avail of the powers that he had, to call in a draft local area plan, county plan or whatever for review by the Department and that started happening.  I think it was in 2003 or 2004.  It was the first time that the power was actually used.  If I am not mistaken, I think it was by Dick Roche, then also by his successor, John Gormley, and that was pretty much it.  That was a check and balance, if one likes.</p></speech>

I would defend it on the basis that it makes for a more compact urban environment than we would have otherwise.  If we were to build at the rate of eight to ten houses per acre, which used to be standard in the past, we would have housing everywhere.  There was a strong argument for higher densities.  That does not mean high rise; it just means building to a higher density than we were used to in the past.  It sustains local services.  If one has-----</p></speech>

There is still a belief that people have a right to do whatever they like with their own land.  They ask who these planners are to come and tell them that they cannot.  That is a particularly prevalent and deep-rooted view that exists pretty much right across the country.  That makes it very difficult for planners to point us in a more rational direction.  If there is not a consensus on the need for planning - planning essentially involves making tough decisions about what we are going to do and what we are not going to do - it is an issue.  We are not used to being told we cannot do things.  We do not want to be told we cannot do things; we want to be told we can and that, if one has a half-acre site, of course one will get planning permission to build on it.  That is why we have 500,000 houses all over the countryside in Ireland.</p></speech>

He wrote a series of articles at that time referring to Dublin county.  The headline of one of those articles alludes to "where it is possible to boost the value of parcels of land beyond the dreams of avarice", and another headline reads, "Cash in brown paper bags for councillors".  In that series of articles, Mr. McDonald termed the 72-member Dublin County Council as a rezoning coalition.  What did he mean by that?</p></speech>

I am not saying that Labour was consistently against zoning land.  In fact, there were several cases where they supported in some cases even controversial zonings.  There was a presumption in favour of development in that chamber.  I do not believe that there is any doubt about that and whatever the developers or the landowners wanted to do was, in general, facilitated.</p></speech>

It goes back to the point that I made that there was a presumption in favour of development everywhere and I would say that that applied with knobs on in cases where the local authorities were populated by people from the property sector who immediately understood why a particular piece of land should be zoned or not, as the case may be.</p></speech>

Professional planners were much less enthusiastic about the wilder aspects of development than county managers were.  In counties that had a perception of themselves as having not done terribly well in the past that was their chance to improve their lot, as it were.  In some cases, indeed in many cases, the recommendations of professional planners were overturned by county managers.  In fact, I know of one county manager who said, "Do not be giving me reports recommending refusals."</p></speech>

Not just that but also other stuff as well but the substance of the allegations were never examined in those inquiries that took place.  That is the problem.  There was an unwillingness to face up to the maladministration and worse that took place in various counties that were named and were the subject of so-called investigations.  The investigations were not actual investigations in the sense that there was no determination to find out what really went on.  For example, the people who were making the allegations were never interviewed.</p></speech>

In the past it was certainly true that connections were used to arrange for State tenants.  In other words, a developer, before embarking on a particular office block, for example, would already have lined up a semi-State company or a branch of the Civil Service to occupy the building, which then made it a complete blue chip or a no fail investment.</p></speech>

If one was working for, say, Dublin City Council and one had grave reservations about what was going on in the council chamber, what could one have done?  Planners and other public servants would have tipped us off about things coming up because they were so appalled by what was going on.  I am delighted they did this.  It is very gratifying to know that there are public servants who are concerned about the public interest and the public interest being subverted to serve private interests and profit.  It was very dispiriting for the planners, in particular in County Dublin but elsewhere also.  They saw rational planning being thrown out the window for the cause of somebody or other who owned a particular parcel of land to make a few bob.</p></speech>

In fact, Dr. Elaine Byrne records that the secretary in the President's office was quite cross about this.  Was it an own goal by Mr. Justice Kenny?  I have never seen a report stating that if one is worried that what is being recommended is unconstitutional, one should ask the President to refer it.  If one is in a favour of something, one leaves it up to the President to decide.</p></speech>

I think &euro;1.9 million was paid in 1989 because planning permission had been refused.  That meant the officials in the council had to undertake the rezoning which Mr. McDonald strongly and rightly criticised.  I am trying to think of an analogy.  If people apply to get into medical school but do not get in, they do not have a right to compensation from the dean of the medical school.  How did this arise in the property market?</p></speech>

It was built into the 1963 Act.  I think it was in it to vindicate the property rights people had under the Constitution in order that if a local authority refused planning permission for a development, one could sue it for compensation on the basis that it had devalued one's property.  There were several notorious cases where a case would then go to the State property arbitrator and the decision would either be upheld or the amount of money involved would be reduced.  There are several very good examples of where this happened, about which Senator can find out.</p></speech>

There was an incentive for them to grant planning permission because they would get, say, &euro;60,000 or &euro;200,000 in development levies in return.  It became one of their major money-spinners during the boom period.  Many of these levies, as we now know, were not paid, however, because the market had collapsed and the developers had gone to the wall or whatever.</p> <p>  It was not just development levies.  The other factor that played a crucial role in determining whether something was permitted or not was the long-term benefit to the council of the rates revenue that a development could generate.  For example, every shop in the huge complex of Dundrum Town Centre is paying rates to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  The council, not surprisingly, facilitated that scheme even though it contributed to the death of the Main Street in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</p></speech>

Every Friday, there would be a huge supplement with loads of ads for jobs for chief executives and God knows what else.  Every Thursday, one would have the property supplement.  At one stage, <i>The Irish Times</i>property supplement was so large it was in two sections.  There was a 12-page opening section and then a 48-page follow-up section as there was so much going on.  It became a major revenue earner for the media, including <i>The Irish Times</i>.  As I said, whatever about perceptions of this leading to a cheerleader situation for the property boom, we were offsetting any such perception by carrying relatively critical pieces about how Dublin was developing and other issues that were the downsides of the boom.</p></speech>

Some years there was a 20% increase in property values, etc.  Naturally, for anyone trying to get on to the ladder, as it became known, that would have induced almost a sense of panic.  First-time buyers were panicked into buying at ridiculously inflated asset values like &euro;450,000 for a two-bedroom flat for example.  One of the problems we have in this country - it was certainly the case during the boom - is that we accept far too many things as normal that are not normal.</p></speech>

The purpose of this inquiry is not just to look at the past but to look into the future and see what lessons can be drawn.  With regard to my earlier engagement about how the planning laws deal with one-off housing, it is commonly noted that the Irish people have a love affair with property.  There is a high percentage of home ownership compared to other similar countries.  Was that the case and does it still hold despite the crash?  Given that this is in our DNA, to use the term Mr. McDonald used earlier, how might this be responded to best to protect the public interest in the future?</p></speech>

One of the nicest letters I ever received was from the EBS saying that my loan was paid off.  That happened two years ago and I thought that it could not be happening at a better time.  The devotion to the idea of property ownership is related to the cultural and historical legacy of Ireland, and history of dispossession and fear of dispossession, which is something that makes the rental market such a minority thing.  It is quite normal in Switzerland, Germany and other continental countries for people to rent rather than buy because it is more convenient for them and they do not fear being thrown onto the street.  Here, there is a fear that people have no security if they rent so they need to buy.  As to what can be done about it, we are talking about a cultural shift, which takes time.</p></speech>

The second session will start at about 11.30; we have moved the time back a bit.  In that session we will hear from Dr. John Holmes on the general scheme of the public health (alcohol) Bill.</p> <p>  I apologise to our witnesses for the delay in beginning.  We held our first meeting last Thursday on the cost of prescription drugs and pharmaceuticals in Ireland.  The stakeholders at that session included representatives from the IPU and the pharmaceutical industry.  We also heard from Professor Colum Dunne from UL.  A number of issues were raised concerning negotiations between the pharmaceutical industry, the HSE and the Government, which we want to revisit this morning.  I thank Mr. John Hennessy, Mr. Shaun Flanagan, Mr. Paddy Burke, Professor Michael Barry, Mr. Fergal Goodman and Ms Teresa Cody for attending today.  I also thank Mr. Ray Mitchell for his co-operation and assistance in organising this meeting.</p> <p>  In private session the committee discussed the fact that Alexion has twice declined our invitation to appear before the committee.  The committee has agreed to publish the correspondence with Alexion.  On your behalf I express disappointment and regret that its representatives did not appear.</p> <p>  I remind people to turn off their mobile phones, as they interfere with the broadcasting of the proceedings.</p> <p>  I remind people of the position on privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or any official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I ask members to keep to the time limit, which I believe is seven minutes, as we have two busy meetings.</p></speech>

I am assistant secretary in the primary care division in the Department of Health.  I am accompanied by my colleague Ms Teresa Cody, principal officer, primary care unit, and her colleague Emma Jane Morgan, who is assistant principal in the unit, is behind us.</p> <p>  Among the significant factors that come into play when we discuss the cost of pharmaceutical drugs is the demographic trend, which has a significant effect on consumption of the drugs and the cost drivers.  Population growth in Ireland in the earlier part of this century outstripped that of Europe as a whole.  Ireland&rsquo;s population is still increasing, although now at rates similar to the EU average.  There was 21% growth in the 65-and-over population between 2006 and 2013, and growth in the older age groups will continue at this order of magnitude in the years to come.  In particular, the cohort of people aged over 80 is increasing by about 4% a year and, of course, they are high users of all health services.  By 2021, the population over the age of 65 will have increased by close to 40% since 2011, representing an additional 200,000 people.</p> <p>  Life expectancy has increased substantially in recent years.  Between 2002 and 2012, male life expectancy at birth increased by 3.7 years, and is now at 78.7.  For women it increased by almost three years in the preceding decade and is now above 83.  Much of this is obviously attributable to advances in medical science and in the treatments available, including drug treatments.  As well as bringing very clear benefits to individuals and to society generally, increased life expectancy means that as people live longer, they are likely to do so with an increasing burden of chronic disease and increasing dependency on health services.  Despite the success of policies aimed at controlling drug costs, we need to continue the efforts to maximise the benefit to individuals and society of the medicines used in Ireland in a way that is affordable.</p> <p>  This is the backdrop against which the cost of drugs and medicines has been under intense scrutiny in recent years.  This has not only been highlighted at Government level, but it was also a significant issue for the troika during the bailout period.  The Department and the HSE have played a significant part in delivering this reform.  This has achieved benefits for the Exchequer and has assisted in managing the pressures on the very constrained health budget in recent years.  It has also brought benefits to patients in terms of facilitating the adoption of innovative new drugs and in substantially reducing the prices that people pay across the counter in the pharmacies.</p><p> I will outline some of the key policy developments that have resulted in reductions in the price of thousands of medicines.  Price reductions of the order of 30% per item reimbursed have been achieved between 2009 and 2013.  The average cost per item reimbursed is now running at 2001 to 2002 levels.</p><p> As the committee will be aware, we have had a series of agreements with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Ireland, APMI, representatives of which the committee met last week.  The agreements in 2006 generated savings in the region of &euro;250 million, and a further &euro;250 million in savings flowed from the subsequent agreements in 2010 and 2011.  The current agreement was negotiated in 2012, and that had a value in excess of &euro;400 million in the period up to 2015.  It expires, as members will be aware, at the end of October this year.  In broad terms, about half the financial value of the deal relates to reductions in the cost of patent and off-patent drugs, while the other half, or &euro;210 million, is related to the State securing the provision of new and innovative drugs.  Also in 2012, a new agreement was reached with the APMI which significantly reduced the maximum price paid for generic products.  That price was further reduced by agreement in 2014, with the result that the price differential between off-patent drugs and most generic equivalents increased from 5% to approximately 20%.  Taking these agreements together, we estimate that cumulative savings in excess of &euro;1.5 billion have been achieved in the nine years since 2006.</p><p> On generic substitution and reference pricing, members will be aware of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  This important legislation provided for the introduction, on a statutory basis, of generic substitution and reference pricing and brought about significant structural change to the system of pricing and reimbursement of medicines.  The introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing promotes price competition among suppliers and ensures that lower prices are paid for these medicines.  Generic substitution allows pharmacists to substitute a cheaper generic equivalent, at the patient's request, when a more expensive product has been prescribed.  Generic medicines are as safe and efficacious as proprietary products and are subject to the same requirements of quality, safety and efficacy.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, has responsibility for the designation of interchangeable medicines under the Act.</p><p> Under the 2013 Act the HSE is responsible for reference pricing, which involves setting a common reimbursement amount for designated interchangeable groups of medicines.  Only the reference price is reimbursed by the State, thus incentivising the patient to opt for a generic medicine at or below the reference price.  Reference pricing coupled with generic substitution therefore provides patients with an incentive to opt for the cheapest available product but does not impose unavoidable additional costs on patients.  Generic substitution has been introduced incrementally, with the HPRA prioritising those medicines which will achieve the greatest savings for patients and the State.  This process will continue until all relevant items on the reimbursable lists have been assessed.  Reference pricing has also been successfully introduced, with the price of many products being substantially reduced from previous levels.</p><p> The impact of this legislation has been positive in terms of increasing the level of generic penetration in the Irish market.  As part of the troika commitments, a target for generic penetration of the off-patent market by volume was set at 70% by 2016.  The target to be achieved by the end of 2015 was 65% and 70% by the end of 2016.  However, by quarter four of 2014, generics already accounted for approximately 68% of the total off-patent market, so the target set for the end of 2015 has been already exceeded.</p><p> The recent European Commission staff working document on Ireland acknowledged the substantial cost savings that have been made by the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing.  Reference pricing was expected to deliver savings in the region of &euro;50 million in 2014, which is retrospective at this stage, and a further &euro;25 million in the current year.  The Act of 2013 also improved and updated the statutory basis for the supply of medicines and other prescribed items under the general medical services, GMS, and community drugs schemes.</p><p> Other important initiatives, on which members can hear more from colleagues - including Professor Michael Barry, who is here with us - include the establishment of the medicine management programme, which has a focus on cost-effective prescribing and a reduction in drug expenditure through more rational prescribing.</p><p> The measures I have briefly outlined - I will keep this brief, as it is a technical area - have been instrumental to achieving the significant savings required in this sector in recent years.  That said, the State still continues to face upward pressure on the drugs bill.  This is due to a range of factors, including the demographic trends to which I referred, the significant increase in recent years in number eligible for the GMS and community drugs schemes, and the desire on the part of clinicians, patients and the public generally to have access to the newest and most innovative medicines, with the associated high costs. </p><p> In order to ensure that funding is available to enable patients to have access to new and innovative drugs, it is necessary to continue to pursue savings and efficiencies in expenditure in this area.  The Minister&rsquo;s and the HSE&rsquo;s preference is for these additional savings to be delivered in co-operation with the pharmaceutical industry, so long as it enables the needs of all parties to be met.  However,  I note that section 21 of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 affords the HSE powers to review and alter prices.  This is an option that is open to HSE to exercise in the event that agreed approaches are not capable of meeting the funding pressures that the HSE faces in regard to drugs. </p><p> The Department and the HSE, with a strong level of commitment, most of which precedes my time in my current role, have successfully implemented a range of policy measures, which I have outlined.  Colleagues from the HSE will be able to provide further detail, but it is clear that significant cost savings have already been delivered for the Exchequer, resulted particularly in reduced prices being paid by the public. Given the substantial cost pressures that the health service will continue to face in the coming years, this is an agenda we will continue to pursue in many ways in order to further reduce the cost and ensure the affordability of medicines for the State and for patients.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to attend today to discuss the cost of pharmaceuticals.</p> <p>  We welcome the opportunity to outline the progress that has been made with regard to the price of medicines in Ireland during recent years.  I am joined by my colleagues Mr. Shaun Flanagan, chief pharmacist, Mr. Patrick Burke, assistant national director, and Professor Michael Barry, chief pharmacologist at St. James's Hospital and head of the HSE medicines management programme.</p> <p>  The HSE provides reimbursement support for medicines and appliances across three main community drugs schemes &ndash; the general medical services scheme, or the medical card scheme, the long-term illness scheme, and the drugs payment scheme.  Additionally, arrangements are in place for the supply of hospital-initiated high-tech medicines through the community pharmacy contractor network of approximately 1,800 pharmacies covering the country and a population of approximately 4.6 million people.  It should be noted that the HSE does not set the prices that pharmacists charge to patients on private prescriptions, but only becomes involved when a claim is made under one or other of the aforementioned community drug schemes.  For example, it does not cover patients who pay less than &euro;144 per month and are not covered under either the GMS scheme or the long-term illness scheme.</p> <p>  In terms of current expenditure, the HSE reimbursed the following amounts in 2014 on medicines and appliances across those three main schemes and in the high-tech medicines area. The expenditure covered the ex-factory price of &euro;1.3 billion, wholesale mark-up costs of &euro;107 million, pharmacy fees of &euro;379 million and VAT of &euro;115 million, giving an overall total expenditure of &euro;1.92 billion.  Those figures cover reimbursement claims for medicines and appliances dispensed in 2014, involving approximately 70 million separate prescription items.  Aggregate spending on the GMS scheme, the drugs payment scheme and long-term illness scheme has decreased since 2009 despite the growth in numbers, changes in eligibility during that period and the introduction of more expensive new medicines such as new oral anticoagulants.  This is due to a sustained and ongoing programme of price reductions, on which I hope to elaborate during the course of my presentation.  The exception in that respect is expenditure on high-tech medicines, which has increased from &euro;315 million in 2009 to &euro;485 million in 2014.  This is as a consequence of the introduction of some highly expensive new drugs and medicines and increased use of some existing products.</p> <p>  With regard to price reductions, expenditure on reimbursed medicines has remained stable between 2009 and 2014 despite the introduction of that range of new medicines.  The average price of an item dispensed on the GMS scheme has decreased to below the price paid in 2002, and the average long-term illness scheme price is less than the price paid in 2000.</p><p>Detailed information on that is outlined in appendix 3 to the information pack that has been made available to members.  Details of the list of actions taken to achieve those reductions are also available.  The price reductions have resulted in savings and cost avoidance for the State, amounting to &euro;1.5 billion over the period in question.  A significant proportion of the money saved has been invested in new medicines for Irish patients.</p><p> The focus on savings has been concentrated in three key areas, the first of which is new patented medicines.  The maximum price a company can seek when it applies for reimbursement for a new patented medicine is the average of the approved prices across nine EU member states, as detailed in the 2012 Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association agreement.  Those member states are listed in the document.  The 2012 agreement also required companies to submit an evidence dossier containing clinical and economic data in support of reimbursement at the price applied for.  This was subsequently underpinned by the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which my colleague Mr. Goodman mentioned.  The 2013 Act requires the HSE to consider detailed criteria, as outlined in appendix 5 of the information document, when making decisions.  The net effect is that companies must provide robust evidence to justify the price of every new patented medicine.  Company dossiers are evaluated by technical staff at the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, which is based on the campus of St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and headed by Professor Barry, who is in attendance this morning.  Summaries of all the evaluations carried out are publicly available on the website.</p><p> Under the 2012 agreement, a medicine that satisfies a cost-effectiveness threshold of &euro;45,000 per quality-adjusted life year progresses to reimbursement.  In exceptional cases, medicines are considered for reimbursement above the threshold, subject to meaningful negotiations having been concluded.  The HSE has been increasingly faced with what individual companies consider are exceptional medicines and increasing expectations that the State will be in a position to reimburse medicines which in no way approach any conventional understanding of cost-effectiveness.  In such cases, the HSE, like pretty much every other health care system worldwide, is faced with a difficult decision on whether to fund a medicine which the company dossier has demonstrated is not an economic use of resources.  The HSE would like to be in a position to reimburse all medicines, but that is not possible given the competing demands for resources.  Members will remember that the director general of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien, recently appealed to Alexion Pharmaceuticals to reconsider the price it charges for eculizumab, or Soliris.  The HSE's national drugs committee considers all the evidence provided and issues its advice on the basis of pricing offers made by companies and in light of the degree of unmet need, clinical evidence, cost-effectiveness, budget impact and any other relevant factors regarding whether the medicine should be reimbursed.</p><p> The second area of focus for control is the off-patent medicines sector, which has also been the subject of a series of downward price revisions under national agreements.  When they are launched, generic medicines are now required to be 60% lower in price than the pre-patent expiry price of the branded product.  The first reference prices were set on 1 November 2013.  As of January of this year, the HSE has set reference prices for 110 interchangeable groups across 37 medicine combinations.  It is now reimbursing approximately 1.5 million items per month in relation to reference-priced medicines.  The aim in setting reference prices is to achieve the lowest possible price commensurate with continuity of supply.  The industry has consistently claimed the HSE is setting its prices too low.  On the other hand, some commentators would contend that our prices are still too high.  We believe the decisions taken to date are proportionate and reasonable, and are consistent with continuity of supply and the policy of reducing Irish prices to acceptable levels.  This project is ongoing.</p><p> The third main area of control is the HSE medicines management programme, which is headed by Professor Barry and was established in January 2013 with the aim of enhancing safe, effective and cost-effective prescribing of medicines in the Irish health care setting.  The details of the programme's wide range of ongoing activities are outlined in appendix 9 of the information pack.  One of the main ways the programme communicates with prescribers is through a series of meetings with general practitioners.  These meetings are held across the country in collaboration with the Irish College of General Practitioners, which invites the programme to make presentations on prescribing issues.  This has proven to be an extremely valuable way of getting key messages across to prescribers.  The programme has met more than 1,100 general practitioners over the past 18 months.</p><p> I would like to comment on the impact of these measures.  The HSE and the State have benefited from price reductions on new medicines and are regularly paying lower prices than companies would have applied for or indeed would wish.  Our most recent audit revealed that Irish prices are now at the average of the nine-country basket and are close to the average price of a wider group of EU member states.  However, Irish prices are still above the average calculated across the full 28 EU member states when the more recent entrants from Eastern Europe are included.  In the off-patent category, I should point out that when the 2013 Act was introduced, the HSE was reimbursing in excess of &euro;22 million per month on medicines reference-priced in 2014, but by December 2014 this amount had been reduced to &euro;10.3 million per month.  Savings of &euro;47.4 million were achieved in 2014 from reference pricing alone.  The full-year impact of that will amount to &euro;60 million.  This is of course ongoing.  The cost of reference-priced drugs now is between 70% and 80% lower than the price paid when medicines were on patent.  As of the final quarter of last year, generics now account for 68% of reimbursed claims.</p><p> The HSE is continuing with reference pricing.  We expect to deliver in excess of &euro;25 million in additional reference-priced savings in 2015.  The HSE has been successful in providing access to many new medicines while reducing the prices of new and existing products.  The figures speak for themselves.  Savings of &euro;1.5 billion have been achieved to date in this complex area.  Members will understand that the various stakeholders involved will try to protect and defend what they have and resist changes that may reduce their incomes.  We remain committed to ensuring pricing in Ireland is reasonable and fair.  We want to provide access to as many new medicines as possible from within the resources available to us.  At all times, our concern is to ensure continuity of supply and avoid causing additional co-payments for patients when making pricing decisions.  My colleagues and I will endeavour to answer any questions that members may have.</p></speech>

We acknowledge and welcome the improvements that have been made in terms of value for the taxpayer when medicines are being purchased on behalf of the State.  It is obvious that demographic factors will present huge challenges from now on.  The witnesses mentioned the increase in life expectancy and the improvement in the treatment of chronic diseases.  We are probably slow to address some of the issues that will lead to an increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases in the years ahead.  Obesity and smoking will lead to an increase in diabetes, heart conditions and smoking-related illnesses.  We are making efforts, but maybe we are not gaining as much ground as we would like.  High-tech medicines that are tailor-made for small cohorts of people are also becoming more prevalent.  There will be huge pressures in the years ahead.</p> <p>  I would like to take a slightly historical view of these issues for a moment to help me to get my head around them.  I applaud the HSE and everyone else responsible for the progress that has been made.  The 2006 reductions agreement generated savings of approximately &euro;250 million.  A further &euro;250 million in savings was generated by agreements reached in 2010 and 2011.  That leads me to believe there was a great deal of fat in the system.  Perhaps the question I will ask in that context will be asked by another Oireachtas committee at some stage.  Was there that much fat in the system because of a lack of political will, or because appropriate mechanisms were not in place?  Was the State being jockeyed by the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland on a constant basis in terms of the cost of available medicines?  What allowed the HSE to reduce the price of medicines to the State by such an enormous amount in such a short period?</p><p>Was it lack of regulation or lack of legislation?  Was it the comparators with the nine European countries in the basket?  Was it lack of political will or was it just the inability of the State to negotiate?  One would have to say that the savings made suggest that there was a poor negotiating stance in the first place.  I am not making a statement of fact but just inquiring on that issue.<br/><br/>The other area that is of concern to me, if I have understood correctly, is that if a company applies for reimbursement of its on patent new drug, the nine European countries are used as a basket.  If the drug is not available in those nine European countries, is it correct that it is to a minimum of three countries?  Is there huge potential for companies to manipulate the price?  Let us be very clear, if there are nine countries, there is a better chance that there will be an average, but if a company is going to make its drug available and knows that the price is going to be based on three countries, it will obviously make it available to the dear ones first and work out from that.  Is there not a huge flaw in the system there in terms of pricing?  The average will always come from the highest down as opposed to from the other way up or from the middle.  I would like further clarity on that.  If that is the case, who decides, first and foremost, the basket of countries and who decides which three countries the medicine will be made available in first?  It is obvious it will be the companies.  There is quite a weak area in the mechanism of adjudication of the price.  Is that a regulatory matter for the European Union or is it a State matter?  Where do we go in terms of trying to address that weakness in pricing?<br/><br/>As an aside to Mr. Flanagan on Soliris for the treatment of PNH, I am led to believe that the Government, the Department or the HSE has made an announcement that Soliris will be made available to individuals with PNH but I am also led to believe it is not available yet.  Soliris has been referenced quite a number of times and reference has been made in Parliament that this issue has been resolved, but I am led to believe that it may not be resolved for the people who are waiting for it so I would like clarity on that issue.<br/><br/>I have raised this issue without saying that it is factual but there has always been a strong belief among some people that there have been sweetheart deals in this State for many years, with some drug companies in previous times being induced to invest further or locate here in the first place, perhaps by the IDA and others or through back channels, and it is obvious the reason they come here is our corporation tax rate.  We have a politically stable environment, we have a reasonably bright graduate workforce and we now have a critical mass, so I accept that there are many other factors why they are here.  However, there was always a view in the earlier part of industrial development policy that there were inducements other than the obvious attractions the State provides upfront.  Has Mr. Flanagan ever come across that particular issue or those suspicions in terms of dealing with various pharmaceutical companies and the pricing of same?<br/><br/>In terms of cross-Border and the continual fluctuations in sterling versus the euro and, in particular, how it is fluctuating now, is there any way of addressing the issue of people in the North coming South or <i>vice versa</i>when it suits or when it is more profitable?<br/><br/>I want a small bit of information on parallel wholesaling where if a drug is cheap in Ireland, it is purchased in Ireland through the wholesale system and sold into the dear countries.  Is this done by pharmacists?  We all know about the free movement of goods and services but if a product is sold to the State, one would think that it should stay in the State and not be shipped out in containers to some other country.  Is there a weakness there as well in the context of parallel wholesaling through the European Union countries?</p></speech>

The first thing to say to Mr. Goodman is there is credit due for the effort made and the fact that there have been significant reductions achieved in recent years.  I want to acknowledge that at the outset.  I put the question because there is a common view that the Department or our negotiators, whoever they may be individually, in terms of any of the manufacturing companies, are less committed to the challenge necessary to bring about the optimum reduction, particularly where the manufacturing base is located in Ireland.  There is a general conversation, which one hears in the corridors of this institution, that there is a fear that the inward investor manufacturing companies would pack up their tents and leave with a consequent loss of hundreds of jobs.  It is said regularly and across all political opinion.  Will Mr. Goodman address that to try to restore people's sense that such is not the case and that we are not being bullied into accepting less than we should?  I leave that as it stands.</p> <p>  I wish to ask Mr. Barry about other important initiatives that Mr. Goodman referred to in his contribution, one of which was more rational prescribing.  Will Mr. Barry elaborate on that because it is something that I have raised before?  I have no doubt we are all conscious, and I am conscious even in terms of my extended family, of a bathroom cabinet overflowing with unused prescribed medications.  I cannot attribute it to a particular age profile.  It is difficult to know.  I have not done any examination or exercise to try to suggest that it is particular to any age group.  We are talking about a reduction in drug expenditure through more rational prescribing and I would like Mr. Barry to advise the committee of what is being done in that case.  I mean no criticism of those in general practice but I think there is a need to ensure that prescribing practices are as required and on the basis of certainty of being used.  I will leave it at that and I appreciate what further the witnesses can tell us.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Hennessy for his contribution.  I am glad he stuck to the opening pages because it runs to many pages and it is a lot of information.  Why do we take the average of the nine EU member states?  Why do we go for the average?  Why do we not take the least expensive?  Who has determined that we must take the mean or median position across whatever number of states, even if it happens to be nine?  Why is it always that we are last?  Why would we not be first, especially when we are such a manufacturing base?</p><p>I may be corrected if I am wrong, but in respect of new patented drugs manufactured in Ireland, we were basing our cost on what it was costing in other EU member states.  Why were we not the first one determining the cost?  It follows on from what Deputy Billy Kelleher was asking earlier.  Why are we always waiting for three or more of these?  Why can we not move from the median to the lowest cost across three or up to nine other EU member states?  What do we have to do to be able to say we have a position and are firm and emphatic on it, end of story?</p><p> I am concerned about the sentence in the submission that under the 2012 IPHA agreement, where a medicine satisfied a cost-effectiveness threshold of &euro;45,000 per quality adjusted life year, the medicine progressed to reimbursement.  My sense of cost-effectiveness does not equal a threshold in terms of monetary cost alone.  Cost-effectiveness is not about a threshold of cost in euro and cent.  It takes into account the situation of the dependent patient, the need of the individual citizen, his or her circumstances and availability for work.  Where a patient is dependent, it might be that he or she could be a contributing taxpayer if he or she was able to return to work as a result of access to a prescribed medication.  I will not go on about it, but the witnesses know exactly where I am coming from in this regard.  It seems a very bald statement to refer to a cost-effectiveness threshold of &euro;45,000.  It is not what I have understood cost-effectiveness assessments should be.</p><p> On the Alexion situation, the Chairman indicated something at the outset in terms of our private meeting earlier.  This is the public opportunity.  I reaffirm what the Chairman said.  It is not lost.  I do not know if anyone in the media is taking any interest in our work here but it is important that it is noted that today we decided for the third time to write to Alexion to record our collective Government and Opposition vexation at its refusal to come before us on the cost of eculizumab, known more commonly as Soliris.  It is infuriating that a company would take such a rigid stance of refusal on the two previous occasions we have invited it to come before the committee.</p><p> I may be the person here living closest to the Border, where I was born and brought up all my life.  I am only four miles from it.  I am still meeting constituents who drive the short distance north of the Border to get their prescriptions processed.  It is still cheaper to access prescribed medications north of the Border than it is in this jurisdiction and, identifiably, to access medications and drugs that are actually manufactured in the State.  I ask the witnesses for their comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-12a.943" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015031200002#H00200"><p>Before I start, I note that I would like to meet Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in after the meeting to give him my prescription for Atorvastatin.  If one of his constituents could pick some up for me, I would be very grateful.</p><p>One of the underlying realities of pharmaco-economics is that we are working in an increasingly globalised world.  We hope that as more harmonisation of drug purchasing policy takes place in the EU, it will improve our negotiating position with the companies.  I say that with the caveat that we do not want to harmonise down to the UK level and that perhaps the German way of taking new drugs on board is more realistic.  In reality, a small economy like ours is not that important.  At a global level, if a company reckons it will completely lose sales in Ireland in acting to avoid an adverse judgment against its pricing policies, it will pay that price.  We are a tiny part of the international drug trade.  With respect to the question of sweet deals, I believe firmly and have for a long time that there is a complete lack of linkage between where international companies put their manufacturing plants and our domestic drug consumption policies.  It is all about the 12.5% corporation tax rate.  If we ever want to do the experiment to isolate the effect of the 12.5%, we should jack up the tax rate and see what happens.  It is possible, however, that companies would try to lead us to believe there were such sweet deals in an attempt to strong-arm us.  We discussed this the other day but we saw evidence of it last year or the year before when pressure was brought to bear on the Taoiseach on the issue of the approval of some drugs by companies suggesting darkly, and entirely inaccurately, that it had an influence on where companies decided to locate their manufacturing plants.  I hope that as the EU gets better at this activity, we will be part of a market force which allows us to drive a harder bargain collectively.</p><p>My second point is that the companies are now engaging in predatory pricing.  There is no way around that.  We discussed this earlier in private session, but I recap the point.  Companies are no longer basing their pricing policies on cost plus cost of failed drugs plus a reasonable profit margin.  Rather, they are using professional marketers to set the price their analysis indicates will be the maximum price the market will sustain before the demand for the drug goes down in line with the principle of price elasticity of demand.  We must understand that, unfortunately, we are getting into an adversarial position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the companies.  The western economies of the USA, Canada, the EU, Australia and others must get together to give companies signals that there are certain thresholds beyond which we will not go on the pricing of drugs.  There is an illustrative example of this.  A good friend and colleague, Dr. Lenny Saltz from Memorial Sloan Kettering, who trained with me many years ago, reacted to a very unreasonable pricing demand made for a drug called Zaltrap, a colon cancer drug.  He said that the incremental difference it made was so small compared with the standard treatment, which in truth was not that great either, that he would not pay for it.  The company heard him and the price of the drug was decreased by approximately one third in the USA.  That tells us the power of what one can do, but it also tells us that these guys are still making money at a price that is one third lower than the price at which they originally pegged the drug.  There is wriggle room on most drugs.  In fact, there is wriggle room for most.  I know of one drug which has been approved for an uncommon cancer.  The company argues that as it is uncommon, the market is not very big.  It is &euro;120,000 per annum for the drug.  The registration trial for the drug involved 100 patients, which means it did not cost that much money to develop.  It is a further example of predatory pricing.</p><p>We must make savings where we can because there are places where we cannot.  Unfortunately, our market is so small that we are not in a good position to drive hard bargains with international drug companies for expensive drugs.  I hope this problem will be addressed at a global level.  When I speak to the industry I tell them they are going to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.  In a previous generation, one could go to the US Food and Drug Administration with a drug that had a 5% survival advantage in a cancer and be reimbursed and paid for it.  That will change.  In an era when multiple drugs produce small marginal benefits, people cannot afford to pay for them all.  The industry needs to find a way to make those drugs cheaper or apply them to the smaller number of patients where the impact is greater.  What can we do?  In the short term, we have to make generics mandatory to save where we can.  I am happy to take two generic drugs, which I do.  If one wants the branded drug, one should pay for it.  If society is paying for the drug and has deemed that the generic is just as effective as the branded version, why should it be asked to pay for the more expensive one?  We need to find a way to save money on those drugs which make up the bulk of our drugs bill.  The bulk of our drugs bill does not relate to the small number of patients on high-tech drugs.  It involves the antibiotics, antidepressants and, like those I am on, cholesterol drugs many people are taking.</p><p>From a health economics point of view, we have to understand one other reality.  There is a bigger picture here.  We must look critically at how we spend money on health care.  Drugs are an easy target.  One of the reasons drugs are an easy target is that people like me who do trials with drugs generally report our results meticulously.  One can see in black and white that drug A gave a person three months and drug B gave them seven months.  Health economists can then calculate what it costs to get that additional incremental benefit.</p><p>There are many things we do in medicine which are never subjected to that kind of analysis, and which are done very inappropriately.  I will not go into all the details.  There are many operations that have limited impact.  There are many people in intensive care unit beds when it is not in their interest to be in that unit and where not only are resources not being used efficiently but also the patient's health care is not being managed appropriately from their own perspective.  In looking at figures such as the cost per quality year of life saved, it is critical that we think a little about it.</p><p> If one looks at something like cancer care, which in Ireland was historically pretty miserable and is pretty okay now, the one thing we had was good access to cancer drugs.  The last problem we needed to fix was the over-prescription of cancer drugs, because we were under-prescribing drugs.  There are countries that combat the over-prescription of cancer drugs very efficiently and they have the worst cancer survival rates of major developed countries.  The UK has one of the worst cancer survival rates of any health service of equivalent size and sophistication.  In New Zealand, no attempt is made to get most new drugs approved.  It is important that we not look at problems like cancer drugs in isolation and that we understand that they are a very easy target when attempting to contain costs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-12a.945" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015031200002#J00200"><p>While I agree with the witnesses that the cost of drugs has come down, I am still concerned.  I gave the example last week of someone who comes to my clinic in Cork.  He is in receipt of an old age pension, he does not have a medical card and he has had two heart attacks.  He travels to Northern Ireland, from Cork to Dublin to Newry, once every two months and is paying less in Northern Ireland for two months of his medication than he would for one month in Cork.  I am concerned when I hear that.  It is a genuine case where someone is slightly over the qualifying criteria for a medical card, he does not have a huge level of income coming into the house, and his wife does not qualify for the old age pension as she is not over 66.  They get the additional allowance for her, but it is still much cheaper for him to travel to Northern Ireland to buy medication.  I am not talking about travelling from Dublin or Monaghan but from Cork.  That concerns me.</p> <p>  I will go through the figures presented on the &euro;1.5 billion savings since 2006 that the witnesses mentioned.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service presented figures to us showing that savings of &euro;765 million have been made since 2006.  It gave a breakdown.  In 2006 to 2010, &euro;250 million was saved; in 2010-2011, another &euro;250 million was saved; in 2013, &euro;120 million was saved; and in 2014, &euro;148 million was saved, giving a total of &euro;768 million.  We are being told here that it is &euro;1.5 billion.  I am a bit concerned about the presentation of figures.  The current expenditure level for 2014, according to the witnesses, is &euro;1.92 billion.  Again, the Library and Research Service tells us that the total 2012 PCRS expenditure was &euro;1.92 billion.  We are, therefore, coming up with the same figures in a two-year period.  We might go through the figures a little more closely in respect of where we are making savings because I am not convinced that we are making the inroads we should.</p> <p>  It was mentioned that the figures for generic drug use are now up to around 68% for the fourth quarter of 2014.  We were told last week that the figure was 48%.  Why are we getting all these confusing figures on generics?  It was the pharmaceutical industry itself that made a presentation to us last week saying that the figure for generic usage was 48%, but we are now talking about a figure of 68%.  Perhaps we might get some clarification on this.</p> <p>  The other issue that was raised goes back to the ESRI report in 2013.  When we talk about the negotiating price, we are talking about the basket of nine countries and we are coming out with the average.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked why we cannot be the lowest of the nine, rather than the average.  We are not making enough progress on this matter.  It is a huge cost factor.  The Library and Research Service refers to the overall cost in 2012.  Total PCRS expenditure for all schemes was &euro;2.56 billion in 2012.  Those are the figures the service is giving to me.  We seem to be getting different figures from different people.  I want to see by the end of 2015 some real change in cost.  I am not convinced we are making enough progress in this matter.  Legislation was brought in on the use of generic drugs and we are making substantial progress, but could we make much more progress and do we all need to do much more, from hospitals to general practitioners across the board?  Are we doing enough and can we do much more?  It is not that we do not want to use the money for health, but we could use that money far more effectively in other areas if we could save on the cost of drugs.</p></speech>

I still have neighbours, families and friends crossing the Border or going to England to get cheaper drugs, or coming back from Spain with drugs they cannot even buy in this country without a prescription.  That needs to be addressed quickly.  I heard Senator Crown speak before about generic drugs, but why are patients less willing to take generic drugs?  Is there any evidence that when patients are on generic drugs there is a longer recovery time?  That is what I hear.  I am only going by family and friends.  When they are on generic drugs it takes them longer to get better.</p> <p>  I love listening to people speak on television about medical science, new cures or people having an opportunity to live longer if they have cancer, arthritis or something like that, but I get nervous when I see figures such as that in six years time, 40% more people in this country will be over 65 and people are going to live longer.  They may live into their 80s, but will they be healthier?  Research shows that perhaps they will not.  My mother died at 89.  She had a great life.  She was never in hospital, except for in the last six months of her life when she had dementia.  We took her home and we had her at home for most of the six months.  One thing that struck me was that this was a woman who had lived a long life, had a large family, who had worked at stages of her life and yet was not there at all in the last few weeks of her life.  She was just somebody lying in a bed whom none of us knew and who did not know any of us.  I wonder about the quality of life people have when we produce medication that makes them lives longer.  Everyone wants to see family members living longer, but they must have a quality of life.  There must be meaning for them in living longer, and it is very sad when their quality of life no longer exists.  Why sustain that natural process of life?  I am not a medical doctor, but one of my favourite songs is "Who Wants to Live Forever".  There is great meaning in that.  I see someone putting up his hand.  He wants to live forever.  I do not want to live forever.  I want to have a decent life in order that when I come to its last stages, I am still able to do little things for myself, even though they may be simple.  Living longer and not having a certain quality of life serves no purpose.  I might as well be honest.</p></speech>

HSE colleagues will be able to pick up on many of the other issues.  As I alluded to at the outset, I am not so long in my current post that I have been present through the negotiation of the previous agreements with the pharmaceutical industry.  However, all the officials present take their instructions from the Minister for Health and the Government.</p><p>The Minister is quite determined to continue to achieve further savings in pharmaceutical costs in order that we will be able to respond to the demographic pressures about which we spoke in terms of the emerging new drugs.</p><p> When one talks about previous agreements, how hard people drove at them and the question of how successful we were, one needs to recall that an agreement, by its nature, is the outcome of negotiations between parties with competing positions.  Therefore, to reach any agreement, be it in industrial relations or any other business-type context, there must be a compromise, presumably on both sides, somewhere along the line.  Thus, the parties reach an agreement that delivers a result for each.  Obviously, successive agreements have delivered further benefits and changes incrementally.  A current agreement is due to expire towards the end of this year, but consideration is already being given to the objectives and details of what we will be seeking in successor talks.  I do not particularly want to elaborate on them today because we are formulating positions.</p><p> The other factor that has changed on this occasion is that we now have the benefit of the 2013 Act which gives the HSE significant statutory powers regarding price adjustment.  Where it is not deemed possible to reach an agreement through negotiation that is acceptable to the State side, we have the option of using these powers.  Obviously, the preferred approach is negotiation.  The term "agreement", by definition, represents agreement between parties with a compromise.  We are quite clear on the instructions we have received from the Minister.  They are quite clear and very much focused on the benefits for the health service, particularly on maximising what we can do with the health budget provided for us by the Government and the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

They concern the basket of countries used in making a determination on price.  I will ask colleagues to address that issue.  The cross-border issue was raised in quite a few of the questions asked.  Issues of currency arise in that context that I believe we will be able to deal with and clarify.  Professor Barry will address for members the prescribing patterns, the use of generics and the quality adjusted life year issues.</p> <p>  I will go through the list of questions quickly and ask colleagues to comment, as necessary.  I will begin with Deputy Billy Kelleher's questions on why savings were possible or even achieved in the period after 2006.  There are a number of key reasons.  First, there was exponential growth in costs from 2004 onwards.  Much of this growth was attributable to a population increase and new products and also the expansion of eligibility.  That was the period in which the over-70s became entitled to medical cards automatically.  This gave rise to a considerable additional cost.</p> <p>  A factor to which I am sure colleagues will be able to allude further was early adoption of new products in Ireland as part of the nine country basket approach.  The approach is subject to the original agreement of 2006.  I will ask Mr. Flanagan to speak about who decided on the nine countries and why they were decided on.</p> <p>  I understand Soliris is available, but colleagues will confirm this.  I believe there were four additional patients registered on it.  Obviously, we are still not happy about the price being charged for the product and the process of seeking an improved price for Irish patients continues.</p></speech>

Professor Barry's programme is getting to grips with that issue.  He will be able to allude to it further, in addition to the use of the nine country basket.  These are issues that are subject to scrutiny in the context of a new and successor agreement, wherein we would not necessarily be working on the basis of the average.  We will be looking for a better approach.  Sometimes the pace of adoption has been an influence.  Traditionally, Ireland has been one of the early adopters of new products and medicines which, again, reduces the number of countries involved in making up the average.  That has now changed, subject to the 2012 agreement and the processes in place courtesy of Professor Barry's programme.</p> <p>  The quality adjusted life year and the maximum of &euro;45,000 comprise a considerable debating point.  The debate is occurring worldwide on health economics.  The issue for us in that regard is that the measure is a tool.  It is used for automatic qualification of a product.  This is by no means the only issue, but it is a useful assessment tool to get business done and products into the reimbursement process.  There are obviously bigger picture issues that have to be borne in mind.  We saw examples recently of where the cost of products far exceeded the &euro;45,000 threshold.  We will try to address the cross-border issue and why drugs are cheaper elsewhere.</p> <p>  Senator John Crown's point on the size of the market was significant.  It is part of the bigger picture issue in determining why companies locate in Ireland</p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke raised issues concerning Northern Ireland and the amount saved.  We can clarify the discrepancies he is finding in his figures concerning what is reimbursed and total expenditure on pharmaceuticals.  Any discrepancy between 2012 and 2014 will be addressed by Mr. Burke.</p> <p>  Generics were referred to.  We have an explanation as to why last week companies were citing a figure of 48% and why we are at 68%.  We will be able to clarify that issue.  I will ask Professor Barry to answer the question on whether there is more we could do on drug prices in securing a better deal for taxpayers.  As to why there is a reluctance to use generics, the quality of life issues Deputy Catherine Byrne raised are very important.  Perhaps Professor Barry might address the issue of reluctance on the part of the public.  It may still feature in respect of generics, but I believe the attitude is changing.  We have seen evidence of change in the figures very recently.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-12a.952" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shaun Flanagan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015031200002#K00500"><p>To respond to Deputy Billy Kelleher's question on the period before 2009 and the changes that have occurred, it is important to note that there has been a series of framework agreements with the industry dating back to the 1970s.  Prior to 2013, the HSE or the State had no statutory powers on the Statute Book it could use; therefore, everything had to be done by agreement.  If there was no agreement, there was no alternative.  To the best of my knowledge, the 2013 agreement represented the first time the State actually legislated and provided powers for the health service to set prices.  That changed the dynamic.</p> <p>  On the rationale for using the basket of nine countries, the original basket contained five countries.  In 2006 there was a long negotiation.  I was not involved, but I understand the negotiators reported directly to a Cabinet sub-committee.  At that point it was agreed that the basket would be increased from five to nine countries.  Austria, Belgium, Finland and Spain were added and regarded as lower price countries &mdash; that is what is coming out in the recent data we have received &mdash; than the countries that had been included in the previous basket.</p> <p>  On the subject of the dynamics of the basket, there is no doubt that companies operate a process of what one might call waves of launches.  Wave 1 features high price countries and is followed by waves 2, 3 and 4.  The first in line are most expensive, about which there is no doubt.  That is how companies operate and it is a rational way to operate.  Twenty-five of the 28 countries in the European Union operate some form of basket system.  To the best of my knowledge, there are three countries that operate what is called a free-pricing market.  They are Germany, Denmark and the United Kingdom which are usually in an early wave.  The position in the United Kingdom can vary, but the three countries are in our basket.  From 2006 onwards, it was recognised that just relying on a basket would result in the same answer all of the time.  This led to the requirement to put in place a health technology assessment process.  Therefore, it is not a simple matter of companies coming to us with an average for nine countries and stating this represents the price.  That is the absolute maximum price they can achieve.</p><p>If that is the absolute maximum price they can achieve, they are required to justify the price in the health technology assessment.  If the health technology assessment satisfies a threshold of &euro;45,000 per quality adjusted life year, QALY, it is automatically an important point.  It is not a line in the sand, above which we will not reimburse.  It is an agreed position and, if they satisfy it in their economic dossiers, they are automatically reimbursed.  If they do not satisfy it, we are into price negotiations.  These negotiations are commercially confidential and non-transparent.  Owing to spillover effects in other countries, if the price in Ireland drops, the price in other countries drops also.  We have price reductions ranging from 5% to 40% for various medicines, but I cannot reveal them because most of the time companies will state they will provide the discount as long as it is regarded as commercially confidential and not revealed in a public forum.  That leaves us in a difficult position when presenting to the committee.  However, members should be aware that the basket is not the setting point, rather it is the starting point and they are required to justify the price and bring it through a full assessment process.  Having satisfied the assessment process, the price stands.  If they do not satisfy it, difficult negotiations go ahead.  As members are aware from what has happened in recent times, we sometimes reach a stand-off position where companies hold a line on a price that we believe is completely inappropriate.  Where they are unwilling to move, decisions must be made on that basis.</p><p> On the question about Eculizumab Soliris, I can categorically say the reimbursement is progressing.  However, the DG said in his press release that there was a screening programme.  It is incumbent on the clinicians in question to complete a form, go through the screening process and reimbursement will continue from there.  Some patients are through that process and we have applications from four patients.  That is the turnover in a relatively quick process.  Most of them have been turned around in 24 or 48 hours.  If there has not been reimbursement, I assume it is down to the fact that the application form has just been received, has not been received or has not been completed.</p></speech>

Once they qualify, the consultant will be told that the HSE primary reimbursement service will carry the cost of Eculizumab.  I know one process patient has been through it and has definitively started therapy.  There are four other applications.  It is down to people completing forms and getting through the process.  There is no attempt to slow it down in case Deputies have concerns.</p> <p>  I have never been involved in a sweetheart deal, nor have I ever seen one.</p></speech>

The Oireachtas has directed us in the legislation that the criteria have been set out, one of which is not foreign direct investment.  It is not something we take into consideration, but that is not to say the companies do not include it in letters.  However, it is not an issue in a decision.</p> <p>  In terms of parallel trade, Deputy Billy Kelleher made it clear that it was entirely legal across the European Union.  If someone wants to parallel import or export, he or she is required to have a wholesale licence.  Most countries have elements of parallel trade and in the past when prices were high, this was a parallel importing country when there was an arbitrage opportunity in importing.  That parallel exporting is an increasing part of the commentary is an indicator that our prices are dropping and that we are starting to fall below other countries.  As recently as 2012, a UK all-party parliamentary group issued a report on difficulties the United Kingdom was experiencing in maintaining supplies of stock as a result of parallel exporting.  It is not that this is the only country that has had to consider these issues.  As we drive prices lower, it will become an increasing concern.  Sometimes a country does not have to be at the bottom of the EU market to engage in parallel exporting.  We have become aware of a number of products where parallel exporting has happened and the export country is not at the lowest point in the basket.  A country can be unfortunate enough that Germany or the United Kingdom is at a higher level.  When this happens and there is a sufficient arbitrage opportunity, specialist wholesalers will export.  There is very little can be done to prevent this.  We work with the industry in putting in place controls for access to stock and preventing any of these wholesalers from gaining access to Irish stocks.  We continue to work closely with the industry on this issue.</p> <p>  The HSE does not buy stock but operates a reimbursement model.  We do not own the stock until the day the bill is presented to us - the day after the patient has it.  We do not buy stock to be held in a major warehouse; we rely on the standard wholesale and distribution mechanisms the industry has in place to control supply chains.  This is consistent with the position in every country in Europe.</p></speech>

Why do we not go to the lowest in Europe?  The reason is that experience tells us definitively that we will have supply issues.  Why do we not go to the United Kingdom in terms of reference pricing?  The United Kingdom is at the bottom of the off-patent market.  It has been down this road for 30 years and is, by definition, lower than us.  We can look good if we go to the United Kingdom, provided we can do the job and get out before the problem starts.  In the Health Act there is a statutory requirement on us to worry about continuity of supply.  We look at the UK price and every reference price across Europe and try to set a price that is at the average or median figure.  I understand it is difficult for people to accept and that it must be very difficult for those who live near the Border.  They can cross the Border and get something cheaper, but the United Kingdom is one of the least expensive off-patent markets in the European Union.  We must remember that it is a market of 60 million people and that Ireland is a market of 4.5 million.  Taking 20,000 packs out of the UK market and exporting them will not be noticed.  In Ireland 20,000 packs could be the entire run for the year.  As we are very open to losing these supports, we must be careful about it.</p> <p>   Pricing is not the only aspect that drives shortages.  There are other reasons, including problems with raw materials, manufacturing difficulties, recalls and quality issues.  Manufacturers may also have production difficulties.  There can also be industry consolidation and unpredictable shifts in demand, including unexpected increases in demand.  Parallel trade and pricing decisions are a minority of the reasons there is a shortage in the market.  Most of the shortages pharmacists experience are not down to pricing and parallel trade issues but to other issues that happen in having a quality assured process.  On occasion, regulators must intervene and state there is an issue about a factory.  This can lead to a problem with the supply of a particular medicine.  It is not as simple, therefore, as pricing and parallel trade.  I think I have covered the issue of reference pricing and the United Kingdom.</p> <p>  In terms of numbers, the level of generic penetration must considerd whether there is an off-patent market and a patent market.  It is technically impossible for a generic to enter the patented market.  The figure of 68% we quote is the last quarter reimbursement figure.  In the off-patent market 68% of claims we receive are for generics.  If we compare it to the figure in the United Kingdom, we must remember that the denominators are different.  Senator John Crown may be able to confirm this point independently.  Cancer drugs such as sutents are not distributed through the community pharmacy chain but through home care systems and hospitals.  They are not included in the UK denominator in terms of UK pharmaceutical spending.  They are also not included in the UK OECD figures.  They are included in Ireland's OECD figures because we have a different model.  We provide these high-tech drugs through the community pharmacy contract network.  That means that 90% of high tech drugs are on patent.  By definition, our denominator is bigger; therefore, it is technically impossible at whole of market level, based on OECD levels Ireland produces, to get to 70%.</p><p>If the committee looks at it where we think it should, which is the proportion of the market where it is possible to compete, 68% of the claims are in generics.  </p><p> In response to the question about people being uncomfortable about generics, the actual figures no longer bear that out.  Increasingly we are seeing, as people become more comfortable with generics and get more used to them, they are becoming more comfortable.  Prescribers are a key driver in providing reassurance to patients.  As prescribers become more comfortable prescribing them, patients will often take their lead from the prescriber.  </p><p> In terms of the reference pricing molecules, we are not 90% generic penetration for some.  Atorvastatin is 90% plus generic and is the most common statin used.  For the one Senator Crown mentioned, we are at 90% generic utilisation.  One of the most expensive proton pump inhibitors is omerprazole, which is at 90%.  In fact, all the proton pump inhibitors are at or above 85% generic penetration.  Reference pricing has made a huge difference and in the generic substitution proportion of that.</p><p> Within the 32% portion where there is no substitution, one has to remember the areas concerned.  People might be less comfortable about substitution which is something the Oireachtas discussed in detail when passing the Health Act.  One must be careful because the further up one goes there are other drugs that one might be less comfortable about substituting.</p></speech>

We have continued campaigns on the HSE website.  We are also aware that individual companies have media campaigns.  The HSE tries to be prudent in the way it spends its money.  If it has a big advertisement campaign that costs &euro;500,000, and its message coincides with what we want to say, then it makes sense for us to allow it to spend that money, if it so wishes, and for us to step back.  If we need to intervene in the future then we will do so.</p> <p>  We had a campaign for the implementation programme.  Our press and comments people were intimately involved in an implementation group.  We met loads of groups, including groups that were vehemently opposed to generic substitution.  They seem to have come around in some of the areas.  Osteoporosis drugs are now 75% substituted and there has been no evidence of significant difficulty, or any difficulty at all, reported to the Irish Medicines Board or the Health Products Regulatory Authority as it is now called.</p> <p>   I am sorry as I think I have taken possibly too much time.</p></speech>

I am not going to reconcile the figures here.  The figures that have been produced in the Department's material, and in Mr. Hennessy's statement, have come from the published audited figures which are figures that have been worked through with the troika as well.  I can provide a summary of those figures.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned that &euro;2.6 billion was paid through the PCRS.  I need to break it down and find out what was included.  For example, in 2009 the figure was &euro;2.633 billion but it included &euro;491 million that was paid to general practitioners.  As Mr. Hennessy said in his statement earlier, the figure for pharmacy includes ex-factory price, wholesale margin, fees and VAT.  It depends on what actor presents what figure and at what point in time.  </p> <p>  I can provide the committee and the Senator with a summary that is transparent about the figures we have produced.  Then I can take any figure and attempt to reconcile it or let some other actor reconcile it because they may have compiled it in a different way.  I hope I have simplified the matter for the committee.  </p></speech>

We have seen this in areas such as peptic ulcer disease and coronary heart disease mortality which has experienced a three-fold reduction over the past 25 to 30 years.</p> <p>  The main focus for the medicines management programme is the safe, effective and cost effective prescribing of medicines.  Safety is an important element to mention.  We must remember that medicines are the most common form of preventable patient injury in the health service.  Safety is a big issue for us, regardless of the money which we have spoken an awful lot about today.  A lot of our work is advising practitioners on the safer prescribing of drugs.  The ones that particularly concern me are the new oral anti-coagulants and we have issued detailed guidance on them to prescribers.  </p> <p>   I shall return to the money side of things.  Even with reference pricing, there is a significant number of things we as prescribers do but can do better.  That has been part of our thrust and I shall give a few examples.  In this country inhaled medications for asthma and COPD costs over &euro;100 million every year.  I refer to the combination of two inhalers, of steroid plus a long acting beta agonist, which accounts for &euro;50 million a year.  There is a new one out, which is 35% cheaper.  Our message to prescribers is very clear - when prescribing one of these new inhaled medications to opt for a product called Bufomix.  These are simple things that we can do but we can do better.  As Senator Crown has said, we should save where we can.  If one looks at statins, proton pump inhibitors, blood pressure lowering medications and anti-depressants, there are 12.5 million prescription items issued for these every year.  Can we do better?  Yes, we can.</p> <p>  We have looked at each of these therapeutic areas, we are developing them as we go along and we indicate to prescribers what we see would be the drug of choice or the preferred drug.  I mean what we would see as the first choice medication.  For example, when choosing a statin today one has five choices.  We are very clear on the choice that we would advise prescribers to take.  We can also highlight the ones that cost us the most.  We work down through all these therapeutic areas and we can make significant savings above and beyond what we have heard today about reference pricing.  The programme is safe, effective and cost effective and prescribing is what we are all about.  We know from the past that this programme has got to be sustained.  One cannot just do so for six or 12 months, otherwise people return to their old habits in due course.  Therefore, we need a sustained programme to ensure quality prescribing.</p> <p>  The next issue is cost effectiveness.  It is important to state that when we talk about thresholds and qualities, we are trying to put a value on the health benefit that a drug will deliver for us.  That is where one gets the cost per quality adjusted life.  Earlier we heard about the importance of quality of life.  That is why we include quality of life in these calculations.  It is because one can get a duration of life but the quality of that life is important as well. </p> <p>  I shall now discuss the question of viewpoints.  Companies submit their dossiers on cost effectiveness to us, so they put the case together.  We will accept a number of viewpoints and one of them is by the health service.  As has been rightly suggested, we also accept the societal viewpoint as well which one includes care costs, travel costs, out of work costs, etc.  Economic dossiers incorporate all of those factors.  In fairness to them, the presentations are of a very high quality.  We do capture all of those aspects in regard to the cost per quality of life.  </p> <p>  In the vast majority of cases, we do not see any difference in terms of clinical outcomes for generic drugs.  It is part of our remit in the medicines management programme to promote generic prescribing and we are happy to do so.  It is well accepted that it is not only the most cost effective prescribing but is also safer prescribing.  We instill in our junior doctors that generics is safer prescribing.  There are many examples that when people read the name of a branded product, they will not recognise it but when they are told the pharmacological name they will recognise it.  There is a safety issue in that regard.</p></speech>

Can a prescribing audit be carried out in pharmacies?  Audits would allow on to see trends, for example, of local GPs prescribing expensive drugs.  The audit could be done in a general practice.  Is an audit carried out on a random basis?  Is scientific data pulled from the reimbursement figures?</p> <p>  I wish to mention parallel trading but shall not go into too much detail.  If the HSE, the Department or whoever makes an agreement with a company to supply a product at a certain price, is supply guaranteed?  Is it just the price that is guaranteed?  When one enters a contract to sell something one normally agrees to supply the product as well.</p><p>I am just wondering because wholesaling obviously suits pharmaceutical companies.  Basically, it is transferring from a cheap to a dear state, so it suits them to have that going.  If they are producing a product, would the witnesses not think that in the price contract there would also be an agreed supply contract, which is the normal course in any other business?  If I am selling milk, I must supply it at the agreed price.</p><p> I am only guessing because I do not know a lot about this but I assume that there are very few launches of patented products in Spain.  I am guessing most of them are in Germany and other high-cost markets, or am I wrong?  If that is the case, surely that is almost market manipulation in a way.  It is a system tied into a minimum of three countries.  One launches a patented product and it is in the high-cost country, and it works out from there.  Is there any way that the EU or any other organisation or entity could assess or address this issue?  That is the obvious one we are all looking at here and which we should talk about.</p></speech>

Part of our remit is the ongoing monitoring of utilisation and expenditure across all the major groups.  As an example, I highlighted the issue of the new oral anti-coagulants.  I felt that was a safety and, indeed, a cost issue.  We did monitor the GMS database and were able to examine this and see that there were dosing issues.  There were also issues concerning poor prescribed medicines that may not be safe and may increase the bleeding risk.  This time last year, this very month, I wrote to all practitioners throughout the country highlighting the issues.  We went back to re-analyse the data later and I am glad to say there has been a huge change for the better in prescribing these medications.</p></speech>

One may have thought it would not be pleasant but it was very positive.  We got many calls from people who said they looked at their panel of patients and made the appropriate changes.  We have seen over 1,150 GPs at this stage and we are getting a positive response from them about prescribing matters.  The Irish College of General Practitioners has been excellent in facilitating this.  It should come as a reassurance.  We are monitoring these and are also monitoring trends in products that may not cost a lot.  They suddenly come onto our radar and we then decide whether we need to look at them more carefully, and maybe subject them to health technology assessment.  We are looking at it, therefore.  It has always been my aim to have an ongoing scrutiny of the pricing and reimbursement of medicines.  That is what we are doing now.</p></speech>

On rare occasions we have had scenarios where, with individual shortages, companies have put two or three times what they were predicting into the Irish market and they cannot keep the stock in the market.  That can cause knock-on effects into other countries.  These companies have single factories around the world.  They have their supply chain mapped out six or eight months in advance.  If something unexpected happens in the supply chain, they do try to flex their muscles and move things back into stock.</p> <p>  While we are often in combat with pharmaceutical companies in terms of security supply and people reacting to pressures, in general, our experience is good.  Companies genuinely want to ensure their stocks are available, if only because it is bad for their corporate otherwise.  If Pfizer has a shortage it is not good for its corporate reputation.  These companies jealously guard their corporate reputations, so I would not put any blame on the pharmaceutical companies for being involved in exporting.  They do their best to prevent it.</p> <p>  They often also put in place lock-downs on stock where individual suppliers can only get so many packs per month commensurate with what they have bought historically.  One will often find third parties in the market complaining about it.  The reason for that, however, is that if one had only bought ten packs a month for two years, why does one suddenly need 200?  They therefore put locks into their stocks to ensure that people cannot get involved in those processes.  There is a sophisticated supply chain operation behind it all trying to control things.</p></speech>

The Deputy should remember that they have sold the stock into Ireland.  Once they sell it into Ireland in the wholesale chain, they have sold it at &euro;10 and no longer own the stock.  It has gone into the distribution chain.  A third party takes it at that &euro;10 price and exports it to another market at &euro;20.  The pharmaceutical company gets no benefit.  In fact, if one thinks it through, the pharmaceutical company loses.  That is because if it is a higher-price market, they could have sold it in the other market for &euro;15, so it is the third party which benefits.</p></speech>

I have explained throughout how we use HTA.  I should also probably have said that in 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2013 there were price realignments on the basis of what the baskets were in those countries.  Those were many years after the launch.  I have no doubt our expectation is that in the next agreement there will be an automatic realignment in various things.  In the last agreement the decision was made to take all the savings we can up front, and we realigned everything at the start of the agreement, as opposed to doing it on a phased basis.  I think, however, that in the next agreement there will be an automatic realignment.</p> <p>  The other thing that happens is that when a company makes an application there may well be only three baskets on it.  They go through the HTA process and we end up in a commercial negotiation.  One of the things we always do is go back to companies and say, "Show us your basket of nine now, guys".  Often at that stage one will have seven, eight or nine in the basket.  As soon as that happens, one is usually in a better position for leverage.</p> <p>  In addition, while companies submit the basket of three to us, it does not mean that we stop on that day.  We have relations with other reimbursement agencies across Europe.  When we see an opportunity where somebody has launched at a lower price, that gives us a commercial opportunity to negotiate with a company.  We do go back and do that.</p></speech>

In the unpatented market, Spain is not necessarily any cheaper than elsewhere.  Companies have very tight pricing windows that they try to apply across the whole of Europe as far as they can, particularly at launch.  Spain is not in the first wave but it is one of the earlier wave countries.  I am not too sure we have data that are readily to hand.</p></speech>

We have gone back and renegotiated with the company.  We have also re-engaged with clinical specialists.  We are working to try to agree a protocol that might allow us to extend reimbursement.  The particular difficulty with Fampridine is that about one third of patients get a good response, one third get a partial response and one third get no response.  Clearly, if one could be certain that one was only paying at a reasonable price for the people who get a very good response, one would be more eager to reimburse.  We are trying to work towards that outcome.  We are hopeful of progress on that in the near future.</p> <p>  The last question concerned the health wave type of scenario.</p></speech>

In terms of the health wave, however, the HSE would welcome any price competition in the market.  We have made it clear that we set prices for reimbursement and for the schemes, but we do not set prescription prices.  Any competition is welcome but we would want to be cognisant that there is a completely different model.  We have a population of 4.6 million with 1,800 pharmacies.</p><p>If one takes it that the average pharmacy probably covers a population of 2,500 people, such a pharmacy might have 1,000 patients.  The Healthwave model, as reported by itself, involves 10,000 patients paying a fee of &euro;25 upfront.  Members can see clearly that it is a different model and there is a choice for society in this regard.  If one needs 10,000 people to run that model, then perhaps one only needs one tenth of the number of pharmacies and that is not a model the HSE necessarily would support 100%.  I know myself that with children, if one needs a prescription late at night and one is in Cork, west Clare where I am from or wherever, one will want a local pharmacy at which one can get a prescription for that child and get it quickly to avoid a hospital admission.  If one is in the unfortunate position of having a family member who is coming home to spend his or her last few days with one and if one needs access to opiates of whatever, one will not be going to a pharmacy in south Dublin with a huge population around it.  That model is built on chronic patients with no changes whatever and our pharmacy model delivers a great deal more than does the other type of model.</p><p> However, I reiterate there is nothing wrong with competition.  We welcome the pricing competition and people can then make their choices.</p></speech>

It is a huge area of expenditure and is of considerable public interest as well.  Our approach has seen significant progress because, as the joint committee has heard, a balance must be struck between reducing price and maintaining supply, which is critical.  As for the future, a key priority for the HSE is Professor Barry's programme in respect of rational prescribing.  One other point I might add is in the area of information and transparency and pertains to providing a lot more information in the public domain on price and costs and helping the debate on this important area through greater transparency on the figures.  The points Mr. Flanagan has just made on competition, choice and well-informed consumers are highly pertinent in this regard.</p></speech>

As the Chair said, the Sheffield Alcohol Research Group has been conducting work looking at alcohol policies in general and minimum unit pricing in particular since 2008.  The Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive commissioned us in 2013 to examine the potential effects of minimum unit pricing in their respective countries and we will focus on that work in our presentation today.  However, before coming to that, I would like to give the committee a little background on the wider evidence on the effectiveness of using alcohol prices to reduce alcohol-related harm.<br/><br/>A major review in 2009 examined the evidence on the impact of alcohol price changes on alcohol consumption.  It found that increases in alcohol prices were consistently and significantly associated with falls in consumption.  This was the case for total alcohol and also for each alcoholic beverage such as beers, wines and spirits.  We saw the same thing for younger and older drinkers and we saw that binge drinkers were also responsive to price changes.  These findings have been replicated across at least two other major reviews.  An example finding is that, on average across different times and places, a 10% increase in the price of all alcohol is associated with an average 4.4% fall in consumption. <br/><br/>However, our primary interest is not whether alcohol price increases reduce consumption but whether they reduce the harm caused by alcohol.  A further review of 50 studies concluded that indeed they do.  Based on the findings of that review, the researchers estimated that a doubling of alcohol taxes in the US would lead to a 35% reduction in alcohol-related mortality, an 11% reduction in car crash deaths and smaller reductions in sexually transmitted diseases, violence and crime associated with alcohol. <br/><br/>Minimum pricing is a specific form of price increase targeting the cheapest alcohol which, as you will see later, is disproportionately purchased by the heaviest drinkers.  Therefore, there is good reason to expect it will have an impact on alcohol-related harm.  Several Canadian provinces have had this kind of policy in place for many years and recent evaluations have shown that those policies have reduced the harm from alcohol in those provinces.  The Canadian policies are not quite the same as minimum unit pricing as proposed in Ireland and the UK, because minimum prices are not directly linked to the strength of the drink.  However, the same basic principle of a minimum price, below which alcohol cannot be sold to consumers, does apply. <br/><br/>The Canadian evaluations have shown that, all else being equal, increases in minimum prices are associated with falls in alcohol consumption, in alcohol-related hospital admissions and also in deaths due to alcohol.  The graph in figure No. 1 of the opening statement, circulated to members, shows one example study.  The black line is the average minimum price of all alcohol in British Columbia between 2002 and 2009.  The grey line is the rate of wholly alcohol-attributable deaths in the province.  These are the deaths very closely associated with heavy drinking such as alcohol poisoning and alcoholic liver disease.  The graph shows that a sharp and sustained increase in minimum prices in 2006 was swiftly followed by a sharp and sustained fall in deaths closely associated with heavy drinking.  This <i>prima facie</i>evidence of policy effectiveness was supported by the statistical analysis which estimated that a 10% increase in minimum prices would be associated with a 32% fall in those deaths closely associated with heavy drinking.  So there is good evidence from Canada that minimum prices and minimum price increases lead to substantial falls in the harm caused by alcohol, all else being equal.<br/><br/>I will now turn to our own work.  We were asked by the Irish Government to estimate the potential impact in Ireland of different levels of minimum unit pricing, MUP, using our Sheffield alcohol policy model, SAPM, as we call it.  For a given alcohol policy, our model provides estimates of changes in alcohol consumption, in consumer spending on alcohol, in revenue to retailers and Government, in the rates of various different alcohol related harms, in the costs of those harms to individuals' quality of life and in the direct costs to public services.  A key feature of the model is that we do not just estimate these effects at a population level, we are also able to estimate the effects on different groups in the population defined by age, gender, income and how much alcohol people drink.<br/><br/>At this point I will be talking about low risk drinkers, increasing risk drinkers and high risk drinkers.  Low risk drinkers are drinking within the Government's drinking guidelines of around 17 standard drinks per week for males and 11 standard drinks per week for females.  High risk drinkers, the heaviest drinkers, are those consuming more than 40 standard drinks per week for males and 28 standard drinks or more for females.  Increasing risk drinkers fall between those two levels.<br/><br/>The model methodology for SAPM is too complex for this short presentation and we are happy to discuss it in more detail during the questions.  The basic idea is summarised in the figure No. 2.  The SAPM works sequentially so we first estimate the impact of introducing MUP on prices.  We then use those price changes to estimate how peoples' consumption would change.  Then we use those consumption changes to estimate how rates of the different harms would change.  Finally, we use the changes in the rates of harm to estimate how the costs of harm would change.  Although each of these steps involves quite complex statistical work, the methods we use are largely orthodox in scientific terms.  What has made our work so influential and impactful is that we look at a very broad range of outcomes, which is unusual for this kind of model.  We are also able to look at the impacts on different groups in society and hopefully the committee will see why that is useful.<br/><br/>I will now turn to results.  First we estimated the impact of different levels of minimum price on consumption.  Figure No. 3 shows that as the minimum price gets higher, the consumption reductions get bigger.  This is fairly obvious because one is affecting more of the market if one introduces a higher minimum price.  Above a minimum price of about 60 cent per standard drink one starts to get quite large reductions in consumption.  At 70 cent per standard drink one gets a consumption reduction of 1.9%.  At 80 cent per drink one gets a 3.8% reduction.  At 90 cent per standard drink one gets a 6.2% reduction.  For the remainder of our presentation I will focus on a minimum price of &euro;1 per standard drink just as an indicative example. <br/><br/>Based on our modelling, we estimate that a &euro;1 minimum unit price introduced in Ireland would reduce total alcohol consumption by around 8.8%.  By the 20th year after the introduction of this policy, when we would expect to see the full effects, that reduction of 8.8% we result in around 200, or 16%, fewer deaths per year, and around 6,000, or 10%, fewer alcohol related hospital admissions.  From year 1 of the policy, and every year thereafter, we would expect to see around 1,500 fewer alcohol-related crimes and over 100,000 fewer days absent from work due to alcohol.  A cost breakdown is provided in table No. 1 in the handout but the headline figure is that over 20 years, the total reduction in the cost of alcohol-related harm is estimated to be around &euro;1.7 billion.  This accounts for costs to the police and health services, and also a financial valuation of improved quality of life.</p><p>The impact on retailers is likely to be positive, as minimum unit pricing is not a tax.  Money from the higher prices is held by the retailers.  We estimate that off-trade retailers - that is, shops and supermarkets - would receive approximately &euro;69 million extra per year from alcohol sales.  Although the policy does not directly affect pubs and restaurants because their prices are already higher than the minimum price threshold, they are largely unaffected directly, but we would expect to see changes in consumer behaviour.  For example, people who are buying less alcohol in the supermarket might go to the pub more.  For that reason, we expect there may be a slight increase in on-trade revenue as well.</p><p> Regarding tax revenue, the negative impact on the Exchequer would be modest, as lost duty from falling alcohol sales would be largely offset by rising VAT revenue from higher alcohol prices. </p><p> A key feature of the policy of minimum unit pricing is that it does not affect all drinkers equally.  The main driver is how much cheap alcohol different groups buy.  Low-risk drinkers purchase very little cheap alcohol - that is, one or two standard drinks per week for less than &euro;1 per standard drink - irrespective of whether they are in poverty.  Even low-income low-risk drinkers do not buy much of this cheap alcohol.  Compare this to high-risk drinkers, who purchase substantial quantities of cheap alcohol.  Although high-risk drinkers in poverty buy more cheap alcohol than those not in poverty - 43 standard drinks per week versus 26 - it is clear that those on higher incomes still buy cheap alcohol.  It is not just low-income people who will be affected.</p><p> The Sheffield alcohol policy model, SAPM, takes account of these different purchasing patterns, and the estimates of annual reductions in consumption for each of these groups reflect this.  We estimate that the annual reduction in consumption for low-risk drinkers would be very small; they would be largely unaffected.  It is estimated that low-income low-risk drinkers would reduce their consumption by just 25 standard drinks per year, which is equivalent to drinking three fewer bottles of wine per year.  That is a small reduction.  Compare this to high-risk drinkers, who, it is estimated, would reduce their consumption by well over 500 standard drinks per year for those in poverty and 480 standard drinks per year for those not in poverty.  This is equivalent to approximately 60 to 70 bottles of wine per year.  That shows the much greater impact on high-risk drinkers.</p><p> A concern for some parties has been the potential financial impact on low-income drinkers.  Our modelling does not support these concerns.  We estimate that spending would fall in most groups.  Rather than spending more to maintain their level of consumption, most drinkers tend to reduce their consumption and spend less on alcohol as a result.  Spending is only estimated to increase in the higher-income groups.  It is worth noting from the graph that these spending changes are fairly small.  The largest reduction is &euro;159, but most reductions are in the tens of euros.  When one compares that against how much high-risk drinkers spend on alcohol per year - an average of over &euro;5,000 - we are not making much of a dent in people's alcohol spending.  Spending is not the significant factor; it is the pattern of consumption, and who is affected by those consumption patterns.</p><p> All research has limitations.  Our aim, which we hope to talk about in greater detail, is to be transparent about these and help policy makers understand their implications for our estimates.  Some of the key limitations of the SAPM include our assumption that prices of products above the minimum unit price threshold will be totally unaffected.  We assume that prices below the threshold come up to the threshold and everything above it is unaffected.  This is unlikely to be the case in reality because, for instance, Diageo is unlikely to want Smirnoff to become the cheapest vodka on the market.  We are likely to see what we call premiumisation - products being pushed up to assume a certain place in the market.  What that means is that we are probably underestimating the impact of the policy.  Our estimates are probably a little conservative.</p><p> There is a lack of clear evidence for the impact of such policies on the use of illicit alcohol or alcohol substitutes such as illicit drugs.  We know from elsewhere that when prices increase we see falling levels of harm, and this suggests that any negative side effects are not sufficient to outweigh the benefits.  We do not ignore these limitations and, where appropriate evidence is available, we test the sensitivity of our results to a range of assumptions, data sets and analytical methods.  What those sensitivity analyses have shown is that although the numerical results change, the broad conclusions stay the same.  There is strong and consistent evidence that price increases reduce alcohol consumption and related harm.  Minimum pricing is a targeted form of price increase, as it tackles disproportionately cheap alcohol purchased by heavier drinkers.  We estimate that it would not penalise low-risk drinkers, irrespective of income, because they buy little of this cheap alcohol.  In contrast, high-risk drinkers buy large quantities of cheap alcohol and would be affected.  These conclusions have been found to be robust to a range of alternative assumptions, data and analytical methods.</p></speech>

I have already indicated that I will support the Bill, but I have some concerns about minimum unit pricing.  I do not wish to be obstructive, but I want to tease out the issues, because I have concerns about the effectiveness of minimum unit pricing and its impact across society.  I have some concern for those who are least well off, who I fear may bear the greatest impact.  Their general health may improve from drinking less.  Even in the submission we heard on Tuesday, I had a sense that there was a targeting of those on lower incomes because of the expectation that the statistics will show greater improvement from the targeting of this group of people.  I would like to see the targeting equalised because I do not believe that alcohol abuse is the reserve of those who are least well off in our society.  I am cognisant of the cases I know personally of people who are very comfortably well off but are in difficulties because of abusing drink.</p> <p>  It is interesting that Dr. Holmes referred to research in the US that proposes to double alcohol taxes in the United States.  I am not opposed to increasing the cost of alcohol, but I have argued consistently that we should look at increasing the excise duty on alcohol per unit measure right across the board.  This would have a greater impact across the board.  Contrary to what was said in the presentation - I mean no disrespect to retailers such as shops and supermarkets - we should take alcohol sales out of these settings.  It is inappropriate that, as Dr. Holmes has acknowledged, shops and supermarkets will make some &euro;69 million extra from alcohol sales on the basis of &euro;1 minimum unit pricing.</p><p>This is from what has been put on the record this morning.  I argue that if we were to increase excise duties, that &euro;69 million would be in the public purse and could be employed to address the consequences of alcohol abuse not only in direct assistance for the abuser but for those who suffer most as a consequence of alcohol abuse.  I am particularly mindful of the fact that the incidence is greater among men, so I refer to wives, partners and children or those in immediate contact, who can suffer inordinately.</p><p> I have put this argument all along, but I concede that I have not won it, as the thrust is going in the other direction.  I am giving everything I can if it will be of benefit.  My concern is that we could better utilise this money if it were ring-fenced for the purpose I describe.  In this instance, we will see greater profits created, and I am not convinced that we will see such a significant decrease in sales of products.  Diageo in Ireland, for example, will have very little to fear.  I would prefer for these companies to be worried, but they are not.  That also applies to other manufacturers and those international companies which sell their products here through various outlets.  Will the witnesses comment on some of the points I made?  I have not posed them as direct questions but I am giving a view on the matter.</p><p> Will the witnesses comment on who would be affected by minimum unit pricing?  I get the sense that the witnesses are concurring with my view when they indicate that minimum unit pricing does not affect all drinkers equally, as it will not.  I have traditionally been a voice for those who are more marginalised and are from lower to middle-income backgrounds.  I am concerned because they are not all alcohol abusers.  We should make no mistake about that.  Nevertheless, for the vast majority, this will have a deleterious impact on their weekly financial condition.  The delegation has indicated that those on higher incomes are still buying these products and will be affected by the policy.  That is true for those who buy these products, but it is not a case of equal impact.</p><p> I thank the witnesses for coming here and giving their insight.  I wish both of them well.</p></speech>

In my day job I do a bit of biomedical research, and it is very nice to hear a really professional and top-quality research-based presentation in these halls.  I have a couple of quick questions.  I may have missed the witnesses mentioning the average price of a unit of alcohol purchased in Ireland now.  Do we have some idea of the quartiles and what percentage of units of alcohol are purchased for less than 50 cent, between 50 cent and 75 cent, etc.?  I presume the delegation's expertise extends to comparative research and other strategies for reducing alcohol consumption.  Are the witnesses aware of anything else that has worked as well as this?  Is there any other strategy of alcohol control across society that has worked as well as pricing?</p> <p>  We have had a bit of chat in this committee about the antics of the tobacco industry and a fair bit of discussion about pseudo-science and so on.  Have the witnesses encountered much disinformation funded heavily by the industry which attempts to discredit their research?  Will they give advice on how to handle that?  Getting to the question of price elasticity, do the witnesses have any sense that there is a ceiling effect beyond which one would be dealing with compulsive or addiction-driven drinkers who will not be price-sensitive in their demand for alcohol?  I commend the witnesses for their great research and wonderful presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-12a.1012" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1068" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015031200002#R00300"><p>I welcome the delegation.  There are three categories of drinker, and, as a non-drinker, I believe it important that people realise there are such discrete categories.  It was stated that low-risk drinkers are males who consume fewer than 17 standard drinks per week or females who consume fewer than 11 standard drinks per week, or an average of two drinks per day.  People may think that two drinks per day is not a terribly high figure.  The next category is that of increased-risk drinkers - males who consume between 17 and 40 drinks per week and females who consume between 11 and 28 drinks.  Again, many people might not believe three or four drinks per day is a high figure.  The alarming category is that of high-risk drinkers - males who consume 40 or more drinks per week or females who consume 28 or more drinks per week.  That amounts to five or six drinks per day, and the witnesses have estimated that this would cost a family &euro;100 per week.  I believe that the minute a person takes his or her first drink, he or she becomes a low-risk drinker.</p> <p>  If a minimum price regime came into effect next week and brought about a 10% increase in prices, how long would it take to affect alcohol consumption?  It was stated earlier that if alcohol prices were increased by 10% across different areas there would be a 4.4% decrease in consumption.  Would that happen in Ireland?  How would we know if the process works?  This will affect supermarkets and off-licences.  How will we know if these businesses sell below the set price?  The Canadian Government's initiatives were mentioned, but have the actions of any other countries been studied?  What level of success is there in other countries?  Why are some countries successful while others are not?</p> <p>  It is estimated that in Ireland, 1,500 hospital beds are taken up every night by patients experiencing alcohol-related harm.  Alcohol consumption in Ireland has doubled in the past 50 years.  We badly need to address the major problem we have with alcohol in Irish society, especially the availability of cheap alcohol to underage and young drinkers and those who binge drink or drink hazardously.  My main concern is the health of drinkers, who may suffer liver diseases, and the safety of families.  Not a day or a week goes by in which I do not have men, women and children coming to my constituency office to tell me about alcohol-related problems.  Apart from minimum unit pricing, what other action could be taken to reduce the consumption of alcohol, especially for high-risk drinkers?</p></speech>

I agree with previous speakers in that it is a very valuable document and we must take it very seriously.</p> <p>  Our attitude towards drinking was summed up to me in the past week when I spoke to somebody who had returned from holidays.  Half an hour into the flight, the crew of the aircraft asked for medical assistance from among the passengers, and when a medical person went to help, it turned out that the person requiring help was a passenger suffering from withdrawal, as that person had been drinking at least 14 units of alcohol per day on holidays.</p><p>This leads me to my question.  I agree fully about minimum pricing, but what needs to be done in addition to that?  I am thinking particularly about what needs to be done to educate young people when they are starting off in college.  There is a university and an institute of technology in the area I represent.  I have seen a huge change in drinking patterns over the last ten years.  Young people are now buying drink, particularly spirits, to consume in their own apartments.  The disadvantage of that change is that there are no measures when one is drinking in one's own apartment.  On the basis of their experience, what do the witnesses consider to be the best way to transmit information to young people?  What changes would they make in this whole area?  Do they believe there are no changes that can be made?  Is there evidence from other countries of how drinking among young people was dealt with?  When young people start in college, it is the first time they have real freedom, especially if they are staying away from home.  It is an extremely important time as regards getting the message out.  Their behaviour during those years can set the pattern for the rest of their lives.  Does the research group have any evidence of how other countries are dealing with that?  How have they tackled it?</p></speech>

We have done our quick read, but we have not read it in detail.  I will certainly give a lot more time to it.</p> <p>  The questions raised by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in are probably ones we are going to be hearing more of as we go through the legislative process with the public health (alcohol) Bill.  They would have been to the fore in my head when I first came to the issue of minimum unit pricing.  I was happy to read the fifth conclusion in the research group's document, which relates to the health effects of this measure on those in poverty.  We need to strike a balance between those effects and the other impact this measure might have.</p> <p>  Senator Crown asked about the ceiling or tipping point.  How do we determine where we set the minimum price?  It might seem very compelling to say that if we keep increasing the minimum price, we will save many more lives.  Where is that point?  How do we determine where to set the price?  When we are looking at the legislation, how best do we ensure we set the price appropriately?</p> <p>  Dr. Holmes referred in his presentation to "premiumisation", which is the idea that the drinks industry will increase the price of its products to ensure its brands retain a premium status.  Could this mean that people will switch to cheaper alcohol?  Has the research group looked at the effects of that?  How can we be sure the consumer will be protected?  If a minimum unit price is set, and we see general prices going up over time, how do we ensure that price is appropriate for the marketplace as time goes on?  Does it have to be linked to something?  I can understand what will happen on day one.  How do we provide for a system that is sufficiently robust?</p> <p>  Senator Crown spoke about misinformation.  It is excellent for us to have the evidence that has been presented here.  I note the point made by Dr. Holmes about illicit drugs.  This is one of the main themes in the correspondence I have received on this issue.  It has been suggested that minimum unit pricing will lead to an increase in people taking drugs.  It seems from the research group's presentation that there is no evidence to support that at the moment.  There is no basis for somebody to put forward that proposition.  If the witnesses could give us any more information on that, I would welcome it.  I imagine we will hear more and more about this argument.</p> <p>  Did the research group look at any parallel strategies when it was doing its study?  Senator Burke spoke about education.  Does this have an effect?  Dr. Holmes referred to the experience in Canada.  Did the drinks industry there oppose the approach to minimum unit pricing that was taken in Canada?  Maybe they could give us some information that would help us to understand that.  We know that the drinks industry in Scotland is taking an ongoing court case against minimum unit pricing.  To me, that is another reason we know it works.  Maybe that is just me being me.  I would be interested to know what kind of evidence or so-called evidence - "misinformation" is a much better word to describe it - they are putting forward.</p></speech>

I had to go to my office to meet somebody.  I have read the research group's document and I listened to Dr. Holmes's contribution on the monitor in my office.  I have three or four questions.  This committee receives many documents.  This is very much an evidence-based document.  I have to say it is one of the most interesting documents I have read in a long time.  It highlights many different areas about which we might not have not thought previously, which we will have to look into.  If the questions I am about to ask have already been asked, I apologise and ask Dr. Holmes and Dr. Angus to skip over them.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses believe minimum unit pricing will bring people back towards social drinking in local pubs and restaurants?  There is a feeling among a certain cohort that if something can be done to increase the price of alcohol, it might encourage people to drink less at home and bring them into more controlled social surroundings.  Do the witnesses believe minimum unit pricing will reduce the consumption of alcohol among those under the age of 25?  Do they believe people in lower socioeconomic groups will reduce their consumption of alcohol if minimum unit pricing is introduced, or will they continue to drink as they do at present?  The document provided by the research group shows that people in these groups drink an average of 43.2 standard drinks per week.  Will they continue to drink at home or will they go to the local pub?  Do the witnesses believe education plays a role in giving young people an opportunity to understand the serious health issues that are associated with drinking alcohol?  I refer particularly to binge drinking among young teenagers.  I apologise if some of my questions have been asked already.</p></speech>

My colleague, Mr. Colin Angus, will respond to some of them as well.  An overarching point that applies to pretty much everything that has been said is that there is no perfect alcohol policy.  Minimum pricing is not going to solve every problem.  When I read through the heads of the proposed public health (alcohol) Bill, I was encouraged to see that the Government is taking quite a comprehensive approach.  Something similar was done with the alcohol strategy in the UK, although it was eventually gutted.  Not much that was effective was left in the end.  The key thing is that minimum pricing should not be considered on its own.  The question of what minimum pricing will do should be considered alongside the question of what other policies will do.  What does the Government's policy strategy as a whole achieve?  Does it hit all the different things the Government wants to hit?  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in made the point that minimum pricing is particularly effective because it targets the very high levels of consumption of very cheap alcohol among low-income, high-risk drinkers.  We need to be very precise here.  We have examined this issue in the UK.  We had a paper published in <i>The Lancet</i>last year looking at this in particular.  We need to be careful not to make sweeping statements.  It is not that minimum pricing will target the poor - it is that it will target low-income drinkers who are consuming at very high levels.  Low-income drinkers who are consuming at low levels will be largely unaffected because they are simply not buying much of the cheap alcohol that the policy affects.<br/><br/>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in made the relevant point that low-income drinkers who drink at high levels are still low-income drinkers, or people who are financially constrained.  I would respond to that by mentioning that the evidence we have on how alcohol harm occurs suggests that a person with a low income or of a low socioeconomic status suffers a greater risk of harm for each drink he or she consumes than an equivalent person of higher socioeconomic status.  A low-income person who drinks 30 units, or standard drinks, per week is at greater risk than a high-income person who drinks the same amount.  If we want to tackle the harm caused by alcohol, to a certain extent we have to target the low-income heavy drinkers because they are the people who are experiencing a lot of the harm.  We need to ensure we go about that in an equitable way that does not aggravate other problems.  We would argue, on the basis of the evidence we have gathered, that minimum pricing seems to do that.  It seems that people would respond to these price increases not by spending a greater percentage of the family budget on alcohol but by reducing their spending on alcohol, reducing their alcohol consumption and improving their health as a result.  I agree with the suggestion that has been made that this improves the well-being of those around these people as well.  I guess that is my main response to that.<br/><br/>The question of how people are affected by this is a little more complex than it might come across in the service level and in my short presentation.</p><p>While people from all social backgrounds are likely to be buying some alcohol affected by this measure, not all alcohol products are affected equally.  There is a threshold and some alcohol products will be a little below the threshold, while some will be a long way below it.  Lower risk drinkers tend to drink a little of this alcohol.  The higher risk drinkers are the ones who are buying this alcohol which is very cheap.  They will experience some big price increases.  This has to do with how alcohol is sold because if one is buying large quantities, one can buy it at much cheaper prices per standard drink.  The same applies if one is buying cheap spirits which is only bought regularly by heavy drinkers.  They buy certain products which are only bought regularly by those drinking at risky levels.</p><p> Tax was raised as an issue.  A key point is that tax should not be seen as an alternative to minimum pricing.  They should be seen as complementary strategies.  If members want to tackle heavy drinking among higher income groups - they should want to do this - tax may be a better targeted option.  However, there are some problems with it.  The way alcohol is taxed is not fully within the Government's control; it is partly under the control of the European Union.  For example, a bottle of 10% strength wine will cost less per unit than a bottle of 14% strength wine.  This is because the European Union specifies that wine must be taxed by volume, not by alcohol content.  The same applies to cider.  One of the reasons we have very cheap high strength cider in the United Kingdom is we have very low taxes on it and also the tax rate does not increase as the alcohol gets stronger.  One of the recommendations I make to the committee in the long terms is that the Government make the case in Europe for alcohol to be taxed based on the strength of all products.  This would allow a much more rational and health-focused taxation system.  The UK Government is also looking at this issue.  </p><p> Mr. Angus will talk about price distribution.</p></speech>

If members imagine tax as an alternative to minimum pricing, there are issues of targeting in the sense that they would affect all of the alcohol products everyone is buying, not just the very cheap alcohol favoured by the drinkers who suffer the most harm.  We recently published some research which looked at the way retailers responded to changes in tax.  It shows that they did not just flatly increase the price of all products in line with what we all expected following the tax increase.  In the case of very cheap products they increased the price by less than we would have expected and over-shifted onto expensive products.  Retailers are doing what members do not want them to do.  They are increasing the price of the alcohol they want to affect the most by the least amount and increasing greatly the price of the alcohol in which they are less interested because it is very expensive and not drunk by the drinkers suffering most of the harm.</p></speech>

As I said, a broad strategic approach is needed which touches a wide range of bases.  International evidence suggests pricing is one of the most effective ways of tackling the issue of the hard caused by alcohol.  The way it is implemented is clear.  The effects are consistent in that it tackles both consumption and harm, but that is not to say pricing is the only option the committee could consider.</p> <p>  A few members mentioned education.  Education is important, but the evidence suggests that on its own it will not reduce problem drinking because there are too many other influences on the reasons people drink.  There is too much advertising which shapes alcohol as a desirable product and appeals to young people in certain ways, while there is too much cheap alcohol available.  Therefore, the level of availability is too high to say education will solve the problem.  However, we do need to teach young people about the dangers of alcohol, but that education might be more effective if the system in which alcohol was retailed and promoted was got right first.  It is, therefore, about having a comprehensive strategy.</p> <p>  There are proposals before members on the labelling of products.  There is not a great amount of evidence that it will reduce consumption, but there is evidence that it will increase consumers' understanding of the risks associated with drinking,  It should knowledge of what is contained in the alcohol and specific risks such as drinking during pregnancy.  This is more likely to affect behaviour if the influence on behaviour of cheap alcohol and advertising was reduced.  There is also a point to be made about consumer rights in that people have a right to know what they are drinking.</p> <p>  With regard to the industry and disinformation, we have experienced a good deal of this.  Members raised questions about the way the industry had responded to this policy, which is supported in Canada.  I am not sure if it supported it when it was brought forward several decades ago, but it generally support it because it makes it money, as we have discussed.  However, in the United Kingdom the off-trade retailers who will be most affected are strongly opposed to it because they do not want alcohol sales to be regulated.  We suspect that they know this policy will have an impact and it will impact most on the heaviest drinkers.  The top 10% of drinkers in the United Kingdom consume 30% of the alcohol drunk, while the top 30% consume 80%.  When we talk about the industry selling responsibly, it makes a huge chunk of its profits from those who drink alcohol above what is deemed to be the responsible level.  It is, therefore, in its interests to ensure policies which regulate drinking or seek to reduce heavy drinking are not implemented.</p></speech>

The point in setting out units is largely to help the public understand the quantities they drink because drinks have different strengths and the problem is that they generally do not know the strength of what they are consuming.  It would be helpful for consumers if unit or standard drink information was placed on products.  If it were placed alongside information indicating what the chief medical officer or the Department of Health recommended as a low risk drinking level, that would be helpful.</p> <p>  On the information the industry gives and the way it has consistently attacked our research, it has been the practice for it or consultancies it has funded to attack it, or it subject to attacks from libertarians who are ideologically opposed to public health policies generally.  They have tried to misrepresent our research by misrepresenting the methods used or the results to place it in a slightly different light.  They often pick up on small elements and either misrepresent them or exaggerate their importance.  Let me give a few examples.  International evidence suggests heavier drinkers are slightly less responsive to price than other drinkers.  They are just a little less responsive, but we often find that the industry presents them as being unresponsive, which is wrong.  It is simply not the case.</p></speech>

However, the industry misrepresents this in stating they are not more responsive to price.  That is what we have been saying all along; it will try to defame the evidence, irrespective of the findings.</p></speech>

Each time, because of inflation, an increasingly smaller proportion of the market is affected if we keep to the same minimum unit price.  The industry has represented this as us correcting rather than updating our estimates.  There is a sense that we are being undermined in a slightly underhand way.  The reason it undermines it is it does not have any evidence to support its case that pricing policies are ineffective.</p><p>All the international evidence agrees that increasing the price of alcohol reduces consumption and reduces harm.  They have tried to undermine this because they do not have evidence to suggest anything different.  When the committee hears evidence from the industry, I urge the members to press industry for the details of its evidence because that is where it begins to become clear that the industry's evidence is not quite what it appears.</p></speech>

There is a short paragraph in the report about the industry approaches which states that the researchers, whom that committee had in at the beginning, stated the industry is always sniping at their research.  The short summary states the House of Lords committee, after it had spoken to the industry, sympathised with the academics because the industry was quick to pick holes in the research and try to knock it but was reluctant or unable to provide evidence to support its own perspective.  it would merely knock the evidence of others without being able to support its own position with evidence.</p> <p>  There are a few other points.  It might be helpful to give a few descriptive statistics about the population.  According to the definitions Dr. Holmes described, 78% of the population drink at moderate levels.  That is the vast majority.  The 22% of the population who drink at increasing or high-risk levels are drinking 66% of all of the alcohol and spending 61% of the total spent on alcohol.  The consumption or spending is concentrated predominately in this small group, and these consumers account for almost all alcohol related deaths and 87%, by our estimates, of alcohol related hospital admissions.  Therefore, the problem is quite concentrated in a relatively small group who also happen to be those who buy the cheapest alcohol, which is why minimum pricing is a well-targeted measure.</p> <p>  On the distinction between those in poverty and those not in poverty, to return to the beginning of the questions, those in poverty are more likely to be abstainers.  Some 30% of those living in poverty do not drink at all compared with 20% of the rest of the population.  Those who drink alcohol at increasing risk levels drink less than their counterparts living above the poverty line.  That switches around when one looks at the high-risk drinkers.  High-risk drinkers in poverty drink more, and are buying a lot more of the very cheapest alcohol right at the bottom of Dr. Holmes' distribution.  The proportion of the population which is drinking at these high-risk levels is similar among those in poverty and those not in poverty, at just over 5%.  In terms of absolute numbers, they number 36,000 of those in poverty and 150,000 of those not in poverty.  It is inaccurate to state that all the high-risk drinkers are in the lowest income groups.  There are many people on higher incomes who are drinking at harmful levels.  As Dr. Holmes stated, those living in poverty are buying the cheapest alcohol and suffering the highest rates of harm.  The rates of deaths and hospital admissions is approximately 40% higher among them than among those not living in poverty.  These are the people one would want to target if one's aim is reducing harm.</p> <p>  On price distributions, I have some beautiful graphs in the report that I was proud of having produced which disaggregate prices into different types of drink.  In doing that, I can no longer tell the committee exactly the median for all types of drink.</p></speech>

The split, between the on and off-trade, is roughly 50:50.  These are ballpark figures.</p></speech>

Our model works only on a yearly basis.  We estimate that when prices go up, we would see a change in consumption within a year.  That is what the evidence internationally suggests.  When prices change, one sees a quite short-run effect.  I suspect it is not immediate, but I would anticipate that within weeks one would begin to see quite big changes in consumption because, ultimately, consumers make purchasing decisions based on the prices they see.  There are some slightly more lagged cultural changes that happen as well as a result of a price.</p> <p>  The health effects are not immediate.  That is because some of those who are drinking heavily today will not die from their drinking until ten or 20 years in the future.  It takes time to develop liver cirrhosis and alcohol related cancers.  Similarly, there are also people alive today who, even if they stopped drinking today, will die of liver cirrhosis.  They have already contracted it.  It is not curable.  They might die later if they stop drinking, but they will die of it.  There is what we call a time lag and, after 20 years, we assume we will see the full health effects where all those effects are played out and we see the full impact.  One will see quite a big chunk of the health effects immediately and the report provides some evidence on what we estimate one would see following the first year, but one would see the full effects emerge over the next 20 years.</p> <p>  Whether we would see in Ireland the 4.4% reduction in consumption that has been reported on average in the international literature is quite difficult to answer because it is an average across many countries at different times.</p></speech>

It is quite different.</p> <p>  I would say that Ireland is likely to see an impact.  It is likely to be substantial and to be of that order of magnitude, but I could not say it will be 2% or 7%.

In terms of alcohol, the main difference between Ireland and Northern Ireland is that the taxes are a bit higher in the Republic, particularly on certain products, especially wine and cider.  Broadly, there are similar drinking cultures.  The cost of living is also a bit higher in the Republic but broadly I would expect to see similar effects between the two countries.  I would not expect the effects of minimum unit pricing to vary massively across the United Kingdom and Ireland.</p></speech>

Partly, that is to do with where they do their drinking.  In the Republic, consumers do more of their drinking in the on-trade - in pubs and restaurants - where alcohol is more expensive anyway and will be almost entirely unaffected by a minimum price.  In Northern Ireland, distribution is slightly different.  Consumers do more of their drinking at home and more of their total alcohol consumption is potentially affected.  They also have a slightly higher baseline rate of alcohol related health harm and they stand to gain slightly more for each incremental reduction in consumption, but the order of magnitude is similar.</p></speech>

Minimum pricing, or at least something close to what is being proposed in Ireland and in the United Kingdom, has not really been tried anywhere else in Canada.  Russia and some of the other former Soviet states have had minimum prices, say on vodka or beer, but those countries are quite different because they have large illicit markets, high rates of alcohol consumption and significant problems of alcohol dependence of an order of magnitude greater than we see in western Europe.  What has gone on in those countries, because the policies and context are different, cannot tell us much that is helpful.</p> <p>  The United Kingdom and Ireland are pioneers in terms of trying to implement this policy in a systematic way.  That means we do not have a significant amount of evaluation evidence.  We only have what has come from Canada.  That is why our modelling has become so important.</p><p> What is important about our modelling is that it is not directly based on previous minimum price policies.  It synthesises all the best evidence we have available on the relationship between prices and consumption and between consumption and harm.  We bring that together, ask what we know and set out what we do not know.  We also try and help policy-makers think about what those things we do not know might mean for the effects of a policy.  The general conclusion has been that there are some uncertainties, there may be some unintended consequences but we remain pretty confident that harm reductions overall would ensue from a policy.</p><p> There were questions about what else works, and the point was raised about very high-risk drinkers or dependent drinkers.  Minimum pricing is not a silver bullet.  It is a public health policy.  It is about the 20% to 30% of people who drink above recommended limits and thereby increase their risk of health problems.  It is not about those very heavy dependent drinkers who have a much more narrowly defined problem.  If one wants to tackle those people, there are alternative policies which can help.  We are talking about treatment, in particular.  A recommendation we would certainly make is adequate resourcing and alcohol treatment services.  Treatment has been shown to be effective.</p><p> Many dependent drinkers buy large quantities of cheap alcohol, so they will be directly affected by minimum pricing.  Therefore, we would expect to see some reduction in their consumption.  It might not stop them being dependent drinkers, but it might reduce their drinking from 120 standards drinks per week, or far more in some cases, to 100 standard drinks per week.  That might not sound like a lot, but in terms of their risk of suffering health problems, it really makes a difference, particularly when one aggregates that across a few hundred thousand people drinking at that level.</p><p> Dependent drinkers do not emerge out of nowhere.  They become dependent drinkers for many reasons.  One of the things that facilitates their addiction is the availability of large quantities of cheap alcohol.  We do not model this aspect and there is not a huge amount of evidence for same, but it is reasonable to expect that the removal of very cheap alcohol from a market will prevent some of tomorrow's dependent drinkers reaching very high consumption levels.</p><p> There were questions on how I might change the culture of drinking and whether people would return to pubs and restaurants.  That is not something we model directly.  Our work is quite data driven.  There is a lot of evidence on how much people drink but there is not a lot of evidence on where they are drinking their alcohol.  Therefore, we have to make some inferences and map across from evidence on retail revenue for different sectors.  I will explain what we expect to see.  We know from various research that one of the reasons people drink less in pubs is because supermarkets and shop prices are much lower.  That is a factor which helps people to drink at home instead.  As prices go up, we would expect to see some people return to pubs and restaurants.  Cultural issues have also driven this change.  In the heyday of the pub we did not have the wine market we have now and wine is a product that people primarily consume at home.  Society has also changed.  People work longer hours, they generally go out more, they live less in communities, particularly middle-class people, and they commute more and live more in the city and urban centres.  There are other reasons for the decline in the pub market than just prices.  None the less, we would expect some impact, or at least we would hypothesise there could be some impact from minimum pricing.</p><p> I was asked about the impact on young people.  I can say that people are affected by this policy to the extent that they buy the alcohol that is affected, or at least that is what we can be more confident about.  Young people tend not to buy huge amounts of this cheap alcohol because they tend to drink more of the on-trade.  The price in the pub will not be affected by the policy as it is already well above the minimum price threshold.  That said, young people do buy cheap alcohol and are price responsive because they tend to have lower incomes.  Therefore, we would expect the policy to have some impact on them.  When we looked at this aspect in the UK, although we did not look at the impact on young people directly in our Irish report, we did do so in our UK and Scottish reports and we have seen some impacts.  They are greater than the impacts on moderate drinkers and smaller than the impacts on heavy drinkers, but none the less they exist.</p></speech>

They change people's intentions but they do not necessarily affect behaviour.  It comes down again to the point that in a very liberalised alcohol market with relatively little regulation on how alcohol is marketed, the prices at which it can be sold and the level of overall availability in shops, simple messaging might not be enough on its own to change behaviour.  None the less, there are impacts, just not necessarily on behaviour.</p> <p>  There were questions on how to choose minimum price and increase it over time.  In terms of choosing it, one must balance the impact on moderate drinkers against the impact of bigger health benefits.  Clearly, the higher one goes with a minimum price, the bigger the health effects, although if one goes so high, it may result in a big restructuring of the alcohol market.  The industry might fundamentally decide this is not the way to should sell certain products any more and make other products.  In that case our estimates would start to become rather less robust.</p> <p>  One trades off in terms of the bigger health impact.  It is obvious that the greater the level of alcohol consumed by low risk drinkers that is affected, the bigger the effects one will have on them.  The question for the committee and the Government is how much impact they are willing to accept on low-risk drinkers to get the bigger health effects.  That is not a question we can answer.  We could make a recommendation but it would just be our personal view that is based on our personal values, so I am not sure that is especially helpful.</p> <p>  In terms of how one increases minimum pricing over time, the Scottish Government has faced this question as well but has not answered it, as far as I am aware.  It said that it needed a mechanism and needed to think about what that mechanism would be, but it has not made a decision yet.  Some obvious things to think about are inflation.  We talk a lot in alcohol research about affordability, which is inflation adjusted to take account of household and personal incomes.  The committee and Government may want to look at whether one can set a threshold that stays the same in order that a minimum price keeps cheap alcohol equally affordable over time.  Within that, one might like to think about equally affordable for whom.  One might find one is making it increasingly unaffordable because the metric is from the population and not from low-income people.  If the metric is based on affordability generated by a population average and not from the low-income people, one might find that one changes affordability for certain groups more than others over time.  There are some quite complex things to think about.  We hope to start research on this issue in the near future.</p></speech>

The evidence that exists has been reviewed but it has been found to be quite inconsistent.  Sometimes and with some drugs, people will substitute them for alcohol.  Other people with other drugs will treat them as complements.  That means that if they stop drinking, they will also stop taking the other drugs or they will reduce both.</p></speech>

There has been some movement to do so in the UK by the UK alcohol industry as part of the public health responsibility deal with which the committee may be familiar.  The industry promised to take 1 billion units out of the market by reducing the strength of some existing beverages.  That has involved beers like Stella and Heineken being reduced from 5% alcohol by volume to 4.8% ABV.  It also involved introducing and promoting new low-strength beverages.</p> <p>  On the surface, that is probably a good thing.  It is a good thing if we provide more options to consumers.  It is a good thing if we provide people with the opportunity to drink lower strength drinks, if they want to.</p><p>There is very little evidence that these policies are effective in reducing consumption because we do not know who is drinking those lower strength drinks.  It might be that the moderate drinkers are now drinking the same amount they were before but are adding some lower strength drinks on days they would not otherwise have drunk.  Similarly, abstainers may now be drinking some low-strength drinks.  We do not know what is going on.  The industry has made some claims that it has succeeded in this billion unit pledge.  We dispute that and the committee will hear more about that in the coming weeks.<br/><br/>A nice example of substitution versus complements for illicit drugs is that young people&rsquo;s alcohol consumption is falling off a cliff in the UK.  There are far more abstainers and far more young people drinking at lower levels than ever in recent years.  This seems to be a very consistent and robust trend.  The interesting point is that it is not being replaced by young people doing other things.  They are not taking up smoking, or smoking more cannabis or taking more ecstasy.  The data does not cover legal highs so we do not know what is happening there.  The suggestion seems to be that when alcohol consumption is falling among young people, consumption of other substances is falling as well.<br/><br/>I forgot to make one point about the industry.  Our research has been published in a wide variety of scientific journals, the world's leading medical journals, <i>British Medical Journal</i>and <i>The Lancet</i>.  The World Health Organization, WHO, has also picked it up and recommended it, as have the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE, in the UK and a whole range of royal medical colleges in the UK and abroad, and their equivalents.  By contrast there has not been a single publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal which has criticised our work in any substantial way.  There have been a couple of suggestions for how we might build on it but nothing has said this work is simply wrong.  That is quite important.  The publications the industry cites are soft publications, think tank reports, things they have submitted to committees such as this one.  There is no credible scientific attack on our research that has not been funded by the alcohol industry.</p></speech>

For the low risk drinkers we estimate a reduction of &euro;4.50 per year, almost no impact on their spending.  For increasing risk drinkers it is &euro;41 and for high risk it is a reduction of &euro;60.  They are small savings impacts.  We do not estimate that the policy would lead to a reduction in the budget for other things for people in low income households because although the alcohol they buy is more expensive, they buy less of it and that cancels it out.</p> <p>  There was a question about people substituting down, in other words, if the market reshuffles itself do people start buying cheaper alcohol.  In a sense that is incorporated in the price elasticities that we use to estimate all of this.  That is incorporated into our estimates of impact on consumption.  What it does not consider is if one believes that cheaper alcohol is fundamentally worse in some way than the same volume bought at a higher price.  The evidence does not necessarily suggest that.  The harmful component is the alcohol.  The evidence even suggests that illicit alcohol is harmful only in the sense that it is strong and has lots of alcohol not because it has some other nasty chemicals that are also bad for one. </p> <p>  Younger people tend to drink more on average and it is true that they drink more in the pubs.  The gradient across age is not that great.  By our estimates, approximately 38% of their consumption is in the off trade whereas it is 46% or 47% for 35 to 54 year olds.  There is not a huge difference.  One might expect, although we do not have the figures here, that the impact of the policies on their consumption overall is quite similar.  It is important to note that young people do not tend to suffer as much alcohol-related harm because they are young and not as ill.  Young people do not tend to die as much as older people.  That is a fact of life.  If one is interested in the harm outcomes one will see that the policy has a much smaller impact on young people.  That is because their baseline rate of harm is very low to start with.</p></speech>

The low risk drinkers are largely unaffected but they are affected to a small degree.  Although costs for the harm caused by alcohol vary, they run into several billion euro in Ireland.  The low risk drinkers are paying for that, through taxes and as victims of some of the problems such as alcohol-related crime and the general social disorder.  Some victims of alcohol-related harm are some of the most vulnerable people in our society.  The poor suffer worse consequences of their drinking than the better off.  There are victims of alcohol-fuelled domestic violence, the broader victims of alcohol-related crime and the dependent drinkers whose drinking is facilitated and perpetuated by the availability of cheap alcohol.  It is for the Government to balance the different priorities and reach a decision.  There are solid arguments about why everyone in society should make a contribution to reducing the harm alcohol causes because that will benefit society as a whole and some of the most vulnerable people in society.</p></speech>

I also believe that we will have in Ireland a near unique opportunity to do original research but also to confirm the Canadian research if we do this.  We should set about doing this prospectively and put structures in place to collect all of the relevant health and consumption data.  If we are asked to renew this legislation at some stage we will be in a good position to show its real impacts.</p> <p>  On a very minor medical point, the reason some people think the same number of units of different forms of alcohol has different effects is that some of the other effects of alcohol that we are aware of, apart from the effect on the liver, cancer causation, etc., are due to some of the congeners in alcohol.  For instance, one might have a worse hangover for the same number of units of alcohol in different kinds of drink depending on some of the other chemicals present.  It does not mean less damage to the liver if one does not have a hangover from a &ldquo;purer&rdquo; or less adulterated alcoholic drink.  That is not how it works. </p></speech>

I am not going to labour the point but it will be a missed opportunity to use the additional revenue for good and required purposes, particularly focused on the victims of alcohol abuse.  That sadly will continue.  We need to be mindful of that and I do not want to see the opportunity missed but it would appear from the draft legislation that course will not be taken.</p></speech>

Rather than treat it as a tax and take money from all retailers there would be a levy on the large ones which would claw back some of the additional money they got from alcohol sales.</p><p>I am not sure what happened in that regard.  Minimum unit pricing has not yet been introduced in Scotland.  I am not sure whether that provision made it into the legislation.  The committee might consider the introduction of a levy on specific retailers as an alternative to minimum pricing.  </p><p> On the point about evaluation, obviously we agree that research is necessary.  We discussed that issue with officials from the Department prior to the meeting.  In Scotland, one of the limitations in terms of how it has been able to evaluate its alcohol strategy has been the lack of good quality baseline data.  Data collection needs to be done prior to commencement of the parliamentary process.  It is not acceptable to wait until the legislation has been passed to commence data collection.  A lack of sufficient baseline data results in a weak evaluation.  Data collection needs to commence early if a proper evaluation is to be made.</p></speech>

As per the Scottish pricing data, bottles of wine which were previously sold for just under the minimum price threshold have increased during the past three or four years to just above that threshold.  It is unlikely that that is a coincidence.  Some of the impact of the policy will be lost because the industry will already have started to react it.</p></speech>
