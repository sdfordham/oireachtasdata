    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-04a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1319" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017040400002#A00200"><p>On behalf of the joint committee, I sincerely welcome the British ambassador, His Excellency Mr. Robin Barnett, and his team to the meeting today.  Ambassador Barnett has served as British ambassador to Ireland since September 2016, and I have already had the pleasure of meeting him just over a month ago when we discussed many aspects of our bilateral relationship, both inside and outside the EU.</p><p>All members are acutely aware that we live in very historic and challenging times.  Last Wednesday was no exception as the British Prime Minister, Ms Theresa May, formally started the Brexit process.  This process now presents many challenges for all of us as the UK and EU enter a new phase in their relationship.  As members are all aware, Ireland and the United Kingdom have a strong, mutual and unique relationship.  Engagement between both countries will continue to be as important as it has been in the past.  As such, I am delighted to further it today.  I look forward to a detailed, positive and constructive discussion following the ambassador's opening statement.</p><p>Members are reminded of the longstanding parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter but continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Before the ambassador begins, I would like to tell him something about our members that he will find very interesting.  I am very proud of the political track record of the members of this committee.  It might be of interest to the ambassador to note that the committee's political experience amounts to 218 years.  We are not exactly a very big committee but we have 218 years of political experience.  I am not going to name anyone in particular but there are two members on my right who between them have 84 years of political experience.  One has 41 years under his belt and the other has 43.  I thought the ambassador might be interested in that useless piece of information.</p><p>I thank the ambassador and his officials again for coming here today.  I invite him to address the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-04a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Robin Barnett" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017040400002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators very much for the invitation to address the committee today.  I am well aware of the very important contribution that this and other committees here at Leinster House make to the democratic process.  Indeed, one of my very first engagements as ambassador to Ireland was to address the Ceann Comhairle's EU symposium at the Mansion House, where I met many Members of the Houses for the first time.  I and my team attach great importance to engaging with members of the Oireachtas and will continue to ensure that we regularly spend time at Leinster House.  We will always be at the disposal of members of this committee.<br/><br/><b></b>The strong ties between Irish and UK parliamentarians are a really important element of our broader bilateral relationship, as evidenced by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, among other things.  It is in this context that I am here today to speak about the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.  I propose to say a few words about the letter submitted from the Prime Minister to European Council President, Donald Tusk and about the next stages in the process, and I intend to say a little about the UK-Ireland dimension.  Then I look forward to hearing members' comments and trying to answer any questions they may have.  <br/><br/>As members are all aware, the Prime Minister wrote to the President of the European Council, Mr. Donald Tusk, notifying him of the UK's intention to withdraw from the European Union, in accordance with Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union.  Upon receipt of this letter, the two-year period for conducting the exit negotiations has begun.<br/><br/>The European Council will now agree guidelines on the EU's negotiating position, which we expect to be agreed at the European Council meeting on 29 April.  Once these guidelines are agreed, the European Commission will present its first draft negotiating mandate for adoption by the remaining EU member states.  Once that mandate has been approved, the Commission will formally open negotiations with the UK.  For our part, we stand ready to start talks on the substance as soon as possible.<br/><br/>I am sure members have all seen the text of the letter, which brings together what we are proposing to our European partners as the basis for a smooth negotiation process.  My Prime Minister has set the UK's guiding principles.  The UK's unique relationship with Ireland and the importance of the peace process in Northern Ireland comprise one of those principles.  If I may, I will set out some of those principles before returning to discuss Ireland, which is, I am sure, one of our main interests here today.<br/><br/>First, in withdrawing from the EU, our overarching commitment is to ensuring that Europe remains strong and prosperous, capable of projecting its values, leading in the world, and defending itself from threats.  Through a new deep and special partnership, we want the UK to play its part in achieving these goals, and I hope that members will agree that such a partnership is in all our interests, including Ireland's.<br/><br/>On trade, we want to work towards securing a comprehensive agreement, taking into account both economic and security co-operation.  We propose a bold and ambitious free trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union.  Given the scale of bilateral trade, running at over &euro;1 billion per week and employing more than 400,000 people, in addition to the strong trading relationships we enjoy with other EU member states, we believe that such an agreement would be in the best interests of Ireland and of all our EU partners.<br/><br/>Crucially, we also want to work together to minimise disruption and to give as much certainty as possible.  In particular, the Prime Minister placed great importance on putting all our citizens first, in the UK and EU, and aiming to strike an early agreement on their rights.  We are clear that providing certainty is in the best interest of our citizens, as well as our businesses and investors, in all of our countries.  I have heard that message loud and clear right across Ireland.<br/><br/>We recognise that two years is not a long time to reach a comprehensive settlement.  We start, however, from a position of close regulatory alignment, trust in each other's institutions and a spirit of co-operation stretching back decades.  Therefore, we believe that a comprehensive agreement can be agreed in the time period set out in the treaty.  Let me emphasise here that we will approach these negotiations constructively and respectfully.  It is in the interests of the UK and the EU that our exit be as smooth and orderly as possible.<br/><br/>The UK Government starts from a clear position of what is at stake for Ireland.  As members know, the Prime Minister's letter sets out &ndash; I quote in full &ndash; that:</p><blockquote>The Republic of Ireland is the only EU member state with a land border with the United Kingdom.  <font color="#00201F">We want to avoid a return to a hard border between our two countries, to be able to maintain the Common Travel Area between us, and to make sure that the UK's withdrawal from the EU does not harm the Republic of Ireland.  We also have an important responsibility to make sure that nothing is done to jeopardise the peace process in Northern Ireland, and to continue to uphold the Belfast Agreement.</font></blockquote><p>When they met here at Government Buildings in January, the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach confirmed their support for a "seamless, frictionless Border" and the continuation of the common travel area.  This is now reflected firmly in our negotiating principles.  Both then and last week, the British Prime Minister reaffirmed her personal commitment to strengthening this significant and crucial relationship as the UK leaves the European Union, EU.  At every level of government, we are committed to ensuring this relationship continues to prosper.  Of course, both our Governments remain committed to upholding the Belfast Agreement and its institutions.  It is vital that devolved government and all of the institutions under the successive agreements are returned and operate in Northern Ireland as soon as possible.  The British Government&rsquo;s unrelenting focus is on achieving that objective.</p><p> The UK and Ireland enjoy a special and unique relationship.  It is testament to the importance of the relationship that the Taoiseach was the first foreign leader to visit Prime Minister May in Downing Street.  Since then, there has been consistent high-level ministerial engagement.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Prime Minister have all visited Dublin in the past six months.  Our existing contacts at official level continue; last September we hosted in London the annual summit of Irish Secretaries General and UK Permanent Secretaries, which is again another unique and important facet of our bilateral co-operation.  Of course, there has been regular and close co-operation between parliamentarians.  We have received delegations from the House of Lords European Union committee, the House of Commons Select Committee on Exiting the European Union, a delegation from the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs.  A delegation of UK parliamentarians also came to Dublin for a very successful CHAMP event with a focus on peace and reconciliation.  I know that many committee members engaged enthusiastically with these delegations.</p><p> I am also aware that many Oireachtas Members are regular visitors to Westminster and I am very keen to encourage and facilitate as much co-operation as possible between our two Parliaments.  One of my main priorities since arriving in Ireland just over six months ago has been to speak to, and much more important, to listen to as many people as possible about the challenges and opportunities they see ahead.  I have attached particular importance to engaging with communities in the Border counties.  I have, for example, spoken to a Brexit forum in Monaghan alongside Ministers, Deputy Heather Humphreys and Deputy Michael Creed.  This visit also gave me the opportunity to hear first-hand about the problems, for example, that mushroom suppliers have been experiencing, as well as the forward-looking preparations that local businesses are taking to ensure they remain competitive.  Last month I was in Donegal where I had the opportunity to witness the excellent collaboration between the city and county councils of Donegal and Derry-Strabane.  The joint report published by these two councils sets out the opportunities and challenges faced by the north-west city region.  I am mindful of the many successful regional interdependencies, such as this these, which have developed in recent years.  On my travels, I have also seen the excellent collaboration between start-ups such as Dogpatch Labs here in Dublin, which the Chancellor of the Exchequer visited, and Ludgate in Skibbereen and its British counterparts.  I have every confidence in the creativity and energy of companies such as these and the private sector more broadly to make the most of every opportunity in the years ahead.</p><p> Before I hand over to the Chairman, let me reassure members that the UK is not turning its back on the world.  That could not be further from the truth.  We want to play our part in making sure Europe remains strong and prosperous, projecting its values and able to lead in the world.  On the world stage, the UK is playing and will continue to play a leading role, whether in the area of humanitarian assistance, the fight to end modern slavery and human trafficking or tackling climate change.</p><p> I hope I have given the committee a clear sense of the UK&rsquo;s position as it heads into these negotiations, especially as it relates to Ireland.  My job and that of my embassy team here is to work hard to promote and support our strong bilateral relationship and ensure that the shared concerns that both the UK and Ireland have for the future are taken into account.  As British Prime Minister Theresa May has said, the task ahead of us is momentous but not beyond us.  I now look forward to hearing from members.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-04a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1399" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017040400002#B00300"><p>I join in welcoming the ambassador and we appreciate him coming here.  He has had a slightly lively first six months in his posting but the engagement we have had with him and his team at the embassy has been very positive up to now.  I will touch on three areas alluded to in the statement but which perhaps did not get much detail in the address.  I would appreciate it if the ambassador could expand a little on them.</p> <p>  The first relates to future bilateral ties.  In the context of Brexit, the Irish Government is limited and will have to negotiate as part of the bloc of the remaining 27 EU member states.  That is widely accepted.  However, we are fortunate we have excellent alternative bilateral institutions already in place, such as the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and council.  I said to the ambassador's counterpart in Irish Government circles that there is a major role for these institutions post-Brexit and we could really see the British-Irish Council increase its workload from two summits per year to 12.  That would replace the amount of ministerial contact that Ministers have at a European Council level.  What are the thoughts of the witness in that respect?</p> <p>  I will probably be the only person to raise the future of the Commonwealth but I will do it anyway.  How important is that institution to the UK with respect to possible economic and social ties?  A third issue is one about which I am very concerned, and this is shared by many people.  It has dominated the media in the UK up to the past couple of days, when Gibraltar seems to have taken over for whatever reason.  It is the so-called Brexit bill.  I have been back and forth to Brussels, as have my colleagues, so many times and we have had really good engagements, as the ambassador mentioned, with counterparts from both the House of Commons and the House of Lords.  I am worried there is an obsession about what has been called a Brexit bill or divorce payment.  This relates to agreements entered into in good faith that are binding until 2020 and which deliver a return.  Is there a chance the British Government might be prepared to park this obsession with a so-called amount that elements in the Houses of Parliament and more particularly in the media in the UK have focused on?  That would allow tangible negotiations on really important matters to take place in the first two years.  We should not allow all negotiations to fall apart because of people becoming obsessed with a figure of 60 billion, whether it is in sterling or euro.  The numbers are bouncing about and will ultimately be paid but they are not the big issue.  What is more important is what happens in the next 50 years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-04a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1360" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017040400002#B00400"><p>I welcome the ambassador and thank him for engaging with us.  I know he met many of us in different capacities in his short time here and he is willing to engage with us.  He is very accessible and I appreciate he has gone to Monaghan and Donegal.  He has done his best to deal with the issue of Brexit, communicate the message of the British Government to us and listen to us and our concerns from an Irish perspective.</p><p> Article 50 has been triggered.  I think most of us would give a cautious welcome to page 5 of Prime Minister Theresa May's letter where she talks about the unique relationship with the Republic of Ireland and the importance of the peace process in Northern Ireland.  She mentions the need to avoid a hard Border between our two countries and the need to maintain the common travel area.  She states that we should make sure that the UK's withdrawal from the EU does not harm the Republic of Ireland.  She also states that nothing should be done to jeopardise the peace process in Northern Ireland and she speaks of the necessity to continue to uphold the Good Friday Agreement.  From an Irish perspective, I think we should also give a cautious welcome to the draft guidelines published by the European Council President which refer to the paramount importance of preserving the gains of our peace process and call for flexible and imaginative solutions to avoid the creation of a hard Border.  There is also a reference, as the ambassador will know, to the existing bilateral agreements and arrangements between the UK and Ireland.</p><p> With regard to the negotiations, I presume the ambassador would agree with us here in Ireland that the talks on the separation and the talks on the future relationship should run as close as possible in parallel because this would avoid uncertainty for Irish businesses and Irish citizens.  I am of the view that this is a matter on which we could agree.</p><p> I want to raise the issue of Gibraltar, which has been very much in the news in recent few days.  It would seem that Spain in particular has got some sort of a veto in regard to the negotiations and we in Ireland are beginning to wonder why we did not get a similar veto put into the guidelines.  I wonder what the ambassador thinks about how this has unfolded in the days following the publication of the guidelines.  That the final deal will be decided by qualified majority voting is a concern for us and I would be interested to hear the ambassador's view.</p><p> I presume the British Government is working hard on the implications of Brexit for the Good Friday Agreement.  For example, one issue is the position regarding the European Convention on Human Rights in view of the fact that there is talk that the UK will introduce a UK bill of rights to supersede that.  This would seem to be at odds with the Good Friday Agreement, in which the British Government is committed to complete incorporation into Northern Ireland law of the European Convention on Human Rights, with direct access to the courts.  There is worry in that regard, and that is just one issue arising out of the implications of Brexit for the Good Friday Agreement.  All of us would obviously want to preserve that Agreement and I wonder what in-depth work is being undertaken to ensure it survives.</p><p> Is the ambassador concerned about the break-up of the UK?  Obviously, Scotland is now talking about a new independence referendum and the issue of Irish unity does seem to have come back on the agenda here as a result of Brexit and for obvious reasons.  I wonder what the British Government feels about that.  Is the ambassador of the view that this independence movement is unstoppable because of the economic and considerations arising out of Brexit?  I would be interested to hear the views of the British Government on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-04a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017040400002#C00200"><p>I welcome the ambassador and thank him for his interesting address.  We all recognise the importance of the time that lies ahead.  I think we are all committed to ensuring that we use that time extremely well as we approach the decisions that have to be taken cautiously and with great care to ensure that we do not damage each other's future, the future of the European Union, the UK-Ireland relationship and the Northern Ireland peace process, on which we have already set out our priorities.  That is not just an emotional response; it is practical also.  The practicality of having a borderless island of Ireland in recent years has been an experience we did not have before and it has worked extremely well.  Trade on both parts of the island has progressed immeasurably, business people on both sides of the frontier have gained the benefits of that borderless island to which I refer.  There is more to come of much greater potential than has been seen before.  Later today, I go to one of our universities to talk on the same subject and, in the next week, we will have people from Northern Ireland addressing a similar debate.</p> <p>  At this stage, we should try to identity the issues in respect of we have something in common, both with the EU and with our colleagues in the UK, and emphasise them rather than emphasising the differences.  We know what the differences and difficulties are going to be.  We know that in future we will require a relationship between Ireland and the UK and between the UK and the EU, on which we will have a negotiating position from inside the EU.  If we identify and set aside the issues that are going to be most contentious and try to address the common areas for a start, we will make progress.  Nothing succeeds like success.  Progress will be achieved on the easier rather than on the more difficult issues and will allow us to show results.</p> <p>  We need to ensure we are not seen to intimidate any of the people of Northern Ireland or to coerce them into a situation that might seem to our advantage now.  It is to their advantage and our advantage to ensure that we progress as we have for the past number of years with that borderless island of Ireland.</p> <p>  I foresee difficulties arising in respect of the customs union and the common travel area.  This matter is not beyond resolution, however, and I think it can be done once the negotiators who have an interest in resolving the problems recognise that it is attainable.  Of course, people will raise various red flags in the next 12 months, identifying issues which may seem fundamental to many countries throughout the EU.  However, nobody in the EU should avail of this process in order to set aside the ideals on which the Union was first founded.  It would be a great tragedy if that were to happen and would be an even greater tragedy if it were to become acceptable among any of the EU member states, including Ireland, or in the UK.  We would then find ourselves sliding into an abyss of uncertainty, doubt and suspicion.  Things have an unfortunate habit of being triggered in such a way as to make life extremely difficult.  We do not want to go back to 1930s thinking, whereby nationalism came to the fore across Europe, and we all know what happened.</p> <p>  I hope that in the next number of months we will both be in a position to establish those points that we see as most important, to have them embedded in the detail of what will be agreed from here on and to allow the positive rather than the negative to prevail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-04a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1420" speakername="Paul Coghlan" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017040400002#C00300"><p>I welcome the ambassador.  We all appreciate very much that he and Mr. Welsh would do nothing to harm the unique and special relationship between our two countries, as the Prime Minister put it in her letter.  As the UK is going to be outside the Union, it is very important, as some of my colleagues have said, that we do everything to strengthen and improve the ties between us.  We can do that in different ways.  The British Irish Parliamentary Assembly, BIPA, is an obvious area that can be strengthened and it can meet more often, as can CHAMP, and there are other organisations.  That is important work which we must bear in mind and pay attention to.  Obviously, like the UK, we want to do nothing to damage the relationship.</p> <p>  Like others, I appreciate very much what the Prime Minister wrote in her letter to President Tusk.</p><p>However, is there a contradiction or a little problem in that the Prime Minister has said very definitely that the UK intends to leave the customs union and the Single Market?  There will have to be a little give and take in the negotiations because the Prime Minister in her letter states that the UK, like our good selves, does not want a return to a hard border, and we want to maintain the common travel area.  In other words, we want Britain to have whatever would be akin to the Single Market.  I do not know what one would call it, but that is what we want and what the UK wants.  I hope this can be resolved in the give and take of negotiation, as Deputy Durkan said.</p><p> I think we all now realise more than previously that the UK's exit from the EU may take somewhat longer than two years.  We must therefore envisage the transition period, during which, presumably, the UK will continue to be a full member of the EU and the Single Market.  However, this will all have to be maintained during negotiations and into the transition for however long it takes.  I would appreciate the ambassador's comments on these matters.</p></speech>

Mr. Robin Barnett and Mr. Paul Welsh.  I have had the opportunity to meet H.E. Mr. Barnett before.  I think he was specially selected for his experience as an ambassador working in many other countries, coming at this crucial time for both the United Kingdom and Ireland.  He brings a great insight to his job and is a vital contact between us and the United Kingdom, so we are delighted he has attended our committee meeting today.</p> <p>  The unique relationship we have had with the UK since before the 1920s, and the agreement of the common travel area in 1923, was not changed by the agreement in the 1970s providing for the UK's and Ireland's simultaneous accession to the European Communities.  There was no change to the common travel area then and there cannot be any change to it arising from the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  This is why the Prime Minister's letter is so supportive of our position.  I will not repeat what my colleagues have said because we all agree that the relationship between the United Kingdom and Ireland absolutely must remain strong, and Irish people working in the United Kingdom must be reassured of their position.</p> <p>  There has been a major increase in the number of people in Britain applying for Irish passports and, as H.E. Mr. Barnett knows, every citizen of Northern Ireland is entitled to an Irish passport.  The Irish population in the UK will certainly increase with all the numbers now applying.  In addition, many Irish people can have dual citizenship, as can many people with Irish backgrounds working in the United Kingdom whose parents were born before 1949.  Similar provisions apply in respect of those with Irish grandparents.  Quite a number of people may avail of Irish passports, which may give them that extra sense of security at this time.</p> <p>  As Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey said, most worrying is that many people at the start of these discussions felt the final agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom would be reached unanimously by the 27 other countries of the EU but there now seems to be talk of a qualified majority.  This is a difficulty for Ireland more than any other country because of our unique position.  I am not sure where this discussion came from or why it is happening.  Spain could veto an agreement.  I always felt secure that if the agreement was not in the best interests of the United Kingdom and Ireland, it could be vetoed.  It is very important that there be a very close relationship between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Irish Government and that we ensure our concerns are raised at the negotiations between the Heads of State during their regular meetings.</p> <p>  A 488 km Border is a very long one, and it will not be possible to man a mighty number of roads along the Border.  It does not matter how Border controls are operated; some roads will not be covered.  The key is that the most convenient way for our exports to mainland Europe is through the United Kingdom, and the Channel Tunnel is vital in this regard, so we must ensure we have seamless transportation through Northern Ireland, into Britain and beyond to the European Union.  Otherwise, we will have to strengthen our ports in Wexford for direct exports to France.  These are all the issues that will come up.  However, the process is still at a very early stage, which is why it is very important that we carry on the dialogue and keep in touch.</p> <p>  A delegation of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, of which I am a member, went to the House of Commons and House of Lords recently.  We had tremendous meetings with Members of Parliament and Ministers there, and such dialogue is absolutely vital for us to know the exact nature of each other's concerns.  The UK has a friend in Ireland, even though it is part of the remaining 27 countries of the EU, and a country that has the deepest concern about the future of the United Kingdom and Ireland because the UK's interests are our interests as well.  We cannot have the whole farming industry in dire straits, which is what will happen if there are significant imports from South America or elsewhere.  We have many concerns and many worries, quite frankly.  We never really anticipated that this would happen, but it is happening now so we must deal with it constructively.  I hope we will come up with a good arrangement which suits the United Kingdom and Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-04a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017040400002#D00400"><p>The ambassador is very welcome.  I begin by offering my condolences, those of the committee, those of many of my constituents and those of others I have met to those affected by the attack on innocent civilians on Westminster Bridge.  We are all familiar with Portcullis House from going in and out of it.  I offer not only my condolences to those whose loved ones died, but also our hopes for speedy recoveries for all those who are recovering from injuries sustained in the attack.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that H.E. Mr. Barnett said he is listening.  He referred in particular to some of his trips to the Border communities, and the fact that he is listening is a very important message to send out from here.  However, my view of the British Government is that its Brexit plan to date clearly shows that it is not listening but is ignoring the views of the majority in the North of Ireland which voted, as H.E. Mr. Barnett knows, to remain within the EU.  He said the UK's Government's intention is to leave the Single Market and the customs union, and again, I think most people's views are that this will have a detrimental impact on the economy not only in the North, but also in the South of Ireland and the people in both areas.  We argue that the British Government has no mandate to do this.  The people of the North clearly voted in the referendum to remain in the EU but it is almost as if the vote is being disregarded or discarded as not as important as other votes.  The people of Scotland would probably have a similar view in this regard.  That the UK is treating people in the North as less important - some would say as second-class citizens - is infuriating a huge number of people.  In the run-up to the Good Friday Agreement, much time was spent on consent, the difficulty trying to agree the wording, getting agreement from all the parties and so on.  Now we see the consent of the people of the North being disregarded.  It is regrettable that the British Government has adopted this position.</p> <p>  The last thing a society coming out of conflict needs is more fear and uncertainty and increased tension.  No matter what one's position is, I think everyone accepts that that is where Brexit is leading us.  I am conscious that H.E. Mr. Barnett is a diplomat and may not be able to answer some of these questions but perhaps he can give us some insight into some of my comments.</p><p>Does the ambassador agree that Brexit poses a severe threat?  Does he agree it will undermine the institutional, constitutional and legal integrity of the Good Friday Agreement?  The agreement is the foundation of the Irish peace process and defines the relationship within and between Ireland and Britain.  Does he agree that in order to safeguard the Good Friday Agreement and Irish-British relations that the North should receive special status within the EU?  This House adopted the view that a special status would be a positive and workable solution and made the suggestion.  I am sure everyone will agree that the North needs a special arrangement.  Even the Unionists have talked about having a special arrangement.  Has the British Government considered the option?  Will it consider the option?</p><p> The majority of the MLAs who were recently elected to the Assembly believe that a realistic alternative must be found for the North.  Theresa May has talked about having a seamless and frictionless border.  It is obvious that a hard economic border will be imposed on the island of Ireland but it is unworkable because we have 277 roads and 500 km of territory.  I do not know how the British will impose a border when it leaves the customs union and the Single Market.</p><p> Other speakers have raised the issue of Gibraltar.  Many people in Ireland have been shocked by remarks made about Gibraltar because there was a sniff of gunpowder about them.  Lord Michael Howard stated that the British Government was willing to go to war with Spain over Gibraltar.  I ask the ambassador to comment on Lord Howard's remarks.  Interestingly, Gibraltar was not mentioned in the draft European Council guidelines but it was mentioned in Prime Minister May's letter last week to the EU to trigger Article 50.  Can the ambassador provide an insight into why the Prime Minister did not mention Gibraltar in her letter considering the strong feelings expressed by a former Tory leader?  My colleagues and I heard similar worries and concerns when we attended BIPA meetings.  We were addressed by people from Gibraltar who expressed their difficulties with the situation.  Again, I am conscious that the population of Gibraltar voted by a majority of 96% in favour of remaining in the EU but that democratic vote was ignored.  </p><p> Prime Minister May has repeatedly ruled out Britain remaining in the Single Market or the customs union primarily due to an irrational fear of free movement within the EU.  Can the ambassador give an insight into his Government's plans for a trade agreement with the EU?  Will it be an agreement at all costs?  People have expressed their concerns about having a default World Trade Organization.  We are trying to pick up all of the signals and listen to what people are saying.  Phillip Hammond has said that he personally hopes Britain can remain part of mainstream European economic and social thinking and the ambassador said much the same in his speech.  If Ireland is forced to do something different then we will do so.  Mr. Hammond mentioned options, including cutting corporation tax, to regain competitiveness.  Jeremy Corbyn shared his concern when he stated that he feared the British Government was attempting to establish itself as a low tax haven.  Many people we talked to in Europe have expressed their concerns that the North of Ireland will be used as a dumping ground for cheap food, goods, etc.  Can the ambassador give us an insight into the British Government's plan in terms of this matter?</p><p> The British Government has committed to scrapping the Human Rights Act  I have been told that the plans are on hold to end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and the European Convention on Human Rights.  These matters are separate from the Brexit negotiations but run parallel with them.  These matters have created a great amount of concern.  The Human Rights Act is one of the pillars of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements.  Many of us believe that repealing these matters would be a direct violation of the agreements.  We have been told that these matters are under review.  Can the ambassador give us an insight into when the British Government plans to repeal the Human Rights Act?  We view such a measure as violating the peace agreement.</p><p> Last week, the Scottish Government voted in favour of holding a second referendum and the First Minister of Scotland, Ms Nicola Sturgeon, has written to Prime Minister May formally requesting that.  Scotland voted overwhelmingly in favour of remaining in the EU yet the country is being dragged out of the EU against its will, according to First Minister Sturgeon, without an influence or input into negotiations as all power is being centralised in London.  Considering all of that and the democratic vote by the Scottish Parliament, will the British Government facilitate a second independence referendum in Scotland before it is forced out of the EU by a Government that the Scottish people clearly did not vote for?</p><p> I have major concerns about the impact Brexit will have on the island of Ireland.  I hope the ambassador can answer my questions.  The view is that Brexit was triggered without an understanding or concern about the impact it would have on Ireland, particularly the peace process.  I am disappointed that the peace process and situation in the North did not feature in the campaign to leave the EU.  There is a large proportion of people on this island who feel that Brexit will be disastrous for Ireland.  The negative impact did not feature in the referendum campaign.  We hope that the relationship between Ireland and Britain continues.  Current negotiations will have an impact on the future relationship between both countries.</p></speech>

As a member and Vice Chairman of the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, it was good to hear the ambassador's and the Chairman's opinions on trying to assimilate views on the issue.</p> <p>  I appreciate the ambassador's bona fides and appreciate his accessibility in terms of discussing this issue.  Today is not the first time that we have met and engaged in a discussion.  Other members have made a similar comment. </p> <p>  From the point of view of Twenty-six Counties, all of the sectors have prepared a paper on the impact of Brexit.  The ambassador mentioned in his presentation that he attended the Ceann Comhairle's Brexit meeting in the Mansion House and I attended the same meeting.  Many of us attended the two civil dialogue or break-out meetings on the various sectors.  I have no doubt that we in Ireland have identified an awful lot of the problems but I am not sure that the UK has fully realised the problems with Brexit.  I ask the ambassador to comment on the matter in his concluding remarks.  </p> <p>   I understand diplomacy and talking a great deal but now it is time to find solutions.  The process to date is like a poker game.  People have kept their cards close to their chests in an effort to get the best outcome for England and Ireland.  Indeed, everyone wants a slice of the cake and to get the best outcome for their country.  The only clear message that I have gathered from the toing and froing is that the EU has said it has asked the UK and Irish Governments to come up with what the EU has described as unique and imaginative solutions that are compatible to the remaining EU members.</p><p>I have already said that where a vacuum is created, space is provided for those who want to fill that vacuum for their own gains.  I am deeply concerned about that as someone who has lived along the Border and been involved in politics for 25 years.  Can the ambassador give me examples of where there is common ground in terms of unique and imaginative solutions?  I will speak briefly about one area to which Deputy Crowe and others have already referred, namely, the importance of the agricultural industry.  Regardless of the outcome, the protection of our green image in agricultural terms in two different jurisdictions would require a magic wand.  It is my view that there must be a special solution on a 32 county basis for that issue alone, not to mention the other sectors.  I ask the ambassador to give his honest opinion on a solution because I have heard absolutely no solution from the British side on any issue.</p></speech>

The British Supreme Court's ruling on Article 50 found that Westminster is in charge and that there is no requirement for engagement with any of the devolved governments with respect to its triggering.  The Good Friday Agreement is of particular concern because, apart from the fact that it is an international agreement underpinned by the British and Irish Governments and the European Union, it has been suggested that legislation will be required in the UK to solidify that agreement under the new arrangements.  Has anything been done about that?</p> <p>  I sometimes get a little worried when I meet MPs from Westminster or members of the House of Lords who argue that Britain is leaving the club but is not exactly leaving the playing pitch.  One is either in the club or out of it.  In my view, the UK has left the club and has left all of the benefits and some of the costs of membership of that club behind.  The ambassador spoke about putting citizens first but some British politicians, who have now jumped ship since the referendum, certainly did not put the citizens first in pushing the country towards Brexit.  I am particularly concerned about Northern Ireland, where there is no Assembly in place at the moment.  We now have civil servants running the North of Ireland on reduced budgets, I might add.  Given the likelihood of a failure to put an Assembly in place by Easter, it strikes me that the civil servants will be playing a role for a considerable period of time to come, at least until another election is held and negotiations take place.  Who is going to take political responsibility for Northern Ireland, to ensure that it suffers no more and no less than any other part of the United Kingdom?  </p> <p>  A question has been asked of me - and I would have to declare some interest in it myself - regarding entitlements to pensions from the UK and to other services for people who served or worked in the UK.  How does the ambassador see that working?  Such entitlements are very integrated under the European Union but outside of that, will that continue on?  It has been part of the Irish, British relationship for generations.  </p> <p>  On the issue of the Border, I cannot see any way that a third country outside of the European Union cannot have a border with Ireland.  I know that the Prime Minister, Ms May and our own Taoiseach have expressed the desire that we have a border-less relationship but I cannot see a way.  The ambassador has been in the diplomatic corps for a long time but I cannot see how one country can sit alongside another and not have a border in place.  I see the problem of the free movement of people as one that can be dealt with relatively easily but not so for the movement of goods.  Everyone accepts that we need to have a border-less relationship with Northern Ireland but nobody has come up with a solution or an idea as to how that can be achieved.  I do not expect the ambassador to outline an idea today but I am wondering if there is somebody in Westminster, Northern Ireland or somewhere in the UK trying to find a solution that will be acceptable to the UK, the citizens of Northern Ireland who wish to be regarded as UK citizens only and the European Union.  Whatever the idea, it cannot create a precedent for other countries to try to dovetail into for their own specific reasons.  I am thinking here of places like Gibraltar, Cyprus and Catalonia, for example.  That is an issue of concern.</p> <p>  There was another issue that I wished to raise but I am afraid I have lost my train of thought.  I will leave it at that for the moment but if it comes back to me, I will revert to the ambassador.</p></speech>

As the Chairman has mentioned, I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  I am also a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence.  I was listening to the ambassador's contribution in my office and noted that he mentioned his visit, on the invitation of the Ceann Comhairle, to the Mansion House.  I asked him a question there which he did not answer so I will put it to him again here.  Our Taoiseach has said that the EU needs to prepare for a united Ireland.  I ask the ambassador if the UK will allow for a united Ireland to be included in the final agreement between the UK and the EU.  Will wording to that effect be allowed for in the final document?  I presume the UK will not have any objection to that.</p></speech>

I have just remembered the other issue I wished to raise.  There are 100,000 UK citizens in Northern Ireland who have become naturalised by virtue of the fact that they moved there to take up employment.  They include university academic staff, medical staff and so forth from various parts of the world who have been naturalised in Northern Ireland.  They are not covered by the Good Friday Agreement in terms of seeking dual citizenship.  Would the UK be prepared to assist that group of people with that in the context of Brexit?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-04a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Robin Barnett" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2017040400002#F01100"><p>Thank you Chairman.  I thank the members for a very comprehensive range of questions.  I will do my best to answer as many as I can but members will appreciate that some of the more technical questions will, inevitably, be outside my immediate range of expertise.</p><p>I am very confident of one thing, namely, that we will be continuing this dialogue in the future.</p><p> Let me do my best to respond to some of the issues which have been raised.  I will begin by reminding members of what the Prime Minister wrote.  We are looking for "a deep and special partnership" that takes in both security and economic co-operation, with a "bold and ambitious" free trade agreement, greater in scope than any such agreement before.  We want to work towards a comprehensive agreement with "a fair settlement of the UK's rights and obligations as a departing EU member state," and to "agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU."  In respect of implementation periods, as we move to the new relationship we want to minimise disruption from any suggestion of a "cliff-edge."  It is very much in that context that I would like to try to answer some of the specific points that have been put.  </p><p> In different ways, the issue of bilateral institutions has been raised.  I stress that we in the UK attach great importance to continuing to strengthen bilateral institutions and contacts.  We are in complete agreement about the importance of parliamentary contacts at all levels.  I have spoken about this on a number of occasions.  I agree that we need to look at all the existing institutions and make sure that they meet the needs of our future relationships.  A priority for me, too, is to continue to ensure that there is good engagement between parliamentary committees here and in the UK on issues of general interest, in other words, the broad range of parliamentary business in which the Houses of the Oireachtas and both Houses of the UK Parliament engage.  That will be an area of great importance in the future.  </p><p> As I already stated, the annual meeting of Secretaries General and permanent undersecretaries is an incredibly important institution.  We will want to make sure that we maintain a strong level of contact between officials.  The flow of ministerial visits since I arrived here is an indication of the political importance we attach to the bilateral relationship, and I can confirm that there will be plenty more such visits in the pipeline in both directions.  I can definitely confirm our interest in making sure that we have strong and effective engagement going forward.</p><p> Senator Richmond mentioned the importance of the Commonwealth for the UK.  I can absolutely confirm that.  We will continue to see the Commonwealth as a very important institution.  It has done a lot of good work since its foundation in every conceivable area, from economics through education and culture, as well as work in the field of human rights.</p><p> In response to the questions that several honourable members put regarding how the talks should be conducted, this is, of course, the opening of a negotiation.  Such matters will need to be agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  As my Prime Minister pointed out in the Article 50 letter, our strong view is that the talks on leaving the European Union should be conducted alongside the negotiations on a new deep and special partnership.  We think that this is firmly in the best interests of the EU, the UK and Ireland for all the reasons that many members have adduced, namely, the importance of clarity and of certainty for the future.</p><p> Let me turn to questions around the Border.  It is clear that the common travel area, which predates our and Ireland's membership of the European Union, is the way forward in terms of ensuring free movement of people.  In terms of free movement of goods and related issues, while there are challenges, we firmly believe that the basis for an effective way forward is a bold and ambitious free trade agreement between the UK and the EU.  To those who say that this may be hard to achieve within a timescale, I would respectfully observe that this is not about how to identify convergence or common standards; we are already starting from a shared place.  Many of the complications that people adduce about concluding a free trade agreement are not appropriate when we are starting from a position of equivalence.</p><p> A number of questions have been posed around the implications for the Northern Ireland peace process.  We are committed to implementing the Belfast Agreement and its successors.  Human rights protection for all in Northern Ireland is part of that and will continue to be.  In terms of the representation of the people of Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom Government will be negotiating on behalf of the whole of the United Kingdom.  As the members will know, there are mechanisms in place to ensure that the views of the devolved administrations are taken into account into that process.  That is why a priority for our Government and for the Government of Ireland is to reinstate the Northern Ireland Executive as quickly as possible.  As the members will know, discussions on that process are continuing on an ongoing basis.  </p><p> In terms of the issues around the rights of citizens, I think my Prime Minister has been crystal clear.</p><p>This is an absolute top priority for my government.  We will continue to make it a top priority and we very much hope that we will be able to provide the certainty that is required as soon as possible.  I must, however, remind the committee that this will very much be a negotiation.  </p><p> In terms of references to Gibraltar, our focus in the forthcoming negotiations on Brexit is to ensure that we get the best possible deal in trade and other matters, and co-operation for the future for the UK and for Gibraltar.  We will be working closely with the Gibraltar Government as we have been over recent months.  We will continue to do that to ensure that we get a result that is in the interests of the United Kingdom, in the interests of Gibraltar and of the 27 member states of the European Union.  </p><p> I was asked whether people are focused on the specific problems of our bilateral relationship.  I give the committee a categorical assurance that they are.  The range of engagement between our two governments is a partial demonstration of that but I can assure the committee that as we prepare for the forthcoming negotiations there is a great deal of focus on the specific challenges, not least the issues that many Members of the Oireachtas have raised here today with respect to delivering a border that is as seamless and frictionless as possible.</p><p> There was a suggestion that we might need legislation to solidify the Good Friday Agreement.  This is an international agreement to which we remain 100% committed.  The committee may have seen a statement to that effect very recently by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire.  In terms of the possibility of an eventual border poll the arrangements on that are spelled out extremely clearly in the Belfast Agreement.</p><p> There were several quite technical and detailed questions including around issues such as pensions.  Rather than attempt to give answers we will come back to the members, if we may, after we have had a chance to consult on some of these technical issues.  </p><p> Finally, I firmly believe that we will be able to achieve the deep and strong and special partnership with the EU that my Prime Minister has set out in the Article 50 letter.  In this process we are very mindful of the importance of our bilateral relationship with Ireland.  We are actively engaged in looking at creative solutions to problems and challenges, although some of those creative solutions will not just come from governments but from the talent that exists in our private sectors in Ireland and in the United Kingdom.  I would also like to stress that we are not just focused on the Article 50 negotiations.  As many members of the committee have indicated, there is a very strong economic partnership between our two countries.  That continues today.  We are actively looking for opportunities to strengthen that partnership in a range of areas, one good example being medtech but there are many more.  Our focus at the British Embassy in Dublin is not only on the work we need to do in respect of the Article 50 letter but also to identify ways, as many members have indicated, of strengthening our partnership for the future.</p></speech>

I am concerned that those students who will start an academic career over the next two years will spend their first year under the existing agreements and then have to face substantial fees as foreigners in the UK for the subsequent years.</p> <p>  The UK and Irish universities have co-operated well together in research.  I understand that some of the funding is beginning to drain away as Brexit draws closer but in the new reality I wonder will the UK be anxious to maintain those links and that co-operation on research and development.</p></speech>

Wednesday, 17 May marks the 43rd anniversary of the bombings.</p><p>The motions urge that the British Government would allow access by an independent international judicial figure to all original documents held by the British Government and, again, this was to happen.  The last time I talked to the ambassador, he said he did not want to meet with the families unless there was something significant to announce.  Is there any consideration by the British Government in regard to progressing this issue and assisting the 34 families seeking justice?  While it is outside the scope of the meeting, I think it would be remiss of us if we did not raise the issue with the ambassador.  As he knows, it is an issue of huge concern among all parties and groups in the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

One point I must emphasise is that while we will be on separate sides of the table in this process, solutions are less likely to work if we do not work together.  I thank H.E. Mr. Barnett for taking the time to appear before the committee and for answering our questions comprehensively.  I am sure we will be seeing a lot more of him and his colleagues in the British Embassy as the negotiating process proceeds.  I wish him the best success as UK ambassador to Ireland.  We are delighted he is here and, on behalf of the committee, I am very grateful to him for coming today with his colleague.  He was very open and, as he said in his statement, he is also here to listen, which is very important.  We can develop the questions that have been put by members today.  Follow-up is very important and we look forward to further meetings with the ambassador as the process proceeds and negotiations start.  He is a very close conduit for us.  Again, it is very important that Members of the British Parliament, both from the House of Commons and the House of Lords, come here just as we will be going on a very regular basis to Britain.  The upcoming meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly is another very important event which will allow for dialogue to continue with our parliamentary colleagues from the United Kingdom and from the regional parliaments.

I am accompanied by the acting deputy governor for financial regulation and the director of consumer protection, Mr. Bernard Sheridan, and the director of enforcement, Ms Derville Rowland.  I will focus on three topics in my introductory statement - the examination of tracker mortgages, the role of the Central Bank in supporting initiatives to reform the motor insurance market and Brexit.  I will address each of them in turn.</p> <p>  On the examination of issues related to tracker mortgages, I fully share the committee's concerns.  Where these issues have arisen, it is clear that lenders have failed their customers.  Moreover, I am acutely aware of the unacceptable impact these failures have had on tracker mortgage customers, ranging from the burden of having to pay more than they should to instances involving loss of ownership of mortgaged properties.  I acknowledge that committee members frequently deal with such cases in their constituencies and that the committee has heard powerful testimony about the effects these failures have had on individuals and families.  The Central Bank is also aware of many of these cases from callers to our public helpline and our ongoing engagement with various consumer representatives.  These are important sources of information which continue to inform the examination.  The Central Bank is pursuing a comprehensive, industry-wide examination precisely to ensure lenders will identify every affected customer, stop the harm and pay appropriate redress and compensation.</p> <p>  The fair treatment of tracker mortgage borrowers has been a key supervisory and policy focus for the Central Bank for the past few years.  In line with our mandate to ensure the best interests of consumers are protected, the Central Bank intervened with a number of lenders in the period 2008 to 2015 on a range of issues related to tracker mortgages.  The interventions ranged from lender-specific supervisory and enforcement actions to, more generally, strengthening the statutory protections for tracker mortgage customers, specifically through the consumer protection code and the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.</p><p>During the period before the examination we dealt with a range of lender-specific issues, resulting in approximately 7,100 customer accounts affected by various tracker issues being resolved prior to the beginning of the current examination.  We also intervened in a number of additional cases on a preventative basis to prevent detriment to tracker customers before it occurred.  Other issues were being actively investigated at the time of the commencement of the examination and these are now being dealt with as part of the examination or, where necessary, have been escalated for enforcement action.</p><p> Where appropriate, the Central Bank has required certain lenders to offer affected customers the right to return to a tracker rate and-or payment of redress and compensation.  The Central Bank has also commenced enforcement investigations into tracker-related measures at Permanent TSB and its subsidiary, Springboard Mortgages.  As a result, these lenders were required to implement a comprehensive mortgage redress programme to address the issues identified.  Although the underlying characteristics of each issue have differed, the Central Bank, taking all of this evidence together, decided to launch a system wide examination in 2015 given the range and nature of the customer impact of the issues identified.  The examination's scope requires a robust review to identify and deliver fair outcomes for all other affected customers in addition to those cases known to the Central Bank prior to the start of the examination.</p><p> The tracker examination is the largest, most complex and significant supervisory review the Central Bank has undertaken to date in respect of its consumer protection mandate.  It has involved an initial review of the total mortgage book by lenders in the relevant period, which amounts to more than 2 million accounts.  In line with our commitment given at the start of the examination, we have been publishing regular status updates in respect of this ongoing and current supervisory work.  The most recent was published last month and has been provided to the committee.  The aim of the examination is to ensure that all relevant lenders conduct a comprehensive and robust review which delivers fair outcomes for all customers.  I note that a number of lenders have recently apologised to the customers where they failed.  Our view is quite clear that this does not have a material meaning unless the lender both stops the harm to all affected customers and provides appropriate redress and compensation for the suffering caused.  Lenders must now demonstrate that they are doing everything possible to ensure this happens.  This is our goal in overseeing the examination.</p><p> The way the framework has been put in place is intended to provide appropriate redress and compensation to affected customers.  One of the quality assurance steps in this process is that each lender has had to appoint an external, independent party to oversee the conduct of its lender-specific examination.  The framework of the examination is in phases.  Phase one involved the development and submission of detailed plans by relevant lenders, which is completed.  Phase two requires lenders to conduct the review of their books in line with our framework.  These reviews are extensive in that lenders must review the underlying loan documentation and customer files for the in-scope accounts to determine the specific contractual obligations and also to determine more broadly if the documentation that each customer received had the potential to confuse or mislead the customer both on a stand alone basis and also when read in conjunction with other communications, written or verbal, made to the individual customer.</p><p> In this respect the Central Bank invoked its powers under section 22 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 to set specific deadlines for each lender to complete phase two of the examination.  The last of these deadlines is the end of September 2017.  The timelines have varied in line with the size of the relevant lender's loan book, the scale and complexity of issues raised in each lender and the complexities associated with completing a thorough review in line with the objectives of the examination.  By the end of next September, the Central Bank expects all lenders to have identified all affected accounts, stopped further harm and to have commenced engagement with most impacted customers.  The Central Bank is rigorously monitoring the completion of this work.</p><p> Phase three of the examination relates to calculating redress and compensation for customers identified as having been affected by tracker-related issues.</p><p>Phase four relates to implementation of a redress and compensation scheme.  It is important to appreciate that phases three and four, dealing with redress and compensation, can run concurrently with phase two.  We expect lenders to initiate phases three and four once affected customers are identified.  There is no need to complete phase two in its entirety before moving to redress and compensation for cohorts already identified.  In that regard, thus far under the examination, around &euro;78 million has been paid out in redress and compensation to approximately 2,200 affected customers.  </p><p> Separately, in regard to the mortgage redress programme for PTSB and Springboard Mortgages that was announced prior to the examination, additional redress and compensation amounts were paid.  PTSB paid &euro;36.8 million and its subsidiary, Springboard, paid &euro;5.8 million.  Due to legal requirements which restricted the degree to which I can discuss individual firms, I cannot provide a detailed lender-by-lender breakdown of payout of redress and compensation.  We are detailing aggregate amounts and there are tables with the available data in the statement I have provided to the committee.  </p><p> I emphasise the Central Bank does not have the statutory power to compel lenders to implement redress and compensation in respect of failures that occurred prior to the 2013 Act.  Having sought such powers, we were granted them in the 2013 Act but they are not retrospective.  However, I believe the Central Bank's robust approach in this matter is evident from the principles of redress we have laid down and published and with which we expect lenders to comply.  To illustrate our robust approach, it is important to emphasise that this work is not just being conducted by our consumer protection directorate but also our separate enforcement directorate which is involved in the exam.  Where regulatory breaches are suspected, cases may be referred to enforcement.  We are committed to taking robust enforcement action aimed at promoting principled and ethical behaviour by and within regulated entities.  To date, the Central Bank has concluded an enforcement investigation in regard to Springboard and imposed a monetary penalty of &euro;4.5 million on that entity in respect of these failures, which is the highest penalty ever collected by the Central Bank.  This is on top of the direct payout to the affected customers.  </p><p> In addition to the investigation into the tracker issues at Springboard and Permanent TSB, the Central Bank has initiated an enforcement investigation at Ulster Bank.  We may also commence other investigations as appropriate into other lenders and persons concerned in the management of such entities where there is evidence of non-compliance with regulatory requirements.  In this regard, enforcement activity will be influenced by the outcome of the reviews currently being conducted as part of the tracker examination.  In short, all possible enforcement angles, including potential individual culpability, will be thoroughly investigated and analysed in the context of the legal framework.  Enforcement measures will be deployed as appropriate, including investigating issues and taking cases under our administrative sanctions procedure, together with the use of our fitness and probity powers.  Boards of lending institutions are expected to ensure appropriate control, governance and management in those firms.  </p><p> In line with international regulatory standards, we operate a risk-based framework for the supervision of regulated firms.  In its regular supervisory work, the Central Bank cannot pre-approve every single commercial decision taken or contract entered into by a regulated firm.  Rather, supervision entails challenge of firms, judgment of the risks they pose to the economy and to the consumer and mitigation of those risks we judge to be unacceptable.  Targeted enforcement action against those firms whose poor behaviour risks jeopardising our objectives, including financial stability and consumer protection, underpins this framework.  Consumers are further protected by other relevant State bodies in this area such as the Financial Services Ombudsman, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the courts system.  Taken together, these form the State's protection for individuals.  </p><p> I recognise and acknowledge the committee's reflection that the examination has taken some time and that it will take some further time to complete.</p><p>I reiterate that lenders are working to the specific timelines we have imposed and are required to examine all relevant individual contracts.  Given the harm the actions of some of these lenders have caused, it is essential the examinations be both comprehensive and robust.  Our objective is to ensure that every impacted customer is identified and appropriately redressed and compensated.</p><p> The Central Bank welcomes the focus that this committee and the cost of insurance working group led by Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eoghan Murphy has brought to bear on the issue of motor insurance.  The Central Bank appeared before this committee in regard to insurance last year.  The Central Bank recognises that volatility in the price of insurance has an unwelcome impact on consumers.  We do not have a role in the setting of premiums, in common with all supervisory authorities across the EU.  It is explicitly prohibited by European law under Article 181 of the Solvency II directive.  The Central Bank is committed to working with this committee, the cost of insurance working group and other stakeholders on aspects related to this issue in ways that are appropriate to our mandate.</p><p> There were a number of common themes between the findings of this committee's final report and the work of the cost of insurance working group in which we were involved.  For example, both found there was scope to improve the renewal process to assist consumers in the purchase of insurance.  Equally, both the committee and the working group recommended substantive work be undertaken to improve data availability.  The Central Bank, through the working group process, is the lead owner for a number of recommendations and actions in these areas.  Work has begun on implementation.  In the area of renewals, the working group recommended that insurers provide additional information on the premium breakdown to consumers and that the renewal notification period be extended from 15 to 20 working days to make it easier for motorists to compare pricing when purchasing insurance.  The requirements for provision of information in non-life renewal notices are set out in the Non-Life Insurance (Provision of Information) (Renewal of Policy of Insurance) Regulations 2007.  The process to amend these regulations requires us to undertake a standard consultation process including engagement with consumers, stakeholders and industry.  The consultation will be conducted in the fourth quarters of 2017 in line with the timeframe set out by the working group.  Regulatory change, if required, will take place in 2018.</p><p> In the area of data availability, the working group has recommended the establishment of a national claims information database.  We are currently working with the Department of Finance and other stakeholders to define key aggregated statistical data on motor claims for publication in the near future.  This will assist with the development of the database in 2018 as recommended.  It should be noted, however, that the database function will represent an extension of our mandate and will require legislative change.</p><p> As I said at the outset, the Central Bank is committed to working with this committee, the Department of Finance, the cost of insurance working group and other stakeholders on this issue in ways that are appropriate to our mandate.</p><p> Brexit is a priority area for the Central Bank, dealing with the implications both for the wider economy and for the financial system.  Our current near-term forecasts are for relatively favourable growth in the economy, driven by continuing recovery in underlying domestic demand.  Consumption and the domestic-driven component of investment is set to remain robust and is supported by a strong labour market.  However, there is no doubt that the outlook remains subject to unusual uncertainty related to external risks, including Brexit and the uncertainty regarding the post-Brexit trading relationship.</p><p> Last week, the UK Government triggered Article 50 of the treaty, starting the two-year negotiation period.  In fact, the European Commission has indicated that an agreement would need to be completed by October 2018 to allow ratification by the UK and European Parliaments before the two-year timeframe elapses.  It is clear that this timeframe is very ambitious, given the volume of issues that must be negotiated.  It can be extended if all member states agree.</p><p> For the domestic banking sector, Brexit to date has had a relatively benign impact.  We have not seen any funding impact or decline in credit quality.  We continue to engage with all regulated entities to ensure they are adequately prepared.</p><p>It is too early to accurately predict any Brexit-related effect on foreign direct investment.  In the financial sector we have had increased engagement with a range of entities, including banks, market and insurance firms, and queries about payments and electronic transfers.  The inquiries have taken the form of discussions on potential new authorisations and possible balance sheet expansions by existing firms or changes to business type.  Where the Central Bank is asked to consider the authorisation of a firm in Ireland, we will want to be satisfied that we are authorising a business or a line of business that will be run from Ireland and which we, effectively, will be supervising.  The Central Bank will expect it to have a substantive presence here.  For financial services, it operates under a common framework for regulation and supervision at a European level.  This is all part of the European System of Financial Supervision, ESFS, which promotes the consistent application of EU legislative requirements.</p><p> Potential new entrants pose a challenge to us as an organisation in planning and prioritisation, but we are meeting this challenge.  To fulfil our mandate in safeguarding stability, using a risk-based approach to supervising credit institutions and ensuring a robust and transparent authorisation and approval process, we established a Brexit task force within the Central Bank prior to the referendum.  This internal task force has a cross-departmental structure involving 15 divisions across the Central Bank.  This functional approach is necessary, given the potential for a more diverse cross-section of entity types and new business models across all sectors.  We have increased our capacity to deal with this and are developing our contingency resourcing plans.</p><p> Our vision is to have a well functioning, well managed and well regulated financial system.  Legacies of the past remain material and continue to be worked through.  Trust in the system remains very damaged, which reflects the need for continued improvements, including in the underlying culture of financial firms.  We endeavour to foster a strong culture of compliance, with firms and individuals within firms acting in the best interests of their customers, backed up by comprehensive and enforceable legislation, rigorous supervision, a credible threat of enforcement and powers of redress when customers have suffered detriment.  As I stated, although the examination of tracker mortgages will still take some time, the Central Bank's goal is to ensure every customer who has been impacted on will be identified and appropriately redressed and compensated.</p><p> In looking ahead, Brexit poses a number of risks and challenges for the economy, individual institutions and businesses.  In line with our mandate, we will continue to highlight these risks, engage with the regulated institutions in order that they will be adequately prepared and provide a transparent and efficient authorisation process for potential entities that choose to establish in Ireland.  Equally, on the issue of insurance, the Central Bank will continue to work with the committee, the working group and other stakeholders in ways appropriate to our mandate.  I look forward to discussing these issues further with the committee, as well as the others raised in the invitation.</p></speech>

I thank him for his opening statement and acknowledge the update issued by the Central Bank on the examination of tracker mortgages.  While it did not answer every question, it went a long way.  On customers being denied their contractual rights, does Professor Lane believe the practice was systemic and widespread across the banking system?</p></speech>

There is a systemic and widespread aspect, but the issue is complicated in that it manifests itself in different ways across different institutions, different periods of time and different categories of customer.  Sometimes it is a systemic issue which is straightforward and an issue which repeats itself across all institutions.  Unfortunately, the reality in the tracker mortgage universe is that there are a lot of variations of this common problem.  That is why because of the differences it requires a comprehensive approach and will take time.</p><p>Underneath it all is a cultural issue, as I believe I tried to say in my opening statement.  Essentially, it is interpreting contracts in favour of the lender, not the customer.  That is the ultimate core systemic issue.</p></speech>

The majority have identified customers who have been impacted on.  One of the 15 lenders is not covered because it purchased the loan book from another party which is carrying out the review.  Therefore, the number is 14 lenders <i>per se</i>.  Of the 14, probably ten have identified issues at this stage, all of different magnitude, depending on the individual institution involved.</p></speech>

As indicated in our most recent report and my opening statement, as far as we can we communicate it, we have a twin-track approach.  It is supervisory in engaging with firms and backed up by enforcement powers.  It is important to emphasise that our enforcement powers are now much stronger than they were pre-2013.  In 2010 we issued a letter to all institutions expressing our concern about tracker mortgages and reminding them that violations would be subject to enforcement and an administrative sanctions procedure.  We have already seen this in the case of Springboard Mortgages and have others in train.  We are saying all of it is subject to enforcement and that it has been effective.</p></speech>

If we extrapolate from the figure <i>pro rata</i>and say there are in the region of 10,000 customers - I know that it is 10,000 accounts - we are looking at a bill of about &euro;300 million.  We know that in the cases of PTSB and Springboard Mortgages, the cost in respect of 1,400 customers was over &euro;40 million.  If we extrapolate from these figures and include the other 7,100 customers affected prior to the examination, the institutions are looking at a &euro;500 million problem.</p></speech>

Let me caution, however, that across the range of problems some are at the high end, large scale and significant.  Quite large sums might be involved in individual cases, while in others they could be at the low end.  The average will conceal a lot.  In terms of the aggregated cost, number one is the redress and compensation paid, number two is any fine we may impose and number three is the compliance cost, which is significant for the banks.  I hope the banks will come out and express intense regret and state they should never have taken these risks in the first place in being aggressive in how they interpreted the contracts.</p></speech>

Presumably, it is a priority to get the remainder put on the correct rate as quickly as possible.</p><p>On the question of the prevailing rate, I know Professor Lane will not be drawn into a debate around individual banks.  However, this issue arises in the case of a number of banks.  AIB is certainly one of them where it has identified a prevailing rate of 3.67%.  Will Professor Lane advise the committee how the Central Bank approaches that question as to the appropriate prevailing rate?  The ECB issue is fixed.  The margin is not specified in the contract, but what is specified is that the customer has the right to revert to a tracker mortgage at the prevailing rate.  If there was no prevailing rate at the time, is it not reasonable that they would be put on the tracker rate that applied previously?  How is the Central Bank approaching this question?</p></speech>

We have laid out clear principles on how we expect banks to interpret these cases.  These are live issues, however, so I do not want to discuss it in any more detail than that.</p></speech>

What is very important is that we built into the examination, from the word go, an appeals process.  We also provided help for customers to take appeals, but without in any way compromising the right of individuals to go to the ombudsman and, in turn, to the courts system.  Therefore there are several layers of additionality.  Given the range of experiences each person has had, there may well be a significant number of cases that did go to internal appeal, the ombudsman and the court.  We allow for that so it is a one-way bet.  A person is not compromising his or her ability to take these other channels, which already exist, by accepting the initial offer from the bank.</p> <p>  We have laid out principles of redress.  For pre-2013, we are using moral persuasion to say how it should be done.  We know we only have redress powers after 2013, but we are saying how we expect people to behave.  Therefore, the original offers should respect those principles, but it is entirely open to each individual to move along with appeals, the ombudsman and the courts system.</p></speech>

If I may, Chairman, I have a final question on a separate topic.  I wish to ask the Governor about house prices.  The latest data from the <i>myhome.ie</i>survey show that annual house price inflation is 9% nationally and over 10% in Dublin.  For newly listed properties, the rate is 5.5% nationally in the first three months of this year and 6% in Dublin.  Is the Central Bank concerned by what we are witnessing in respect of new house prices?  What are Professor Lane's views now in respect of the help-to-buy scheme?  In the context of the changes that were made to the mortgage deposit rules, what is the Central Bank's current assessment of house prices, their sustainability, and whether we are heading towards another bubble?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-04a.77" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017040400002#H00800"><p>Of course, when one sees significant run-ups of that order, it is a source of concern.  Of most concern is a scenario where it persists.</p><p>It is one issue where, in a given period, if there is a surge for some reason, it then self-corrects.  Of course, we do not need to go through all of the supply issues which are relevant to this.  It is also important to emphasise that, in an economy that is doing very well at the moment in terms of a strong labour market and so on, there is going to be some degree of reasonable house price increase.  Let me emphasise, however, that the contribution of our rules is that the dynamic has self-correcting features.  The strongest one is the anchor that mortgages cannot be offered beyond 3.5 times a person's income.  Therefore mortgages cannot detach from income levels because of that rule.  The second feature is the percentage deposit requirement.  It is 10% for first-time buyers, 20% for second-time buyers and 30% for buy-to-let.  As house prices go up, those deposit requirements become more demanding, and that is a self-correcting feature.</p><p> As regards the help-to-buy scheme, when asked last year, I said that one could make the case that there might be some gains to boost supply by easing the ability of new home builders to access finance.  Of course, in the short term that takes time to kick in with a demand effect.  </p><p> The second point, which is ultimately for the political system, is the distribution element.  If one is offering up to a &euro;20,000 rebate for this category, is that the best use of that funding and what else could one do with it?  However, it is for the Oireachtas to rank what are the best interventions or best uses for these tax rebates.</p></speech>

Let me emphasise that that should moderate over time as it triggers a supply response, but the impact effect, by easing the ability of that cohort to buy homes, will of course drive up prices.  Part of the mechanism is that by driving up prices, a strong feature is to trigger a supply response.  That is part of what the building industry called for.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-04a.81" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017040400002#J00400"><p>I would like to pick up on that point about the building industry.  I agree with Professor Lane's analysis.  I opposed the help-to-buy scheme - unfortunately, we were in a minority - because I believed it would trigger what we have seen in the past three months with house prices increasing every month in Dublin by &euro;6,000 and by &euro;4,000 per month elsewhere across the State.  The real fear is that we will see that happening in the second and third quarters also.  The construction industry did not suggest that that was what the help-to-buy scheme was about.  Indeed the Government did not suggest that either.  It suggested, and continues to suggest, that it is about trying to ensure people can gather the necessary deposits.</p> <p>  Data released to me by the Minister for Finance show that 74% of people who have been approved under the help-to-buy scheme had over the 10% deposit required.  Some of them had a 30% deposit and took out a 70% loan-to-value ratio mortgage.  There is no clarity on whether the 24% or 25% of people who had a 10% deposit actually required up to &euro;20,000 from the help-to-buy scheme.  In Professor Lane's view is the help-to-buy scheme necessary to assist first-time buyers enter the market in terms of the Central Bank's rules?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-04a.82" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017040400002#J00500"><p>As the Deputy just indicated, which is consistent with our data, many first-time buyers put down fairly big deposits compared with the value of a home.  The fraction of first-time buyers who were, or are, constrained by the 10% deposit is going to be limited.  This is true of any subsidy scheme.  It is the conundrum of whether one is able to target those who need a subsidy or, if one sets out a rule, whether it will include many more people who already have a capacity to meet our deposit requirements.</p><p>That is an inevitability of all subsidy schemes.  It is one reason cost-benefit analyses of schemes are a good idea to work out the ratio between those who alter their circumstances against those for whom it is essentially a windfall and an extra receipt for income.</p></speech>

I have been critical but I understand where the Central Bank is.  We have a job to do here to debate and agree policy while the Central Bank needs to stand off from it to a certain extent.  However, Professor Philip Lane is on the record saying he would act if there was any evidence of a housing bubble or spiralling prices.  Increases of &euro;6,000 per month in Dublin over the past three months and &euro;4,000 nationally are spiralling house prices in anybody&rsquo;s book.  How long would that trend have to continue for the Central Bank to intervene?</p></speech>

A relatively short number of months is not going to be enough.  We cannot be intervening every few months.  We have pre-committed that every year, in November, we will make our net analysis.  Intervening more frequently than an annual basis would be too frequent.  In the course of this year, we will be making the assessment if we think there is a destabilising spiral.  As I indicated earlier on, there are self-correcting features.  It cannot be the case that when we have a mortgage rule of 3.5 times income that prices can be detached from incomes.  I must emphasise this is not about affordability.  What is happening now is that it is only people on relatively good incomes who can buy a house.  It is not a statement to say that the average house price will connect to the average income level.  The mortgage market is only one slice of all of the issues the political system is debating such as affordability and ways for people to achieve a home.  At least through the end of 2016, we have seen mortgages have not gone above the 3.5 times income level.  It essentially means people on relatively good incomes are able to buy houses, especially in Dublin.</p></speech>

That can include somebody coming from a compliance area or somebody from outside who has got consumer experience.  It can range across institutions.

However, that is not to say the lenders themselves could not actually facilitate that.

We have engaged quite a bit with several consumer stakeholders to ensure the issues they are identifying feed into the lenders&rsquo; approach to this.  We are trying to build the consumer element into this.  It is one of the key challenges we face, namely that the lenders need to approach this from that perspective and not the legal perspective.</p></speech>

All the banks invite that.  I agree with the Deputy that one of the ways consumers should be represented is through the consumer voice in the process.  On top of that, the appeals set-up has a majority of independent members to ensure non-bank interests have the majority vote.</p></speech>

It does not know how many people will be affected.  Is IBRC behind the curve with its review?  Will it get additional time or leeway as a result?  What is the impact of loans sold on by the banks to so-called vulture funds?  How will the review take place given the institution would no longer hold the loans?</p></speech>

It is being put through the same process as all the other lenders, so it is not getting any special treatment.  Clearly, it is a different type of institution in the sense that it is being run by a liquidator.  The framework being applied to it varies slightly because of the fact it is in a liquidation process.  It has to consider all the loan books it is responsible for to determine whether there is any impact on customers.  If there are impacted customers, it has to contact them and identify them.  It is making progress and we are satisfied with the work it is doing.  It is not the case that it is dragging its heels.  We are monitoring it closely to ensure it will deliver.</p></speech>

It includes all mortgages and loanbooks that have been sold or transferred.  We took the approach that the originator of those loans was responsible.  Ultimately, responsibility works back to the person who sold the loan in the first place.</p></speech>

Once the Central Bank has the numbers that there were so many thousands of cases and so many people lost their homes as a result of the measure, the Central Bank has no power to enforce a redress scheme.  The loans have been sold to vulture funds, which are not regulated by the Central Bank, even after the powers that came in under the 2013 Act, how can the Central Bank ensure that if the IBRC review recommends a redress scheme, as we have seen with the majority of other banks, people are put back on the appropriate rate?</p></speech>

We have set out our expectations and applied the framework to all the lenders.  They have all committed to ensuring all the loanbooks are assessed.  We are overseeing that to make sure that happens.  If they are being sold on to an unregulated loan owner, they fall back to the originator and the originator is responsible.  In the case of the IBRC, that includes, for example, the Irish Nationwide Building Society loanbooks.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the Governor has said that this is a live issue.  There are many customers.  AIB has been mentioned but other financial institutions have used a prevailing rate.  People are very angry because after finding out the bank was swindling them for so long and now they have a redress programme, with many having experienced personal trauma in addition to financial trauma, when they are restored onto the rate, they feel injured and victims all over again.</p> <p>  I understood that the redress programme had to be agreed by the Central Bank.  We know that 90% of customers have been put back onto the rate.  A large proportion of them have been put onto what is called the prevailing rate.  Can the delegation tell this committee that the Central Bank has not signed off on this measure?  The impression is that the bank has accepted it.  Has the Central Bank accepted it or not?  Is the bank continuing to consider the prevailing rate issue?  Can the delegation offer any hope to customers who feel that they have suffered another injustice?</p></speech>

This is one of the live issues that form part of the examination.  It is one of many and it is a complex issue.  To be clear, the scope of the examination is not purely around contractual obligations.  It is around regulatory obligations, which is around transparency, and also other influencing factors that lenders need to take into account.  In the context of this particular issue, we require all lenders to take those three elements into account and not just the contractual element.  This is a live issue and, no, we have not signed off on it.</p></speech>

We said that phase 2, where lenders identify affected customers and so on, will conclude by September.  There is a lot going on month by month and we get monthly updates, but we challenge that.  Just because a firm says what it thinks is the case does not mean we accept it.  There will be waves of revision as we go along.</p></speech>

I want to focus on the tracker mortgages issue.  The update of the Central Bank of Ireland's Examination of Tracker Mortgages-related Issues 2017 paper was quite comprehensive and assisted us in getting a deeper understanding of where the Central Bank is in terms of examining this issue.  However, where individuals made complaints to the Financial Services Ombudsman and received a negative decision, I am fearful that the Central Bank's examination will not adequately cover all the people concerned.  I say this because I have evidence particularly about PTSB.  I will refer specifically to PTSB because the Central Bank stated in its report that it had commenced enforcement investigations against the bank.  I know of samples of cases where the FSO made a negative decision about complaints and the people concerned have not received notifications that their cases are being examined, neither from the bank nor the Central Bank.  Will the Governor give guarantees or assurances to those people that they will receive letters?</p></speech>

All trackers, regardless of the history of complaints, are being examined.  It is not the case that a customer receives a letter indicating that the case is being examined.  Everything is under examination.  I am fully sympathetic that people are in an information gap because it a lot more concrete to receive a letter than to be told everything is under examination.  The practicality of 2 million accounts, however, means all accounts are being examined, including those that have been subjected to an ombudsman process.  I ask Mr. Sheridan to reinforce my point.</p></speech>

Again, it is one of the issues we identified early on in this examination and we have worked closely with the ombudsman on this.  He provided us with an analysis of the complaints that his office had looked at over the years, and it was clear that a large number of complaints were upheld in favour of the bank.  Our concern has been that this examination has a broad scope, as I said earlier, in that it is contractual, regulatory transparency and influencing factors, and all of those elements would not necessarily have been considered in previous complaints as such.  We have worked with the ombudsman and engaged with all of the relevant lenders to make sure all of those cases are being included in this examination.</p></speech>

I want to look at one of the thematic areas, namely, data protection.  This should be apparent to the Central Bank at this stage but I want to get the bank's assessment of this.  In the bank's examinations to date, has it found that there are glaring gaps in how data protection law was applied to individual customers when they sought information on specific telephone calls, dates of engagement or correspondence they had?  I understand that when complaints were made or when people sought to interact with their bank, especially on the options issue, and again I am talking about PTSB, there were glaring inaccuracies in some instances in how the bank interpreted that engagement.  Also, the bank refused in some instances to acknowledge that telephone calls had taken place or that particular correspondence was entered into.  When people sought to have records furnished, they were not furnished, or if they were, they might have been furnished inaccurately or less than adequately.  I want to ensure that from a consumer protection point of view into the future, where people have issues with their mortgages, a robust system is in place to ensure the data protection element provides protection to the consumer.</p><p>I hope the Central Bank will address that matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-04a.117" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Sheridan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017040400002#O00200"><p>It is a good question.  Obviously, the scope of this goes back a long way and, as such, there are data issues.  From our perspective, we have made it clear to lenders that if there is any issue in terms of lack of documentation and nothing to back up their position, then it needs to go in favour of the consumer.  The other issue is lenders' ability and willingness to share that information with consumers, and also to consider that in the context of the examination.  We have required independent oversight to oversee what lenders are doing.  We are also carrying out assurance work, particularly in the area where lenders are concluding that borrowers might have been in scope but not impacted upon.  That will be an ongoing focus for us.</p></speech>

In other words, it should be decoupled because there is a resources issue.  If it is necessary to examine 2 million accounts, presumably microscopically, that gives rise to questions as to whether there should be a separate entity to speak for the consumer in this instance.  Professor Lane will understand if there is a certain degree of scepticism in respect of the idea that the banks appointing their own independent advisers to oversee the conduct of the investigations and then liaise with the Central Bank in the process.  For all sorts of historical reasons, he will understand that there would be some scepticism about whether the Central Bank can adequately and robustly protect the consumer.</p></speech>

Around the world there are all sorts of different institutional arrangements but let me emphasise that there are a lot of advantages to having consumer protection within the Central Bank.  It is important to emphasise that there is no hierarchy in the legislation.  It is not the case that consumer protection ranks below financial stability.  These are twin mandates that we have.  I remind the Deputy that our financial regulation activity is funded by fees collected from the industry and that there is not a resource constraint here.  If we deem it necessary to expand our personnel to deliver consumer protection, by and large that cost will fall on the industry; it will not fall on the taxpayer.  We have advocated throughout that the cost should be fully paid for by the industry.</p> <p>  An advantage of consumer protection within the bank is that we learn a great deal from being the overall supervisor.  Around the world, stand-alone consumer protection commissions have a difficulty because they do not have the same access to information that we have.  I would think that it is in the best interests of consumers that we have that twin power.  It is quite effective.  We have done a lot that is at the intersection of supervision and consumer protection.  Our codes have been, unusually in the international context, prescriptive in how financial institutions deal with consumers.  There is always an uphill struggle to do more and do better, but it is not an issue of resources or of any conflict within the Central Bank.</p></speech>

One of these relates to PTSB and the other is an open investigation into Ulster Bank.  As the examination proceeds and we get scrutiny of the information on customers' identified approach to redress and other information, we will consider opening further enforcement investigations.</p><p>In the context of our work, we conduct a forensic detailed examination of data records to get right down to the heart of the matter - the rule breaches, how it happened, why it happened.  It can involve 20,000 to 30,000 documents and we supplement it with interviews.  In that context, we always will consider taking cases against senior responsible individuals who participate in any breaches where there is evidence of that.  It is a complex regulatory framework.  Our responsibility is primarily to bring administrative sanctions cases forward or to look at the fitness and probity context.  That is within the remit of the Central Bank.</p><p> In addition, we have statutory obligations to make criminal reports to other relevant agencies.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for example, is one of those.  In this context, no reports have been made to date.  That is an evidence based procedure.  However, I met the Garda to discuss trackers and I have opened a dialogue with it.  We discussed this in general terms.  As our investigations proceed and progress, we will keep that under constant review and we will make those reports where the issue arises.  We have regular engagement with the Garda.</p></speech>

Essentially, I am asking for that assurance because we do not want to come back to this again in the future when another raft of borrowers who have potentially been forgotten about will have a legitimate case to be heard.</p></speech>

In relation to the Central Bank's updated report, it outlines on page 22 the public warnings and on page 23 where the Central Bank issued communications to Bank of Ireland.  That was in 2010.  In 2012, Bank of Ireland commissioned a Red C report that would "encourage tracker mortgage holders to move off their product", to "ultimately improve the overall profitability of the Bank of Ireland" Group.  There were several hundred letters sent out to customers asking them to come in to branches and meet the bank on foot of this report.  Was the Central Bank aware of that or is that part of its remit?  The Central Bank issued a yellow card and a red card, certainly, to the Bank of Ireland, that there were problems.  Then, in 2012, they go off and do this.  Would that be where an individual would be held responsible?</p></speech>

We looked across the system in 2010 and arising from that, we had to follow-up issues with Bank of Ireland.  Also, as a follow-up from that, we introduced measures where in future anybody who was coming off a tracker mortgage had to get clear information and also a warning of the implications, and those provisions were subsequently included in our 2012 consumer protection code.</p> <p>  I cannot comment on a specific institution but all lenders were to comply with those requirements in terms of the specific disclosures to be made.

I am happy that the Central Bank is looking at it.</p> <p>  Professor Lane remarked on the culture that was there.  I am not convinced that this could be interpreted entirely as culture.  I wonder if any of the investigations are looking at the possibility of collusion between the lenders at the time.  It seems too coincidental that so many lenders interpreted the tracker interest in such similar ways.  Has there been investigation into collusion between some or all of the lenders?</p></speech>

Any indication of anything that would be either a violation of our codes or of competition law will be flagged.  Until these examinations are concluded, I am not going to rule out the hypothesis of collusion.  As I said here in December, there is an economic imperative for many of these banks.  What I think happened much of the time was essentially that during a period of financial distress in the economy, the banks were trying to save money by charging customers where they could at a higher, more expensive rate.  They might say that it was within the terms of the contract, that they interpret the contract to mean they could do that.  There is a common economic incentive to do that.  It would be ideal if the ethical standards and the culture within those firms would be that they would not exploit it because they were consumer-focused bank and that is what we want to get to.  <br/><br/>Our codes have a degree of prescription in how banks are supposed to treat their customers, unlike many jurisdictions which take the view that a customer has been given a contract and <i>caveat emptor.  </i>We have a lot more consumer protection in how we approach things but we still had this massive failure.  It is an uphill struggle.  Let us see what comes out of the examination and associated investigations.  Collusion is not impossible but I can think of other reasons it happened.</p></speech>

They are in charge of the contractual position and it is a position between them and the customer.  Then it is a position between the Central Bank and the lender regarding the code.  To refer to collusion might lead one to think that there is a need for agreement as between each lender to act and there is not.  Each one can act unilaterally or may have acted unilaterally and that is something that is probably relevant to consider when looking at that dimension.</p></speech>

If I am correct, prior to that there had been a limit of &euro;220,000 which had been brought in by Professor Lane's predecessor, the loans had to be 90% and for any balance above that there had to be 80%.  In November, Professor Lane came along and effectively put it all at 90% with no limit at all on the price.  Am I correct?</p></speech>

There is now a situation where a person could buy a &euro;1 million home and they could be regarded as a first-time buyer.  I am being slightly facetious, but take someone in Dublin looking to buy a &euro;400,000 first-time home and they can look for a loan of 90%.  Surely by lifting a complete limit that would effectively add to the increase in the price of houses.  Why did the Central Bank not lift the limit from &euro;220,000 to say &euro;300,000 or &euro;350,000?  Why was the limit removed completely?</p><p>Has that move in itself added fuel to the fire in terms of the increase in the price of houses?</p></speech>

The first is the loan to income ratio, which we did not touch.  At three and a half times income, the loan limit is quite restrictive.  For example, in the United Kingdom, the corresponding figure is four and a half times income.  That is the anchor or core of the scheme.</p> <p>  The second instrument relates to deposits.  Last November, we published the evidence surrounding what we did.  There are two reasons for it.  The first is for simplicity.  As Deputy O'Donnell indicated, we had a scheme with a turning point of &euro;220,000.  If that had persisted, every year we would have to move the number because &euro;220,000 was the median house price for first-time buyer price in 2012.</p></speech>

There are two reasons.  First, when we see a rise in house prices, the question is whether we should reduce that number or recognise that the average house price has gone up and relax the number.  That would lead to speculation every year about what we would do with the turning point.</p> <p>  We already have a strong anchor in the system with a limit of three and a half times income.  We had a layered track of 10% for first-time buyers with only 5% of exceptions.  We tightened the ability to go above that limit.  The figure was 18% for second-time buyers and 30% for buy-to-let mortgages.  That is a fairly severe set of deposit requirements.</p> <p>  The second point is more empirical.  There was not much lending caught by the rule because at that point we had many exceptions to the rule.  From memory, only 11%, approximately, of first-time buyers were actually being caught by that rule.  People had more in deposits than was needed &ndash; we discussed this point earlier.  Many first-time buyers have more than they need on deposit.  They were not caught by the rule.  Many people below the rule were getting exceptions.  Not many people were being caught by the rule.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-04a.159" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1374" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017040400002#S00500"><p>I am asking a question.  We suddenly had a measure in place by the Central Bank.  It was put in place by the predecessor of Mr. Lane.  It was a &euro;220,000 limit for first-time buyer with a 90% loan.  It was draconian in nature and particularly impacted those in Dublin, more so than outside Dublin.  Suddenly, the Central Bank took away any limit.  The Central Bank left the loan limit at 90%, with exceptions for some people who could go to 95%.</p> <p>  Not long ago during the Celtic tiger, we were complaining that mortgages of 95% and upwards were fuelling the price of houses.  I want to know why the Central Bank took away the limit completely.</p> <p>  Let us consider the first three months of this year.  House prices went up by 4.3% approximately.  The Governor stated last November, when the Central Bank took away the limit, that if there was a material change then the bank would make changes to the rules.  Now, the Governor is saying that the bank will look at it every November.  November is eight months away.  That is too long.  It seems strange that the Central Bank went from having a limit to no limit at all.  Is that a contributory factor in the increase in the price of houses?</p> <p>  What does the Governor regard as a material increase in the price of houses?  At what point will the Governor seek to bring some sort of control over the increase in the price of houses?  November is eight months away.  If house prices continue to spiral at the rate they are going, it will put the value of the average home beyond the ordinary person.</p> <p>  I always look at it in simplistic terms.  Can the average couple afford to buy a home?  If they cannot afford to buy a home, then we have a dysfunctional system.  The Governor referred to stability.  Stability is not a macro issue; it is about something else.  We saw a couple on an RTE programme last night.  They bought a one-bedroom apartment during the Celtic tiger because they were told that was the only way to get on the property ladder.</p><p>They have a family and they have to move out of that one-bedroom apartment.  The loan is in negative equity and is a millstone around their necks.  They are renting elsewhere.</p><p> They are not first-time buyers curtailed by Central Bank restrictions.  However, let us consider the first-time buyers who are renting, who are in their 30s and approaching 40 years of age.  Such people are wondering whether they will ever qualify for a mortgage or buy a family home.  I am asking a question.  By lifting that limit, is it possible that the Central Bank may be contributing to depriving these people from buying homes that they can afford?</p><p> At what point will the Governor consider that a material change in price has taken place, considering we have seen a 4.3% increase in the first three months of this year?  At what point will the Central Bank step in and make the changes to ensure that an ordinary person, who is making a living in an ordinary job, can afford to buy a first-time buyer home?</p></speech>

This goes back to the interconnection between financial stability and consumer protection.  As Senator O'Donnell has said, these rules have a double effect.  Partly, they serve to protect the system in order that we avoid a crisis of the same type from recurring.  Partly, they are in place to protect households.  That is definitely part of our intention.</p> <p>  Credit rules are not about solving the affordability problem in this country.  For people on typical incomes to be able to afford a reasonable home, the answer is all about expanding housing supply.</p> <p>  Senator O'Donnell pointed out the specific change in our rules that might affect a house costing &euro;300,000 or &euro;400,000.  The change is rather small because it is only at the margin above &euro;220,000 where the extra deposit was required.  This is not a major change, especially in the context of a large fraction of people in that neighbourhood securing exemptions from the old rule.  The old rule was complicated and had a wide exemption.  Now, we have a new rule that is simpler.  The borrowing limit is 90% but there are few exceptions.  Only 5% of first-time buyers can get an exemption from that rule.  Therefore, it is not the case that it is a material change that is driving the housing market.  It is a simplification.</p> <p>  I repeat that the anchor of the system is a limit of three and a half times income.  This means that when house prices go up, only people on high incomes are affording houses.  That is why all the measures being worked on to increase supply represent the key to that.</p></speech>

One is that the economy is growing.  Employment is growing quickly.  More people are looking to buy homes.  Of course, with the dysfunctional rental market, many people are looking at high rents and are concluding that even though houses are expensive, buying is what they believe they should do.  It is part and parcel of the wider housing supply issue.</p> <p>  Of course, it is still the case that we live in a low interest rate world.  Certain people, especially those who take out a long duration mortgage of 30 years or so, are calculating that some of these levels are affordable.  However, this applies to a limited group.  What we are seeing is that only people on decent incomes are able to buy houses.  That is essentially why it is not part of the overall solution.  What we need is affordable housing.  That is the core focus.</p></speech>

There is a major problem with supply.  Does the Governor not see his role as ensuring control in the market until such time as that happens?  Is the role of the Governor not to ensure that the price of first-time buyer houses, ordinary three-bedroom semi-detached houses, does not go out of control prior to that point?</p></speech>

I repeat the point that a limit of three and a half times income is a fairly severe by international standards, especially in a low interest rate world.  For that to be the limit on a mortgage is a severe restriction.  In a European context, the 90% deposit limit is significant for first-time buyers.</p> <p>  We have put in rules.  I will go back to what Senator O'Donnell asked me.</p><p>If we see, according to our modelling, that house prices are going above what we think is a reasonable zone, then we will intervene.</p></speech>

At what rate of increase in house prices over the next number of months would the Governor say that we need to change the rules on mortgage lending to ensure the price of houses does not go out of control for the first-time buyer?</p></speech>

Prices are rising from a low level.  We will act if the level of house prices compared to the level of incomes and the level of interest rates is in a danger zone.  Our assessment in November last year was that, at that point, it was not in a danger zone.  Prices were still in a recovery mode.  I do not agree with the Senator that we can do it more than once a year because it would be totally destabilising.  Every-----</p></speech>

We cannot operate in a vacuum where it is let go for eight months and absolutely nothing is done.  The question I am asking is, at what point is there is a material change?  Professor Lane is a renowned economist, he understands figures.  We have seen a 4.3% increase in the first three months, the highest in over two years.  The ordinary person looking in will want to know at what rate of increase will they be reading that the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Lane, has said we need to change the rules to ensure the price of houses does not go out of control.</p></speech>

There is a very strong reason to have a calendar based review.  It is once a year in November.

He said that he would act if there was a material change in the price of houses.  The ordinary person looking in here, who is looking to buy their first home, could possibly be alarmed because they are being told that, regardless of the way the price of houses goes between now and November, the Central Bank, through its Governor, will do absolutely nothing in respect of mortgage rules to ensure the price of houses does not go out of control.</p></speech>

If there is material change in house prices relative to fundamentals in that review, we will alter the rules.  That is the commitment, once a year.  That, in an international context, is a high frequency.  These rules cannot be changed on a month-by-month basis.</p></speech>

Really, the response I have gotten from the Governor is that he will be doing nothing between now and November.  I ask him to pay careful heed because we got into this mess in the Celtic tiger period when the price of houses spiralled out of control and we suddenly had a situation where people were taking out loans, which I know had much higher interest then, which effectively put them in negative equity.  The loan-to-income ratio is fine, but if there is a situation where the price of houses increases at an exponential rate, there is the risk that there will be people buying houses again who will find themselves in negative equity in a relatively short period of time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-04a.184" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017040400002#V00100"><p>This is why it is impossible to have an exponential, ongoing rate of increase in house prices.  We know incomes cannot grow at that rate.  Let me go back.  Given the tragic history of what happened here, it is so tempting to be fearful whenever the price of houses goes up, and to say it will trigger extrapolation and a self-sustaining spiral.  This is why the loan-to-income ratio is fundamental.  Incomes cannot spiral upwards, therefore mortgage levels cannot spiral upwards in this context.  That is why there is a limit.  With the loan-to-value ratio and the deposit requirements, again people's deposits cannot spiral upwards.  They have to save those deposits, so it is impossible to have that spiral in the same way.  A degree of predictability is needed in our rules, and this is why a once a year review is good way to do it.  Going back, I have said that if we see a material change we will change the rules, but on a once-a-year basis.  Doing so more frequently than that is not a good idea.</p></speech>

May I make a suggestion?  As costs are rising, in that trajectory there is always a period of very high movement of house prices.  To follow on from what my colleague said, we spent two years with a few other members of this committee in these windowless rooms.  There needs to be sufficient flexibility.  Professor Lane has mentioned that there are fundamentals.  I think that is the term he used.  Those fundamentals need to be able to trigger something.  We need to understand what would be triggered in respect of situations where the Governor may have to intervene more than once a year.</p> <p>  I understand his thought process in respect of the market but, equally, if the fundamentals are moving at such a pace, something else may be necessary.  I suggest that he give some thought to how he explains the triggering of those fundamentals to us in order that we are able to have confidence that he is flexible enough to move in a period of high inflation in respect of house prices.</p></speech>

Essentially, the way policy in this area should work is to have the decision once a year.  Of course, more frequently than that, if we detect early indications that we may need to do something, then through other vehicles, such as forward guidance or through our speeches, we can indicate to everyone-----</p></speech>

I do not want to be disrespectful but previous governors, in the period before the recession, used that terminology also.  It did not work.  It is not going to work.  Unless the Governor has the flexibility within his structures to intervene in an intelligent way, I think we could be whistling past the recessionary graveyard again.  That is not something any of us want to happen.  We do not want to see the people in our offices again who we have seen for the past six or eight years.</p></speech>

We have an additional tool called the countercyclical capital buffer which we look at every quarter - every three months.  This is something that can move at a much higher frequency.  Its role is to detect overheating of growth in credit growing.  I think it is a very good idea.  Under European law, every European country has to make a new, fresh assessment of whether credit in the economy is overheating every three months.  That is the measure we can move more frequently.  In the Irish economy, I would agree with the idea that we need to be continually looking.  There is a lot of European focus on the phrase "countercyclical capital buffer".  We just released our current assessment a few days ago.  We do assess.</p><p>We are forced to assess and have a routine of doing so every three months.

Is Professor Lane satisfied with the analysis that the Central Bank of Ireland is conducting in respect of the commercial real estate, CRE, sector?</p></speech>

A basic issue is that every office block is different, every shopping centre is different, so the dataset is less advanced.  We and authorities across Europe are doing work now to try to improve that.  It is very important to say in the Irish context that in recent years, much of the funding for what we see around Dublin is not coming from credit but from equity.  That is a fundamental difference.  It still matters quite a lot because if there is a reversal in that market it means that the collateral values of the banks' existing loans will alter.  It is fundamentally different when there is a lot of equity funding compared to debt funding.</p></speech>

In terms of delivering redress at this stage, we are satisfied that will happen.  I think there is a separate issue around compensation on top of the redress but our priority, as we have said, is to identify the customers that are impacted, stop the harm and then fix the problem.  The redress is the key part of the problem.  We have engaged with the liquidators to ensure that will happen.</p></speech>

The framework we have set out includes principles for redress and compensation.  There is a potential issue in a liquidation as to where the claim for compensation would rest in a liquidation.  That is a potential issue.  As far as we are concerned the framework covers redress and compensation across all lenders but we are engaging with the liquidator on those specific issues.</p></speech>

After the crisis across Europe there was a recognition that what is called a macro-prudential policy should have been interventionist in terms of the credit volumes and that the capital held by banks should be subject to intervention.  We have that framework in Ireland.  On the subject on which we have just had an exchange, it is not an issue about the Governor writing a speech or a report stating that the Central Bank of Ireland is concerned.  One needs tools.  We are using two instruments, first, a set of mortgage rules and second, a capital buffer so that if we think the credit market is starting to overheat, we can force the banks to hold more capital and therefore be able to absorb more losses.  What we have right now is that we have brought in these mortgage rules, which I think are fairly severe in an European context but we are open to tightening them if we think it is needed.  In regard to the capital buffer, it is still the case that credit is shrinking on net but if we get to a situation where we see credit surging we can intervene.</p> <p>  There are other tools available.  We have many tools and we in the Central Bank of Ireland have a lot of autotomy to trigger them.  It is definitely my responsibility and by the way, the reason that I took on this role is that I think it is fundamental.  I would hope that somebody with my background in economics would be able to make the call when needed.</p></speech>

We would be in a bad space if we were to end up there.  Has the Central Bank of Ireland conducted an analysis of the offers that have been made to people who are seeking redress and compensation?  What I am trying to find out is whether some financial institutions have tried to get out of their responsibilities on the cheap?  Effectively if the potential liability is X, Y or Z, and the banks make an offer to somebody who might be in a difficult space, which is not the full amount of redress for which they are liable, what is the position?</p></speech>

We are going through the files and where we see a scheme which we do not think is taking into account all of the relevant householders or we do not like the scheme, we challenge it.  On top of that, even if the affected person does not like the figure with which we may have ultimately also agreed, there is an appeals process where there is support to launch that appeal within the framework.  There is also the ombudsman and the courts.  There are many layers but the fundamental point is that persons who receive a cheque should not be concerned that it somehow compromises the individual's options.</p></speech>

Professor Lane mentioned Brexit as a priority issue for the Central Bank and said that were the bank was to be asked to consider the authorisation of a firm in Ireland, it would still want to be satisfied that it would be authorising a business or a line of business that would be run from Ireland, that it would effectively be supervising and that it would expect it to have a substantive presence here.  Has any of the potential insurers or banks looking to move to Ireland and engaging with the Central Bank raised personal taxation rates as being an important issue in its decision to locate here?</p></speech>

I am sure the wider issues are raised with IDA Ireland or other branches of government.

The attractiveness of Dublin or Ireland as a location is not something it would discuss with us.</p></speech>

There is a single European system of financial supervision.  For banks, it is absolute because the decision on whether to grant a banking licence is taken by the European Central Bank through the single supervisory mechanism in Frankfurt.  In other sectors such as insurance and investment funds there is a common framework, but there is a degree of difference in interpretation at national level.  Within the various committees at which we meet at a European level there would be a discussion to come up with a common philosophy and framework.  That process is ongoing.</p></speech>

One is revising the codes, for example, in respect of lengthening the period for renewal.  That is broadly routine.  We revise these kind of things all the time.  The specific issue about the information database is that as it is not within our current powers, legislation must change.  It is also the type of activity where we would require financing to do it.  The question arises as to whether it could be from a levy on the industry or something else.  That is being worked through at the moment.  It is more of a mandate issue.  Do we have the legal mandate to do it?  It is fine to expand our mandate but we need a law to allow us to do it so steps need to be taken.  Planning for that is in train.  Work is ongoing to set that up.</p></speech>

We know that a lack of return on investments is a major factor in driving up prices so Professor Lane's remarks could be interpreted as telling insurers that price increases were the only option.  Does the Central Bank regard the huge increases in insurance premiums as necessary corrections?  Is the Central Bank telling us that a 70% increase over two years across the board is an increase it is happy simply to let pass?</p></speech>

Our role in this regard is to make sure that the insurance firms have the resources to pay out on claims and that they do not collapse.  We want to make sure they are making profits and have enough reserves to pay out on claims.  If the cost of claims is going up and if companies cannot compensate through investment income, the end result is that premiums go up.  Equally, they can remain profitable with a lower cost of insurance and lower premia if all of the working group's reforms drive down the costs.  Essentially, it is a sustainability issue.  We need to ensure insurance companies are sustainable but if costs can be brought down, that is consistent with falling premia so it would be good news for premiums to fall as long as it is on the basis of the cost base falling to justify that.  Many policies can help with that.</p></speech>

One haulier told me that the cost of his insurance has gone up by 300% this year, which is an enormous expense.  He also told me about a company in Poland which sells lorries to Irish people who insure them here at enormous cost.  The same lorry is being sold in Poland with insurance fixed for four years.  Something is wrong somewhere.  Would Professor Lane like to comment on that?</p></speech>

Looking around and understanding why it is high here compared with other countries is an important way to think about it.  I hope that the ongoing work does more to find out whether it is because of differences in compensation awards or differences in market structures and so on.  A lot can be learned from looking around.</p></speech>

However, we would be here until Christmas if we asked every question we have been requested to put to the Central Bank at this committee. </p><p> Professor Lane passed the buck when he said that people should go directly to the bank with their correspondence.  In many cases, they are not getting any response from the bank.  They do not know where they are at.  They do not know when their tracker is going to be restored or when they are going to be paid their compensation.  Bearing in mind that Professor Lane said that the framework requires each lender to appoint an external independent party to oversee the conduct of its examination, where does he think these people should go with their queries?</p></speech>

The nature of this comprehensive approach is that banks are trying to come up with policies that treat all customers fairly.  The banks ask to be told of concerns about individual accounts but they are working from the full universe of all accounts.  They then have a cohort who took mortgages out in 2006 when there may have been an issue with an incorrect rate or being moved off a tracker onto an incorrect rate.  Month by month, I hope that more cases get finalised.  Only when the bank feels ready to announce it has a policy for this large group of people will it ride out and announce its rewards.  If people do not like what they are receiving, there is a wave of appeal mechanisms available to them.  Unfortunately, it is taking time.  One might imagine that any one complaint could be handled promptly.  However, when that complaint is folded into a very large examination, it does lead to delay.  It is frustrating but our intention is that this will conclude with all of these cases being dealt with.  Moreover, it does not mean waiting to the end.  As a cohort is dealt with, then redress and compensation should be paid.  A significant number have received redress but not a majority.</p></speech>

However, there is the alternative explanation of a common culture across the banks and a common economic incentive.

A fine of &euro;4.5 million, the highest fine the Central Bank has collected to date, was imposed.  More importantly, in the course of the enforcement investigation we detected the consumer detriment and prioritised that as the most significant part of our effort.  One of our first actions was to require PTSB, the owner of Springboard, to prioritise the identification of impacted customers and give them redress and compensation.  The requirement to prioritise the redress and compensation approach was borne out of the open and ongoing enforcement investigation into PTSB.  We demanded that consumer interest be a first priority and that the redress requirement which we sought and obtained in law in 2013 be applied.

The regulations, by and large, are European in nature.  There is not a huge amount of variation in the regulatory regime across Europe.

It has been reported that those customers affected are feeling the heat since with extra pressure to pay exorbitant interest rates.

These customers will also have the benefit of the code on mortgage arrears.  What is also important to remember is that the types of loans these funds have bought.  There could be a mix of how a firm treats arrears but, as time moves on, how long-term arrears cases are dealt with across the system.  Over time, final solutions are necessary.</p> <p>  There may well also be differences in strategy.  We released the mortgage arrears report a while ago where we did call out that these could have different strategies compared with local banks.  That is true and a consequence of the different ownership.  It is worth keeping an eye on.</p></speech>

Obviously, there have been two reasonably high-profile announcements with AIG and Lloyds announcing relocation plans from London to places other than Ireland.  While I accept the Governor&rsquo;s position that it is early days, the initial signs are not great.  The two companies mentioned already have business and involvements in Ireland but have decided to locate elsewhere in the EU rather than here.  I know Professor Lane will already have addressed these points to a certain extent.  Will he address the specifics and the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments?</p></speech>

On a firm making a decision about where to go, apart from the regulatory issue, there is a whole pile of other factors, such as location and proximity to London, which will enter that decision.  I must emphasise again the scope for regulatory arbitrage is not zero but is limited.  By and large, all EU countries operate under the same framework.</p><p>There are European supervisory authorities, for example, with insurance.  The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, EIOPA, means all insurance regulators get together frequently.  There are plenty of discussions about what we want to ask of a firm moving from London and exchanges about coming up with a common framework.  It will not be conclusive in the sense that there is still room for risk assessment.  There will be differences in variation in what exactly is the risk posed to the host country by a given corporate structure.  There may well be legitimate differences of opinion across a system.  The Senator gave two examples.  Let us see as time moves about the balance on when there is a wider set of examples.</p></speech>

The more we can converge on a common understanding, the less influence any differences of interpretation will play.  We have already publicly stated we have six applications from insurance companies.  It is not that there is no interest.  There is plenty of interest across all sectors.</p></speech>

In 2016, we grew by approximately 5.5%, so numbers went from approximately 1,500 to 1,600.  We are in the low 1,600s now.  We have identified that if we were fully staffed and incorporated an expanded rate of activities, we would like to be at 1,800 by the end of the year.  In terms of hiring net 200 in one year, the nature of the Central Bank, like any central bank or regulator anywhere, is that our employees are attractive to employers.  We believe a particular feature of Brexit is that this will get worse because firms coming to Dublin will ask who they can hire and, naturally, they will be looking at our employees and employees of other banks here.  That is an ongoing challenge.  I could say to the Senator that if our pay levels were higher it would be easier but that is part of the wider context in terms of public sector pay.  There are many factors to deciding what is appropriate on that.</p></speech>

However, in terms of borrowing and having a certain amount on deposit, if the requirement was 20% of &euro;400,000, that would be &euro;80,000.  However, if house prices increase, 15% of, say, &euro;600,000 would be &euro;90,000.  Is there an argument to be made that when the guidelines are relaxed or it is made easier for people to get in the race, to a certain extent that creates a problem in that house prices rise to match the relaxation and the consumer is no better off?  They have just got a smaller percentage of a higher amount, which in overall terms is no different or potentially higher than the original.  Does the Governor get the point I am making?</p></speech>

In the United Kingdom, it is four and a half times the income.  There is a lot of lobbying effort taking place with a view to saying it should be four and a half time the income here.  That is the linchpin in terms of anchoring the system.  There is a limit to how much credit can fuel the housing market when we have that restriction.</p> <p>  Going above that, we have three layers of deposits.  It is appropriate that first-time buyers have a lower deposit requirement than second time buyers.  It is 10% for first-time buyers, 20% for second time buyers, and 30% for buy to let properties.  We must remember that in the mid-2000s, much of it was buy to let properties coming in and competing with first-time buyers but when there is a 30% deposit requirement for buy to let, that restricts that.</p> <p>  There are many breaks in the system.

That amount of redress is significant for most people which means, presumably, that they were out of pocket by that amount of money at the start of or during the process and various personal issues may have arisen for them as a result.

The average, in terms of what we have published so far, is around the &euro;30,000 mark.  However, within that and over the course of this examination there will be a mix of fairly minor errors where there is a minor amount of redress and a minor amount of compensation and extreme cases where severe damage was done and the compensation amount will need to much higher.  The average conveys something but it is supposed to be customer specific so when we see a severe case, the scale of the payment should be ramped up.</p></speech>

Is it possible for the committee to get those figures because it is not nice if someone is affected by &euro;500, so to speak, but it is not the same as being affected by &euro;100,000.</p></speech>

On the tracker mortgage issue, the Governor has been very clear that lenders have failed their customers.  That is a very serious environment for the Central Bank to be operating in and it should take it at the most serious level.</p> <p>  On that, we said earlier that the reasons banks treated customers in this way are unknown.  We still do not know whether it was for economic advantage or collusion.  Padraic Kissane, one of the witnesses who came before this committee, was clear on the harrowing stories families are still living through as a result of this issue yet the consumer has no information on that and no voice in that regard.  That is a huge concern because justice delayed is justice denied and many of these families are still living in an environment where they are not aware what is happening and feel powerless.</p> <p>  We have a number of public interest directors in our banking system who one would imagine would be the voice of the consumer on these issues.  However, they have been silent regarding these cases, which is very worrying.  I have some questions for the Governor.  I refer to the correspondence I get as a TD.</p><p>If people tell me they are engaging with the financial institutions but are not getting any information and are being ignored, is there anything - having regard to his earlier comments about how the banking system has failed its customers on this issue - the Governor's office can do to compel the banks to give their customers information on their files with respect to where their cases are at?</p></speech>

There is a multi-layered approach to trying to represent consumers.  The motivating factor for many people in the Central Bank, especially in our consumer protection work, is to try to protect the consumer through the range of powers we have.  There is also the ombudsman process.  As Mr. Bernard Sheridan said earlier, it is intended that the framework that each bank runs has a consumer voice.  The Deputy might argue about how independent that process is if the bank is picking the framework.  There will be a majority of independent voices in the appeals process.  I can appreciate the frustration experienced by customers if they are not getting sufficient updates on their individual cases.  That leads to considerable distress because of the sheer uncertainty about not knowing what will happen.  The only thing I can say about that is that I hope month by month an increasing number cases will be resolved.  We are pushing banks to do this as quickly as is feasible.  I will now ask Mr. Sheridan to respond.</p></speech>

Quite a number of consumers have contacted us directly.  We have engaged a good deal with Padraic Kissane and I acknowledge the work he has been doing on this issue.  We have required lenders to put dedicated units in place to deal with customers who have queries.  If the Deputy has information on the way particular lenders are treating their customers, we are happy to follow up on that, and we have done that in the past.</p> <p>  We are in this phase that is live, as such.  Even though lenders might not be able to explain to their customers their individual positions, they should be able to explain what is happening, the timelines involved and when they can expect to hear back.  We are pushing lenders to do that but we are happy to be given information if consumers are not getting that treatment.</p></speech>

We have reports both from witnesses and from those in the media of how some institutions have changed the language they use and how it is very interchangeable and complicated.  Article 5 of Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive 93/13/EEC states: </p><blockquote>In the case of contracts where all or certain terms offered to the consumer are in writing, these terms must always be drafted in plain intelligible language.  Where there is doubt in the meaning of a term, the interpretation most favourable to the consumer shall prevail.</blockquote> <p>Will the Central Bank's investigation be established in line with the provisions of that article?</p></speech>

That captures it.  That same philosophy pervades many of our codes.  There is a whole range of different regulatory requirements which essentially boil down to what the Deputy has just said.  I will ask Mr. Sheridan and Ms Rowland to respond on what happens when these codes are violated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-04a.313" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Sheridan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017040400002#GG00600"><p>The Deputy has made a good point.  This essentially is the core of where we are at in the examination.  It is up to the lenders to deliver on this now in terms of their approach to, and interpretation of, it.  They have to take the interpretation from the point of view of what a consumer would reasonably understand rather than from a legal contractual perspective.  We are in the middle of this process with lenders and it is true that none of them is taking that approach regarding their consumer focus, but we still have to continue to challenge other lenders.  The test will be the outcomes of this examination in terms of what they deliver, but that is a key element of this examination.  The Deputy has captured the key element of its scope.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-04-04a.314" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Derville Rowland" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017040400002#GG00700"><p>I agree with that point.  The essence of the provision the Deputy cited is a civil law protection.  It is not a financial services regulatory law protection.  It is something that attaches and is afforded to everybody who has commercial dealings in this State as a consumer, and he or she can go to the court and vindicate that right separately.</p><p>We cannot chase down an enforcement case based on that provision but it makes perfect sense in Ireland, if consumer protection is at the heart of what we do, that we interpret our regulatory requirements in line with the law of the land and in line with consumer protection provisions in the wider corpus of law that protects consumers.  It is our clear expectation that all lenders behave in a way that puts consumers' best interests at the heart of their behaviour and interpretation of such requirements.  That attaches to the interpretation of contracts, the transparency provisions in our codes and what we expect as users and enforcers of financial services.</p></speech>

One can imagine a customer raising the matter with the Ombudsman and trying to sue the lender and in other jurisdictions such a matter might be resolved primarily through a court case.  I believe this will prove to be quite effective for the Central Bank as the regulator using our regulatory powers, which are quite wide-ranging, to essentially avoid having all of these individuals taking court cases, which would be intimidating and costly for them.  The Ombudsman framework can be effective.  At this scale it is limited, whereas we can deliver a lot more through this framework approach.</p></speech>

It is true that it is in a moral suasion space but when we were putting together the consumer redress and compensation scheme we made every conceivable effort as lawyers and regulators to put the consumer at the heart of it.  Where it is capable of being used, the money is received upfront, one keeps that money and can appeal the decision.  If one does not like the answer one gets on appeal - it is not that we recommend this but these are the available options - in addition to that, one can go to the Ombudsman or to court, but it is preferable that matters are sorted quicker, simpler and easier through the use of an effective redress and compensation option at first pass without having to use those additional protections, but they are available if they are needed.  It was seen as a complementary option.  Our aim is for this to be sorted as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

When Mr. Kissane and others appeared before the committee they expressed a view that the Central Bank is the appropriate forum as the guardian of our financial system and regulator to investigate these matters and to hold the banks to account.  I advise the Governor's team that thousands of people are relying on this and they still have faith that the officials in the Central Bank will sort out this, but the clock is ticking.  I ask that they do not betray that faith and to ensure they hold the banks to account and get redress for these families.</p></speech>

We are here to serve the public interest.  This is a heavy responsibility for Mr. Bernard Sheridan's staff, who are at the front line in leading this, but it is a motivating factor knowing that in the end this will deliver.  Time passes and it is very unfortunate that this has happened, but at this stage we are hopeful that a lot can be remedied.</p></speech>

That is where lies the difficulty.  As a result, we have received volumes of correspondence from clients of banks that have been badly affected.  I will deal with some of their cases.  For example, clients may have written to their banks about their pre-March 2006 tracker mortgage and have gone through the process with the bank only to find that it does not respond or pushes them from pillar to post, often forcing them to get legal advice and legal services at a huge cost.  Instead of dealing with the problem, the bank pushes it out and tests the customer in how far he or she is prepared to go in pursuing the problem.</p><p>I understand we cannot name individuals, but in one case a client wrote to us anxious that this matter be raised with the witnesses.  I refer to the position before 2006, what they bought out of the promotion of the product itself and then the discovery that when they sought redress, the bank simply pushed them around.  From 2010 to date, they have not received any approach from the bank that they consider to be constructive or helpful.  In fact, they have fought all the way and are now at the end of their tether.  This kind of issue falls generally within the area of tracker mortgages but also brings in other matters the bank has ignored.  How does the Central Bank enforce this?  As Ms Rowland said, it has an obligation to deal with this type of custom before it goes anywhere else and without putting the customer into bad health and arrears because of the associated cost.</p></speech>

I agree that the relationship between a bank and an individual customer is typically totally asymmetrical in terms of the balance of power and any legal process, its associated costs and so on.  This is why the idea is that much can be resolved through this examination process which bypasses the need for individuals to take legal actions.  Importantly, this examination goes back to the mid-2000s so it will cover pre-2006 trackers.  Anything with the tracker flavour is covered.  I ask my colleagues to give some extra analysis.</p></speech>

Pre-2006 tracker mortgages are clearly part of the examination.  The three strands to the examination concern contracts, and that is from day one; transparency, which applies to what people were told at the beginning, during the process and now; and whether there were other influencing factors.  All these elements will play a part in the assessment, but the Chairman's point concerns the manner in which the client has been treated, which to me-----</p></speech>

This is just an example of how people are being treated by a bank that is becoming more arrogant by the day, and most banks are.  I wish to put on the record that I see a significant difference between the manner in which banks previously treated their customers and the manner in which they are doing so now.  This customer I referred to says there is absolutely nothing in the promotional material they have from 2005 to suggest that a customer might lose his or her tracker.  In other words, they have investigated the matter, they have the evidence, they have presented it to the bank and they have asked the bank in a reasonable way to consider the matter and not to push them any further.  They have told the bank they are almost a beaten docket because of what it has done to them.  However, the bank refuses to deal with them.  This has been going on in this case since 2010.  The bank is destroying this person's life.  How many more lives is it destroying and what action can the Central Bank take?</p></speech>

They are the people in respect of whom we really need to be satisfied that this is true.  The lenders are making assessments, as in the case referred to by the Chairman, that perhaps the lender has no case to answer.  We have put in a framework and independent oversight to verify this.  Our role is to assure this happens, and we have employed and are employing additional resources and expertise to challenge the banks.  Ultimately, if we end up in a dispute, we will use all our supervisory and enforcement powers to deliver for the customer.</p></speech>

To say it to a customer is one thing, but it is another for the bank's representatives to say in here, to a committee of the Parliament, that it would write to and explain the matter to customers, and then not to do it.  That means the bank ignored its customers.  The customer is king and, having been in business, I know one cannot ignore customers but take on board their criticism and suggestions.  In this case the bank did not even bother.  The bank told us it would write to its customers but the person who wrote the letter I received has asked who protects the customer.  This person does not know where to turn.</p></speech>

The framework basically sets out the priorities in identifying the impact to customers, fixing the problem and communicating with the customer at that point.  In terms of progress being made in individual institutions, a number have started to contact cohorts.  I cannot comment on a particular case as to whether a person has been contacted.  They are working through their loanbooks, so maybe the person is not in a cohort that has already been contacted.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, we must keep saying phrases like "we cannot comment on individual cases" and so on because the legal framework under which we engage with individual institutions prohibits it for good reasons.  It is frustrating but we have tried, prompted by the level of interest from committee members and the testimony they have received.  In our March report we tried to put out a lot of information, including where we had to request permission from individual institutions to do so.  We live in a legal environment in which we cannot discuss certain issues in public as it would be a breach of the legal requirements under which we operate.  The committee had representatives of the individual institutions in here and that was quite effective.  They can speak about their institutions and the committee can hold them to account.  We can hold them to account on a more confidential basis.</p></speech>

There is another letter where the correspondent has been waiting for seven years.  Looking at the correspondence and what is going on, it is shocking that banks do not even reply to these people.  The answer is, of course, to bring back in the individual banks, and I am afraid it is something we will now have to do.  There is no consistency in how they reply to the committee or their customers.  I tested Bank of Ireland, writing to Mr. Boucher and asking him to examine a client's case.  One bank said it cannot speak to us about individual customers, which is fine, but that it would contact the client in question.  That is fair enough.  Bank of Ireland gave one sentence in reply and said it could not talk to us.  That is the type of attitude we are coming up against from banks.  I have said they are growing more arrogant by the day.</p><p>The person who wrote the letter to me stated that seven years have elapsed.  Earlier Deputy Burke spoke about Padraic Kissane.  On 9 March, Padraic Kissane said that the deception is continuing on such a scale that it is worse it is getting rather than better.  We listened to him here.  In terms of the cases that he outlined, the Governor can quote us the letter of the law, which is his job, and the regulators and banks will do their business.  The customers have been pushed so far from the centre of things that they do not understand the language that the bank is using against them, which is a real problem.  Nobody has spelled out to the customer in layman's language exactly what the criteria is in terms of the investigation, how long they can expect to wait or given them a complete brief on where their case is and instead customers have had to fight all of the way.  Some of the replies have been as follows:  "When you look at your mortgage we gave you the wrong set of terms and conditions due to a manual error.  Despite this error we have now decided to honour these terms and conditions."  The replies make it sound like the borrowers are the guilty ones.  They have been made to feel guilty and thankful that the bank has talked to them at all.  I am not saying so.  That message has been conveyed in the correspondence sent to everyone.</p></speech>

We have a lot of effective instruments to hold these banks to account.  It does take time because of the scale of the issue and the balance between the first priority of delivering redress and compensation for individuals and to back that up where we see violations of various codes through enforcement actions.  We are in the middle of all of this.  All I can say in response to these individual customers is that we are working on their behalf.  Thousands of customers have received redress and compensation and more cases will be resolved over time.  I hope that we can prove to be effective in helping to resolve these issues.</p></speech>

Rather than being of help the past two years, since my account was identified as part of the redress scheme, have left me drained.  The fight has all about but gone from me.  I am now at the hurdle of the independent appeals process and unsure if I have the strength left to continue which I know is exactly what the bank hopes for.  However, there is only so much a soul can take and this tracker issue affects every single aspect of your life.  The appeals process has, in a nutshell, made me feel like I am on trial.  I cannot tell you how many times I have wondered what I did wrong and why I am in this position.  I am on trial because I am guilty of wanting to own my own home.  I was robbed of my money each month while each month also repaying the bank every instalment they asked for.  I never missed a payment but I am the one who is guilty.  I am the one through this whole process who has had to repeatedly justify my position through an appeals process to the same bank that robbed me monthly.  The banks broke the Customer Act 2007 and yet it is I, the consumer, who is guilty. </blockquote> <p>That sentiment rings through every single piece of correspondence that I have received.  I would love to see the Governor, to the extent of the law and beyond, pressing these banks that have now, in my opinion, regained the same level of arrogance that they had before the crisis struck.  I ask the Governor to understand the following.</p><p>The language that is being used on this is not informing the customer but is pushing them further away.  The actions of the banks through legal processes and so forth are frightening the same customers.  The banks should be dragged to the point of remedying the situation now.  It is unforgivable that they would do this to ordinary people who did no wrong.  That is my view.  Thousands of letters have been sent to us.</p></speech>

This comprehensive approach can deliver a great deal, compared with each individual fighting these cases on their own.  I hear what the Chairman have said.

Perhaps we can do more in terms of trying to communicate what we are doing in a way that can be more easily understood by the-----</p></speech>

The first relates to Ulster Bank and, again, I do not expect you to comment on an individual bank.  The lady concerned had to use her solicitor to get the documents she was entitled to from Ulster Bank.  That is not right.  The second relates to AIB.  The person says that AIB refused to supply them with details on their various accounts and that there is a strong possibility that it illegally removed the person from the valuable tracker rates.  How do you expect people not so much to defend but to present a case if their bank is reluctant to give them the details or is dragging its heels in doing so?  It is outrageous.  Many of the citizens of this country who have pushed themselves to pay their debt every month are not able to afford it and are broken trying to do it.  I appeal to you to understand what we are facing.</p></speech>

It is a comprehensive approach whereby all accounts are being examined.  Of course, it is helpful for individuals to deal directly with their own banks, the ombudsman and us.  It is also very effective to have individuals such as Padraic Kissane and others acting as the voice for people.  All of this will help.  However, the concept of our examination is that it does not require individuals to take action.  In principle, these are comprehensive reviews.  Mr. Bernard Sheridan can probably reinforce that.</p></speech>

They have to continue to pay the inflated cost of their loan while they are waiting for the Central Bank.  It is clear from the correspondence that unless they take action, the banks will just ignore them.  It seems to me that the banks are not prepared to get to the end of this by a long shot.</p></speech>

This is the most comprehensive framework we have put in place to try to resolve these issues.  We are putting the onus on lenders to deliver this.  We have set specific timelines using our statutory powers.  However, I agree with you that there is no point in them delivering a report to us which says something while, behind it, they really have not taken it seriously and taken the approach from the consumer.  This examination will continue after the phase two reports because that involves our assurance work and our challenge to these lenders.  Ultimately, if the lenders' boards do not take responsibility for this in the way they should, that means we will take whatever action we can to ensure the consumer gets the right outcome.  I agree with you that the behaviour described from lenders to customers is not acceptable in terms of what they are putting them through.</p><p>We are working very hard to make sure that all those cases are dealt with under the examination.</p></speech>

When one looks at this, and when one examines the correspondence that we have all received, and there is a huge amount of it, it is clear that the bank took action to take money from their customers illegally.  Now they are going to redress it.  They are now robbing the rights of the customer to proper redress and proper compensation by dragging their heels and ignoring them.  That comes across in every single piece of correspondence I have read through over recent months.</p> <p>  I say again that it is outrageous the banks are seemingly getting away with this.  In some cases they will get away with it because they have broken the customer in the process.  That is the outrage that jumps off the page, as it were, in the context of this correspondence.  Some of these people dealt with the banks for 20 and 30 years, and now they are being treated like this.  If the banks were really honest about it and wanted to resolve this, we would not be having these committee meetings.  They would be out in the regions, meeting their customers, calling them in and offering them a course of action.  We are going to have to call in the banks again now to go through all the details with them because they are simply not telling the truth about their engagement with the different affected customers.</p> <p>  I accept the job the Central Bank is doing, but there is something not right here and there is a relationship issue between the banks and their customers.  To go back to Ms Rowland, civil law, and the rights of customers under that law, is just being ignored.  The banks are just ignoring it.</p></speech>

That is what I am saying.  Even in the case where someone is so beaten down by a difficult case that they withdraw from the process, that does not influence what we are doing.  If those cases come up, they will be receiving the redress and compensation.  There will be assistance for people, by and large, if they want to launch an appeal.  There is no threat of loss of the redress and compensation.  There will be support for people who want to bring appeals.</p> <p>  I accept the Chairman's basic point that at this stage, after so long a time, many people are discouraged and have been distressed by all of this.  It goes back to the same point the Chairman has also made about the culture of banks and so on.  We have this consumer framework which basically says that there are different ways to protect consumers, but in the end it is essential we have companies that accept, and whose boards and senior management accept, that they should be consumer focused in how they do business.</p></speech>

Each of the schemes are being designed by the individual lenders.  They then have to come to us where we challenge them on their approach.  Ultimately, the payment and decisions regarding the payment are matters for the board of each institutions.</p></speech>

Many people approach us with issues concerning trackers.  One feature that stands out is the differential between the fixed rate and the variable rate and, more particularly, the significant differential between the fixed rate and the tracker rate.</p><p>It is quite significant.  I know of cases in which people did not even remember signing documentation to switch to a fixed rate.  The fixed rate could have been 4% or 4.9% and the tracker rate, 0.81%.  The differentials are extraordinary and make an enormous difference.  I know of a case in which a family bought a house and over ten years were switched to and from a fixed rate mortgage about three or four times.  They would have had to sign various documents, but they have no recollection of signing them.  May we have some indication as to when the banks will have to come back.  Is the kind of thing featured in the example I have given on the Central Bank's radar?</p></speech>

The key is identifying those who have been impacted on and fixing the rate.  That is happening.  Communication will take place with customers to settle what will happen after that, including the paying of redress and compensation, the next steps in the process.</p></speech>
