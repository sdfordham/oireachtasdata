    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-26a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip Sheridan" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014022600004#E00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting City &amp;amp; Guilds to make a presentation.  We very much welcome the opportunity offer our views.  I am Philip Sheridan, commercial manager for City &amp;amp; Guilds in Ireland, and with me is Ms Jennifer Warner, executive manager of our marketing department.</p><p>  City &amp;amp; Guilds is a leading global awarding organisation for competency-based, industry-relevant and internationally recognised qualifications.  We currently offer over 500 qualification portfolios, ranging from levels 1 to 9 on the Irish national framework.  Our qualifications are developed in partnership with industry experts and span over 28 sectors.  City &amp;amp; Guilds has a long tradition in Ireland and its first formal engagement here was with the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction in 1901.</p><p>  Our mission is to enable individuals to develop the work-based skills and competencies that will enhance their employability opportunities.  We pioneer the most up-to-date delivery and assessment methods and seek to improve vocational education through forging partnerships that deliver the skills and training required to develop the kind of workforce that is needed in the current environment of economic difficulty.  City &amp;amp; Guilds is a registered charity and, therefore, any surpluses are reinvested in order to develop the qualifications and resources required in a rapidly changing workplaces.  We have over 150 approved centres in Ireland - supported by a dedicated team in Dublin - and each year over 15,000 Irish learners are awarded City &amp;amp; Guilds certification.  In 2011, the Ireland office took full responsibility for City &amp;amp; Guilds' European operations.  In operating globally, we respect and fully support national systems.  Since 2008, over 2,000 thousand qualifications were formally aligned with the national framework of qualifications.  This alignment provides formal national recognition so that each City &amp;amp; Guilds qualification fits into the national framework and provides a clear progression route for our learners.</p><p>  Community education and vocational education have an important role to play and immense potential to provide support in respect of the persisting challenges we face in our economy.  There is a growing interest in vocational education and training around the world as a means to smooth over the education-to-work transitions which all economies must confront.  Ireland faces many challenges and I would like to share with the committee some research findings and recommendations that are based on City &amp;amp; Guilds' review paper on the Irish apprenticeship system and also our findings on young people's vocational choices in Ireland.</p><p>  A survey conducted by the European Commission in 2011 found that three quarters of people in Ireland thought vocational education has a positive image in the country.  However, only 10% said they would recommend vocational education to a person who is finishing compulsory schooling.  This prompted City &amp;amp; Guilds to investigate these perceptions further and, as a result, it commissioned a survey of 508 young people between the ages of 15 and 19.  Our findings raise concerns about the perceptions and understanding of vocational education among young people in Ireland.  The popularity of university and the influence of parents suggest that young people are encouraged to aspire to attending university, with only limited information about other options being available, including studying alongside working.  Our research also suggests that it is common for young people to lack awareness and understanding of vocational education.  Fewer than half of those surveyed correctly described what constitutes vocational education.  The survey also shows that most aspire to take an academic route.  Only 6% of those surveyed were planning to pursue a vocational qualification when their current courses were complete.  Of those planning to pursue an academic qualification, more than half had never even considered a vocational option.</p><p>  We would like to offer some recommendations to the committee on the basis of young people's responses to our research study.  We are of the view that: more information should be available to young people in school to help them judge whether vocational education can support their career choices; information, advice and guidance should be offered in school at an earlier age, ideally at 13; information, advice and guidance should provide young people with real-life examples of individuals in a wide range of careers and trades; and, in view of the fact that young people seek information, advice and guidance through school and college websites, online material should be as accessible as possible.</p><p>  In Europe, vocational and general education form part of the package and apprenticeship is treated as part of vocational education, usually at upper secondary level.  Researchers from other branches of social science have identified models of apprenticeship that embrace formal and informal learning within structured on and off-the-job training provided by employers.  Industry experts suggest that companies require that employees: have the ability to learn new skills and adapt to changing circumstances; can conceptualise the contribution of their role to organisational effectiveness; can work in flatter structures and without supervision; can manage the interface between customers and the organisation; and possess capabilities such as problem-solving, creative thinking and innovativeness.  All these requirements put considerable responsibility on the education system and government organisations to ensure that people are equipped to meet these demands.</p><p>  Our review of the current apprenticeship model in Ireland clearly shows that it forms a very strong basis for the future development of vocational education in Ireland.  The current model is much more likely to remain appropriate if it is developed in line with a number of the following recommendations: build on the strengths of the model; extend apprenticeship to new sectors; vary the duration of training in line with skill levels; enhance governance and quality assurance; improve curriculum development and assessment; enhance the profile and attractiveness of vocational education and training, VET; set up a dedicated VET data collection body to inform policy makers; and establish a new mechanism to balance trainee numbers with demand.  City &amp;amp; Guilds remains committed to supporting the development of the apprentice system in Ireland and to working with policy makers and stakeholders in the near future.</p><p>  In this short presentation we have only scratched the surface of the relevant topics.  We have made all the necessary and detailed information available to the committee through the secretariat.  We fully support the committee and the key stakeholders in delivering a world-class vocational educational model which will meet the needs of the learner and the employer and which will ensure that learners have access to lifelong learning.  The importance of the role of community education and vocational education to economic growth cannot be overstated.  In the longer term, Ireland needs a more managed approach to the structural changes taking place in the labour market.  Ireland would benefit from a self-sustaining skills ecosystem that puts plans and programmes in place to address skills gaps.  Doing so will require overcoming some significant hurdles such as those relating to the value of vocational education, its attractiveness, lack of information relating to vocational educational skills needs and limited collaboration between key stakeholders.</p></speech>

First, adult guidance is very important.  With the employment control framework in place, the number of guidance counsellors, as I am sure the members have heard previously, have been greatly reduced.  It is very important for people who are disadvantaged and marginalised to have their need in this area met.  The second significant challenge, as has been also highlighted by NESC, is that provision must become more flexible and there is a need to move away from the traditional academic-year approach and provide more flexible delivery, which is very important.  The education and training boards network of vocational schools and colleges has been the backbone of provision since the 1930s but we need to provide all-year-round provision, as the members will note from the document I have issued, and not provision where schools would be closed for June July and August.   All-year-round provision to meet the needs of clients is important.</p><p>  I will conclude on that point in deference to the Chairman's request-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-26a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Berni Brady" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014022600005#F00700"><p>AONTAS welcomes this opportunity to present to the committee.  I come from a different perspective because AONTAS is not a provider-organisation.  We are the national adult learning organisation that advocates for adult education and promotes adult education and we have also been a champion of community education from the 1980s right through until now.</p><p>  In this short presentation I want to focus on what community education has done, how we understand community education, who takes part in it, what are its outcomes and some of the challenges it might face in the context of the changes that are taking place.  AONTAS has a community education network which comprises approximately 140 groups of people involved in the provision of community education and they are independently managed groups.  The focus of my presentation is on those rather than on the statutory groups.   </p><p>  Community education is delivered in both the statutory and non-statutory sector.  Within the statutory sector it is delivered through the education and training boards and is co-ordinated by local community education facilitators.  Within the non-statutory sector it is delivered by a number of independently managed not-for-profit providers who receive financial support from a number of sources, including Government Departments, charities and various other sources.  Currently approximately 58,000 learners participated in the education and training board-funded community education programmes but we reckon that a further 30,000 learners also participate in programmes funded by the independently managed groups.</p><p>  Community education is effective because the range of supports available to learners through community education supports the capacity of people to progress through the qualifications framework on to further education.  It includes being located in the communities where people are based; having skilled outreach staff to connect with "hard to reach" potential learners; focusing on the whole person and their circumstances - economic, social, cultural and emotional; providing supports such as child care, mentoring, study supports, guidance counselling, literacy, number and IT supports; and providing follow-up support after formal courses are completed.  </p><p>  Community education attracts people who are the most distant from education, training and the labour market.  They include early school learners, lone parents, long-term unemployed, ethnic minorities and people experiencing physical and mental illness, addiction and other kinds of problems.  They would normally be people who would find it difficult to come back into an institutionalised setting or into a school setting.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-26a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Padraig Walsh" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014022600006#G00300"><p>On behalf of myself and my colleagues from Quality and Qualifications Ireland I thank the committee for the opportunity to talk here today about the role and potential of community and vocational education.  As members will recall, QQI representatives attended this committee last week to discuss the application of what was recently referred to as the fees to community and voluntary providers.  As members will be aware from that presentation, QQI is an amalgamated entity which in November 2012 replaced the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, NQAI, and the Irish Universities Quality Board, IUQB.</p><p>  In the context of the brief comments I will make, it is important to note that in addition to being an awarding body and a quality assurance body, QQI is responsible for maintaining the national framework of qualifications, NFQ, and has statutory responsibility for ensuring that providers of education and training make learners aware of how they may access education and training, transfer from one part of the education system to another, and how the qualifications they obtain allow them to progressively move through the different levels of the NFQ if they so desire.</p><p>  In respect of its relationship with community and vocational education providers, QQI is an awarding body and an external quality assurance body operating under the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Act 2012.  Working within this legislation and the emphasis it places on the capacity of providers to deliver programmes, QQI envisages an evolving quality assurance relationship with providers of community education and vocational education and training.  QQI will therefore be placing much more emphasis on the internal and external quality assurance of providers including how they design, deliver and assess programmes that lead to our awards and, in turn, to their inclusion in the NFQ.  In the context of the recent establishment of the education and training boards, the introduction of SOLAS and the development of a further education and training strategy, we believe this will be a very important parallel development.  It is also fundamentally in the interests of learners.</p><p>  Following on from our meeting with the joint committee last week, QQI is looking forward to meeting with Aontas and with the ICTU community sector committee to discuss the impact these developments may have on the approximately 150 providers QQI currently engages with from the community and voluntary sector.  While we have engaged with Aontas in the past, it is now imperative that we work closely with the community representative organisations to explore how the sector can constructively and positively respond to evolving quality assurance standards.</p><p>  A potential reconfiguration of the sector with a reduction in the number of providers with a direct relationship to QQI and an increase in provider networks or consortia linked to lead providers presents challenges for the sector and for QQI.  However, it also provides the opportunity for a strengthened sector able to more proportionately allocate its collective resources between providers, provision of education for learners and the maintenance of the quality assurance systems required to underpin this provision.  We believe this is an exciting development.</p><p>  Vocational education and training, with its inherent emphasis on access to employment, is going through an equally interesting transition.  In Ireland, vocational education and training is largely associated with the poorly understood label of further education and training.  In reality, vocational education and training is happening at all levels on the NFQ, and members have heard about that already.  Specifically in this area we are engaging with Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI, and with individual education and training boards, to provide practical support in the management of quality assurance agreements, which need to be updated in the light of the aforementioned amalgamations and in the context of what were F&Aacute;S training centres now becoming incorporated into education and training boards, ETBs.  Our hope and intention is to then work with the ETBs as a whole as they will need to engage as a sector with new quality assurance standards developed by QQI.  As in the case of our work with the community and voluntary sector and with higher and education and training providers, our intention is to encourage the sector to collaborate and to share practice in all areas of their work thus focusing on quality assurance but also, importantly, on quality improvement.</p><p>  While I have particularly referenced public bodies and publicly funded parties, it is important to stress that private providers operate in the area of vocational education and training, and both public and private providers work with awarding bodies other than QQI.  The 2012 Act values these relationships while stipulating that they must lead to the inclusion of awards in the NFQ.  A significant number of the awards of certain United Kingdom awarding bodies were aligned with the NFQ under previous policy developed by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland.</p></speech>

As the last speaker, I realise I am the one who is keeping members from their discussion and debate and consequently, I will try to be as brief as possible in going through our paper, which I understand will be published.  An tSeirbh&iacute;s Oideachais Lean&uacute;naigh agus Scileanna probably is one of the youngest organisations in the State and is four months old this week.  We were established under the Further Education and Training Act 2013, which gives the organisation a significant range of functions and powers to make a real contribution to the advancement of further education and training.  The heart of the Act is about so doing, with obviously a purpose to improve learners' experience and I will revert to that point.</p><p>  SOLAS has been very busy in the past four months.  Among the key things we are obliged to do is to deliver to the Minister for Education and Skills a set of proposals, or roadmap if one likes, for the future of further education and training and we will do this by the end of March.  We realise that of itself, SOLAS is only one actor in this hugely diverse and fascinating sector and consequently, will deliver a corporate plan regarding how we will play our part.  For the first time, we will pull together the further education and training elements and will publish a services plan outlining what will happen this year.  We have a very big job to do as we transfer to Mr. Michael Moriarty and his colleagues all the former F&Aacute;S training centres.  Seven, and not six as stated in the report, already have moved.  However, this is not about just moving centres as more than 400 staff have moved, as have all the resources and most importantly, the thousands of learners who are associated with the facilities.  This has happened and the balance will transfer on 1 July.</p><p>  SOLAS is deep in the process of developing the further education and training strategy.  We have had a wide range of research consultation and that phase is over.  We are in the process of drafting the strategy and will consult widely as we bring it to fruition.  While much information and many themes are emerging, two main points have emerged that must be addressed.  The first is to seize the opportunity to re-engineer the sector.  It has grown up over many decades and a huge amount of fascinating and excellent work has happened and is occurring.  However, we must plan, co-ordinate and manage it for the future and SOLAS intends to address this in the strategy.  There also are immediate imperatives, as a programme for long-term unemployed people, for young unemployed people and the outworkings of the apprenticeship review must be all addressed in the short term.  SOLAS will seek to do both.</p><p>  We have given the joint committee a summary of existing provision that will continue.  The main point I wish to make in this regard concerns business continuity.  While we are doing all the redesigning and re-engineering, we must keep the show on the road and must ensure that current learners are getting the opportunities while all these changes are emerging.  We have drawn up a summary of what we perceive to be the main benefits of both vocational and community education.  It is about benefits in respect of higher wages, better employment prospects and the ability to retain a job.  Such education contributes to employability, has an important role in providing skilled labour to meet replacement demand.  It supports those in employment to improve their position when competing for work, helps job creation and productivity growth, supports labour market participants in coping with changes - we have been obliged to do a lot of that in recent years - and facilitates progression to higher education.</p><p>  Community education, as Ms Bernie Brady has eloquently outlined, has a massive role to play.  If I may digress slightly, this was brought home to me earlier this week when I had the opportunity to attend the Star awards, which are operated by Aontas and in which 260 contributors, volunteers, providers and learners came together to celebrate what community education can deliver.  It was uplifting and humbling to be present and to participate in that process.  The final point I would make is quite simple, namely, how will one judge success in this regard in five years' time?  It simply will be about whether we could meet the challenges and could deliver demonstrably improved experiences and outcomes for learners who participate in further education and training.</p></speech>

I wish to put several questions to various organisations in attendance and will start with the representatives from City &amp;amp; Guilds.  In his presentation, Mr. Sheridan outlined that City &amp;amp; Guilds would like to have more information presented to young people, particularly from the age of 13.  He might elaborate on that point a little further as to what precisely must happen there.  In addition, he mentioned there are many strengths in the current apprenticeship model.  He should elaborate on his thoughts in this regard.  What does Mr. Sheridan perceive to be the strengths and what does he perceive to be a particular weak point that requires further development?  As for Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI, a number of training centres have been taken over from F&Aacute;S.  Mr. Moriarty should elaborate on how that is working.  I also ask Dr. Walsh to comment on the next question.  In respect of the collaboration the ETBs have had thus far with SOLAS, how much duplication has been encountered in the programmes that had been organised by the former VECs and in what F&Aacute;S had been doing heretofore?  Has much duplication been identified and what is happening to try to pull them together and to ensure streamlining?  Mr. Moriarty also focused on the need to align employer needs and the vocational education and training sector.  What has been the practice up to now in trying to pinpoint and give direction in this regard?  In respect of both the former VEC and now the ETB sector, as well as with the F&Aacute;S sector, what has been the practice and how has it worked heretofore?</p><p>  As for Aontas, Ms Brady mentioned the difficulty regarding the number of funders with which the community sector must engage and how frequently, no organisation takes an overview as to how it all blends together to ensure it is strong overall or how one part of funding can have an impact on the various organisations that carry it out.  How would Ms Brady like to see this changing?  On Aontas's engagement with SOLAS, what role does she expect to develop between Aontas and SOLAS over time?</p><p>  I thank Dr. Walsh for his contribution on behalf of QQI.  I acknowledge he sent his apologies in respect of last week's meeting and while he would have liked to have been present, he had other engagements at the time.  If he gets an opportunity to do so today, he should comment on the impact of the existing fees in the community sector, as it is a matter the joint committee discussed last week.  I already have mentioned a couple of issues in respect of SOLAS.  There obviously is a significant job of work to be done and SOLAS is planning to produce a plan for the next five years.  Mr. O'Toole should provide members with an idea as to how he envisages matters rolling out over the next five years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-26a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/984" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014022600008#J00200"><p>I also welcome today's guests.  I have a small number of questions.</p><p>  In his conclusion of the City and Guilds presentation, Mr. Sheridan spoke of how the limited collaboration between stakeholders was impeding matters.  Perhaps he could expand on that.</p><p>  The area that I wanted to touch on was SOLAS and its five-year strategy, which is being developed and will be published at the end of March.  There is a significant challenge, particularly when it comes to the provision of community education.  One of the tasks that Mr. O'Toole will oversee is the development of new programmes to ensure not only value for money in the provision of programmes but also social inclusion.  It is a balancing act.  If one looks at the role of community education, often it targets the most disadvantaged in society and the local community.  In talking about getting those who are most disadvantaged, many of whom may have been out of the system for a considerable period, back into education, those participants will need additional supports.  As Ms Brady pointed out, one must go at the pace of the learner.  That would be different from some of the programmes provided through the further education and training, FET, sector, which are time-intensive.  There is a balancing act and I wonder how that will be achieved.  Maybe Ms Brady could comment on it as well.</p><p>  From the meetings last week and this week, there seems to be an opinion gathering - Mr. O'Toole mentioned it in his presentation, as did QQI - on the possibility of providers networking to achieve better outcomes in terms of both education and value for money.  I wonder whether Ms Brady could comment on that, as somebody who represents adult learners and who is the voice of advocates of adult learners.  I am not saying it is a bad idea; certainly, there is merit in it.  It is something that individual providers should be looking at.  I merely wonder whether she could comment on it.</p></speech>

It is interesting to hear from all the groups that are involved in the community sector looking at the changes that have occurred over the past five years.</p><p>  My question is a follow-up on the SOLAS plan.  How does that plan work?  Do employers or potential employers in technology and all the different areas come to SOLAS stating what they envisage over the next period of time if they get funding from the banks to set up their businesses?  How does SOLAS generate a plan for providing people with skills for the future?</p><p>  The other area is apprenticeships.  Many made the point that people should be given the opportunity to get themselves educated at community level.</p><p>  I want to ask a question of those who know the business.  I came across a lone parent who wanted to take up carer's training in a private school for &euro;1,900 and who was getting no support from anywhere to take up that course.  What provision is being made for those trying to get into education?  That was a private course but it was not offered anywhere else.</p><p>  Another issue is the recent decision to charge apprentices for their training as part of their work process.  I do not know where it came from.  Is that cutting off opportunities or putting up barriers for young people and the middle aged?  We are not only talking about young workers any more.  How should the matter be dealt with?  What supports should be given to workers?  They are not students and cannot get student grants.  They are being told they must pay fees that they can ill afford.  Should SOLAS continue paying those fees, as F&Aacute;S had done since 2004?  That is an important area.  We want to get more people into the workplace and part of that involves training, and then these apprentices, who are on the minimum wage, are being told they have to pay for that without any supports.  That will be a significant barrier.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-26a.36" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul O'Toole" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014022600008#J00800"><p>First, Deputy McConalogue asked about potential duplication in F&Aacute;S and the VECs, how we would deal with that and what we are finding.  He touched on employers and where this strategy is going in dealing with that.  I hope I have captured that correctly.</p><p>  There is quite a lot of provision.  If one takes everything together, approximately 250,000 citizens access further education and training to some degree.  That is a combination of full-time and part-time programmes across a wide range of provision.  It has grown up organically.  It responded locally, depending on accidents of history, location of facilities or whatever.  The challenge to eliminate wasteful duplication where that exists is to get a fix on what is there, and that is difficult.  Our first task is to develop what we are calling a services plan for 2014.  All of Mr. Moriarty's members, various voluntary groups and the old F&Aacute;S network are submitting their plans for 2014 and that will give us for the first time a line of sight on everything that is out there.  It is a start.  Of itself it will not fix matters, but we will have a complete picture and will use that as a building block for the future.</p><p>  On how employer engagement works, it operates in a variety of ways.  Obviously, the Department of Social Protection has a employer engagement programme and that is of relevance to us because they are at the front line dealing with the unemployed.  Over time, employers engage.  They contribute to the development of standards, with Dr. Walsh and his organisation.  F&Aacute;S would have a long-standing tradition of engagement with employers, particularly those that are committed to the apprenticeship model.  Obviously, there is an opportunity to expand that and to improve that level of engagement in the future because the way forward is for employers to contribute to specifying the skills that are required for the jobs that they can provide.  It is uneven at present and we will seek to improve that in the future.</p><p>  In terms of the building blocks of the strategy, there is the immediate imperative to respond to the horror of long-term unemployment, the challenge of youth unemployment and a variety of other immediate issues.  We need to tackle those and ensure business continuity.  However, we will set milestones for the progressive re-engineering of the sector over five years and we will publish those in line with our strategy.</p><p>  Deputy O'Brien also touched on the five-year strategy.  He asked about the place of community education in this.  We would be acutely conscious of an anxiety in the sector as to whether, with all of this change, we will wipe out tried and tested programmes.  In that regard I would make a number of points.  We want to walk before we can run.  We know what is out there.  One of the challenges, because of the diversity of provision, is being able to properly evaluate, monitor and demonstrate the strengths of that diversity.  When one looks at it from the point of view of investment, sometimes it is difficult to see the returns that are being made.  We need to build a base of information that is objective and measurable and will inform better decision-making, whether it is for the community side, the labour market element or whatever.</p><p>  Deputy O'Brien made an important point about social inclusion as a driver and, perhaps, more economically driven labour market programmes.  Sometimes these are seen as two separate matters.  Most who have looked at this a little closer, and many who are more expert than I, would say it is a continuum.  The purpose of any programme, even if its primary driver is social inclusion, is ultimately to help learners progress and improve employability.  These are not polarised concepts, but perhaps the linkages and the progression for somebody who is at extreme disadvantage, and how that route is managed into a better life for that person, needs to be better defined, and, hopefully, we will collaborate to do that.  Maybe that would deal a little better with Deputy O'Brien's point about recognising the pace of learning.  We would say it is not a case of one size fits all, and we should not seek for it to be so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-26a.38" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Moriarty" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014022600009#K00200"><p>I will not repeat anything Mr. Paul O'Toole has said.  Reference was made to collaboration.  This has been epitomised by the successful transfer of the training centres thus far.  We have had extensive collaboration with F&Aacute;S, Mr. O'Toole and his staff, and my chief executive officers from the ETBs.  We have had a seamless transfer so far of the first tranche of training centres.</p><p>  On the issue of duplication, we come from different backgrounds.  We are coming from the VEC background, which is very much focused on the post-leaving certificate courses.  The ETBs will be charged with almost all State delivery of education and training.  It is at the delivery stage that we must prove ourselves as ETBs.  We will have service level agreements signed with F&Aacute;S.  Set out will be the targets to be met, the programmes to be delivered and the funding associated with those programmes.  That will be evaluated afterwards.  In line with Government priorities or priorities set by the State in its planning process, we are trying to meet the objectives set at local level through the ETBs.  At present, up to 80% of the training in the training centres is contracted.</p><p>  Let me return to the issue of alignment with employers.  The system has been out of sync with the European norm for many years.  I have said before that when AnCO was set up in the 1960s, the State was quite socialist in that it started making provision, first with AnCO and then through F&Aacute;S, for apprenticeship and training.  ETBs, as providers, have challenges but employers must be challenged to engage actively with us and SOLAS in devising programmes and ensuring providers are answering the needs of industry.</p><p>  Mr. O'Toole talked about SOLAS and national engagement with employers.  However, there is now a fantastic opportunity for local ETBs to meet the needs of local employers.  Some days ago I attended the conference of the Irish Hotels Federation, at which Mr. O'Toole spoke.  We had a number of meetings with the federation with a view to meeting their needs for commis chefs, breakfast chefs, waiters and front of house staff.  One will have read in the newspapers today that there is a shortage of qualified front of house staff.  This is where ETBs can operate locally, as we have been doing for years.  It is a case of making it part of a strategy to ensure we are meeting the needs of employers.  Those needs change and evolve, and the education and training system might not evolve as fast.  This is important to acknowledge and I believe Deputy O'Brien did so.</p><p>  Deputy O'Brien mentioned community education.  I want to be certain that, with the amalgamation of ETBs into larger entities with the transfer of F&Aacute;S, we do not lose touch with the local communities.  This is why we have always emphasised at ETB level the importance of community education.  The hallmark of the VECs since the 1930s was a focus on the marginalised.  This must remain part of the philosophy and must not be totally swamped by the requirement to meet the skills needs of jobseekers and other learners.  This is important.</p><p>  I mentioned earlier that education and training boards, schools and centres of education exist to serve their communities, jobseekers and those who require re-skilling.  The challenge for us and teachers in schools that have post-leaving certificate courses is to examine how we can be more flexible and meet the needs of the clients all year round.  It was said about VEC schools in the 1930s that they were the schools with the lights on at night.  We need the lights on not only at night but during the entire year.  This engagement with employers will be the engine and it will be critical to the future development of the sector.  Thus, we as providers will be meeting the real needs of local employers.</p></speech>

Funding and other supports must be based on recognition of the role of community education and the work done through it and an understanding of the various kinds of community education supported under the ETB system and also the work supported by the independently managed groups.  It is no surprise that the research we did on community education two years ago was called Community Education: More than just a Course.  The title was devised by a person who took part in community education and said it was not just about a course but about a whole development process for people.</p><p>  There are two aspects to funding.  AONTAS has put forward a funding model that it developed in collaboration with our community education networks for the independently managed groups.  A diagram of the model is contained in the presentation submitted to the committee.  We did this some years ago but it needs to be updated because it was done before we ever heard of SOLAS, for example.  There are some key elements that are still core to the exercise.  One is that the funding should cover the true cost of community education, which means a whole organisation approach rather than bits and pieces that can be put in here and there with the result that when funding finishes there is no support when somebody loses his job.  Another key aspect should be multi-annual funding.  It is impossible to plan ahead on any sort of long-term, year-to-year basis.  The funding model would account for both vocational and non-vocational learning.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-26a.43" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1170" speakername="Marie Louise O'Donnell" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014022600010#L00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  It is as if all these stakeholders are starting a new department of education.  I enjoyed Mr. Sheridan's excellent, relevant study which locked right into the chief inspector's report.  One of the most negative findings of the latter report was exactly what all these young people are saying in the summary about a lack of information about apprenticeships.  In addition, they wanted more emphasis being applied at a younger age, understanding their careers properly and getting advice from experienced people.  The chief inspector mentioned this as being a negative aspect in his own report on second level schooling.</p><p>  I wish to ask a question of all the witnesses from City and Guilds, Aontas, ETBI, SOLAS and the bridge on the River Kwai, the QQI.  I say that because it reminds me exactly who they are and because it was a great bridge.  What is their big creative, practical or imaginative plan to challenge and counteract the caste system which has arisen between academic education, mar dhea, and vocational education?  That is at the heart of what the witnesses are doing.  I know the smaller aspects of it, but what is the big plan?  I am appalled by the idea that we would think a caste system has developed between academic education, whatever that is, and vocational education.</p><p>  I worked in a university up in Ballymun for 25 years, which challenged that in many ways.  It did not come in with an academic plan, but with a plan for a flexible way that involved everyone in education.</p><p>  Where are the representatives' associations in the development of these great apprenticeships?  Germany has 384, England has 170, but we have 25 which are in constructions which are falling apart.  We have developed other ones but what is their current status?  It is all about lifelong development, so where are the groups represented here today in that development?</p><p>  What is the witnesses' plan about challenging and counteracting this massive caste system, which is going nowhere?  The Smurfit graduate business school in Blackrock, County Dublin, depends absolutely on the vocational aspect of its great masters.  It is completely dependent on sending its students all over the world for experience when they come in with their great academic businesses.  That is a major challenge, so I would like to hear what the plan is in that regard.</p></speech>

Their presentations contained a wealth of information.  I wish to ask about the learning outcomes and the need for more knowledge for younger people.  One of the suggestions was to bring it in for 13 year olds, so do the witnesses envisage that being so from first year in education?  What would be the effect of bringing it in prior to secondary education?  I am not too sure of the effects of that.  Are we labelling people too young?</p><p>  I taught in a vocational school for 16 years so I know the value of that type of education.  I certainly cut my teeth teaching in the adult education sector, which was brilliant.  I could not praise them enough because I sampled all different kinds of education, which was the best way to get experience in the teaching profession.</p></speech>

It has been great to have everybody together in one meeting.  I have always felt that we undervalue vocational and community education and I was encouraged by Mr. O'Toole's comments on how that is all being brought together now to put a structure and strategy in place.  It is a hugely important area.  Ms Brady's point on the need to value education was well made.  While it is important to focus on the economy, we must ensure we have the right courses to give people the skills for the jobs that are actually there and help people get out to work.  The personal development aspect is also huge.  One of the providers I was most impressed with in my area was Laneview, which works with people who have been in prison with drug problems and may never get into formal employment.  It is great to see the journey those people have gone through, most of them having dropped out of education at age 12, to get accreditation.  There is great joy in the room for themselves and their families when they are presented with their certificates.  That is what should be recognised rather than just formal metrics.  It is important to remember that education involves the whole spectrum from those who have had very little interaction and left school early with few skills right up to PhDs.  We should not lose things in the middle.  Those early leavers need the opportunity of motivation and personal development.  I am encouraged by the fact that there have been developments in bringing it all together.</p><p>  One of the other providers in my area provides for thousands of people every year on FETAC, SOLAS and Safe Pass courses.  I asked them yesterday what was the one thing they wanted.  All they ask is that bodies like SOLAS, ETBI, QQI and City and Guilds recognise that professional resources exist in the wider community, understand what is going on at ground level and consult providers.  Great work is being done by different community groups which have been built up over the years and have huge experience in disadvantaged areas in particular.  For a long time, all they have been asking for is to be considered, listened to and planned for, and, hopefully, we are finally starting to see that structure.</p><p>  Many of the questions have been asked.  Witnesses will come back to the questions Deputy Charlie McConalogue asked on how we are advertising this sector.  Are people going into schools and telling them about apprenticeships and breaking down those difficulties of understanding about what is vocational education?  Is the right provision there now?  I accept what Mr. O'Toole says about working with the Intreo centres to ensure they are aware of provision.  I had a young man on to me recently who was able to show me a letter he received.  He had gone for a job with a construction company, which had sent him back a letter saying that while they were very impressed with his interview and he was suitable for the position, he needed one thing first.  All he needed was a three day traffic management course.  He went to the social welfare office to tell them and he went to the F&Aacute;S office and was told he could not be offered the course.  I was stunned because it is a three day course.  I do not know if that is just a localised issue involving the person he was dealing with or whether there is a structure being put in place to ensure we are matching people properly with courses like that.  It is particularly about small, simple things.  He could be on the dole for three more months because he was not sent for a course for three days.  Is the system starting to come together to ensure those issues do not occur?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-26a.47" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014022600011#M00300"><p>Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell referred to what she described as a "caste system".  In the second level from first year to sixth year, those going down a vocational or apprenticeship path are often seen as failing.  It is often seen that someone has not been able to follow the academic system that is in place from first to sixth year.  It is often considered that once one chooses to go down that path, it is because one did not fit and it is a second choice.  I do not see it being provided as an option earlier on or considered as the best way to use some people's talents, because that is what they are talented in.  Our system is not geared up in a way that actually develops those people, embraces them from an early age and shows them that this is a path that one goes down.  People also need to develop other skills which may not be their strength but that is part of delivering them down a pathway that will see them develop their natural talents and contribute well as a citizen afterwards.  That is a big gap.  People often come too late in life to apprenticeships or do so half-heartedly with the feeling that they did not match the system's view of what they should have been able to do.</p><p>  If people have comments on that in particular, I would like to hear it.  Do they feel there is a need in SOLAS, QQI, etc. to engage from a young age?  It is done better in other European countries.  Do we need to change our second level system to provide guidance and respect for that pathway?  Can witnesses comment on the career guidance aspect?  I referred earlier to a cultural and structural change.  Guidance counselling also plays an important role.  There has been a significant reduction in the number of career guidance hours in secondary schools in the last couple of years.</p></speech>

Many of us have experienced it.  Often where someone is told to do a course, he or she is not really engaged with to see if the course matches or develops particular skills and attributes he or she has to give them a great deal of potential.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-26a.50" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip Sheridan" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014022600011#M00600"><p>This is a perfect time to answer some of the questions.  Some of them are interconnected.  I want to talk about the branding of vocational education training.  There is a fear we must focus on, and streaming from that is its attractiveness and value.  I referred in my presentation to the European Commission talking to people in Ireland about how it is valued.  While a high percentage of people agreed, only 10% said they would recommend it.  Members said that parents are the most influential people in terms of what young people will do in future and that is absolutely right.  The second most important people are career guidance staff within schools as well as teachers.  Research shows that we need to engage with young people earlier at approximately 13 years of age and in secondary school.</p> <p>Research tells us that is what children want, as they are much more informed these days.  We could umbrella that approach as going downstream into the problem, going to the root cause of some of the issues, particularly on the branding side and what further education can do for people.  It is matching people with careers and professions at the earliest opportunity, not at the upper stream when it is almost too late for them to make decisions.  I personally experienced this when I was teaching at third level, apprenticeship level and post leaving certificate level.  Sometimes one would encounter this mismatch where young people ended up in the wrong place doing the wrong thing, which is very inefficient for the State.</p><p> We have a very strong apprenticeship model.  It has its strengths but also its weaknesses.  One of its main strengths is its duality where it combines workplace learning with further education.  It is competency-based training which is the best way to learn skills and knowledge.  The supports built into the institutes of technology, SOLAS, An tSeirbh&iacute;s Oideachais Lean&uacute;naigh agus Scileanna, and ETBI, Education and Training Boards Ireland, as well as investments in particular industries have been significant.</p><p> Some of the weaknesses relate to extending into new sectors and the duration of apprenticeships.  It must be remembered one size does not fit all.  For example, an aircraft technician and a plasterer are on completely different ends of the scale but the apprenticeships for them last the same time.  If some of them were speeded up, costs would be reduced and the delivery would be speeded up for employers.</p><p> Collaboration between QQI, Quality and Qualifications Ireland, SOLAS and ETBI is very strong.  It has improved dramatically over the past several years.  We engage at regular intervals with the teams represented here today.  Collaboration on the employer side, however, needs to be improved and become stronger, a point referred to earlier by several speakers.  If that is achieved, it will have the end result of getting people into employment after training and developing qualifications.  City &amp;amp; Guilds believes we can support such development.  We have been in existence for over 130 years and have been involved in qualification development in the UK for some time.  Rather than recreating the wheel, we believe we can use particular qualifications from the UK and transfer them here, adjust them to local needs and deploy them.  This will bring efficiency and speed.  We operate in 81 countries and would like to offer our experience in other markets to Ireland&rsquo;s.  We have over 12,000 qualifications on our system which goes from higher levels right down to entry level which is not on any framework, making it ideal for community practice implications.</p><p> Our plan is to support the Irish mechanism in the best way we can, bringing our experience and efficiencies to the table and participate as a provider in the system.  Early intervention is important, as I said earlier.</p></speech>

We work solely with the Prison Service developing qualifications for many areas.  One size does not fit all and one has to be in every area.  Sometimes we talk about the national framework as if there are two frameworks, one for further education and one for higher education.  There is actually one framework.  One should be able to enter at any level, depending on the learner&rsquo;s capabilities and capacities, and should stay on that level until he or she wants to get off.</p></speech>

That is to indicate people can get on and get off at different parts, as well as go back.  Other countries have an earlier separation between vocational and further education.  Many of these are, however, unforgiving and tend to be quite impermeable.  QQI recently published a study on where FETAC learners go after qualifying.  In 2009, of those who achieved major awards, 18% went on to higher education.  This would not have been achievable before without a framework.  Employers and higher education providers need to be able to recognise the qualification easily.  Of those from 2009, 21% went on to reach a further FETAC level award and 56% presented in employment.</p><p>  We host Qualifax, the national learners&rsquo; database, which gives information about community education, non-certified education, further and higher education and vocational awards.  As part of our new establishment, QQI will also have to develop a national database which will indicate at what levels particular awards are on the framework.</p><p>  Several members referred to duplication.  Duplication in itself is not necessarily a bad thing.  We duplicate the leaving certificate around the country.  It is unnecessary duplication we would seek to weed out.  We have come through two separate systems, the vocational education committee and the F&Aacute;S-SOLAS training system.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Walsh agree that a caste system between vocational education and what one would deem academic education has built up?  I think what everybody is saying is absolutely wonderful but I want to know how QQI is going to address that.  How will we go about addressing that in middle school?  I believe a person can do the leaving certificate and go on to be a forester, a plumber or a plasterer.  I do not believe one has to do the leaving certificate or something else.  I believe this is a massive part of any kind of vocational training.  I am talking about something more insidious and deep-rooted.  I have to leave for a very important vote.  Does QQI have plans to counteract and challenge that at a younger age?  I understand what Mr. Walsh is saying about the flexibility of coming in and out of systems and agree that this flexibility does not exist in other jurisdictions.</p></speech>

I can see that under the framework for flexibility that is coming in one could go from vocational to academic and avail of different levels and modular education, but many people still do not fit into that.  I am thinking in particular of the universities.  There is a bit of some of it in all of them.  Could Mr. Walsh respond to Senator O'Donnell's question?</p></speech>

It is very difficult to see how one can promote the current craft-based apprenticeship system to people, particularly women, because it almost excludes them from the types of profession at which they are looking.  The development of that must then feed back into the secondary system.  People have to see that there are opportunities for them to get into meaningful work-based systems.  One of the real difficulties in vocational education is the idea that it is an off-road option and that it is there solely for people who have fallen off the wagon.  What we need in many cases are good examples of people who take vocational education as a genuine career choice.  There is a series of areas where people do that.  We, and those who make policy, must be able to speak about that area as something that can be positively endorsed rather than something that is seen to be an off-road option.  We must make it more attractive and facilitate people in seeing that there are outcomes that are not narrow or cul-de-sac outcomes for people who go down that route.</p></speech>

I remember how in the early 1960s, if one wanted to advance or wanted one's children to advance in provincial Ireland, it was either through the Civil Service or vocations such as teaching.  That was seen as something that was advancing.  The vocational schools at that time may not have been seen in the same way, but so much has changed since then.  One area in which Ireland differs from Europe is the fact that we enter vocational education much later - after the leaving certificate, when one goes on to higher education.  The secondary school system here is very much the same regardless of whether it is the education and training board system or the voluntary secondary school system.  The schools are very much alike.</p><p>  We run a series of business education forums with leaders of industry who have asked us not to send them people with master's degrees who want to be managing director in three weeks.  That is a big problem they have.  They want people with particular skills.  When we met the leaders of the IT industry, they referred to the 4,000 vacancies that remain unfilled in this country.  There are fantastic opportunities through vocational education.  Ms Canning is a principal and an adult education officer so I might ask her to expand on that point.</p></speech>

One of the most popular questions in our information referral website is about how one can repeat the leaving certificate, as if nothing else existed.</p><p>  Deputy McConalogue referred to the issue of guidance, which is a key part of the supports for people in adult education.  Last year, we ran a consultation programme for adult learners to find out what they would like to see in the new SOLAS services.  Among the key issues emerging were guidance and information at the point of entry - this is especially important where links are made with Intreo - mentoring and supports for those who have already enrolled in programmes and further guidance at the point of exit.  We should reconsider the issue of guidance to avoid lumping it together for one person to deliver.  People who deliver further education and training need a broad range of skills, including mentoring skills, to help learners as they proceed.</p><p>  The recent report from the NESC on the long-term unemployed contained interesting information on what employers considered important.  Work attitudes were top of the list, with 74% of employers contacted in an IBEC business sentiment survey reporting work attitude as the most important factor, followed by literacy and numeracy at 36% and, way down the list, qualifications at 13.9%.  That says something about what is needed to make people work ready.  Qualifications are not always needed because there are opportunities for upskilling on the job.  We need to think more broadly than simple steps up or building up.</p></speech>

One of our challenges is to prioritise the changes that are needed.  Today's discussion reflects many of the things we could do but if we try to tackle everything at once, sometimes we can only take a sticking plaster approach.  The sector needs to decide how it should progress.</p><p>  The system will have to be able to recognise the different capacities and learning styles of individual learners and value equally the routes they take as individuals rather than pigeonhole people or regard options that do not involve college as second best.  People learn, develop and contribute in different ways.  If we can achieve that goal over a five year period, we will make a significant difference.  We will have to make choices in the first instance and our sector has to compete for resources.  We will get the resources when we convince those who pay for them that our work is valuable.</p></speech>

Our country attracts the biggest industries in the world.  Vocational education can play a big role in this regard.  In regard to the particular skills required, while we are currently experiencing emigration, people are also immigrating to Ireland to work for these international companies.  Education has to be outward thinking as well as inward thinking.  The City &amp;amp; Guilds would encourage that approach.</p><p>  We need to consider the framework as three dimensional.  It is not a linear system.  We can add value and knowledge in a format that creates more learning for people.  People should view lifelong learning as a part of life rather than something they have to do to get a job.  We have to adapt to the speed at which industries change.</p><p>  Many of the people I know who went to university and graduated with high level degrees found they could not get jobs without experience and or gain experience without jobs.  Today's discussion has focused on how we can fix that problem.  Apprenticeships are an ideal way to integrate learning and working in a way that almost guarantees future careers.</p></speech>

We will continue to explore this.  Separately we will have a meeting hopefully when the apprenticeship review is published.  That will also be relevant to this.  As a select committee, and particularly the two Deputies here, we would have dealt with the legislation which established SOLAS and the ETBs.  That is a new phase in our education system.  At the same time it builds on all the measures there such as the VECs, City &amp;amp; Guilds and the community providers.  It is bringing it all together and making it more coherent.  I am not saying it was not coherent before, but there is an issue about joining it all up together so all parts complement each other.  I found today's discussion very helpful.  We lost people along the way because we had votes, other meetings and matters we had to attend to.  As a committee we will examine what we debated here today and will try to build on that.

We thank the committee for this opportunity to present on the special liquidation process as it impacts on IBRC mortgage customers.</p><p>  With the committee's permission, we have an opening statement which we would like to provide to it.  I will highlight some of the key contents from that statement.  Then we will be available to take questions from the committee.  The members of the committee will be aware that we retain obligations of confidentiality towards individual borrowers of IBRC and we are unable to discuss the specifics of any particular account or borrower.  Furthermore, the sales process for the residential mortgage portfolio is ongoing with final bids due on 14 March 2014.  As I am sure the members of the committee will appreciate, there are certain matters that remain commercially sensitive in relation to this transaction which we are unable to discuss.</p><p>  Mr. Wallace and I were appointed as joint special liquidators on 7 February 2013 under the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Act  2013, IBRC, Act 2013.  The passing of the IBRC Act and the appointment of the special liquidators was part of the promissory note transaction which yielded significant benefits for the State.</p><p>  On our appointment, we were instructed by the Minister for Finance to arrange for the valuation of IBRC's loan assets by independent advisers.  In this regard, the special liquidators appointed PwC as independent advisers to value the residential mortgage portfolio.</p><p>  PwC was also appointed to provide independent advice in developing a robust and credible sales strategy for the sale of the residential mortgage portfolio which would ensure that maximum value was achieved for the benefit of all creditors of IBRC.  We understand the committee sought a copy of this report issued by PwC.  In view of the commercially sensitive nature of the material contained in that report, we regret that we are not in a position to make this available or to put it into the public domain.</p><p>  It is also worth noting that, per the ministerial instructions, the assets of IBRC could only be sold at a price equal to or in excess of the independent valuations obtained.  Should a bid in excess of the independent valuation obtained not be received, the loan asset will transfer to NAMA at the independent valuation price.</p><p>  I will give a general update on our loan sales processes to date.  For operational reasons, the loan assets of IBRC have been divided into six portfolios, code named Evergreen, Sand, Rock, Salt, Stone and Pebble.  The Sand portfolio comprises Irish originated residential mortgage loans with a par value of &euro;1.8 billion.  In total, there are 15,734 borrower groups comprising 24,632 loans for sale across the six portfolios.  Thirty-three of these borrower groups, representing 0.2% of total borrower groups, were or are being offered for sale on a stand-alone basis.  No IBRC borrower is being provided with an exclusive opportunity to buy back his or her loans at a discount, and each sales process is a competitive sales process involving third parties.</p><p>  Within the Sand portfolio, there are 11,825 individual residential mortgage customers comprising 12,702 mortgages with a par value of &euro;1.8 billion.  Following receipt of legal advice, we corresponded with these residential mortgage holders and provided them with an opportunity to make written representations on the method of disposal of their loans and the criteria for determining who may bid on those loans.  We received 1,224 residential mortgage holder representations.  The special liquidators have reviewed and considered each representation.

We have employees who are owed moneys in respect of contractual entitlements and suppliers who were owed money on the date on which the bank went into liquidation.  The most substantial creditor is the State, which will account for approximately 70% of the unsecured creditors of IBRC.  We have our secured creditor, NAMA, which is owed just short of &euro;14 billion.</p></speech>

There are resolution targets.  The delegation mentioned its own resolution targets in its opening statement.  I will return to this later.  Under the existing scheme, set out around April of last year, very specific targets were set for the banks.  There are percentages of 25%, 35%, 50%, etc.  There was a carrot-and-stick approach.  The stick approach is that if financial institutions do not meet their targets, capital penalties will apply to them.  The loan book being sold contains people with performing mortgages.  They may be performing just by their fingertips but there are people in resolution processes, as has been explained.  I will go into the detail of the resolution process later.  What is the position on the resolution targets pending the sale?  If the Central Bank has no role in this matter, how can penalties be applied according to the code of conduct?</p></speech>

As my colleague Mr. Eamonn Richardson alluded to, by the end of next week we will have effected restructuring deals with 44% of the borrowers in arrears who are co-operating with us.  A further 42% are work in progress.  We are actively encouraging those in this category to continue to co-operate with us so we can have restructuring deals done for them over the coming weeks.</p></speech>

Mr. Wallace referred to the current state of play and said that following the sale of the loan book, a voluntary code of practice will apply, but I am saying the current resolution process for people in Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank, Permanent TSB involves very specific targets which, if not met, result in the application of penalties by the Central Bank.  Capital reserves must be adjusted, for example.  Will any penalties apply to the new institutions?  It is critical that people in difficulty be put into a resolution process.  What gatekeeping exists to ensure the targets will be met by the new financial institution?</p></speech>

The statement issued last evening by the liquidator claims all the parties now in phase 2 agree on abiding by the voluntary code of conduct.  In earlier comments by the Minister and the Department, there seems to have been concern about the rating in terms of the creditors' best interests and distortion with regard to the value of the book on the basis of having some people in a box and others outside it.  Given that everyone in phase 2 has accepted the voluntary code of conduct, it creates equalisation with regard to the purchasing of the loan book.  Does this present a legislative impediment that would be damaging to the creditors?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-26a.100" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ann Nolan" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014022600005#D00100"><p>First of all, I would like to welcome the fact that all the bidders have said they will voluntarily abide by the code.  As regards possible future legislation, last week in the D&aacute;il the Minister said he hoped they would voluntarily abide by the code.  However, we are in discussions with the Central Bank and the Attorney General on whether we can extend the legislation.  It is quite complex because a lot of different legal contracts were entered into between different people at different times.</p><p>  The Minister is absolutely determined that the code of conduct will apply.  We will certainly be watching the space.  If the bidders who eventually purchase them do not abide by what they have committed to do, the Minister has said he will legislate as necessary.</p></speech>

The earlier argument was that creditors would be at a disadvantage if we were to legislate for a code that would have devalued the book.  Because everybody has now signed up to the voluntary code, there is no negative impact on the loan book.  Putting aside the fact that the State is the major creditor, what is the impediment from a creditor's perspective?  Is there a creditor impediment that would stop a legislative framework being put around this?</p></speech>

I cannot give legal advice on that issue but it is unlikely, given that this process is now half-way or three quarters way through, that we would have legislation to go through in that period, even if we had it ready.  The fact is there are legal complexities and this is not necessarily the only book that would be sold.  We are looking at legislation, as the Minister said.  The creditor position is obviously changed by the commitment.</p></speech>

There are a number where we have given moratoria whereby they do not have to pay for a period when they find themselves in temporary difficulty.

Indeed, Mr. Richardson and I have spoken to many of them directly.  As liquidators, we have a job to do, which is to sell the assets for the best price we can for the benefit of the creditors, which I alluded to already.  The only other thing I would say is that this is not the first mortgage book that has been sold in Ireland.  Our experience on the ground is that we have seen no material difference in the way the buyers of those books have dealt with and handled customers post-acquisition than with any existing Irish bank.</p></speech>

We are not discussing investment properties but family homes.  We now have a vista in which we have two different standards of protection.  If one is a customer of AIB, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB or Ulster Bank, one has the full protection of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and recourse to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  However, if one had taken out one's mortgage with the former Irish Nationwide, one will now have a completely different standard of protection which is entirely discretionary and can be removed at any time by the new holder of one's mortgage, if that ends up being an unregulated entity.  The issue is that even if the funds say they are compliant, a dispute may arise.  If one is in difficulty with one's mortgage and the fund says it is complying with the code of conduct and offering various restructuring options, to whom does one turn to if one disagrees?  One cannot go to the Central Bank, which has nothing to do with it and one cannot go to the Department of Finance, which also has nothing to do with it.  One cannot go to the special liquidator, which will have got its fees and be gone.  Who do people turn to?  They have nowhere to turn.  That is morally bankrupt and completely unacceptable.  It is as much a political issue as it is one for the special liquidator.  Even with the voluntary compliance that these funds say they will adopt, what will happen if they sell on the mortgage book?  That is what they do.  They will not necessarily work out each of these mortgages for the next 15 to 20 years.  They may well sell this on.  That commitment will be sold on with it and will be gone.  Has that issue been discussed?</p></speech>

They will not have access to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  It is another matter we are considering in the Department at the moment.  I understand the two purchasers of the existing portfolios of mortgages that have previously been sold on the Irish market have established an internal, independent appeals procedure which they are using for people who wish to appeal where they have a problem with their mortgage.  We will ask whoever purchases these mortgages to do the same.  We are reviewing this issue in the legislative review that we are carrying out.</p></speech>

That avenue will be completely closed off for IBRC mortgage holders who will have their mortgages sold by the special liquidator.  There is a serious vacuum in the law which must be addressed urgently.</p><p>  I revert to how this issue arose in the first place.  We know from parliamentary questions that the Department of Finance was in contact with KPMG as prospective special liquidator for IBRC as far back as autumn 2012, which was several months before the Minister came to the D&aacute;il in February 2013 with emergency legislation to appoint the special liquidators.  Did anyone think of this issue and the mortgage holders and of ensuring that these basic but vital statutory protections would be retained in the circumstance of the bank being liquidated?  Why was that not factored into the sale process following the appointment of the liquidator?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-26a.156" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ann Nolan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014022600006#E01200"><p>It was very important for legal reasons that the sales process was independent and that the other creditors of IBRC would not have recourse to the State.  We did not do anything that would impinge on the value of the assets as they were being sold as the taxpayer would otherwise be left liable for quite a considerable sum of money.  The question of public policy on the protection of mortgage holders is a separate one in respect of which we are looking at legislation.  It is not as part of the sales process of IBRC loans.  Any legislation we bring forward is likely to apply to any sales process of any loans and unlikely to apply exclusively to the IBRC loans.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-26a.157" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014022600006#E01300"><p>What Ms Nolan is saying is in fact worse.  She is saying the issue was considered but a decision was taken not to insist that these mortgage holders would be left in no better or worse position.  The Department felt that insisting these protections be retained might diminish the value of the loan book and so decided to exclude them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-26a.158" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ann Nolan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014022600006#E01400"><p>No.  What I am saying is that as part of the IBRC liquidation, we dealt only with the value of the assets being sold.  In terms of protection for the individual mortgage holders, at the time we introduced the legislation, it seemed most likely these mortgages would go to NAMA.  I understand that now there are other bidders.  That is not exactly what we expected at the time.  We would require NAMA to apply the consumer protection code to any consumers.</p><p>  The question of sales of mortgages is a broader one that encompasses more than just the IBRC.  It has to do with the mortgage contract.  It is obviously preferable that all of the protections of the State apply to these customers, but it is also important not to put ourselves in a position in which we are implying they will have no protection at all.  They are governed by the mortgage agreements they have signed and they will be governed by any restructuring agreement they sign with KPMG or have already signed with IBRC before the liquidation.  It is not the case that these customers are left with no protections at all.  The legal position is that the courts have asked anyone who has gone to court over a mortgage case whether the consumer protection codes applied or not.  The courts will retain the right to ask that question.  It is specifically provided for in the insolvency legislation that people have rights under the consumer protection code.</p></speech>

In respect of the timing of last night's announcement, it could be construed that this was a statement that was going to be put together before the special liquidators came before the committee today.  How long have they been in negotiations with the preferred bidders with regard to a voluntary code of conduct?  We discovered this afternoon that it has no legal standing and that no targets are in place for the people in resolution processes that carry penalties as they do in all the other institutions.  This committee would certainly like to know about the timing of last night's announcement.</p></speech>

As Mr. Richardson said, each process for the sale of loans goes through a number of different stages.  We have phase one in which we try to determine whether there are any parties interested in acquiring the loans.  After that stage 1, we then look to see what kind of values the potential bidders have put on those loans.  Where there is an appropriate reason to bring bidders through to phase two, we do that.  This is probably one of the more complex books in terms of getting it to market and getting it sold.  It was our professional judgement that it was only in the last two weeks that it made sense to engage with the bidders in respect of this issue.  We had heard it debated.  In our professional judgement, there was no point in doing it prior to that because it was only at that stage that we had some insight as to which bidders were seriously interested in making a bid for the various loan portfolios within this section.</p></speech>

We see revelations in the newspapers today to add to the arguments put forward by myself and others that the special liquidators should have taken that course of action.  The special liquidators say they have independent legal advice, which is fine.  Can they tell us the name of the company that gave them that advice?</p></speech>

To clarify one point, the litigation does not relate to the role of KPMG as auditors to Irish Nationwide Building Society.  The firm that gave us the advice is McCann Fitzgerald.</p></speech>

I will summarise it because I want to move on to the mortgage issue.  The special liquidators of IBRC are employees of KPMG who ask whether IBRC should sue KPMG as a result of the auditing of Irish Nationwide accounts carried out by KPMG.  The special liquidators seek independent advice from a legal firm that gave advice to Irish Nationwide on the issues of corporate governance.</p></speech>

The independent board made an assessment as to who should be joined to the litigation.  It was not our decision.  In regard to the Statute of Limitations, we will shortly be announcing a different arena for managing the litigation, other than by Mr. Richardson and me.

As Mr. Wallace pointed out, the decision not to sue KPMG was made before that firm was appointed as special liquidator.  The decision was made by the independent board not the Department of Finance.  We did not play a day-to-day management role in the running of IBRC before it was liquidated nor do we do so during its liquidation.</p></speech>

I have also put questions to the Minister on it.  In regard to mortgages, the special liquidator expressed the view that the preferred bidders will honour legal agreements and referred to the restructuring that has taken place in IBRC.  Will restructuring agreements affecting individuals with split mortgages or interest only mortgages be regarded as legal agreements?</p></speech>

Mr. Wallace indicated that he is legally precluded from interfering with the issue of statutory compliance with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears but I presume that the compliance with restructuring would be done on the basis of a legal agreement in the contract.</p></speech>

We would expect any buyer of a loan to honour those restructuring agreements.</p></speech>

They are deeply concerned and quite angry about what is currently happening.  One individual, who is a father of three children, has asked me to outline his situation to the committee.  He has a split mortgage under a restructuring arrangement with IBRC that is reviewed on an annual basis.  According to Mr. Wallace, that restructuring agreement will be enforced with the buyer but the agreement is reviewed annually.  If IBRC rips the agreement up next year and demands the repayment of the full amount, this individual would have recourse to the Financial Ombudsman.  However, the new owner of the mortgage will be able to legally review his contract and decide whatever action it considers appropriate.  What would Mr. Wallace say to this individual about what will happen when the agreement is reviewed next year?</p></speech>

The restructuring agreements with IBRC that I have seen certainly extend beyond one year.  Many of them extend to three years, five years or longer.  It is certainly not the norm in the restructuring agreements I have seen.</p></speech>

The most Mr. Wallace can say to those concerned is that the bidder will comply with the restructuring until the time of the review, at which point all bets are off and there is no recourse to the Financial Ombudsman.</p></speech>

In so far as legislation prospectively governed the actions of people who had acquired such assets, it is not a foregone conclusion that it could not be applied to people who purchased those assets prior to the legislation coming in.  So because the legislation would be prospective, it would not interfere with the conditions of the sale.  It is legitimate for the Government to legislate for the actions of people who are in that sort of space.  That is why we have a suite of regulation of financial service providers.  It would be for the Attorney General to make the final decision but we are not discounting the possibility that it would be possible to so legislate.  That is why it is under active exploration.</p></speech>

My last question is for the Department of Finance regarding Tanager.  There are concerns about a conflict of interest.  It is well publicised that directors of Tanager, which bought the loan book from Bank of Scotland, are partners of A&amp;L Goodbody, which provided advice to Certus and which was involved in the outsourcing of the loan books.  Is there any concern or are any red flags going off within Departments about directors of one company buying loans from Royal Bank of Scotland being partners in another company which provided advice to the bank to sell the loans?

I acknowledge that the special liquidators are trying to do the best thing by the taxpayer and get the best price for loan book but they must have been told at the time of the liquidation what the strategy was for the work out of the mortgages.

We knew the loan book was going to the market for sale; we thought it was more likely that it would end up with NAMA.  It would be fair to say that the Irish economy has recovered in the past 12 months and the amount of interest in buying Irish assets has improved significantly in the past 12 months.  We knew that some of the assets would sell but at the time we liquidated, it was not clear to us that there would be as much interest or that as big a proportion of the assets would sell to the private sector.  One of the reasons we put in the NAMA arrangement was to make sure there was not a firesale because that would have left the Irish taxpayer very exposed, but all I said was it would have been our expectation that it was more likely that a bigger proportion of the assets would end up with NAMA than now appears likely.</p></speech>

I understand that it had to be in place before 9 a.m. the following morning.  This is a little reactionary.  Almost 40% of the mortgages the special liquidators are dealing with are distressed.  I am uncomfortable with the notion that somebody can come in and manipulate their mortgages to get the most money they can out of them and we need to put legislation in place to protect them to the best of our ability.  I urge the Department and the liquidators to reconsider the need for legislation.  Given what has been divulged, any valuer would understand that the Minister would legislate if they did not live up to the code of conduct.  To safeguard the mortgages, the legislation should be introduced now rather than waiting for the loans to be sold on and on.  A total of 970 borrowers are not engaging.

Mr. Richardson and I would like to publicly thank everybody in IBRC, particularly for the hard work they put into getting many of the loan books ready for sale.  It has been an outstanding contribution by them.  We worked pretty well with most employees over the period of time and we sought on many occasions to extend the contracts of employment with them as long we could.  We recently announced an extension until late 2014.  The other good news is we have not had occasion yet to make compulsory redundancies in respect of IBRC employees.</p></speech>

In addition, they are considered to have started new jobs and do not have entitlements they had built up previously.  They have been disadvantaged following the liquidation and that must be acknowledged.  I thank Mr. Wallace for acknowledging their hard work because the vast majority of people working for Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society were hard working and decent and that is not said half often enough.  Is there not an injustice that people in the higher echelons who were moved for the purposes of cleaning up the bank were given a lucrative handshake while those who are still there cleaning up the messy loans and doing the hard slog are not being remunerated or looked after properly post-liquidation?</p></speech>

KPMG was auditor of INBS in the time running up its collapse and KPMG advised the Government that it would have to pay north of &euro;5 billion into the building society.  Mr. Wallace, in reference to himself and Mr. Richardson earlier, stated: "We have no experience selling loan books whatsoever."   He has no electoral mandate obviously to act in the public interest.  Based on that, does he think it is appropriate that he should be making decisions that are harming tens of thousands of Irish citizens?</p></speech>

It is not a decision that Mr. Richardson and I made independently.  It was following the receipt of professional advice having appointed independent advisers to provide that information to us.  The other thing is that nowhere in the liquidation of IBRC have we allowed an individual borrower to singularly bid on his or her own loan without competition from another party.</p></speech>

My question is about his suitability rather than the process.  KPMG was the auditor of the Irish Nationwide Building Society and gave it a clean bill of health.  Mr. Wallace has said he has no experience in selling loan books and he clearly has no elected mandate to look after the public interest.  In the context of those three facts, does he believe it is appropriate for him to make decisions that so seriously affect tens of thousands of Irish men, women or children?</p></speech>

In many cases liquidators go into a business where they have no prior experience.  I am not saying that is an analogy here, but I am saying I think it is wholly and absolutely appropriate that we would make decisions based on advice from experts in a given field.  The sale of the loan book that we are discussing is one aspect of the overall liquidation; it is not the entire liquidation itself.</p></speech>

Mr. Wallace will be very familiar with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, a copy of which I have here.  I am sure he will be familiar with the sentence in Chapter 1 as follows: "Lenders are reminded that they are required to comply with this Code as a matter of law."  At today's committee meeting we have learned that the IBRC or Irish Nationwide Building Society mortgage holders, rather than being protected by law as is the case under the CCMA, will be protected by a voluntary agreement that has no supervision, no Central Bank involvement, no sanctions, nothing in writing, no guarantee that mortgage holders can buy out their own loans and no access to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  Does Mr. Wallace believe that mortgage holders should be satisfied with the voluntary agreement the special liquidators have secured on their behalf?</p></speech>

We can simply do the best we can in the circumstances, being conscious that our ultimate objective is to get the best price we can for the assets of the bank.</p></speech>

I have just read back over part of the special liquidators' opening statement which stated: "We are satisfied that the voluntary nature of this arrangement strikes a fair balance between the interests of the mortgage holders as well as the interests of the creditors of IBRC."  The creditor essentially is the State, the majority shareholder.  Given the protections under law guaranteed by this code compared with a non-existent gentleman's agreement that no one is willing to write down, that has no oversight, no sanction and no enforceability, does Mr. Wallace believe that the Irish Nationwide Building Society mortgage holders would be satisfied with that agreement?</p></speech>

Earlier, Mr. Wallace stated that it was his professional view that if it was a binding agreement it would lower the sale price.  If bidders would lower their sales price if it was a binding agreement then they are <i>de facto</i> not serious about the voluntary agreement because they are lowering their sales price only because they will be forced to comply with this so-called non-existent voluntary agreement.</p></speech>

We have independent advice that if we made it a compulsory term of the sales contract it would impact value.

However, in the past hour Mr. Wallace told this committee that it is his professional view that if these bidders were asked to sign a binding agreement rather than a gentleman's spoken agreement, it would lower the sales price.

[We agree on that.]  It is unlikely that this purpose could be achieved through actions which would make it more, rather than less, difficult for borrowers to comply with the terms of their loan agreements.</blockquote>I put it to Mr. Wallace that in many cases that is rubbish.  Let me give him an example.  Let us consider a mortgage in arrears where there is equity in the house.  Many of the domestic banks are offering split mortgages, which comes at a cost to the lender.  If, as I agree, these hedge funds and whoever else is bidding are looking to make a financial return, then they are likely to evict the family, take possession of the house and secure their equity.  Is that a reasonable assertion?</p></speech>

In the opening statement we alluded to a number of issues which we have taken into account following independent advice on whether we would be in a position to allow mortgage holders to bid on their loans.  Even if we decided to go down that road, there are two practical issues, parking all the other issues that have come into our decision-making process, as to whether we could contemplate individual mortgage holders bidding for their own loans.</p><p>  First, across the entire portfolio of IBRC loans we have, less than 0.2% of the total of borrowers have had the opportunity to bid for their own loans.  They have bid for their own loans in a very competitive environment, allowing other qualified bidders in to bid for those loans at the same time.  We have had no examples right across any book - nor will we have any examples - where individual borrowers will be the only party bidding for their loan because that does not allow Mr. Richardson and me to fulfil our duty of getting - and standing over getting - best price.</p><p>  Second, even if we got down to the point of allowing individual borrowers to bid for their own loans, parking everything else to one side, we would have a range of practical issues to deal with.  Let us consider the hypothetical case of Mr. and Mrs. Murphy with their home on a particular road in a particular suburb of Dublin.  All the information would then be available to anybody who actually qualifies as a qualified bidder - it is not that difficult to qualify as such.  They would be able to go in and look at all of the information regarding Mr. and Mrs. Murphy's home, their payment records, the amount of the mortgage, the level of their arrears, when they stopped paying and all of the details around their mortgage.  We believe an incredible range of practical difficulties would arise even if we got to the point of getting the advice indicating it is practical to allow individual mortgage holders to bid for their own loans.</p></speech>

That is an eminently achievable auction process.  Was any effort made to model that auction process?</p></speech>

That consideration was given here, as we did in respect of any portfolio.  As we indicated in our opening statement, we corresponded with every mortgage holder prior to commencing the sales process.  We received 1,224 responses, and Mr. Richardson and I, along with PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, personnel, read them and took them into account in forming final views on how this portfolio should be sold.</p></speech>

We took a number of issues into account, including the cost of running a process, timing and independent advice from PwC.  Nowhere else in the process had we a position where only the borrower would bid for the loans.  We had to account for confidentiality of personal information and execution risk in following through the process.  I do not want to harp on about it but we also had an obligation to get best price for assets from a company loan perspective.</p></speech>

I will give an example of a gentleman who has been outside the gates of Leinster House and was keen to see the witnesses this afternoon.  He owes &euro;220,000 on his family home and is in arrears of &euro;20,000.  I assert that the non-performing loans - the example I give is one - could be sold for a discount of 50%.  We do not know if that is the case and the witnesses cannot say, but they could easily be sold at a 50% discount based on international prices for these types of loan books.  This person's home is in positive equity but he cannot pay the &euro;220,000 mortgage.  It is likely that his mortgage will be sold to a hedge fund for approximately &euro;110,000 and the fund, as it is completely unregulated, is likely to knock on his door or write to him informing him of an intention to initiate repossession proceedings.  It is likely that he, his wife and his children will be evicted from that home.</p><p>  The special liquidators could have designed a process that sold him and his wife their mortgage for &euro;110,000 or even more than the price that will be agreed with the random hedge fund that buys such things.

Mr. Wallace is in a very tough position and in the same way I believe the liquidators are hanging 13,000 Irish families out to dry, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, conspicuous by his absence, is hanging the liquidators out to dry.  They are not helping themselves as they have made the wrong decision, which will cause much unnecessary pain and suffering in this country.

We have taken independent advice on setting up the sales process and how to manage that sales process for the mortgage side of IBRC.  We took the advice from PwC's loan portfolio team.  There were a number of different parties within the first phase of this particular sales process but the issue becomes even more pertinent in the second phase because it did not apply to some of the parties in the first phase.</p><p>  The advice that we have taken says that if we include it as a definitive term then it will impact on value.  That is a very live issue for us.  Two weeks ago there was a case in the US where the judge refused to confirm a particular sale regarding IBRC because he thought there was better value available in respect of that sale.  It is a pertinent issue for us, as liquidators, that we get best value.</p></speech>

That is what Mr. Wallace has implied because last night, in the late hours of the night, they had not signed up to some voluntary commitment.  That is a big contradiction.  It cannot be both things.  Either the assurances Mr. Wallace has tried to give are worth nothing or it would have made no difference whatsoever if it had been made a condition of the sale that the purchaser had to sign up to the code.</p></speech>

I seek clarification on the issue of the mortgage holders being allowed to buy back their own mortgages in or around the same sort of discount the vulture capitalists will get when they purchase the mortgage books.

I said that cost and timing came into the decision-making process, but I do not want to go over old ground.  I am speaking from the perspective of ensuring Mr. Richardson and I can stand behind our obligations as liquidators.  Therefore, we have not allowed any individual borrower to be the only party bidding for their own loans.  There is competitive tension in the less than 0.2% of all the loans of IBRC that we have allowed to be put out on their own as individual loan sales.  We have not, in any particular party of IBRC, allowed an individual borrower to be the only party bidding for their loan.</p></speech>

Quite a number of factors went into the overall decision as to whether we could entertain individual mortgage holders and allow them to bid for their own loans.</p></speech>

My next question is for the Department.  Does it accept that mortgage holders have significant reason for anxiety, particularly when one looks at the attitude of banks that are based outside this country?  They are not the banks we bailed out.  Those banks have taken a different approach to the loans they own.  They have displayed an attitude of getting whatever money they can regardless of the consequences for the person who had the loan and in a way that is not true because of the political and public pressure that might be on banks based here.</p></speech>

The same Central Bank rules apply across the board for all mortgage protection and to all banks whether they operate inside or outside of Ireland.  I understand that where the loans are sold, there is an issue and we talked about it earlier.  For banks themselves, the same legal protections apply regardless of whether those banks have been bailed out by the Irish Government.</p></speech>

These bidders have been asked for this commitment because they are based outside the country.  Mr. Wallace was satisfied as to their bona fides but we know what is happening in this country with venture capitalists.  Ireland has become a magnet for international hedge funds.  They see pickings here and come in like vultures and sell on.  They have no interest in hanging on to loans and being challenged on the commitments they gave to Mr. Wallace.  We are also dealing with an unknown quantity, possibly based outside the country, that will not come under the code of conduct to which financial institutions in this country must subscribe.  Mr. Wallace indicated to one of the members that he will disclose the bidders at the end but it is meaningless because we will never know the bidders if the loans are sold on at the rate hedge funds can sell them on.</p></speech>

The liquidators refused to allow the mortgagors to bid for their loans.  As far as I can see, the liquidators are acting illegally by excluding potential bidders.  The normal answer we get is that it is impractical to deal with individual mortgage holders but I cannot understand it because this is untrue.  How is it practical to set up these mortgages in the first place?  It takes a lot more paperwork to set up a mortgage than to pay it off in one go.  The liquidators have shown they can communicate with the mortgage holders because they wrote to them individually in August 2013 and looked for submissions.</p></speech>

I have been given a couple of questions to ask and have a couple of my own.  </p><p>  Mr. Wallace has acknowledged that PwC was appointed by the liquidator to value the entire loan book.  How many of the partners, executives or staff members of PwC appointed by KPMG to conduct the valuations were also partners and senior executives responsible for conducting PwC's Project Atlas - Anglo Irish Bank Corporation plc?  This report in the middle of September 2008 found that significant security was in place to minimise the bank's loss through default.  Anglo Irish Bank management, subsequently relying on this report, told the Government that just &euro;300 million in additional capital was required for the bank.  The figure turned out to be &euro;30 billion.</p><p>  When assessing due diligence of who should be appointed for the valuation and loan sale preparation process, did the liquidator take account of past experience in the assessment?  Does the liquidator agree that, objectively, it is hugely astonishing that the same people who undertook such an appallingly bad original valuation of Anglo Irish Bank in 2008 were hired again and, presumably, paid millions of euro for the privilege?</p><p>  For how many years was KPMG auditor for Irish Nationwide Building Society, an entity which was subsumed by IBRC and for which KPMG is now the Government appointed liquidator?  There is the question which arose in the American courts recently that there was embedded fraudulently charged interest on some of the commercial loans in the Anglo Irish Bank loan book for a long number of years.  This has been shown as fact.  It was not a once-off case but an experience that was systemic.  It implies that any rolled up interest, the subject of such fraudulent charges, contaminates the cumulative loans that are the subject of a sale and that the buyers of such loans are buying loans with toxic or embedded fraudulent charges.  How has the liquidator dealt with this issue?</p><p>  People who took out mortgages, whether in the Irish Nationwide Building Society or, to a smaller degree, in what was Anglo Irish Bank, entered into a series of covenants under headings which included the term of the mortgage loan, the amount of the loan, the repayments, the interest charges and their basis.  Even though there may have been some small print licence to sell on or securitise these loans, their essence is a relationship extending over 25 years.  I agree with Senator Fidelma Healy Eames that when a loan is sold, even if it is performing-----</p></speech>

I understand that as an official it is not Ms Nolan's duty to give opinions on policy direction and so forth but perhaps she would explain, in legislative terms, what mechanism exempts buyers of mortgages from Central Bank regulation.  What is the mechanism that puts such people outside regulation by the Central Bank?</p></speech>

The Central Bank Acts puts them under regulation but if they are not a regulated entity under those Acts, then they are not in regulation as such.  If one buys a loan and one is not a regulated entity, then one falls outside the scope of regulation, as I understand it.</p></speech>

At other side of the sale, there is the contractual nature of the sale of the actual loan.  It was implied that the purchasers of loans could adopt a belligerent attitude which could affect people adversely because they are on variable rate mortgages.  Most variable interest rate loans are tied, somewhat, to the ECB rate.  The rates tend to move around that space.  If we saw a departure from that general approach to the variable interest rates being applied on the current loan book that is being sold and there was an increase of 1% or 2% with no material change in the ECB rate, that could be deemed to be very belligerent behaviour by the purchaser.  Ms Nolan indicated that such behaviour might give rise to legislative action, not on the sale itself but on how the contract is operating.  Is my understanding correct here?</p></speech>

I am not clear as to what conditions exist that would allow the purchaser of the loans to increase interest rates.  Obviously, it would be a matter of concern if a very aggressive line was taken but I could not speak to whether or what we could or should do about that or whether ---</p></speech>

I thought the situation was that action could not be taken on the actual sale of the loans but that we could look, from a legal perspective, at how the loans were being operated.  In other words, the operational rather than the sale aspects of the loans could be examined</p></speech>

Banks can charge different interest rates for different loans, depending on the risk appetite, the length of the loan, the financial position of the borrower and so forth.  Indeed, there are non-banks which also charge different interest rates for different types of loans.  There is usually something governing the interest rates in the loan agreements themselves but there is no legislation governing interest rates on loans.</p></speech>

I will put it to Ms Nolan.  Yesterday evening's announcement that everybody in the phase 2 bidding process is in verbal agreement to adhere to a voluntary code of conduct means there is a flat-line position between all of the phase 2 bidders, even if we might not call it a level playing field.  Does this change the Department's thinking about the legal advice it received previously regarding imposing conditions on the sale that would have an adverse effect on the value of the loan book?  Now that everybody is actually in that space, has it been considered that it could be possible to put a legislative framework around this that would not have an adverse effect on creditors?</p></speech>

Indeed, there would be no particular reason for legislation to apply to these loans but not to other loans that might be sold in the Irish market.</p></speech>

Its mortgagees, or the individuals who own those mortgages, are entitled to the same protection as IBRC mortgagees will be entitled to.  It would be quite unusual to have bespoke legislation for this sale and not for other sales.  I cannot see any particular reason to change the legislation on the sale of loan books in such a way.</p></speech>

If the bids are allowed to proceed without a legal commitment in respect of the code of conduct and the Minister subsequently introduces legislation to require adherence to the code of conduct, could the bidders sue the liquidator of IBRC?  The bidders have opted into the voluntary code of conduct and are aware that the Minister will introduce legislation on the code of conduct.  On the grounds of certainty and the potential cost to taxpayers, should the liquidator not consider requiring bidders to comply with the code of conduct for mortgage holders?</p></speech>

The price is clearly factored into the voluntary commitments.  If the liquidators allow bids to be made on the basis that they will be required to comply with the code of conduct, they will flush out individuals who are seeking to flip the loans on rather than comply with the code of conduct.  Would it not be best practice and good governance for the liquidator, acting on behalf of taxpayers, to implement such a requirement now to bring certainty to the bidding process?</p></speech>

In particular, one gains a great deal of insight when one sees bids coming in from multiple parties on the same asset.  This gives one a very good indication as to whether the value range for the assets in question was appropriate.  This is something we are very conscious of in respect of each of the loan sales we do.  As I stated, and this is as true of the loans we sell to third parties as it is of the mortgage book, it is of vital importance that we secure the best value for taxpayers and the creditors of IBRC.

We all remember the shenanigans associated with the relevant legislation in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  The consequence of that is the sale of the loans of 13,000 mortgage holders.  My focus is not solely on those mortgages, because mortgage holders with the Royal Bank of Scotland are in exactly the same boat and do not have any protection.  That issue was not the subject of much attention.  Ms Nolan stated that her only interest was to ensure Royal Bank of Scotland was not bailed out by the State.  I am interested in the citizens who hold mortgages provided by that bank.</p></speech>

That was his primary concern.</p></speech>

If the Minister wants to come in and defend himself he is more than welcome.  He was invited but he refused to appear before the committee.  The Minister can do that.  I am asking about the powers vested in him.  Obviously the answer is right.  Now we will go to the point Ms Nolan has raised.  The issue that the Minister has raised in terms of the potential legal threat is, as Ms Nolan has stated on several occasions before this committee, that if one was to take an action in isolation - at no time have I suggested during this thread of conversation that we take an action in isolation.  To reiterate, what Ms Nolan has confirmed is that the Government's stated intention is to provide protection on a statutory basis to all mortgage holders, including the 13,000 in IBRC, that the Minister has the power to issue a directional order to the liquidators of IRBC to cease with the sale at this point in time.  The Minister has the power to bring forward the legislation that he has already stated he intends to bring forward and if it is brought forward on a unilateral basis that does not specifically deal with this sale, then the issue of legal action is diminished or does not exist.  If this is what we all want, why do we not do it?  Instead of the Minister saying he will introduce legislation if they will not agree with this voluntary code, why not just issue a directional order to IBRC liquidators to stop the sale at this point in time?  The sale was supposed to be complete by the end of last year but it is not.  Stop the sale at this point in time.  Let us bring forward the legislation.  As one of the main parties in Opposition, I have offered to work with the Government and the Minister to bring forward legislation.  Deputy Michael McGrath has put his suggestions forward in the form of legislation.  If we are genuinely serious about not shafting the 13,000 mortgage holders why can we not take that course of action?</p></speech>

I understand there is concern that the bidders - we will have to see who they are - may not do what they have promised to do.  We will take action if they do not keep to the promises they have given to KPMG.  I do not think I could count the sale of the mortgage book as shafting the 13,000 mortgage holders.</p></speech>

Why cannot we just do that?</p></speech>

The Minister can only give directional orders if it is necessary for meeting the purposes of the IBRC Act, not if it is necessary for the general public interest.  So it would be quite difficult to justify stopping the sale half way through on the basis of legislation which he can pass after the sale is over in any case.</p></speech>

Despite the fact that the Minister issued a statement last night saying he will legislate, and Ms Nolan has reiterated those points, she has not been able to confirm to the committee that the legislation the Minister is thinking about introducing could affect the new owner of those 13,000 mortgages, whether the owner decides voluntarily to sign up to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears or if that is sold on.  There is no clarification as to whether such legislation could actually impact on the person who buys these mortgages on 14 March.  That is where I take serious issue with the commitments the Government is giving at this point in time.</p></speech>

Until I get it, I cannot say it definitively.  I do not work for the Attorney General's office.  I would like to have a stamped copy before I could assure the House that this is perfectly okay.  I have no reason to think we cannot, and I believe we can.</p></speech>

I presume the liquidators are on course to meet the targets for loan disposals.  How many people - if the liquidators do not have the number they can supply it to the committee or to me at a later stage - bought their loans directly from IBRC in the competitive tender and so would have got a writedown, and what was the overall reduction in those loans?  They may not be able to give out the individual overall reduction but across the board.</p></speech>

The other issue is on the former CEO of Anglo Irish Bank, Mr. Mike Aynsley, IBRC.  He is a joint defendant in regard to the racketeering cases going on in New York.  I understand the liquidators have provided a statement saying Mr. Mike Aynsley may well look to the bank for his costs.  He is still a company director at the Companies Registration Office in Ireland and may look to the bank to cover his costs.  Why is he not being taken off as a former director if there is an exposure to IRBC and liquidation of the legal costs of the former CEO?  Will the liquidators reassure the committee that no deal was done with the former CEO where he withdrew legal action against IBRC and liquidation for the fact that the notice period of one year was not paid out to him when his appointment was quashed when IBRC went into liquidation?</p></speech>

I can give the Deputies and the Chairman a categoric assurance that no payment has been made to Mr. Mike Aynsley or any sweetheart deal done with him, nor do we intend to make any payment.  Mr. Aynsley voluntarily withdrew that litigation.  On the costs being covered in the potential US court case, there is a slight confusion.  The meaning of what was said was that we may have to cover his legal representation costs at the hearing, whether he is director or not.  There are quite a number of people named in that litigation who are not directors of the bank who may still have to cover the costs of that.  We intend filing an objection to that litigation for the very reason that there was a stay on all IBRC litigation in the US and that it would join us by the backdoor in that litigation if we had to cover all those costs.  On his resigning as a director in the companies office, that is a matter for him.  We have corresponded with him but that is an issue for him, not an issue for us.

The trade magazines are saying it is down to Oaktree Capital and Lone Star Funds.  Oaktree Capital's own description of itself states it emphasises an opportunistic value-oriented and risk controlled approach to investment in distressed debt.  Lone Star Funds states that it invests globally in distressed debt.  If these two bidders, or ones like them, are the successful bidders, they are debt collectors.  They may be reputable and extremely respectable and professional firms - in no way do I suggest they are not - but they are not banks.  They are professional investors in distressed debt.  On the basis there is no written voluntary agreement, if when the successful bidder emerges it says it never agreed to adhere voluntarily to the CCMA, will we have any proof it did?</p></speech>

At issue is a &euro;1.8 billion par value book.  I have no wish to make it seem unimportant but, from our perspective, whether it is &euro;100 or &euro;1 billion it remains the same principle in that we have not got best value.</p></speech>

However, from our perspective, as legislators, it is a completely different issue.  Let us consider the example provided by Mr. Wallace in which the difference was &euro;1 million.  I realise that is not the case.  Let us suppose PwC did the analysis - I do not believe the firm has done it - and it came out that the difference was &euro;1 million.  Let us suppose PwC made a stab at total sales value under the recommended process and the firm also did an estimate of the sales value under alternative scenarios, particularly one in which the mortgage holders are allowed to bid.  I hope the firm did this.  Anyway, let us suppose that total difference was &euro;10 million.  We, as legislators, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, as the guardian of the public purse, could then decide to let the bidders do what they are going to do while we, the State, would make up the difference, therefore protecting any question of a challenge from the creditors because the total amount of money available to the creditors does not go down.  Under that scenario we could potentially avoid thousands of families being unnecessarily evicted.</p></speech>

There was some confusion because Mr. Wallace thought my question pertained to all mortgages but I was primarily concerned with residential principal private dwellings and so on.  I am seeking clarity because given the rapid fire of questions backwards and forwards taking in the import of what Mr. Wallace said has taken some minutes.  Mr. Wallace should correct me if I am wrong but I understood he said 60% of all mortgages he had were sold back to the original mortgage holder.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I do not understand how we can commit ourselves to do something down the road, which presumably will have the same impact on the price, when we cannot do it now because it will have an impact on the price.

How much it changes is moot but that is not the issue.  If we bring in the legislation now, the other creditors can say we took some of their value and can sue us.  It would be better to bring in the legislation in a more general way that is not related to IBRC.  That applies to all the other mortgage holders and would also be fairer to other mortgage holders whose mortgages have been sold.</p></speech>

In his presentation Mr. Wallace said that in total there were 15,734 borrower groups comprising 24,632 loans for sale across the six portfolios as described, 33 of these borrower groups, representing 0.2% of total borrower groups, having been or being offered for sale on a stand-alone basis.  We know for a fact, as every Deputy has repeated today, no borrower has been provided with an exclusive opportunity to buy back his or her loan at a discount.  Did the 33 loans have a certain value?  For example, were they above &euro;1 million, &euro;5 million or whatever?  What were the criteria that put those people into that space?</p></speech>

I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference, even on silent mode, with the recording equipment in committee rooms.  Before commencing I congratulate Mr. Niall Burgess on his appointment as Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  He succeeds Mr. David Cooney, the outgoing Secretary General, who will retire at the end of April.  Mr. Burgess has been director general of the Anglo-Irish division at the Department of Foreign Affairs since August 2010 and he served as Consul General in New York, as well as in Chicago, Geneva, Brussels and with the consul secretariat in the European Union.  He brings a wealth of experience to the job.  We wish him well and I am sure we look forward to working with him when he takes up his appointment on 29 April 2014.  We also wish Mr. David Cooney well, as he has been an excellent Secretary General.  Holding the position of ambassador to the Vatican, he has been an exceptional public servant, demonstrating major commitment throughout his career.</p></speech>

He is joined by his colleagues, Dr. Lorna Gold and Ms Caoimhe de Barra.  We are pleased to have the witnesses before us and I have known Mr. Meehan a long time, as we attended St. Flannan's College in Ennis for five years in Ennis.  I was delighted to see him as executive director general of Tr&oacute;caire as I know he has worked extremely hard in the organisation through the years.  He deserves the role.  This is Mr. Meehan's first appearance before the committee.  I offer him my congratulations and those of the members of the committee.  We look forward to working with him today.</p><p>  We will hear a presentation from Mr. Meehan before engaging in a question and answer session.  We look forward to Mr. Meehan's comments as he plots his course as executive director general of Tr&oacute;caire.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-26a.934" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. &Eacute;amonn Meehan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014022600003#B00200"><p>Thank you.  I very much welcome the invitation to address the joint committee.  It provides me with an opportunity to acknowledge personally the very valuable work of the committee on development issues, consider the new responsibility the committee has been given in overseeing Ireland's progress on policy coherence for development and update members on Tr&oacute;caire's views and responses to current sectoral domestic issues and positions on key international challenges, especially climate change.  Following last year's publication of the policy for international development, One World, One Future, we now await the outcome of the most significant review of Ireland's foreign policy and external relations since 1996.  The review of foreign policy represents a key opportunity to reaffirm Ireland's core values and principles as set out in One World, One Future and to integrate these into Ireland's foreign policy for the future.</p><p>  The review takes place in a context where the scale and complexity of current and emerging challenges are formidable.  The impacts of global economic and environmental challenges are compounded in developing countries when poor governance and failed institutions accentuate economic and social inequalities, facilitating resource grabbing by elite interests and further institutionalising exclusion, poverty and corruption.  In Ireland, the delay in implementing charities legislation and appointing a charities regulator has compounded an already difficult operating environment for charitable organisations.  I am happy to address the ways in which Tr&oacute;caire has responded to this governance vacuum in more detail.  Members will have received some information in a background briefing note describing how Tr&oacute;caire works, our programme approach, thematic programme areas, the countries we work in, finance and auditing standards and changes at board and executive level in 2013.  In the interests of saving time, I will focus on a small number of key issues in three of our programmes in respect of which action by the joint committee would be most welcome.</p><p>  First, I wish to highlight climate change.  Tr&oacute;caire's sustainable livelihoods and environmental justice programme seeks practical ways to support people's right to food, a livelihood and to make a living.  Progress towards food security and poverty reduction is becoming increasingly difficult in the face of ever more unpredictable climatic events and the woefully insufficient action to tackle climate change by those most responsible for causing it.  In recent years, we have witnessed at first hand how frequent and severe climatic events like storms and droughts disproportionately impact the world's most vulnerable people.  Global leaders have awoken to the seriousness of climate change given the recent experiences with extreme weather in Ireland, the USA and the UK.</p><p>  However, to date action by policy makers at all levels has been slow and insufficient.  Ireland must do its part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Publication of the long awaited climate change Bill is expected before Easter.  The outline heads of the Bill, published in February 2013 can be improved.  Based on extensive public hearings, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht recommended in a report published in November 2013 a number of ways to improve the Bill.  In light of the role of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade on policy coherence for development, I encourage members to support the findings of that report and, through appropriate channels, encourage the Minister, Deputy Hogan, to reflect its findings in the Bill.  In particular, the Bill should incorporate a national objective for 2050 of near-zero emissions from energy, buildings and transport, carbon neutrality in agriculture and ensure the expert advisory body follows the model of the fiscal advisory council.</p><p>  To put matters in context, I have just returned from Zimbabwe where I visited subsistence farming communities in the Matobo region of Matabeleland.  Tr&oacute;caire commissioned research recently into the impact of climate change on rural communities in Zimbabwe.  Using meteorological data going back to 1970, the researchers have shown that the mean maximum temperature for Matobo district has risen from 25.8o between 1970 and 1980 to 26.9o between 2000 and 2008.  At the same time, the figures show a decline in mean rainfall patterns from 707 mm between 1970 and 1980 to 476 mm between 2000 and 2010.  The frequency of dry agricultural seasons is increasing.  A continuation of this trend will make agriculture and food production impossible in this region and other parts of Zimbabwe.  Responding to climate change is no longer a choice but the effectiveness of how we do so is very much within our control.</p><p>  The joint committee has taken a strong interest in violations of human rights around the world.  As such, I wish to draw the attention of members to two issues within our governance and human rights programme.  The first is one with which members will be familiar, that is the ongoing human rights issues in the occupied Palestinian territories.  I visited Israel, the West Bank and Gaza in January and witnessed the ongoing and systematic displacement of Palestinians.  Many are being forced off their land due to the construction of Israel's separation wall, the ongoing demolition of Palestinian houses and the expansion of Israeli settlements.  It was striking that the settlements are expanding at such a rate and construction was evident across the West Bank.  There are now more than 500,000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank.  Despite the current US-led peace negotiations, the Israeli Government has continued to expand settlements in recent months with successive announcements of the construction of thousands of new housing units.  Furthermore, according to UN data, 286 Palestinian structures have been demolished since 28 July 2013 when negotiations started.</p><p>  These actions are illegal under international law and are undermining the fragile negotiation process.  Greater action is needed by European governments to ensure pressure is put on Israel to abide by international law.  The timing is critical to support the process and prevent the talks from collapsing.  European leverage at this moment could have a very positive impact.  The joint committee has already endorsed the proposal of an EU trade ban with Israeli settlements.  The T&aacute;naiste has also publicly supported such a proposal.  Achieving an EU consensus on banning settlement trade may not be realistically achievable in the short term.  Ireland, however, should consider demonstrating leadership by taking action at national level.  In recent months, the Dutch and UK governments have taken steps to introduce official government advice to their private sectors regarding the risks involved in having commercial links with Israeli settlements and being potentially implicated in violations of international law.  We encourage the Irish Government to do likewise and issue formal advice to importers and other businesses to refrain from purchasing settlement goods and to avoid all commercial and investment links with the settlements.  Many commentators have raised concerns that this may be the last chance for peace negotiations for some time.</p><p>  I refer briefly to a second issue, which is the premature end of the term of office of Guatemala's Attorney General.  The issue is outlined in the briefing note we circulated.  Ireland has a direct interest in this issue as it has funded the UN's International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala.  The early termination of the term of office of the Attorney General is a matter of concern.  We ask the joint committee to take the matter up with the T&aacute;naiste and to ask him in turn to take the matter up with his counterpart, Guatemala's Minister for foreign affairs.</p><p>  The final issues to highlight today arise in the context of our humanitarian programme.  Tr&oacute;caire's humanitarian work continues to address needs created by both natural and man-made crises.  We support humanitarian programmes in more than 20 countries with a variety of national and international NGO partners.  Natural catastrophes such as Typhoon Haiyan in the Phillipines mobilised very significant resources.  The task we face there, while daunting, is not complex or dangerous.  Complex and protracted crises in Syria, Sudan and Somalia require ongoing public interest and political engagement.  Today, I  draw particular attention to the complex crisis in Syria and the hidden crisis in South Kordofan, Sudan.</p><p>  Since 2011, more than 130,000 Syrian people have been killed from what started as peaceful civil action.  In the bloodiest chapter of the Arab Spring, Syria has become the battlefield for a proxy war.  The action and inaction of many has turned a stable country into a humanitarian disaster that is affecting the wider region.  More than 2 million people, mainly women and children, have fled to Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, Turkey and Lebanon.  It is worth noting that the UN appeal for $6.5 billion to support the people of Syria has been funded to the tune of 11%.  That is shocking and unacceptable.  Tr&oacute;caire continues to deepen its engagement with Caritas and local partners working in the region.  Distribution of food, water, basic cooking utensils, clothing, sanitary material, mattresses and blankets has taken place to several hundred thousand people while access to health care and psycho-social support for the most vulnerable and education for children have been supported.  With more than 4 million people displaced internally and little regard for those trapped between battle lines, the crisis appears intractable.  Ireland's response to the crisis has been to allocate &euro;19 million in humanitarian assistance and a commitment to allow 90 Syrians refugee status here.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-26a.937" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014022600004#C00300"><p>I refer to the area of policy coherence which means we should not give with one hand while taking with the other.  For example, land that had been used for food is then used for producing biofuel.  Has Mr. Meehan experience of instances where land has been grabbed, literally, or subtly, from people who had been living there for many years?</p><p>  There is no doubt that the situation in Syria is a huge problem which is getting worse.  Today there are reports about bombing of civilians.  There is a fear that an evacuation will not be properly patrolled with the danger that men will be taken.  Will Tr&oacute;caire have a role in the process?  Like other members I received an e-mail from the Israeli ambassador with regard to Palestine and the funding of NGOs.  I was fortunate to visit Palestine in a semi-private capacity last November.  We met wonderful community groups, youth groups, drama groups, cultural groups and heritage groups.  We visited a wonderful music school with a symphony orchestra.  In general, there seemed to be disconnect between those groups and the Palestinian Authority.  What is Tr&oacute;caire's engagement with such groups?  There is no doubt that the settlement issue is the biggest factor preventing peace.  It is only when one is able to see the separation wall in Hebron that one realises the extent of the settlement problem.  There seems to be a disconnect between the political issues and the people who have decided to get on with their lives.  We met groups in both Palestine and Israel and we wondered where is the dialogue between people and the movement to bring people together.  The dialogue seems to have fallen away due to pessimism and perhaps cynicism that there had not been progress in the years since the Oslo Accords.</p></speech>

I visited India a number of years ago and I spoke to people actively involved in the Irish Aid programme.  They singled out Tr&oacute;caire as an agency that provided sustainable assistance to areas in great need rather than simply crisis management.  This is to Tr&oacute;caire's credit.</p><p>  Mr. Meehan referred to the need for a charities regulator, an issue that has been highlighted as a result of recent controversies which I believe will lead to greater transparency on the part of charities.  I ask Mr. Meehan to comment on the possible effects of the controversy on Tr&oacute;caire's fund-raising.  Ireland has a great tradition of supporting charitable organisations.  It would be a pity if a few organisations were to damage that ethos.</p><p>  Mr. Meehan gave the example of Zimbabwe as being a microcosm of what is happening elsewhere in Africa and the need to address the issue of climate change.  There was a focus on climate change a number of years ago.  However, in my view, the global financial collapse has diverted attention away from the issue of climate change.  There is also a tendency to see it as someone else's problem.  Ireland is a small country compared to China or India and therefore it could be perceived that our impact is minimal compared to the impact of larger countries.  How can that mentality be overcome?  How can cohesive global action be achieved with regard to climate change?  Unless the major economic powers are involved, any action we take would only scratch the surface.</p><p>  The Chairman of the committee led a deputation to Palestine last summer.  I was shocked at the conditions in which Palestinians are living and their dispersal throughout that region.  It is shocking to discover that many of the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon have been in existence since 1948, with people living in atrocious conditions.  I have photographs which I took of collapsed houses in a dangerous condition with people living in them.  We were flabbergasted to see that because such buildings would be cordoned off in Ireland.  The settlements are continuing.  The Israeli ambassador wrote to all members of the committee.  I appeal to the ambassador and to the Israelis, as people who have suffered enormously throughout the centuries and in particular in the twentieth century, that their humanity should surely recognise the appalling conditions in which the Palestinians are left.  Perhaps Mr. Meehan might have some suggestions as to what we could do to effect movement in that area.  The US Secretary of State, John Kerry, is worthy of great credit for taking on what is almost an intractable problem.</p><p>  I refer to the situation in Sudan and in the Central African Republic.  Tr&oacute;caire may not be working in the Central African Republic but the situation in that region is atrocious, with displacement of people and the humanitarian crisis.  It is a pity to see the living conditions of the Syrians who were educated enterprising people, whose standard of living exceeded others in that region.  I share Mr. Meehan's view that Ireland should be taking greater responsibility for accommodating refugees.  I welcome any suggestions in this regard.</p></speech>

We are all aware of the outstanding work Tr&oacute;caire is doing around the world.  I am sure that will continue under his leadership.</p><p>  Tr&oacute;caire has needed to reduce the number of countries in which it is working from 27 to 17 over the 2013-15 period.  Was this due to financial considerations or were there other considerations?  Like others, I am happy it is continuing its work in Palestine.  It is not only involved in highlighting human rights abuses, poverty and so on, but it also acts as an advocacy group.</p><p>  Mr. Meehan mentioned the formal advice from the British and Dutch governments.  Are there particular reasons that Mr. Meehan can articulate as to why the Irish Government does not want to give the same basic advice to Irish companies?  We seem to be working towards a consensus across Europe on this matter, but it is interesting that many companies, particularly multinationals and banks, are pushing ahead regardless of what their governments are doing.  This initiative is coming from some of the largest banks in Germany, Holland and so on.  Would Mr. Meehan encourage companies based in Ireland to follow suit?</p><p>  What work does Tr&oacute;caire undertake in Palestine and in partnership with whom?  We are all horrified by what is happening in Gaza.  It seems to be getting worse.  Conditions were affected by recent floods and there is no access for supports.</p><p>  Tr&oacute;caire also works in Uganda.  We are all aware of the passing of its anti-gay Bill into law this week.  Many of us view that law as draconian and an infringement of human rights.  On the day it was passed, some newspapers outed 200 individuals as being LGBT.  People are being targeted.  We all want to send the message to the Uganda Government that this law is unacceptable.  Does it change the dynamic of our country's relationship with development aid?  No one wants the development work and projects that are under way in Uganda to be hampered but this situation creates difficulties.  What is Mr. Meehan's advice?  Does Tr&oacute;caire work mainly with the Ugandan Government or NGO partners?  Will Tr&oacute;caire's work be affected by this law and how?  How should the Irish Government react?</p><p>  Like others, I am interested in the impact of the scandal about CEO's salaries.  How does Tr&oacute;caire highlight its transparency and oversight as regards its funding?  What are its initiatives in this regard?</p><p>  We were delighted when Aung San Suu Kyi was released in Myanmar-Burma, but that country is again experiencing significant levels of ethnic violence.  I am particularly worried about the security of minorities like the Karen, of whom Ireland has a large population.  They would like to be able to go home.  The Rohingya are another group.  Does Tr&oacute;caire work with organisations that assist these minorities?</p><p>  I congratulate Mr. Meehan on the document, "Stand for Global Justice - Tr&oacute;caire".  This forms part of Tr&oacute;caire's advocacy work in the European Parliament.  I am informed by an election candidate in Dublin, Ms Lynn Boylan, that Tr&oacute;caire is asking all election candidates to sign up to it.  It covers some of the areas in respect of which we have asked questions, for example, settlements, advocacy, climate change, etc.  How important is it that people are not only aware of the issues when they are elected, but will also act as champions for change in the European Parliament?</p></speech>

I am sure that some of the questions will overlap.</p><p>  Regarding the Israeli Embassy's memo, while it acknowledges the fact that Tr&oacute;caire does good work throughout the world, it claims that Tr&oacute;caire's policy is unfair and imbalanced and does not take into account the complexities of the situation on the ground.  What is Mr. Meehan's opinion on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-26a.944" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. &Eacute;amonn Meehan" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014022600005#D00500"><p>Regarding Deputy O'Sullivan's questions, policy coherence for development is critical.  We have such a good track record in development co-operation that it would be a great pity if other Government or EU policies undermined our excellent work.  This is at the root of policy coherence for development.  It is good that this committee now has a monitoring role in that regard.  It tends to be slightly orphaned as a topic within the development community, but it is one of the most important issues that we could address and involves everything from trade to tied aid, the relationship between our private sector and African governments, etc.</p><p>  It is difficult for us to have a role in the Syrian evacuations.  We have direct access to information from Syria and partners working inside that country.  The only way to bring about a situation in which there is proper care for those who are in need is a peace agreement.  A considerable amount of effort needs to go into achieving that.  There are no short-term or other solutions to this crisis.  The question is whether all of those who are engaged in what is a proxy war actually have the best interests of Syrians at heart or whether there are bigger issues at play.</p><p>  A question was asked about the disengagement from the Palestinian Authority by groups.  It is true.  In terms of the Palestinian Authority and Hamas in Gaza, there is no question that there are issues of governance for ordinary Palestinians.  Given the origins of the authority, it has never been in a position to develop good systems of governance.  It only re-entered the West Bank and Gaza after the Oslo Accords were signed in the early 1990s.  Beforehand, it was a political movement.  There is a long history dating back to the Ottoman Empire of appalling governance and mistreatment of the peoples who have lived in that region.  We are just seeing the latest version.  It is no surprise that ordinary people in their social movements become disconnected from what they regard as a less-than-perfect government.  I will revert to the Palestine question again in a moment.</p><p>  Senator Walsh referred to sustainable development assistance.  I thank him for his comments, as that is our approach.  While short-term assistance is required in many situations, our approach is long term.</p></speech>

Is it being far more co-operative with the United Nations in respect of access to aid for people who are under pressure?  Is there any evidence this is happening or that there is progress?</p><p>  Mr. Meehan referred to the level of promised aid materialising at only 11%.  Will Mr. Meehan comment on the sustainability of the aid effort?  What will happen if the promised aid does not materialise?  How great a humanitarian crisis are we facing?</p><p>  We received correspondence from the Israeli embassy.  The correspondence asked several questions and it is only appropriate we put them on the record in the committee.  One of the questions related to the nature of the relations that exist between Tr&oacute;caire and the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign.</p></speech>

I was interested in what they were saying about the need for charities regulation, which I do not think anyone would deny at this stage.  Since the recent scandals and revelations, has Mr. Meehan noticed a drop in their fund-raising efforts?  I am not sure what percentage of Tr&oacute;caire's income comes from fund-raising, although I think I have seen it published somewhere.  Has it impacted on the organisation?  I know that is not the only reason to have the legislation.  It is absolutely essential.</p><p>  I completely agree with the points made about climate change, but in a global recession it is almost inevitable that the focus on climate change would disappear.  Mr. Meehan spoke about those most responsible for causing it, and I agree that we have to take personal responsibility for it, but places like America are now changing to an even dirtier form of fossil fuel.  They have so much of it that there will be no constraint on its use.  Given the winter they have had, they might be persuaded that there is some truth in climate change.  Perhaps some good will come out of it.</p><p>  I absolutely agree with Mr. Meehan that what is happening in Palestine is really tragic.  I got the same questions from the Israeli embassy and I can understand why they are asking these questions.  Nobody is suggesting that the Palestinian Authority has given the most wonderful leadership.  I am sure there are abuses going on in Gaza, but if I lived in Gaza, I would be radicalised as well.  Tr&oacute;caire is looking for a boycott of Jewish communities operating in the occupied territories in the West Bank.  They make the point that there are 23,000 Palestinian workers there, but if people moved into my front garden and set up a shop and tried to justify it by telling me they were going to give me a job in the shop, I would not be terribly impressed.  These arguments just do not stand up.  I was there many years ago when the Oslo Accords seemed to offer some hope to the people there.  I can understand that they would be utterly disillusioned at this stage and I hope the talks produce something for them.</p><p>  In respect of Syria, I was thinking that 90 refugees is a pitiful numbers, given the huge scale of that problem, but even if we were to double it, that is still a drop in the ocean.  Mr. Meehan is absolutely right in saying that the only solution to this is a peace agreement, regardless of the agenda behind it.  This is important not just for the people trapped in Syria, because the refugees can never be assimilated into their current host countries.  The richer countries like Ireland will never take enough of them to solve the problem, and the economic status of the countries they are in does not permit it.  What can we do in the meantime to ameliorate the conditions that exist in the refugee camps?  I know Tr&oacute;caire is working in them.  I was reading in <i>The Guardian</i> yesterday about the impact the conflict is having on women, with a huge increase in the number of deaths of women in child birth, of babies dying, and of violence against women, even from their own husbands due to the stress of the conditions in which they are living.  Is there any way of shaming the states into meeting their commitments?  Is there anything we can do in that respect?  It seems to be an horrendous situation in Syria.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Meehan for his detailed submission.  There is absolutely nothing he contributed with which one could disagree.  He highlighted the key areas, such as climate change, governance issues - we all know how important that is in emerging democracies - and human rights.  I express my deep appreciation of the Roman Catholic community in Ireland.  Notwithstanding all the economic difficulties, the contributions to Tr&oacute;caire have increased on average by 4%, which is an incredible achievement.  I thank the witnesses for providing us with more detailed documentation earlier which allowed me to understand a little bit more about Tr&oacute;caire and its specific Roman Catholic structure.  I must admit I am never quite sure about the difference between Tr&oacute;caire and Concern, but at least I now have it here that Bishop William Crean, the Bishop of Cloyne, is the chairman of Tr&oacute;caire.</p><p>  Looking at Tr&oacute;caire as a religious organisation, Mr. Meehan mentioned the countries in which the organisation is operating, including countries in Africa.  I presume Somalia is a Muslim country.  The conflict in South Sudan is between Christians and Muslims.  There was also a conflict between Christians and Muslims in Kenya.  We read about the horrendous massacre in northern Nigeria of students in their dormitories, burned to death by fanatics from the Muslim community, who are systematically targeting Christians, Catholics and others.  Mr. Meehan highlights that Tr&oacute;caire concentrates on addressing the issues of HIV and the AIDS and then speaks about the vulnerability to AIDS.  We talk further about gender equality, which I presume is about empowering women.  I note that Tr&oacute;caire is involved in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is recognised as the world capital for rape.</p><p>  The themes involved are gender, women, Catholicism, Christianity and empowering women.  Perhaps I will take the lead from Senator Norris, who would argue about fertility control, and ask whether Mr. Meehan finds any degree of conflict in the implementation of Tr&oacute;caire's policies.  I would argue that maybe a woman has more control of her fertility, that is to say, could engage in family planning, have a smaller family, and might be more economically secure in her development.  I would argue that for the poor unfortunates in the Democratic Republic of Congo who are being raped incessantly, abortion may be an issue that would have to be addressed by these unfortunate schoolchildren, or whoever they are.  These are important issues for a Catholic or Protestant agency engaging in this work.  Does Mr. Meehan find that such a conflict exists in the field?</p><p>  I cannot help but feel very sorry for the lesbian spokesperson from Uganda who spoke about the horrors that are going to unfold there.  That law is so repressive.  I lived in Africa for four years.  African men are macho and the culture is macho.  They are going to target systematically these poor unfortunate sexual minorities and annihilate them.  There is a terrible record in Africa, unfortunately.  Black Africans can be born white as albinos, believe it or not, and there is a terrible systematic slaughtering of albinos.</p><p>  Tr&oacute;caire is addressing all the issues that are of concern to humanity, such as gender inequality and HIV-AIDS.  One of the methods of reducing vulnerability to HIV is the use of condoms and other forms of prevention.  Does Tr&oacute;caire come in conflict with its religious persuasion and the implementation on the ground?</p></speech>

I wish to make a couple of points on the issues raised.  I will try to steer away from issues raised by others.</p><p>  Global challenges are compounded locally and poor governance and failed institutions accentuate economic and social inequalities.  In attempting to address these issues, we are often faced with suggestions that the people for whom the aid is intended do not necessarily always receive the aid to the extent intended and that administration costs in the process cause particular problems.  Perhaps the witnesses would respond to that issue in some fashion.</p><p>  The point on the Charities Act 2009 was well made, a point which the Chairman and I have made on numerous occasions.  I am concerned that five years have elapsed since the Act was passed.  We are all aware of situations where, in the event that it had been passed on time with all its trappings, some of the issues that have arisen in the interim may not have occurred at all.  We all support that view and continue to raise it.</p><p>  Climate change is an issue we need to look at again.  Climate change is not new.  It comes and goes over the millennia and has come and gone several times.  It happens to be here now.  It used to be called global warming.  We can attest to the fact that it does not always mean warming, as we know from recent events.  We need to recognise that it is an economic issue.  Those countries that do not observe it can have an economic advantage.  Those countries that do not take account of the guidelines laid down and do not observe carbon emission requirements have a duty to the rest of us.  I strongly agree that, proportionately, we need to address our own particular responsibilities in that area and I think we are all committed to that.  Recently, there were some suggestions to the effect that we do not need to do that, that the whole situation has changed and in some strange way the European Union has decided to reduce its targets after 2030, which is some time away.  A lot of water will run under the bridge between now and 2030.  The question I would raise is to what extent Tr&oacute;caire finds the equivatory response in some quarters to the whole question of climate change and the economic impact it has for all of us.  </p><p>   As a representative of this country I would have a friendly attitude to the agri-sector, which is the main business of this country.  Other countries throughout the globe do not necessarily have the same attitude.  Ireland is in the happy position where it can offset its carbon responsibilities to those countries which it sees as having a serious contribution to make.  Everything that grows has a contribution to make as a repository in relation to carbon, including grass and trees, and some trees more than others.  Some trees that are not highly regarded here, for example, the infamous sitka spruce, has a huge capacity to absorb carbon.  The one thing to remember is that when burned or destroyed it emits the same amount of carbon it took in.  That is simple technology.  There are those who would suggest that is not true and those who would suggest that some industrial treatment in the interim can change all that.  It does not change it.  Anything that goes through an industrial process has a carbon attachment, regardless of whether we like it.</p><p>  At another committee of the House in the past couple of weeks, I heard people suggest that the whole issue of the requirement to comply with carbon limits does not apply any more, that it is all rubbish and nonsense.  That has to be confronted.  To what extent does Tr&oacute;caire hear such comments in the course of its very important and charitable work?  As I have often said, the only fuel that is carbon neutral is untreated wood, straight out of the forest, that goes into the stove.  It just emits what it absorbed in the first place, nothing more and nothing less.  There was no industrial process whatsoever, except the chainsaw.</p><p>  An issue that has arisen from time to time is the question of aid for trade.  We have discussed it at recent meetings.  As far as I can see, it is becoming more evident, particularly with some of the more powerful upcoming countries, that it is being used to the benefit of the donor countries, more so than the recipients.  </p><p>  Southern Sudan was discussed at the joint committee in the past.  An issue that other members and I have raised from time to time is the global menu of crises that take place on a daily basis and whether it is possible to identify them in a way which would mean a more focused and concentrated effort could be directed towards those areas in need of the most immediate and urgent treatment.  We dealt with Somalia in the past and it continues to be an issue.  We have dealt with refugees from Somalia, a country that had appalling catastrophes perpetrated on the civilian population some years ago.  Issues that would make the hair stand on one's head were brought to our attention by refugees in this country.  They did not always receive the kind of comfort and succour to which they would have aspired, and tragically so.  The question that arises is the extent to which Tr&oacute;caire is in a position to identify those most sensitive areas that are in urgent need of attention in the course of its daily work and the degree to which it can address these issues or if Tr&oacute;caire, like we are from time to time, is distracted by each emerging issue of a really serious nature on a daily, weekly or monthly basis to such an extent that it has to spread itself in all directions at the same time.</p></speech>

I am sorry I was not present earlier but I have had an opportunity to read the presentation.  I do not wish to repeat anything that has been said.  Last year, a delegation from this committee visited Jordan, Palestine and Israel and looked at the situation.  One of the concerns, apart from all those in relation to the Palestinian issue - not least the reaction of the areas we visited - was the pressures that arose in Jordan due to the number of refugees arriving there with high level skills who are now competing with the Jordanian people for career opportunities.</p></speech>

Some of Deputy Crowe's questions remain to be answered and there were also questions on Uganda and Palestine.  Obviously, we are all concerned at recent developments in Uganda.  The Minister of State, Deputy Costello, said yesterday he is waiting for a report from our embassy in Uganda in order to comment further on what action will be taken.  It is obviously quite serious.  We want to hasten bilateral relations between both countries.  We fund NGOs there at present but we do not fund the government there as a result of what happened before.  It is something the committee will probably consider at some stage in the future.  We were to go to Uganda this year.  I believe we should still go there and protest at this draconian legislation.  It is something to bear in mind.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-26a.960" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr &Eacute;amonn Meehan" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014022600009#H00500"><p>I will draw in my colleagues shortly but I will begin by responding on one or two points.  In regard to Uganda, our fundamental principle is that each individual, by virtue of their birth and their humanity, is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect.  On that basis, the recent legislation in Uganda is seriously flawed.  It is not good legislation and it denies basic rights to a very vulnerable group.  It is opening a situation where we can expect to see attacks on people and where people will be killed or forced to leave the country.  Originally, there was a proposal that the death penalty would be part of this legislation, and that has been reduced to life imprisonment.  On any analysis, it does not meet basic human rights standards.</p><p>  I want to address Deputy Byrne's question around Islam and the relationships in countries where we work, in particular issues around Tr&oacute;caire as a Catholic agency.  First, what is happening in Nigeria and the murder of innocent people is appalling.  I do not know a lot about the situation in Nigeria but it seems to me it is a very divided country.  However, it also seems to me that governance and the institutions of the state are not capable of providing basic protection for all the people of that state, which is a serious problem.  Everybody is entitled to the right to life, whether they are Christians or Muslims.  It is an appalling situation.</p><p>  For ourselves, I will give the example of Somalia.  We have been working in Somalia since 1992, when the humanitarian catastrophe started and some 1 million people died of starvation.  We have worked very effectively there over the last 20 plus years, mainly in health and education programmes, and we have supported communities there to set up their own health and education committees.  We have a very strong and healthy relationship with those communities and it works very well.  The fact that Tr&oacute;caire is a Catholic agency and providing assistance and support to Muslim people is something that, in a sense, is not strange to Tr&oacute;caire.  Our support and assistance is given to communities on the basis of need, regardless of their race, religion or sex.  In many of the countries where we work, there is a mixture of populations.  The Deputy mentioned South Sudan, and Ethiopia and Kenya are other examples where there is a good mixture of communities.</p><p>  With regard to Tr&oacute;caire as a Catholic organisation, as such, we are bound by the church's teaching in regard to abortion and artificial birth control.  Over many years, I have seen a situation where the best responses to the HIV and AIDS crisis in particular are ones that are deeply rooted in a community and where there are a number of responses to the problem.  The first response is a recognition within the community that there is a serious problem.  The second is that people are willing to sit down, as a community, and decide how they can respond to this.  The next is that full education is provided and there is complete openness and transparency for everybody in those education programmes about how to protect themselves from the spread of HIV and AIDS.  Tr&oacute;caire as an organisation insists that every education programme for communities is completely open and transparent about all methods, mechanisms and approaches to protect oneself from disease and from potential death.</p><p>  Sr. Miriam Duggan is a Medical Missionary of Mary sister.  She is credited in Uganda with describing, outlining and designing some of the very best community-based approaches to HIV and AIDS, which succeeded in transforming the situation in Uganda.  We now see, 30 years after the crisis, that there has been a dramatic reduction in Uganda of the incidence of HIV and AIDS.  There are Government approaches and UN approaches, as well as the approaches of other organisations that have a somewhat different perspective to ours.  I believe there is a place for everybody.</p><p>  In my own experience, and for Tr&oacute;caire, condoms on their own are not a solution.  There are vast quantities of them available but there needs to be a response that goes beyond that.</p></speech>

Mr. Meehan mentioned Tr&oacute;caire is bound by church teaching on contraception.  As I understand it, a condition of receiving Irish Aid funding is that it facilitates and participates in the distribution of contraceptive supplies in war situations or humanitarian crises.  Is that a problem for Tr&oacute;caire and how does it work?</p></speech>

We certainly have not done that.  The whole area of the protection of women and children in particular in conflicts and humanitarian situations is something that is very important for us.  It is one of the areas where, in fact, we provide training to other organisations within our Caritas network about how to respond to those situations.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to have this discussion with members.  The crisis in Syria has been ongoing for three years and the peace negotiations have not made a great deal of progress.  There has been some small progress in terms of humanitarian access, an issue raised specifically by members.  We can put the situation in context by taking the example of the city of Homs, which was besieged for 300 days.  Even during the six-day ceasefire, when goods were going in and people were being evacuated, the ceasefire was violated on several occasions.  The context is extremely volatile and there is huge fragility around ceasefires.</p><p>  Without a formal and final peace settlement, we will see a continuation of the fragility of the current situation.  Out of a population of 21 million, more than 9 million are directly affected, whether because of displacement - there are more than 2 million refugees externally displaced beyond Syria's borders, the vast majority in neighbouring countries, and some 6 million people internally displaced - or because they are stuck and cannot leave their current location.  Tr&oacute;caire works with several agencies inside Syria to access places like Aleppo and Homs.  We have found that aid workers and civilians are being directly targeted and men are being disappeared.  It is extremely difficult to access the areas we need to access.</p><p>  An issue on which the Government must reinforce its advocacy at all international fora to which we have access is in calling for the implementation of the recent UN Security Council resolution on humanitarian access.  That important resolution will be monitored on a monthly basis.  If we can advocate for that monthly monitoring and provide any support possible for it, it will help to put pressure both on the regime and on all of the forces that are active in Syria to improve their operations.  It is also important that we ensure there is accountability in the long term for the crimes against humanity that clearly are taking place in Syria and which are being inflicted by all sides to the conflict.  Support for the gathering and documentation of information around crimes against humanity is very important.</p><p>  Regarding the range of humanitarian crises that are ongoing at any one moment, I remind members of our work in South Kordofan, which is a forgotten emergency.  Several hundred thousand people are suffering aerial bombardment there but the world knows very little about it.  The way in which the UN system operates is that there are early warning systems and very good data which tell the humanitarian community and the world at large about what is happening.  The tragedy is that very often these early warning systems are ignored.  For example, in 2011, we knew up to six months in advance of the looming famine conditions in east Africa.  It was only when the situation became critical, however, that there was a response.  At that point many people had died, livestock were lost and so on.  It was just not possible to go back and recover all that was lost.</p><p>  In terms of the Government's response, we work extremely well with Irish Aid.  The latter has a very useful tool in terms of identifying the countries that should be the priority because of their need and not because of the profile they have internationally at any one time.  We must constantly question ourselves on whether or not we are giving visibility to the crises that are forgotten by the international media and whether we are making enough use of the UN's data to identify the locations where we should be operational and active.</p></speech>

As members are aware, we work with several Oireachtas committees, including the environment committee where we present on the issue of climate change.  Policy coherence for development is an obligation we have under the Lisbon treaty, and Irish Aid was recently peer reviewed in this regard by the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD.  Best practice within development co-operation now requires us to look at policy coherence.  It is about putting in place mechanisms for the research into and analysis and understanding of the policy linkages and policy inconsistencies that impact on intractable global problems like climate change, and also the links between our economic trade co-operation and our overseas development programmes.</p><p>  In the context of the publication of One World, One Future last year, the role of this committee <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> policy coherence for development is highlighted in terms of the biennial report that is to be produced by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and is to come before the committee.  We have made a submission to the Department in regard to how that biennial report should be constructed.  We are strongly of the view that it should have a thematic focus rather than trying to capture everything related to policy coherence for development, because it is a very complex and all-embracing issue.  We would prioritise those issues where we feel there is the highest potential for inconsistencies and incoherence.  We see this committee having a role in the discussion of that report and making recommendations on the basis of it.</p><p>  One of the areas we highlighted was the relationship between our aid work and our trade promotion work.  The alignment of trade promotion with foreign affairs by the current Government raises a question around the primary objective of our aid programme.  It is stated as being about poverty eradication and human rights, but there is also talk of synergies with the Irish business sector and how to ensure there are no conflicts of interest there.  Similarly, in respect of our foreign affairs policy more generally, in our submission to the review we highlighted the issue of human rights due diligence and its importance in the context of the Africa strategy and the promotion of Irish business interests in Africa.  We have an obligation in terms of the policy advice we give to businesses in regard to human rights due diligence.</p><p>  In regard to climate change, the concern we would bring to this committee is to ensure that the interests of the poorest and most vulnerable are taken into account in the shaping of the climate Bill.  Although the environment committee has the lead role in this regard, there is also a role for this committee to ensure the Bill is consistent with stated objectives in respect of foreign policy and the aid programme.</p></speech>

At that time, there were probably close to 1 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, a country with a population in the region of 4 million.</p></speech>

Ms Sally O'Neill and Ms Hilary Daly have engaged with the joint committee, for example, in bringing various visitors from Colombia to discuss human rights in that country.  Is Tr&oacute;caire still active in Colombia and, if so, with which Colombian agencies or non-governmental organisations does it work?</p></speech>

As Mr. Meehan noted, two years ago we commenced a process of reviewing our overseas structure.  The review identified that, in light of the additional external and internal pressures on the agency, Tr&oacute;caire could not sustain its work across 17 countries if it was to continue to be able to deliver impact, illustrate the delivery of impact and be accountable not only to beneficiaries but also donors and supporters.  We recognise that we made a significant contribution in Colombia over many years and our local partners were keen to reinforce this work.  These included Catholic Church and human rights partners as well as partners working in agriculture, all of whom would have preferred if we had been able to remain in the country.  By and large, however, they understood that, as an agency with limited resources, Tr&oacute;caire needed to focus its resources in areas where we could make the greatest difference.  We retain an advocacy relationship with organisations in Colombia and continue to engage in advocacy at a European level through networks.  However, we no longer programme directly, in other words, we are no longer involved in supporting service delivery on the ground in Colombia.  Tr&oacute;caire is strongly engaged in Central America on issues of human rights, disaster risk reduction, gender equality and reducing domestic violence and it is our intention to continue to work in Central America, including continuing our engagement in advocacy in Colombia for the foreseeable future.</p></speech>

Our Christmas campaign raised 25% less in 2013 than in 2012.  While we have noted declines in the funds raised in the past five years since the onset of the economic crisis, they have not been remotely of this scale.  Apart from that, what we have noticed in the past five years is that while we are receiving donations from roughly the same number of people, the amounts they contribute have reduced.  This is understandable given the circumstances in which people are now living.</p></speech>

On average, the Lenten campaign has raised more than &euro;8 million in each of the past three or four years.  We are hoping to be able to repeat that this year.  The theme this year is access to water and the availability of water, whether for households or irrigation.  Obviously, there is a link with climate change which is having an impact on the availability of water.</p></speech>

Our financial  year ends at the end of February and by the end of this financial year, our income will be greater than it was in the previous 12 months.  This is due to a collection we had for a humanitarian response in mid-November.  When one responds to a humanitarian crisis it generates additional resources.  However, we also tried to establish what is our unrestricted income as this is, in a sense, the true measure of what is available to the organisation to spend as it sees fit and in the places it has prioritised.  The emergency income is additional to this income and is allocated only to the country for which it has been raised.</p></speech>

We support Irish Aid funding for Tr&oacute;caire and similar agencies.  Members have seen at first hand the good work done by the organisation and its benefits.   We look forward to continued dialogue with Tr&oacute;caire.  While the word "Tr&oacute;caire" is pronounced slightly differently in some countries where people place an emphasis on the second syllable, it is good that the Irish name is used.</p><p>  Mr. Meehan stated that water will be the theme of this year's Lenten campaign.  Water is life.  Members saw solar panels being used in Mozambique to pump water in places which did not have an electricity supply.  We also visited a number of other Tr&oacute;caire projects.  We are pleased the organisation is working in this area and highlighting the important role of water.  One sees women walking along roads carrying water several times a day in Africa and we appreciate the work Tr&oacute;caire does in bringing water to people.  I thank the witnesses again for this informed discussion on Tr&oacute;caire's activities.  I hope its Lenten campaign will be successful.  </p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste regrets that he could not be here to discuss the review of foreign policy with the committee and he asked me to convey to the Chairman and members his regrets and his assurance that it is his intention to meet the committee on an early mutually convenient date to discuss recent developments in Northern Ireland and North-South issues.</p><p>  I welcome the opportunity to address the committee on the review of foreign policy and external relations, which was launched by the T&aacute;naiste on 8 October 2013.  The purpose of the review is to provide an updated statement of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and external relations, and to identify a series of recommendations for its conduct.  Our foreign policy and external relations are fundamental aspects of Government.  They are the means by which we promote our values and pursue our interests abroad.  Through it, we pursue Ireland&rsquo;s economic prosperity and promote peace and security both at home and in the wider world.  Our foreign policy is also a statement of who we are as a people, and how we wish ourselves to be seen by the outside world.</p><p>  Following our successful EU Presidency last year, the chairmanship of the OSCE in 2012, and our election to the UN Human Rights Council, we have an opportunity to reflect on the future direction of our foreign policy, the values and interests we seek to promote through it, and how it contributes to achieving Government objectives.  The vital work of restoring our international reputation and promoting our economic recovery are priorities for the Government.  The international leadership roles we have undertaken as a country have done much to achieve this goal.  Our embassies and other diplomatic and consular offices around the world are making a vital contribution.  They are working hard to realise our goals - presenting the best case for Ireland, influencing decisions that affect us, working with the State agencies and Irish business in  promoting our trade, tourism, education and investment, in addition to providing a full range of services to our citizens abroad, sometimes in difficult and tragic circumstances.</p><p>  As we look to the future, and having exited the EU-IMF programme, it is timely to reflect on the future direction of our foreign policy.  The review will consider a broad range of issues reflecting the breadth of our external engagement: how we set our external priorities; how we engage as an EU member state; how we contribute to economic recovery and growth through promoting our trade, tourism and investment; the pursuit of peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland; the services we provide to our citizens abroad and our relationship with the Irish diaspora; the contribution of our international development policy; and how we ensure Ireland is a respected international actor.  These are all important issues, as are other aspects of our foreign policy which the review will consider.</p><p>  Northern Ireland is not a foreign policy issue<i> per se</i> but one with distinct foreign policy aspects that touches closely on a broad range of domestic policies and on the objective of national reconciliation.  In this regard, the review will look at a number of aspects of the work of the Department in the area.  Our work with regard to Northern Ireland operates at three levels.  First, as part of a whole of Government approach, we support an all-island policy across sectoral areas.  Second, as guarantors of the agreements, we are responsible for overseeing the implementation of and maintaining support for the principles, values, institutions and other bodies envisaged in those international agreements.  Third, we are responsible for the articulation of Northern Ireland interests and of our Northern Ireland policy to other governments, particularly the US Administration and our EU partners.</p><p>  North-South co-operation is promoted through the North South Ministerial Council in Armagh, through other bilateral ministerial and official engagement and through engagement with the wider business and civil community.  It is a priority to complete the review of North-South co-operation.  Part 1 of the review, which deals with the value for money of the North-South bodies, is essentially complete and attention has turned to the forward looking elements of the review.  In this respect, Ministers on the North South Ministerial Council are considering their priorities in their respective areas of co-operation with a particular focus on efforts that will help economic recovery, job creation and the best use of public funds and the most effective delivery of services to those on the island.</p><p>  The Good Friday Agreement has contributed to creating a sustainable peace and provides the mechanism to develop a strong all-island economy by presenting opportunities for beneficial co-operation on these islands.  The St. Andrews Agreement review provides a further mechanism to explore specific areas, including growing exports, improving and upgrading of services, job creation, higher and further education and co-operating to improve access to international funding such as the EU&rsquo;s Horizon 2020 programme which focuses on research and development and innovation.</p><p>  The Government is firmly committed to supporting reconciliation.   We progress this in a number of ways.  First, there are some areas and principles of the agreements which underpin the peace process which have not as yet been implemented fully.  The Government is committed to the full implementation of all aspects of the agreements as the best framework for reconciliation.  Second, the Government takes seriously the need to deal sensitively with the legacy of the past including meeting the needs of victims.  It is clear that the legacy of the past continues to have a corrosive and disruptive affect on politics and community relations in Northern Ireland.  This informs our support for the ongoing political talks in Northern Ireland.  The T&aacute;naiste has made clear the Government&rsquo;s commitment to playing an active and constructive role in dealing with the past and in encouraging agreement on a new architecture for dealing with the past to be agreed by the Northern Ireland Executive parties.  Third, my Department through its reconciliation and anti-sectarianism fund supports cross-community and cross-Border projects.  These funds work with a broad range of partners with the aim of challenging sectarianism and promoting respect and reconciliation across traditions in Northern Ireland, between North and South and between Britain and Ireland.  A new strategy for the funds is being prepared and will be launched in 2014.  The purpose of this strategy is to outline priorities for the funds in the next three years and a new funding framework to match these priorities, to ensure the funds remain relevant, effective and efficient in the coming years.</p><p>  The decade of centenary commemorations, already under way, has the potential to present risks to the peace process by enhancing division and igniting sectarianism.  However, it also has the potential to enrich narratives and to provide opportunities for acknowledgement and reconciliation.  The Department&rsquo;s approach is guided by the principles of historical accuracy, mutual respect, tolerance and inclusivity.  The reconciliation fund provides support for a number of commemorative projects as part of its regular funding of community and voluntary groups.  In total, &euro;116,000 was awarded by the reconciliation fund for expressly commemorations related projects in 2013.  Some political parties have made submissions setting out their thinking on all aspects of review, including those related to the Good Friday Agreement.  I thank them for these contributions, which will be examined carefully in terms of preparing the outcome of the review.</p><p>  I refer to how the review is being taken forward.  Given the wide-ranging nature of our foreign policy and external relations, it is important we consult widely.  The Department is facilitating a broad-based consultation process, involving all Departments, State agencies, academics and experts, business organisations, interested stakeholders and civil society.  A public consultation exercise has produced a wide range of views and submissions, reflecting the breadth and depth of our foreign policy.  We will take these submissions into account as we proceed with the review.  It is important the Oireachtas should make its contribution to the review, as it does to the process of shaping and overseeing our foreign policy, through the work of this and other committees on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

I welcome that there will be a new strategy for funding, whether through the anti-sectarianism fund or other supports for cross-Border projects.  The committee gets representations from many groups seeking funding.  We welcome this review and will have an invaluable input into it.  Even in assessing funding and the efficiency of funding and especially in light of much of the outreach work we are doing in Northern Ireland, there are concerns about sustainability of projects with a lifespan of two to three years after which the funding runs out and they are left hanging.  It is something of which the committee is very conscious.  We certainly welcome that a new mechanism for funding will be announced in 2014 and no doubt the members of the committee would like to have an input into that process.  While we appreciate the Minister of State has said he will not give feedback on suggestions today, one hopes they will be taken as formal observations.</p></speech>

I will be very brief because I already had the opportunity to contribute at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade which the T&aacute;naiste attended and through parliamentary questions, as the Minister of State knows.</p><p>  I refer to the need to include in our policy the development of an all-Ireland framework.  The cross-Border bodies that were established following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 have been successful.  I believe their potential has not yet been maximised.  Of course there are other areas where we should be developing a framework for new all-Ireland bodies.  We need to be fairly vigorous in that respect.  In developing an all-Ireland framework, we need to be very conscious of the importance of the message sent out to communities, North and South, where there are major infrastructural projects.</p><p>  It is very regrettable that the Narrow Water Bridge project has not progressed.  Substantial funding was committed by the European Union and there was a shortfall of a few million euro which should have been made up by the Northern Ireland Executive and by the Government here because it is a project that would be very beneficial for the east coast counties of Louth and Down and stretching to the broader region, including into my and Deputy Conlan's constituency, where we need more visitors to the region.  In the overall context of public funding, it is a relatively small amount and it would be a shame if that project were lost.</p><p>  In much more difficult economic and political circumstances, the Government in 1989 was able to progress the restoration of the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal, which is now the Shannon-Erne Waterway.  It involved an investment of &pound;30 million - I cannot remember if it was punts or sterling.  At that time in 1989 and 1990 the relationship between North and South and between east and west were far removed from what they are today.  The Government at the time was determined to bring that project to fruition, in which it succeeded.  It has been a major catalyst for tourism development in Fermanagh, Cavan and Leitrim.</p><p>  It would send out a strong message to communities on both sides of the Border if the Narrow Water Bridge project was to be advanced and it would cost a relatively small amount of money.  I know there are competing demands for public expenditure.  However, it is a project where the European funding should not be lost.</p><p>  The Chairman, other members of the committee and I were in Derry and Donegal last Thursday night and Friday.  We heard about the issue of the A5 road from representatives from the northern side of the Border and Donegal.  They are very anxious for that project to be advanced.</p><p>  There are a number of outstanding commitments under the Good Friday Agreement.  The policy document, when it is finalised, should send a very strong message about the re-establishment of the civic forum, provided for under the Good Friday Agreement.  It is also necessary to bring forward the bill of rights and Acht na Gaeilge.  Those are all issues that the community, particularly the Nationalist community, is anxious to have addressed as quickly as possible.</p><p>  We know there has been substantial progress in the area of policing.  There was progress up to the past 13 or 14 months with regard to parades.  According to a report in the <i>Irish News</i> almost 200 sensitive parades were permitted last year despite failure to fill out forms correctly.  It is not acceptable that the Parades Commission would allow incomplete applications to be processed, finalised and approved.  There were only two parades in 2012 where the organisers were not properly identified.  In 2013 that had risen to 170.  The parades issue did significant damage to the economy of Belfast and beyond particularly around Christmas 2012 and into the early part of 2013.  We do not want parades to cause the issues they do for small communities where there is thuggery and intimidation of communities through the misbehaviour of a number of people taking part in those parades which are not properly organised and the organisers take no responsibility for organising them properly.</p><p>  Under the Haass proposals there are proposals in that regard.  I welcome that the Alliance Party, the SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in have all worked hard to try to bring those Haass proposals to a final conclusion.  One of the proposals was that there should be no grey area around parading and there must be a code of conduct.  In its statements the SDLP has been very strong on the need for a proper code of conduct so that people organising the parades as well as those participating know their responsibilities to the wider community.</p><p>  Unfortunately, during Question Time last week we did not reach an oral question on immigration reform in the United States.  Coming up to St. Patrick's Day, we all want this issue advanced and brought to a successful conclusion.  Unfortunately, the utterances from some senior Congressmen in the United States were not as positive over recent months as they have been in the past.  I hope Government representatives during their visits to the United States will use every opportunity to hammer home that message again.  I know it has been done continually in the past, but it needs to be given the extra impetus.</p></speech>

The Government is committed to implementing all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and Deputy Smith has correctly mentioned the big ticket items in developing an all-Ireland economy.  In the long run these would include the Narrow Water Bridge, the Ulster Canal, the A5 road and various other projects that are symbolic of development.</p><p>  As a Government in Ireland, we are falling down in doing the basic stuff right in this regard.  There is no point building a running track if we do not have running shoes.  We have not developed proper cross-Border health care services, for example.  We are trying to achieve the goal and although there is much discussion, it has not yet been reached despite the time elapsed since the peace process began.  This should not be a political matter and we should reach that goal to benefit communities along the Border which are at a loss because neither Government is examining the issue seriously enough and moving it forward.</p><p>  Deputy Smith mentioned big ticket items but what about the local road infrastructure that has not been developed over 20 years?  It is crazy that after 20 years in a peace process we still do not have a decent road between Armagh and Monaghan.  There is no push North or South for that to happen, and there is no link between county councils and the roads service in Northern Ireland to address the issue.  In PEACE I there was a basic movement to reopen Border roads but rather than examining big ticket items, perhaps we should seek to develop local road infrastructure, which can lead to local businesses to develop and thrive.  That has not been done.  The straight road between Newry and Enniskillen goes through Monaghan town but the road has not been developed in 20 years.  I do not see any push from Departments in the South to do anything about that.  The Minister of State referred to the development of an all-Ireland policy and as part of that we must consider the basic areas that have been totally neglected.</p><p>  There is a real issue for hauliers in the Republic of Ireland because of transport networks.  The UK is to introduce a system of taxation for foreign vehicles and there will be a major effect for Donegal hauliers or people from the Republic bringing goods and services into the area if a tariff must be paid going through Tyrone.  If I want to go to Cavan or Dundalk from Monaghan, I must go through Fermanagh or Armagh, so there should be a derogation applying to these routes to ensure hauliers are not penalised when taking products from one county to the next.</p><p>  These are fundamental issues to be addressed by this Government with the UK Government to ensure there can be economic benefits for people living along the Border.  We must ensure this peace process does not pass us by or be seen as a Dublin or Belfast issue rather than something for the people along the Border.  The issue must be addressed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and others.  That should happen sooner rather than later.  If we can deal effectively with these issues now rather than leaving them on the long finger because we are concerned with big ticket items, we would do more to advance and develop reconciliation along the Border.  When people trade and can see economic benefit from the political process, they will buy into it completely.  Along the Border we must see tangible benefits from the process, so the basics must be considered before we move to major projects.</p></speech>

When Deputy Smith contributed he stated he would be brief as there were a number of areas and forums in which he could engage.  I apologise for not being as brief as we do not have the engagement and forums like this to discuss issues and what we have is not what I would like it to be.  I have been an MP for over ten years and my relationship with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been best when I have had the mobile telephone numbers of senior officials to whom I can speak, particularly at the weekends and evenings, when there are events in my constituency that require intervention or a contribution from the Department.  Much work needs to be done with Northern representatives to develop relationships and have a point of contact.  I have often been frustrated when constituents find themselves in difficulty in Australia or America, for example, but where I have insufficient means of contact with authorities.  I would like to see us considering that process and how we can engage best.  Is there a point of contact for Northern representatives and can we speak to somebody to resolve such issues expediently?</p><p>  There are outstanding issues and my committee colleagues have listed a number of them.  From a constituency perspective, I am interested in the road to Sligo, the Ulster Canal and the A5 road.  I do not disagree with the comments of Deputies Smith and Conlan and certain issues must be moved forward for the development of all our people in the northern part of the island, regardless of the side of the Border on which people live.</p><p>  Like Deputy Conlan, I can get frustrated as there is much potential for cross-Border work.  The opportunities are significant in the health area.  My party colleague, Ms Bairbre de Br&uacute;n, MLA, as Health Minister implemented much work in the North-South process.  The health items on the cl&aacute;r of the North-South Ministerial Council may look impressive but there is much more that can and should be done.  It is a fundamental issue along Border counties and we must help to sustain a quality health service in the North of the Ireland.</p><p>  A major conference was organised by the Centre for Cross-Border Studies a couple of weeks ago which examined a proposed Border development zone that would increase investment in the region, allowing for greater flexibility and work for the communities along both sides of the Border.  Is consideration being given to that and how does the Irish Government expect to view that proposal?  I also agree with Deputy Conlan's comments regarding the heavy goods vehicle levy, which is absolutely ridiculous.  It is a bit like the quarry tax as Westminster is introducing levies intended primarily for England and Wales, primarily, with Scotland tagged on, and we are not featured at all.  As a republican, I am not too concerned about that but there is an impact on businesses in the North.  The levy will create huge difficulties for logistics companies on the island.  I know a levy for the South has also been considered but if there are two separate levies, there should be a derogation for trade North and South.</p><p>  Deputy Smith mentioned the bill of rights and I have written to the British Government about that.  I am very concerned that 15 years after the Good Friday Agreement, a bill of rights has not been progressed.  There is also the issue of the undocumented.  I attended a launch in Donegal at the weekend where this was raised but the issue is frequently aired.  Families are separated because a person is living, working and having a family in America but cannot return for a funeral, wedding or to maintain family relationships.  That is tragic.  We all probably have relations effectively trapped abroad because they cannot get home so there is a real human rights issue involved.</p><p>  I would like to hear more about reconciliation funding.  I am not sure if the Minister of State is aware of the work of Fermanagh Trust on shared education.  I do not want to go on too long but there is a school in Fermanagh that a few years ago saw protests about having a Catholic dinner lady.  As a result of shared education it is now working co-operatively with the local Catholic school.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-26a.997" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014022600006#E00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his presentation.  A number of aspects of it stand out.  He spoke about economic sustainability.  Obviously, an alarming number of young people in the Six Counties and in the Twenty-six Counties are unemployed.  If people can work together for the common good as part of an all-Ireland economy, that will play a central part in building peace and reconciliation and developing long-term peace.</p><p>  As both Governments are co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, they are obliged to deliver agreement on issues like the past, parades and flags, and the Haass report.  How do they propose to proceed, given that the efforts of Dr. Haass have not been successful to date?  It must be stressed that at least 90% of the people on the island of Ireland were very supportive of his efforts to try to reach agreement.  Clearly, his initiative was resisted by sections of the Unionist parties.  How does the Government hope to bring about a successful conclusion to this process?</p><p>  Dealing with the past, with the legacies of the conflict, is a big part of reconciliation.  As an island, we have done very well to get an acceptable police force in the Six Counties.  That seemed to be impossible at one stage but was achieved by democratising the workings of the entire police system and establishing various policing boards and authorities.  Perhaps this jurisdiction could learn from the work that has been done in the North with regard to accountability.  I refer to the work of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, for example.  We do not want to lose any of this.  Reconciliation cannot come about unless people are able to deal with the past.  The future can be shaped as a consequence of dealing with the past.  It does not appear that serious efforts are being made to bring about that.</p><p>  The Minister of State referred to "creating a sustainable peace and [providing] the mechanism to develop a strong all-island economy".  How does he hope to do that?  What role will the Irish Government play in that regard?  I understand that a number of initiatives which were taking place did not stand the test of time.  They were successful in the short term but they were not followed up.  When cross-Border economic initiatives are being pursued, it is essential for them to be sustainable.  How does the Government hope to bring about that sustainability?</p></speech>

I will not delay the meeting.  Deputations have to come to this forum to discuss issues like the development of the A5 and the construction of Narrow Water Bridge.  The failure to complete the Narrow Water Bridge project is devastating.  There was a feeling in every party that it would be done.  It was seen as a new dawn for tourism in the area in question.  It was also relevant to North-South relations.  I certainly thought it should be completed.  If there was a shortfall that could have been addressed by the two Governments, as some of my colleagues have suggested, I think it is something we should revisit in the short term.</p><p>  It is imperative that we revisit the funding of the various organisations in the North to determine what is the best format for the provision of funding.  I have found during visits with this committee and with the Labour Party that these initiatives form the basis for keeping many communities together.  I appreciate that some people raise questions about the projects that are getting funding.  Ultimately, the development of communications and contacts between North and South is all about generating positivity in the communities and ensuring that positivity is used to make both sides of the Border better places in which to live.</p><p>  The SDLP made a presentation to us regarding the Civic Forum for Northern Ireland.  It was supported by Sinn F&eacute;in.  This is another example of an important initiative, which involved people of all parties and none, meeting a dead end.  I suggest that the forum could be used by people from all communities in Northern Ireland who are interested in improving their facilities.  It should be reconsidered by the North-South groups, perhaps on foot of ministerial intervention.</p><p>  I would like to speak about the Haass proposals.  We met those involved.  It seemed that good progress was going to be made, but it suddenly transpired at the last hurdle that this was not possible.  It appears that the leaders of all the political parties are still working on this.  I hope that will continue to the point where an attempt can be made to ascertain whether Dr. Haass is prepared to come back for a final meeting with all the groups.  Now that there is some positivity about this matter, we should not lose the opportunity to make progress.  We should ask all the parties to continue their work in this regard.</p><p>  Deputy Ferris spoke about the economy, which is the life blood of people on both sides of the Border.  We must continue to develop all aspects of the economy.  I have said on many occasions that the extent of educational opportunity in some parts of the North is very poor.  Many people have significant concerns about what is available to the Unionist or Protestant community.  Many of the people from that community who obtain educational honours at third level do not seem to believe in their own economy or their own community.</p></speech>

There are a number of issues.  Looking at the television, I know what they are talking about in respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, policing and so on.  When the Good Friday Agreement came about, it was supposed to be something that was not just set in stone, but something organic that would grow and that we would learn from best practice.  I know there are proposals relating to looking at changes relating to GSOC and so on.  This controversy has highlighted the fact that there are inadequacies on both sides of the Border in respect of the structures that are there.  We can learn from each other.  In particular, former Ombudsmen from Northern Ireland have spoken about the powers of investigation and so on.  We have heard from the Victims' Commissioner who not only spoke about the difficulties she experienced in dealing with the past, but about the difficulties experienced by the victims themselves.  Victims from the South told us that in order to move their cases forward, they had to go through the Victims' Commissioner in Northern Ireland.  They are also saying that there was nothing similar to the historical inquiries team and no mechanism for families to move that on.  If we are looking at this package, we need to look at what is working and what is not working in both jurisdictions.  Those were the original ideas we had in respect of the Good Friday Agreement and how it would evolve.</p><p>  I welcome the news regarding the economy.  We try to sell it and agriculture on an all-Ireland basis.  There are ways in which we can develop that and we should go through that.  People have talked about the undocumented Irish.  There was a delegation from the Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  At that time, there was also interest from some Unionists and Nationalists in Northern Ireland.  The undocumented Irish is an all-Ireland problem.  One is not asked whether one is from the North or the South.  Perhaps that is another area for co-operation.  We will probably get one more bite of this and it would be helpful.  The Unionists would have some insight into those from a Scots Unionist background in respect of talking to some of those Congressmen and Senators, which might be helpful.</p><p>  The HGV issue was mentioned.  An anomaly has arisen recently in respect of the new licensing system.  I do not know if it has come across the Minister of State's desk and I do not expect an answer but he might put it in the mix.  If someone is born in Northern Ireland, they have two choices.  They can put down that they were born in the United Kingdom, which many Nationalists would have difficulties with.  The other option is to put down that they were born in Northern Ireland.  There is no option of stating that they were born in Ireland.  It may seem to be a silly thing but families I know who had to leave Northern Ireland because of sectarianism and difficulties do not see themselves as being from Northern Ireland or the UK.  They see themselves as Irish.  Again, the Good Friday Agreement was to look at that.  It is anomaly that perhaps that came out of the new regulations relating to border controls and might have come from the EU but I am asking if the Government can look at that.</p><p>  In respect of funding for advocacy groups for victims, we are familiar with Justice For the Forgotten.  Both of us have attended meetings over the meetings.  The anomaly relating to whether one is from the Border region or Belfast could be looked at.  When we were developing this, I do not think this anomaly was the way things were going to develop.  A total of 17 people have been classified as disappeared.  Again, if we are talking in terms of anomalies and disparities in the system, one of those disappeared, Seamus Ruddy, was believed to be disappeared in France.  Again, his family were treated differently from other families in respect of supports.  That would shock many people and is something that possibly the two Governments could look at.  I know there was a request for funding from the Ball and Parry families but, again, it was outside the parameters of that funding.  I do not think any of those groups which are working for peace and reconciliation but are also looking to work with victims' groups should be left out of the equation.</p><p>  People have spoken about the Narrow Water Bridge.  The T&aacute;naiste appeared before the Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade which asked him about the consultative forum.  He indicated that some energy would be put in to try to get agreement.  What steps are being taken by the Irish and British Governments to convene that forum?</p></speech>

I was at another meeting.  I also want to add my voice to the disappointment felt over Narrow Water Bridge.  As somebody who comes from the area, it was certainly something the people of Louth, Armagh and the surrounding areas looked forward to for years.  We thought we had it within our grasp.  We talk about the possibilities of revisiting it.  The debacle over funding is a significant issue.  Are there plans to revisit it and, if so, what are they?  Could the Minister of State expand on that?</p><p>  I have raised the issue of penalty points North and South here a couple of times.  I was disappointed on Sunday to hear the announcement that the plans to ensure that people who received penalty points either side of the Border would carry them into their own jurisdiction have been halted.  Could the Minister of State expand on it?  I am somebody who drives up and down the M1 every day of the week.  I am not taking it against Northern drivers but when one is out of one's jurisdiction, one certainly sees many more speeding Northern cars going up and down that motorway.  When one knows that one can do it and not be caught speeding or that garda&iacute; will not check one on checkpoints, the temptation is-----</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State.  This is a very important committee.  Other committees such as the Committee of Public Accounts or the finance or agriculture committees may be regarded by some in the Oireachtas as being very important but in my view this committee is by far the most important, given that it frames what happens on the island of Ireland.  The progress of events in the past 20 years has been incredible when one remembers what both sides of the Border on the island of Ireland had to endure and how people have overcome such difficulties.  We are in a much better place now.</p><p>  Last Monday, a number of Fine Gael Oireachtas Members went to Stormont, on their own initiative, in order to build links.  We attended a dinner with major business leaders and members of all the political parties as well as the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.  Peter Robinson said that we can talk about the political situation but I think we have got over that, so to speak.  I do not think the DUP or the other parties regard politicians coming to visit as an issue now.  As politicians, we need to begin to reach out socially rather than politically because that is how things happen.  I refer to the North-South parliamentary forum and the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and various agencies and infrastructure but in my view, visits such as last week's visit facilitate social exchange and off-the-record conversations build friendships which it is hoped will last for the good of everyone.</p><p>  I have been to the Newtownards Road and I have met former combatants and dissident IRA prisoners.  I have visited Marian Price in hospital and I am delighted that she was released, which was the right thing to do.  These issues should have been addressed much earlier.</p><p>  I refer to some issues outstanding such as the Irish language and the bill of rights which need to be addressed and this committee can play a significant role in addressing them.  I have said publicly and in this committee that we have no interaction with loyalist and Unionist MPs.  This is an important committee.  I commend the SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in MLAs who have attended our meetings and made valuable contributions.  However, absence has created a void which we should not ignore.  We may need to send out the message that it would be helpful to the loyalist and Unionist community but also it would be helpful to this committee and of benefit to the Good Friday Agreement to have some involvement and interaction with them and to hear their views.</p><p>  We need education about our past and where we come from.  When I visited the Newtownards Road last Monday, I was conscious that nearly 100 years ago my grandfather was tried in a Belfast court in 1919 and was imprisoned in the Curragh.  He was from the republican tradition and a Sinn F&eacute;in councillor and he went on hunger strike.  He joined the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the foundation of the State.  At that time, tens of thousands of young men were involved in the Ulster Volunteers and were marching, mobilising, training and arming themselves to fight against home rule while my grandfather was involved in the Irish Volunteers of which there were 200,000.  They were training, mobilising and arming themselves to push for home rule.  The historian, Roy Foster, said that if the First World War had not broken out, there would have been some terrible bloodshed on the island of Ireland.  I come from Boyle, a town of 3,500 people and 126 young men from that town died in the First World War.  History is written by the victors and we air-brushed those young men out of our lives and out of our history.  I will wear the poppy because these young men came from a Nationalist tradition and they should be remembered.  The poppy should not be the preserve of militant unionism, nor should the lily be the preserve of militant nationalism.  I can respect the 126 young men from my town or the 50,000 young men from the island of Ireland by wearing something in remembrance of their sacrifice.  Equally, as democratic Nationalists we should not be afraid to wear the lily to remember the men of 1916.</p><p>  Let us not talk about the political structures because they are there to stay.  Our work is to build up cross-Border and cross-community links through education.  For some politicians in Cork and in other parts of the country, the North might as well be as far as Roscommon because that is as far as they have travelled.  The same applies to people in Northern Ireland.  We must try to encourage much more co-operation.  We should not be afraid of anybody nor should we dwell on our history - although we should remember it - and we need to move forward.</p></speech>

He will have noted that brevity is alien to this committee but it reflects the enthusiasm and commitment of the members and shows their personal interest in North-South relations.  I commend all members on their ongoing personal interest in the work and their endeavours through their party structures.  The interest and enthusiasm is a reflection of the current situation in Northern Ireland which has become a changed place.  I agree there are challenges such as legacy issues.  This committee visited Derry which is a changed place.  The Minister of State will know this from his interest in Derry.  I refer to the legacy of the Fleadh Cheoil and the city of culture events which have made Derry a changed place.  It was a privilege and delight to be there as a member of this committee, to hear about the success of the events of 2013.  People were also talking about the future.  This committee wants to be part of that change but not because we want to make ourselves feel good.  Deputy Martin Ferris summed it up that people need to see the economic dividend of the peace process, not just symbolic projects such as the Narrow Water bridge and the A5 road.  We know the economic dividends which these major projects bring to that part of the island.  I acknowledge the Minister of State's reflection about the North-South Ministerial Council's change in focus and direction to look specifically at economic projects.  The north-west gateway is firmly back on the agenda.  As noted during our trip to Derry this agenda is not exclusive to one city but it will include the entire region and a widespread population.</p><p>  The Minister of State is under time pressure.</p></speech>

It would take a long time to reply to each in detail, but many were pertinent and I will answer as many as I can in a short space of time.  A number of themes came through and several members mentioned similar issues of concern, for example, the Narrow Water Bridge project.  Everyone present was enthusiastic for it.  Unfortunately, EU funding for it has been withdrawn.  Deputy Smith mentioned the various difficulties encountered in matching the funding.  As a result, the focus now is on ensuring that the approximately &euro;18 million that was forthcoming goes to other projects.  It should not be lost even though this particular project is in abeyance.  We will endeavour to put the project back on the agenda because it is a desirable one, as mentioned by a number of Deputies and Senator Moran, but the current deadlines have been missed and we can do nothing about that.  It is the Government's intention to work with colleagues in the Executive to that end.  The T&aacute;naiste confirmed this at his meeting with the First and Deputy First Ministers on 10 January 2014.  There will undoubtedly be disappointment on the Louth-Down border in particular, but also in other areas along the Border.  Nevertheless, funding will continue to be available.</p><p>  The Chairman, Deputy Smith and others mentioned the A5 project.  Its funding continues.  The Government and the Northern Ireland Executive have confirmed their commitment to the scheme and the Government has reaffirmed its funding commitment of &euro;25 million per annum in 2015 and 2016.  It is a question of moving ahead.  There was a judicial decision in Northern Ireland regarding the A5 and environmental reviews must be completed before the project can proceed.  In that regard, I was glad to note the recent statement of the Minister for Regional Development, Mr. Danny Kennedy, MLA, to the Northern Ireland Assembly that his Department was on schedule to commence public consultations in April.  Since some of the obstacles have been overcome and the Republic is on a better financial footing, we would like to see that project moving ahead more rapidly.  Opening up the gateway to the north west has been mentioned.  The area of Donegal, Deputy Feighan's Roscommon and my native county of Sligo has cross-Border involvements with Fermanagh and so on and has a large Unionist population.  It is important that it be opened up economically and politically.  As such, I would like to see the A5 scheme continue.</p><p>  Deputy Smith mentioned a bill of rights.  It is a commitment under the Good Friday Agreement that has not been fulfilled.  Everyone North and South would like to see progress being made.  The T&aacute;naiste has made the views of the Government clear to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and will continue raising the issue in his discussions with her and the First and Deputy First Ministers.  I welcome the fact that the bill of rights is one of the issues to be addressed by a commission on identity, culture and tradition as outlined in the proposals that emerged from the recent political talks.  There is widespread support from both sides of the community.</p><p>  The Deputy also referred to an Irish language Act.  One should be introduced in Northern Ireland.  All parties to the Good Friday Agreement recognised the importance of respect, understanding and tolerance in respect of linguistic diversity.  I welcome that the Irish language is one of the issues to be addressed by the commission on identity, culture and tradition.  We are looking forward to seeing progress on that front.</p><p>  This brings me to the recent Haass talks and how progress on them may be achieved, which every member referred to in one way or another.  Intensive negotiations are still under way.  Only yesterday, there was a meeting of the leaders of the political parties regarding the talks.  They are anxious to make progress.  There will be a further meeting next week, after which we will move on to the St. Patrick's Day events in Washington.  Within this debate fall all of the relevant issues, for example, parades, flags and other legacy issues.  This work is key to moving forward.  Much progress has been made under the Haass talks and there is a great deal of agreement on a number of matters.  This is the framework under which we hope progress can continue.</p><p>  This work emanates from the Northern Ireland Executive in the first instance.  Unlike the Good Friday Agreement, which was brokered by outside interests and bodies, the work following the talks will be brokered within the framework of Northern Ireland and the parties represented on its Executive.  A satisfactory conclusion is important.  Our Government and the Government of the United Kingdom are special interest actors in this respect, but we want the initiative to come from within Northern Ireland.  We are hopeful that progress will be made.</p><p>  We support the Haass proposals on a code of conduct, as mentioned by a number of members following Deputy Smith's raising of it initially.  He stated that he only had a couple of items to raise, but he-----</p></speech>

He would like to see it addressed.</p><p>  Deputy Smith referred to immigration reform.  The Taoiseach and the Ministers will take every opportunity to advance this work.  The T&aacute;naiste was recently in ongoing contact with Congressman Paul Ryan.  People on all sides of the political divide agree that this is a major priority.  We are anxious to make progress on it as quickly as possible.</p><p>  Deputy Conlan raised a number of issues.  With others, he mentioned the heavy goods vehicle, HGV, levy, which will be introduced across the UK from 1 April.  Naturally, we are concerned that it may impact on cross-Border trade and all areas within the Border region.  A number of representations were made by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, who has taken the lead on this issue.  Several roads that criss-cross the Border - parts of the A37 and the A3 - are being exempted from the levy.  We will continue to pursue additional exemptions, including for the A5, given the Irish Government's financial commitment to its upgrade.  We are anxious to ensure that the levy is not dealt with in the way outlined by Ms Gildernew, that is, it is discussed in the broader UK, but its application to Scotland and Northern Ireland is an afterthought, and that it not interfere in any way with cross-Border trade and co-operation between the two jurisdictions.</p></speech>

The Minister recommends that Ireland exercise its discretion to opt in to this measure, which concerns temporarily moving the seat of CEPOL from Bramshill in the United Kingdom to Budapest in Hungary until a long-term solution for the future of the agency is found.  This is a technical amendment to the CEPOL regulation to amend the name of the location from Bramshill in the UK to Budapest.  There are no difficulties or significant implications of the amendment from an Irish perspective.  Ireland submitted an application to host the seat along with six other countries.  The matter was voted on at a JHA meeting of Ministers in October.  Ireland is supportive of the decision to locate the college in Budapest.</p><p>  Hungary is covering a number of costs including cleaning and public utilities which were previously borne by the EU.  The permanent location of the seat forms part of discussions on a new Europol regulation in which the Commission seeks to co-locate the agency with Europol in the Hague.  These discussions are ongoing.  I recommend the matter to the committee.</p></speech>

Members will recall that the committee invited written submissions on this topic.  Each group will be invited to make an opening statement of approximately five minutes.  This will be followed by a question and answer session.  I ask everybody to turn off their mobile phones.  Silent or flight mode is not sufficient because it will interfere with the recording equipment.  If anybody says something interesting during such interference, it will not be broadcast in the media or anywhere else.  All phones should be turned off.</p><p>  On behalf of the committee, I am pleased to welcome Ms Caroline Counihan of Rape Crisis Network Ireland, Ms Sarah Benson of Ruhama, Ms Laura Pohjolainen of the Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre, Ms Maire Mulcahy of the women's committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Ms Ellen O'Malley-Dunlop of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, Dr. Teresa Whitaker of Sex Workers Alliance Ireland, Ms Lucy Smith of Ugly Mugs, Ms Felicity Kennedy of the Women's Therapy Centre, Ms Siobhan Barron of the National Disability Authority, Ms Fiona Hurley of Nasc and Ms Rita Harling of the Do or Die Foundation.  They are all very welcome.</p><p>  Before we begin, I want to draw the attention of all witnesses to the situation in relation to privilege.  I ask them to note that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  The purpose of this meeting is to assist the committee in bringing recommendations to the Government with respect to sexual and domestic violence.  We are not going beyond that remit.  If people talk about something else, I will bring them back to the subject of this meeting.  I want to keep it focused.  I invite the witnesses to speak for five minutes each.  We will be as tight as we can on the time.  I ask witnesses to bring up any salient points they want to make about sexual and domestic violence in Ireland.  We want to focus on remedies.  We know the problems.  We know there are issues.  We want to hear any ideas the witnesses might have about what the Government, the committee and the Oireachtas can do to remedy and address these issues.  We need to prevent this from happening in the first place, if we can at all.  I ask witnesses to focus on that.</p><p>  After the opening statements, we will have a question and answer session.  I will explain how that will work.  The first person who arrived in will be invited to spend five minutes asking questions and getting answers.  That is how we work it.  The next person who came in will then have five minutes to ask questions and get answers.  I do not want speeches from members.  We can have speeches in the Houses.  I want questions.  Members should be trying to get information from the witnesses.  That is what we are looking for because time is very tight.  I ask Ms Caroline Counihan of Rape Crisis Network Ireland to make the first presentation.  She has five minutes.</p></speech>

It is our contention that in order to reduce attrition rates, improvements in victims' experiences are vital for the justice system.  Given the remit of this committee, we will focus today on the engagement of rape victims with the justice system.  It is clear that if there is to be a credible Government response to the pervasiveness of sexual violence, there will have to be a much broader focus than a concentration on the justice system.  Approximately 30% of rape crisis survivors decide to make a formal complaint to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  By working side by side with these survivors, we build our knowledge about the positive changes that would enable more survivors of rape and other crimes of sexual violence to make and maintain complaints.  Some of the relevant services we provide to survivors include specialist accompaniment services from trained volunteers who accompany survivors to sexual assault treatment units, Garda appointments and court proceedings.  Rape Crisis Network Ireland provides legal information on its help website and has published a guide to the legal process for survivors.  Legal advice and support are made available to survivors, staff and volunteers from the network's legal director.</p><p>  The experiences of our clients as they go through the criminal justice system inform and direct us in our legal advocacy work.  We have published a number of detailed policy papers and submissions on various legal topics.  If the criminal justice system experience becomes less daunting for survivors, attrition rates are likely to fall.  As a consequence, reporting and - eventually - conviction rates will rise.  This is important from a prevention or public policy viewpoint.  The need to reduce, as far as possible, the risk that survivors will be retraumatised as they progress through the criminal justice process is at least as important.  Organisations involved in the rape crisis sector, including Rape Crisis Network Ireland, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, Ruhama and the National Disability Authority, have been campaigning for over 40 years for the reform of the justice system as it relates to sexual violence.</p></speech>

Ruhama is a long standing member of the national steering committee on violence against women we regard our  own operations as directly working to combat violence against women through front line engagement with and support and advocacy on behalf of women affected by prostitution.  From Ruhama's perspective, prostitution constitutes violence against women and is a fundamental violation of women's and girls' human rights.  Prostitution is inherently harmful and abusive.  It violates the human dignity and integrity guaranteed to all in the UN Declaration on Human Rights 1949.</p><p>  Whether consciously or not, some people consider prostitution to be a reasonable choice for a particular sector or class of women.  Prostitution is somehow acceptable for poor women, vulnerable women, indigenous women, women of colour, of different race, instead of being seen as sexual exploitation and a human rights violation.  If this view is accepted, it is a toleration of the creation of a separate, expendable, throwaway class of women.  Intrinsic to prostitution are numerous violations of human rights: sexual harassment, economic servitude, educational deprivation, partner and family violence, racism, class issues, vulnerability to frequent physical and sexual assault, degrading treatment, trafficking and child abuse.  While the number of boys and men prostitution is small, women and girls represent the overwhelming majority of those bought and sold in the sex trade.  Prostitution is not an isolated individual act; it part of an organised system, which feeds on abuse, distress, vulnerability and inequality.  Obviously not all women in poverty or drug addiction or who have been abused, become ensnared in prostitution.  However, it is clear that both the risk and reality of prostitution for millions of women and girls internationally are closely connected with other forms of gender-based violence and can be said to be a direct consequence of gender inequality.  This understanding of prostitution is also supported by a vast amount of research both nationally and internationally.  It is a view borne out in numerous international conventions, plans and resolutions which are highlighted in our written submission to the committee. </p><p>  The starting position that prostitution is a form of gender-based violence is fundamental to achieving an effective and meaningful response.  Such a response must target three areas.  Prevention means stopping vulnerable women and girls from being drawn into prostitution; protection involves practical supports for those in prostitution; an exit strategy to explore and facilitate opportunities for those wishing to leave.  Some activists and feminists well as organisations supported by the sex trade, argue that prostitution <i>per se</i> should be exempted from the category of human rights violations.  They propose that instead of seeing prostitution as a human rights violation, the assumption should be that prostitution is a human right, a right of a woman to do what she wants with her body.  Prostitution in this argument is constructed as sex work and it is proposed that all aspects of prostitution, soliciting, selling, buying and pimping, be decriminalised. </p><p>  Ruhama contends that countries that have tried to regulate or decriminalise the sex trade have been shown to have failed on the key objectives for which regulation was introduced in the first place, such as reducing stigma, violence or harm to those in prostitution.  Regulated and decriminalised environments create a huge increase in not only the regulated but also but also the illegal trade, proportionately increasing sex trafficking and effectively removing much of the already limited power the prostituted woman or girl, by conferring it on pimps and organisers who are legitimised and transformed into businessmen.  Countries that have taken this approach also fail to give any meaningful consideration or resourcing to either prevention or exiting supports for those at risk of or in prostitution.  This is because viewing prostitution as simply work helps to keep women in prostitution, whereas viewing prostitution as a violation of women's human rights helps keep women and girls out of prostitution.  Ruhama recommends the following measures as a minimum response in Ireland, which we believe are congruent with a positive action against domestic and sexual violence and also with the committee's separate recommendations on Ireland's prostitution laws.  It is timely to note that just this morning, the European Parliament voted a landmark resolution confirming all forms of prostitution as violence against women, a human rights abuse and incompatible with the charter of fundamental rights.  It called on member states to consider the Nordic model.  </p><p>  Ruhama recommends naming prostitution as a form of violence against women and girls in the national action plan on domestic, sexual and gender based violence and in policies and actions that may devolve from this plan; a recognition of the need for and resourcing of supports to those trapped in prostitution as vulnerable persons; recognition and resourcing of targeted interventions to high risk groups, specifically, minors in residential care settings or in receipt of social interventions due to neglect, abuse or at-risk behaviours.  Grooming is still not an offence in this jurisdiction and this is one of the most common mechanisms for the exploitation of minors into prostitution; resourcing of preventative programmes, including education and awareness programmes on domestic and sexual violence in schools and colleges that explicitly incorporate the issue prostitution as a form of violence against, and a risk to, women and girls; legislative measures to ensure that those in prostitution are not criminalised but which target the sex buyer and others who are the source of demand for the exploitation of prostitution; awareness-raising programmes to educate boys and men about the harm of prostitution and to challenge perceptions of entitlement to buy sex, including targeting sex buyers as a part of any programmes on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.</p></speech>

ICTU's women's committee comprises representatives of 47 affiliates, with a combined membership of more than 778,000 people, some 52% of ICTU's membership.</p><p>  One of ICTU's fundamental values is the right of every citizen to live and work without fear and intimidation.  Our summary document, which we forwarded last week, opened with an inventory of horror.  We have been encouraged not to repeat the data, which are available, but three or four points merit repetition - 14,792 is the number of incidents of domestic violence disclosed to the Women's Aid national freefone service in 2012; 194 is the number of women murdered in the Republic since 1996, 119 of whom were killed in their own homes and, of the 142 murder cases where the perpetrators were noted, 75 women or 53% were killed by a partner or ex-partner; 7,797 is the number of women who received support from domestic violence services, an increase of 3.5% since 2010; 3,066 is the number of children who received support; and 322 is the shortfall in refuge places using the Council Of Europe's recommended ratio of one refuge to 10,000 people, given the fact that Ireland has only 136 refuges.</p><p>  In this context, ICTU has made recommendations concerning what needs to be done in the workplace, in law and in State policy and services.  We advocate an employer-union policy statement that has clear aims and commits the organisation to treat domestic abuse seriously.  A statement from an employer is a powerful message.  Such a policy could include a recognition that the health of the employee is the employer's paramount concern.  It could also include training for HR or employee welfare staff.  It should identify detailed support services and could provide time off as necessary for employees to avail of and organise medical assistance, legal advice and rehousing arrangements, extended paid leave and job security for employees attempting to escape domestic abuse and offer the possibility of a transfer where applicable and appropriate.  The policy would also involve the creation of employee assistance schemes that named and identified domestic and sexual violence as matters that fall within their remit and effective policies against discrimination and sexual harassment.</p><p>  We call on the relevant Departments to invest in and develop comprehensive education programmes that increase young people's understanding of the effects of violence and how it undermines gender equality and human dignity.  Programmes should be developed to encourage men and boys to become active and strategic partners and allies in the prevention and elimination of all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls.  There should be an increase in funding from Cosc to extend the worthwhile White Ribbon and Man-Up campaigns with which we have worked.  HSE funding should be maintained for the Men Ending Domestic Violence, MEND, initiative, which includes some rehabilitative work with perpetrators.  The Government should also legislate as per the recommendation of the Oireachtas committee to criminalise the purchase of sex.</p></speech>

The centre has operated as a front-line service for victims of rape, sexual assault and childhood sexual abuse since the 1970s.  Our submission addresses four areas in which we believe change is necessary, those being, the disclosure of counselling and psychotherapy notes in the criminal justice system; the need for a definition of consent in the proposed new legislation; that non-exploitative sexual expression between young people is decriminalised by reference to a close age difference; and that the age of consent of sexual activity be retained at 17 years.</p><p>  Regarding the disclosure of counselling and psychotherapy notes, the committee knows from our detailed submission that substantial work has been done with the support of the Public Interest Law Alliance, PILA, which provides a comprehensive overview of the procedures governing the disclosure and production of records in other common law jurisdictions, including Western Australia and Canada.</p><p>  The DRCC's position is that counselling and psychotherapy notes have no place in the criminal justice system.  Client notes reflect the work and healing space between therapist and client and, as such, reflect the internal world of the client.  The notes should remain confidential to maintain the integrity and healing potential of that process.  However, we also accept that there are a small number of necessary limitations to confidentiality, for example, if there is a threat to a person's life or if there is a child protection issue.</p><p>  Until recently, the DRCC's policy was not to hand over client notes when requested by the criminal justice system.  However, what happened in reality was quite different.  When a client gave his or her permission to have his or her therapy notes disclosed and when subpoenaed by the judge, the DRCC handed over the notes.  This policy was resulting in further trauma to our clients.</p></speech>

The head of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, stated: "Stop persecuting sex workers".  The United Nations Special Rights Rapporteur to the Human Rights Council, Mr. Anand Grover, recommended the repealing of laws criminalising sex work and practices surrounding it.</p><p>  The question is whether we want a society where sex workers are persecuted and socially excluded or a society where sex workers are socially included and respected.  The UNAIDS compiled a briefing note in recent weeks entitled The Legal Status of Sex Work: Key Human Rights and Public Health Considerations.  Its main points are that sex work should not be conflated with human trafficking and that criminalisation of sex workers or their clients negates the right to individual self-determination, autonomy and agency.</p><p>  Human rights bodies have called for the decriminalisation of sex work.  They argue that the Nordic model of criminalising clients of sex workers raises serious concerns because it drives sex work further underground into the hands of criminals, increases societal disapproval, increases stigma against sex workers, and we know all about stigma in Irish society.  We know the way gay people and Travellers were stigmatised historically.  There are many out groups in Irish society.  Sex workers are one of those out groups.  If we criminalise the buyers of sexual services it means this group will be stigmatised, they are sitting ducks and it makes them targets of people who want to beat up or murder sex workers or treat them in a violent manner.</p><p>  We know that the criminalisation of sex work has not worked in Sweden.   We know that trafficking and prostitution still exist in Sweden but it has been driven further underground.  That has happened in Norway also.  The stigma around sex work, societal disapproval and violence against sex workers have increased.  The sex workers are afraid to report it to the police or to draw attention to themselves, in other words, they are now a more socially excluded group than they were before the law was enacted.</p><p>  We have a number of recommendations, including that the Government should not introduce a law that would criminalise the buyers of sexual services.  Such a law as seen in Sweden and Norway has negative consequences for sex workers.  We also recommend that the law be amended to exempt premises shared by sex workers, with no third party involvement, from the definition of a brothel to ensure that sex workers can work together to increase their safety; and that a new non-judgmental sex work project should be established.  If the Government is serious about supporting and protecting sex workers it should establish a new sex worker project, in collaboration with sex workers, that would address their physical and psychological health and welfare needs.  We also recommend that the Garda should work in partnership with local drug and specialist sex work agencies to develop strategies to reduce the risk of violence against sex workers; that the Garda would receive training in this area and that they be resourced to introduce an Ugly Mugs scheme in cities where there is known commercial sexual activity similar to what has taken place in Liverpool, in Merseyside; that all current and future policy and research be conducted with sex workers from across the range of opinion - those who wish to exit to those who intend to remain in this work; and that crimes against sex workers should be categorised as hate crimes.</p></speech>

The scheme improves the safety of sex workers and reduces crime committed against sex workers by bringing sex workers together to share information with each other about potential dangers.  It is a free service available to all sex workers.  It started out on the website<i> Escort-Ireland.com</i> and last year it became its own organisation, Safe IQ Limited.</p><p>  How it works is that when a sex worker encounters a bad person or other danger, they report it to Ugly Mugs.  Each incident reported is reviewed and a warning to all sex workers is then published.  This scheme enables sex workers to be aware, both of specific offenders and of more general offending trends, which greatly improves their safety.  It is a very successful scheme and that is because we have a great community of sex workers in Ireland.  Sex workers do not agree about everything but when it comes to safety, sex workers in Ireland really support each other.  This is vital in Ireland, as there are no other supports.</p><p>  Last year the Taoiseach stood in this building and delivered an historic State apology to the so called &quot;fallen women&quot; incarcerated in Magdalene laundries but that was an apology for the &quot;innocent&quot; women imprisoned alongside sex workers, the unmarried mothers, the girls suspected of promiscuity.  For sex workers, nothing has changed.  The very same religious orders that ran the Magdalene laundries continue to dominate over sex workers today and the State, the media and the NGO sector all collude in that situation continuing on as is.</p><p>  Ugly Mugs is highly used by sex workers.  More than 4,500 incidents have been reported to date, and more than 60,000 discussion posts or comments on incidents have been made by sex workers.  About half of reported incidents are crimes.  We record both crimes and other incidents that may not be crimes but which sex workers define as abuse.  Crimes include threats, robberies, assaults and rapes.  Sex work is not inherently abusive.  Currently most sex workers in Ireland are independent.  Most clients are not abusive in any way to sex workers.  It is not normal for sex workers to experience serious abuse but some sex workers do encounter serious abuse in the course of their work.  The reason for this is the stigma around sex work.  Ireland is a very hateful country towards sex workers and that has very damaging consequences.</p></speech>

There was no information given as to what had become of them.  What had become of those women at that point was that they had been stalked by the <i>Sunday World</i>.  Photographs of them in an undressed state had been taken pervertedly.  One lady's breast was on the front page of the <i>Sunday World</i> one week.  They were being prosecuted North and South for brothel-keeping.  That is what became of them but we never hear the truth of what becomes of these people.</p><p>  There is no independent research into sex work in Ireland.  All the independent research has come straight from the Magdalen laundry orders and it is this which allows the completely false picture of sex work to persist.  All the statistics have been discredited, including the statistic of an average age of 14 years.  The author of the study from which that statistic was used, Professor Melrose, has stated that it has been wrongly used by Turn Off the Red Light.  There have been wild claims about child prostitution.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has clarified that these statistics do not relate to children in prostitution.</p><p>  We must improve policing.  We must have Garda sex work liaison officers.  We must examine good practice with regard to sex work policing.  Policing is decidedly important in combatting abuse within the sex industry and sex trafficking.  We should be examining the Merseyside model.  We need to stop giving all the State funding for support to sex workers and sex trafficking victims to Ruhama.  The Magdalen laundries are very wealthy and they do not need this money.</p></speech>

My name is Felicity Kennedy.  I am CEO of the centre and I am also speaking somewhat as a practitioner, because I am a psychologist and a counsellor.</p><p>  The Women's Therapy Centre was formed six years ago.  We currently have 43 clients coming to us and 47 clients on a waiting list.  We were formed as a therapy centre for women, but what quickly began to happen was that women who had experienced and were recovering from experiences of domestic violence were coming to us.  At the moment, one third of those who come to us are referred by the domestic violence agencies, which are the agencies that provide support in the immediacy of the trauma of abuse.  Another third of our clients come to us via our website or through word of mouth, and they come for the same reason, which is to recover and go through psychotherapy - a kind of stage of safety, mourning and recovery from the experiences of abuse.  At this stage, six years later, we have developed a specialist knowledge on how to work with survivors of the trauma of domestic violence.  A mental health service like ours, which has developed a specialist knowledge, is a final part of a continuum of care in looking after those who have experienced domestic abuse.</p><p>  It is important to stress that those who do this work and who do the psychotherapy work need to have a specialist knowledge.  Without a specialist knowledge, there is a danger that people can be re-traumatised.  That comes up again and again in the research, and is known as the second trauma.  We view domestic violence and the impact of domestic violence as being what is increasingly called complex trauma.  This means that if somebody is experiencing the trauma of ongoing sexual abuse, such as physical assaults, psychological traumas and emotional traumas, and these are repeated by an abuser whose intent is to annihilate the self of the victim, then the psychological consequences are complex.</p></speech>

The NDA is an independent statutory body with responsibility for providing information and advice to the Minister that is relevant to the lives of persons with disabilities and promoting universal design in Ireland.  As outlined in the written submission to the joint committee, the NDA has undertaken research in the area of abuse and violence against people with disabilities.  We are a member of the national steering committee on violence against women, chaired by the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence, COSC.  The NDA wishes to highlight the following points on domestic and sexual violence against people with disabilities, drawing on NDA work to date.  There is a considerable body of evidence showing that, people with disabilities are at a higher risk of violence and abuse compared to others, and are more likely than others to have experienced multiple incidents of sexual violence.  Irish data shows that those with severely hampering disabilities are 2.9 times more likely to have experienced domestic and violent abuse than other adults.  Raising awareness and education about domestic violence and related issues are critical for improving the knowledge levels of people with disabilities considered most at risk in order to empower them in relationships while at the same time protecting them from violence and abuse.  Disclosure of abuse may be particularly difficult for persons with disabilities, especially where they are dependent on care and may feel less comfortable complaining, may have little contact with others or may have difficulty communicating.  Often, they feel they will not be taken seriously.</p><p>  In line with Government policy, as people with disabilities move out of institutions to living in the community, there is a need for a renewed focus on appropriate supports and protection in mainstream settings to prevent domestic and sexual violence against them, which is why we are delighted the committee has included disability in the discussion.  Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 needs to be reformed to widen the definition of what constitutes a sexual offence and to give clarity on consensual sexual relations between vulnerable adults where they have the capacity to consent to sexual relations.  Article 16 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, commits state parties to take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social, educational and other measures to protect persons with disabilities, within and outside the home, from all forms of exploitation, violence and abuse.  On ratifying the convention, Ireland will be required to fulfil this requirement.  </p><p>  We are pleased the focus of discussion is on solutions to address the issues raised.  As an advisory body, the NDA has undertaken research and has funded some of the research members heard about this morning.  The Rape Crisis Network of Ireland undertook research on sexual violence against persons with disabilities and specific barriers to disclosure.  Barriers include fear of being blamed, a fear of not being believed or a fear of the legal process, with almost 25% fearing loss of support if they come forward.  We also funded research by the School of Applied Social Studies and the Centre for Criminal Justice and Human Rights in University College Cork, which shows areas of the criminal justice system that need to be improved so that they are accessible to persons with disabilities and to ensure an understanding of disability.  The NDA continues to engage with other relevant bodies, as appropriate, to guide them on many of the issues that arise, including our engagement with COSC and those in the justice system generally in respect of access and awareness.  I thank committee members for their attention and I look forward to the discussion.</p></speech>

Nasc, the Irish Immigrant Support Centre, is a founding member of the domestic violence coalition, on whose behalf the Immigrant Council of Ireland presented last week, and we fully support and echo the recommendations made.  We welcome the opportunity to present to the committee on some additional points raised in our submission based on our 13 years of experience providing one-to-one support and advice to migrants on immigration-related issues.  Nasc is a non-governmental organisation working for an integrated society based on the principles of human rights, social justice and equality.  Nasc, which is the Irish word for link, works to link migrants to their rights through protecting human rights, promoting integration and campaigning for change.  Nasc provides immigration advice and advocacy to 1,000 migrants annually.</p><p>  Any person experiencing domestic violence can encounter difficulties in reporting incidents and in accessing support services and remedies.  Immigrants can face additional barriers, including language difficulties, social isolation, racism or discrimination, limited access to income or independence, uncertain immigration status and lack of knowledge regarding available supports or remedies.  These were discussed by the Immigrant Council of Ireland at hearings last week and we endorse the recommendations made.  We also have some recommendations of our own.</p><p>  Nasc has provided advocacy and support to 92 migrant victims of domestic violence since 2011, including on immigration and social welfare issues.  In 2012, Nasc co-authored a ground-breaking report on migrant access to social protection,entitled "Person or Number? Issues Faced by Migrants Accessing Social Protection".  Subsequently, the Department of Social Protection committed to re-examining access to social welfare in the cases of migrants affected by domestic violence.  Nasc is a lead organisation in the migrant consultative forum established by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, in the wake of the report, which regularly meets with the Department of Social Protection.  Nasc would like to see a similar commitment from the Department of Justice and Equality to engage with migrant NGOs and other interested parties on policies impacting on migrant communities.  In addition, Nasc recommends co-ordination between the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Social Protection in developing policies and regulations that protect migrant victims of domestic violence.</p><p>  In our experience, migrant victims of domestic violence can be particularly vulnerable when making a report to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On top of the trauma of experiencing domestic violence, there may be language and cultural barriers as well as concerns about immigration status.  We are concerned that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not fully cognisant of the particular issues that impact migrant victims and the specific needs they may have in seeking out the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  According to Department of Justice and Equality guidelines from the INIS, migrant victims of domestic violence whose residency is dependent on that of a violent partner can apply to gain independent residency.</p></speech>

We are a support group for families who are experiencing domestic violence in the home.  All genders can avail of our service.</p><p>  Domestic violence is a serious attack on a person's basic human rights, be they male or female.  This act of cruelty is most often not reported as it is still taboo.  It is still not recognised as a crime in our State.  This is unacceptable.  Domestic violence can lead to premature death and in some cases serious mental health issues.  The act of domestic violence does not only affect the victim but often the victim's children also, leaving them with mental scars and serious trust and relationship issues as they become adults.  Sadly some of them carry the same cruelty with them.  Domestic violence victims live their daily lives in fear for months, years and for some, decades.</p><p>  I have heard accounts of some unbelievable cases in which victims have been subjected to such cruelty that their injuries were broken jaws, broken ribs, broken limbs, stabbings and strangulation.  Some had their hair pulled, leaving them with bald patches, others lost their teeth, others were scarred by cigarettes being stubbed out on their skin.  The list goes on.  In the times in which we live these acts are bordering on the barbaric.  Statistics show at least one in four females will experience some level of domestic violence through their adult life.  It leaves the victim in a very life threatening situation.  This has proved to be a sad time for victims.  It has to end.  Until a person has lived through the experience of domestic violence, one will never understand the rules that apply to it.</p><p>  We at the Do or Die Foundation are urging the Government to implement a domestic violence abusers register.  In a time of great financial unrest it is vital that the register exists in order to protect families.  Financial pressure will also add to the rise in report of domestic violence stretching the resources of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  At present the Do or Die Foundation is liaising with local police stations to offer support if the Garda is presented with a victim of domestic abuse.  This will be done through a referral process and we are offering emotional support.  It has been reported that 70% of calls to Garda stations in the Dublin area originate in domestic violence.  Garda resources are being stretched to the limit, leaving other serious crime issues that need policing neglected.</p><p>  We at the Do or Die Foundation are urging the Government to implement a domestic violence register that will protect the vulnerable as well as giving the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na more authority when faced with an incident of domestic violence.  We understand the Government must abide by EU regulation and our intent is not to scare monger the general public.  Other EU countries have registers that work effectively.  In 2009, the police force in the UK requested such a register and the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme was implemented last year.  It is also known as "Claire's Law" after the vigorous campaigning by Michael Brown, the father of Claire Wood who was strangled to death by her ex-boyfriend, George Appleton in 2009.  This scheme operates in Greater Manchester, Wiltshire, Nottingham and Gwent.  It has since proved to be successful with cases now coming before the court this summer.  Although it received criticism from other organisations, there is significant confidence that in the foreseeable future it will apply throughout the UK.  In surveys taken three quarters of victims of domestic violence interviewed, stated they would have left a relationship sooner had they know about the previous history of a violent partner.  A live register can prevent tragedies.  I ask the Government to accept our challenge.</p><p>  In May 2013, the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny took part and supported "The Man Up Campaign" in County Mayo.  He stated that "I'm one for reality and truth".  The truth is that domestic violence is at an epidemic level and will rise by approximately 15% every year the economic situation deteriorates.  Domestic violence costs millions of euro each year and puts a strain on other services such as medical, Garda and the court.  </p><p>  In March 2012, the Irish officials met at the UN Human Rights Council and participated in the Council of Europe Convention on violence against women and domestic violence.  That was almost two years ago and Ireland is one of the very few countries that has yet to sign the relevant treaty.  What is the reason for the delay?  The treaty is designed to protect each country's people.</p><p>  We at the Do or Die Foundation also believe that the education of our younger generations is vital in explaining the severity of domestic abuse and that it is a crime.  Our young people are our future.  We lead by example.  The Do or Die Foundation and its volunteers have put together a programme aimed at educating young people at second level.  We are also willing to talk to other support groups on this issue.  Educating and making people aware that this is a crime and will be treated as a crime is vital.  It is also vital the perpetrator is aware that his or her violent history is available to the public if he or she is suspected of carrying out this crime on another person.  The register would act as a deterrent.</p><p>  If someone has a bad credit history, he or she will appear on the Irish Credit Bureau's database.  If someone has a history of causing domestic abuse, where can one find that information?  Nowhere.</p></speech>

I have referred already to the pilot scheme of Claire's Law, which operates in the UK.  The Do or Die Foundation has also looked to what applies in Manhattan for other answers.  My colleague, Ms Priscilla Grainger was invited to visit the Family Justice Centre in Manhattan.  She was met by the chief commissioner of domestic violence, Ms Kathleen O'Reilly.  Since her appointment as commissioner, there has been a decrease of 40% in the incidence of domestic violence in Manhattan.  In the case of the murder of females by past or present intimate partners, the Manhattan area has a specific police unit that deals only with domestic violence cases.  They are very proactive in this area and keep close involvement with victims of domestic violence with follow up home visits, which act as a deterrent.  In the US, if the police force receive a call for help from a victim of domestic violence, the officers immediately make an arrest after assessing the situation without intervention or contribution of evidence by the victim.</p></speech>

I thank her for her excellent presentation.  We now come to the question and answer session.  The practice that has developed over time is that a member asks a question, which is then answered.  Nobody makes long speeches as members have an opportunity to make them in the D&aacute;il or Seanad Chamber.  We try to elicit information at committee meetings.  Answers should be concise and focused on the question.</p> <p>I will give each Member approximately five minutes to ask initial questions.  If they want to revert subsequently, we can be a little bit flexible, but we want to finish in half an hour or thereabouts.</p></speech>

I appreciate their voicing their opinions on the matter.  I will ask four questions.</p><p>  I will start with Laura.  I hope she will forgive me, as I cannot see her surname.  She will have to allow me to call her just Laura.  Like a number of contributors, she stated that the habitual residence condition, HRC, was an issue.  How can the problem be overcome, not only from the perspective of those groups seeking to protect women and men in domestic violence scenarios, but also in the sense of protecting the integrity of the immigration services, given that we would be providing a particular right to one over another?</p></speech>

Often, people who have experienced domestic or sexual violence are not taken seriously.  Given the assumption that people will take advantage of an exemption to the HRC, clear guidelines should be set on how to identify victims of domestic and sexual violence.  For example, people in Traveller and Roma communities have a significant difficulty in seeking help, accessing services and identifying themselves as victims.  Clear guidelines on how to identify victims should be provided to people who work in the system.  Many organisations and projects that work with women who are also affected by the HRC.  An interagency approach would be key.</p></speech>

In the current system, there is no question that the primacy of the rights and interests of the accused must be properly represented before the court.  However, the complainant, victim or prosecution witness also has rights.  The fact that the accused&rsquo;s rights have primacy does not mean the victim or witness has absolutely no rights.  It would pose a real risk of serious harm and retraumatisation if such a cross-examination were allowed.  It is a question of the lesser of two evils.</p><p>  This is a special situation, in that the questions to be asked will be intimate and the potential for abuse is considerable.  I am not just referring to instant abuse, but also a longer-term retraumatisation and damage.  I am not saying someone should not be represented, as an accused person should always be represented.</p></speech>

For example, court dates would have a bearing when the situation is being revisited, given that there are sometimes several months or years in the difference.

As we all know, Article 6 of the European Convention on Human rights talks about the right of the accused to a fair trial, fair procedures and all the rest which is, essentially, the right to due process.  That is very like our own right under Article 38 of the Constitution.  Nevertheless the European Court of Human Rights or the European Court - I forget which - said that provided the interests of the accused are properly represented, there are situations where it is in the interests of justice that personal cross-examination should not be allowed.  It is time to examine the matter again.</p></speech>

She may not be able to answer my question today but perhaps she will send me information on the matter.

If a defendant sacks their legal team, the notes are given back to the prosecution until such time as the defendant employs another defence team.  In that particular instance the defendant cannot cross-examine the complainant without a team.  The matter is addressed in the memorandum of understanding, but a lot more can be done.</p></speech>

I thank her for her comments.  With regard to the expertise available by first responders or first response units, whether that is the Garda, paramedics, social workers or whatever, in terms of the training they may have and their ability to respond in an appropriate manner, how significant is the training that is provided?  Does Ms Harling's organisation, as a provider, see room for improvement?  I am sure she does but I ask her to be specific.</p></speech>

Garda&iacute; are dragged from pillar to post and are not trained.  Perhaps one or two garda&iacute; in a certain division have received training about domestic violence but not them all.  In many cases women who are victims of domestic violence do not want to speak to a man even though he is a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Perhaps women in a certain division of local police stations could be trained in some way to deal with specifics.  Garda stations have referred people to my organisation and we go through the emotional stuff with those people.  We can direct them towards Dolphin House, provide court accompaniment and all that type of thing.  Garda&iacute; have come to us because they do not know what steps to take.  There is not enough training and there are too many-----</p></speech>

The whole thing concerns good process from beginning to end.  Sometimes that might involve statutory change, as Ms O'Malley-Dunlop mentioned, concerning counselling records.  My view would certainly be that this is the best way to deal with it.  Revising the other sexual experience provisions would be another example.</p><p>  It is enormously important for a victim to deal with well trained people.  These include garda&iacute;, sexual assault treatment unit personnel, staff of the Rape Crisis Centre, prosecution lawyers in the DPP's office and prosecution advocates who have specific training relevant to how this trauma impacts on victims of rape and sexual assault.  I completely support the training of judges, which is a critical element.  Various professions do receive training along those lines, but I would plead for some specialist input from experienced rape crisis staff.  They are on the front line, dealing with survivors every day and are thus familiar with the issues.  That is a vital component in this regard.</p></speech>

Judges and barristers must be aware of attitudes in society because when one appears before a jury of one's peers, they will bring to bear all the attitudes of society.  A specialist judge may direct a jury and refer to those attitudes, so education is an ongoing thing.  I support everything that Ms Counihan said and we do need changes in the law.  I welcome the proposal for a sexual offences Bill to cover all of the law in this area so that it will not be all over the place.</p></speech>

One other issue, which was not raised last week, concerned women engaged in prostitution.  Ms Benson has made a presentation on this matter for Ruhama.  The report of the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality deals with the central issue in Ms Benson's submission, that prostitution is a form of violence, and hence our recommendation that we change the law and adopt the Swedish approach.  I want to ask Ms Benson, and also the representative of Ugly Mugs, how violence specifically directed at women engaged in prostitution is being tackled.  In other words, I am referring to violence beyond the act of prostitution or the sale of sex itself.  How can that issue be best approached?  Is it by working alongside and co-operating with the Garda?  I know, for instance, that Ruhama has a sensitive way of ensuring that incidents are reported to garda&iacute; without necessarily disclosing details about clients.</p><p>  Ms Smith of Ugly Mugs said the majority of women engaged in prostitution that she knows of are independent.  That is against what we found in last year's hearings by the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  Ugly Mugs is clearly at a different level from other organisations that engage with garda&iacute; but if one is talking about developing an app, where does the funding for that come from?</p></speech>

One concerns on-street prostitution whereby we collaborate with the two other health services on the street in conjunction with the main Garda stations.  Harcourt Terrace has closed, so they are the Bridewell, Pearse Street and Donnybrook.  We facilitate reports of crimes in respect of such offences.  A number of years ago, we reviewed the possibility of expanding that to encompass the UK approach.  At that time, we were told there were constitutional issues over carrying it through.  In addition, it would be different from the legal situation in the UK as regards facilitating a witness <i>ad litem</i> mechanism for women.</p><p>  As regards the indoor sex trade, we are currently developing a pilot initiative with the Dublin Metropolitan Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which we hope to roll out with the establishment of liaison garda&iacute; for women in prostitution.  This will be a proactive referral mechanism through welfare checks both to ourselves and the women's health service with which we collaborate on awareness of support services available, including free sexual health services.  The objective is to build trust as opposed to going in on raid situations.</p><p>  We also do training with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in conjunction with front-line garda&iacute; from the organised prostitution unit.  That training stresses the objective of approaching with a degree of sensitivity and sensibility those who are in prostitution, as opposed to going in and simply arresting and charging them.  That training programme has had the support of the Assistant Garda Commissioner for the last three years and is slowly reaching out.  We hope to extend the training to senior garda&iacute;.  </p><p>  Individual cases are still problematic because some women may not disclose incidents of violence due to their immigration status and other external factors, as well as fear, including a fear of not being believed.  Therefore, one of our approaches, and that of the women's health service, is to support, encourage and empower women to report crimes.  Some women have been extremely courageous in doing so and we support them through the court process.  However, we consider there is still more to be done and so we are being proactive in that regard.</p></speech>

Last year, I took it on as a separate company.  It does not have any funding whatsoever, nor does it have an office or staff.  It is a web service, so it is not expensive to run.  The community provides support so when sex workers are attacked, other sex workers will support them.  It is a community initiative whereby everybody supports each other through a network.  Ugly Mugs does not provide actual support; it just facilitates people who have problems and connects them with other sex workers they can talk to, as well as other sources of support.</p><p>  When we ask them, the single biggest thing that sex workers want is a friendly police service, including Garda liaison officers.  The other single biggest concern is the message going out that it is okay to abuse sex workers, they are all trafficked so they have to do whatever one wants, and it is fine to rape them.  That message is continually sent out in the media but we need to stop it.  We need to send the opposite message, that it is not okay to abuse sex workers.  Even though there are many reasons that sex workers do not engage with garda&iacute;, the biggest one is the stigma and fear that they may be judged by garda&iacute;, pursued by the media, and have anti-sex work organisations intruding into their lives.  </p><p>  While the police service is the main concern, we would like to see support services for sex workers.  At the moment, the main support services for sex workers are the UK ones that provide phone support.  Some of the UK organisations do provide phone support to Irish sex workers, but there is basically no support here.  That situation is completely undesirable and will allow abuse and crime to thrive because there is nowhere for sex workers to go for help.  Many sex workers would like to have a friendly garda to whom they could talk when they experience problems.  When we ask them, they continually state that they want all of these different support services, but they do not exist at all.</p></speech>

It was a pilot scheme that was brought in with the Clare's Law register, but it has been so successful that they are going to roll it out throughout the UK.  This means it is working, which is because it gives security.  I am a mother and I would like to know that if I thought my daughter was in an abusive relationship, I could go and have a look at the background of this guy she is possibly going to end up marrying, and who is probably going to end up fatally inuring her.

I was just saying to my colleague that I worked for a trade union for many years and it was very rare to have someone ring to seek assistance, so there is obviously still a terrible shame about seeking the assistance of agencies.

I went to a conference last year in Harvard dealing with psychotherapy and women.  Of course, I went to learn but part of what I came away with was a sense of pride in what we are doing here.  There is a lot of work in the United States and the UK in terms of understanding complex trauma because a lot of the men, and some women, of course, have been traumatised in the wars.  There is a tradition in the United States, from Vietnam, of looking at the trauma.  What we are doing here is looking more at women's trauma and relational trauma, and setting up, I think, quite a unique model of working with women recovering.</p></speech>

The symbolic violence is that society is saying sex workers should not have a voice in making laws.  Of course they should.  That is a form of violence.

I would say the stigma is the main cause of it because we have seen it increase in the last couple of years, with the ongoing media campaigns against sex work.  It is also caused by the laws.  Sex workers are compelled to work alone in order to work legally, so they are prevented from working with a friend for safety.  Therefore, it is due to bad laws as well as the stigma.</p><p>  There is also the complete lack of any support for sex workers, so when a sex worker is a victim of a crime, they do not have any support organisation to go to or they do not feel able to go to the police.  Most people who offend against sex workers are not actually clients or even people with any relation to the sex industry.  It is often vigilantes and so forth and people are actually targeting sex workers because they are repeatedly getting the message in society that it is okay to do this.  Therefore, I believe stigma is the biggest issue.</p></speech>

We have to consider that some of these children are seeing this in their homes, so it has to be dealt with as delicately as possible.

We are hoping a second SAVI report will be undertaken.  This would provide us with proper comparative research and a great deal more information, including information as to why this is happening in our society.

There is a national guidelines committee which includes representatives from all the rape crisis organisations, including ourselves and the DRCC.  It is a fabulous committee and an example of inter-agency co-operation at its best.  Over a period of close to ten years it has produced two sets of agreed guidelines.  It takes its time in terms of working through whether proposals will work or not in practice and getting the views of representatives of the DPP's office, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the medical profession, SATU nurses and so on.</p><p>  I have not heard of many complaints regarding the SATUs - perhaps one or two in the six years I have been in this job.

In our experience, immigrant women who are experiencing domestic violence will often take years to come forward.  In fact, I would categorise them as a silent oppressed minority.  A particular difficulty is that they do not tend to interact with any service providers.  They drop the children to school and go to the supermarket and that is largely it.  They do not go to the places where they could access services.  Even if they do attempt to do so, they face significant barriers.

The vulnerability that arises from not being able to access services and protections leads to an exclusion from different aspects of society, such as not being linked into employment, not having economic independence, and not having access to education and knowledge about services and supports, perhaps because of illiteracy and language barriers, including in regard to accommodation and health issues.</p><p>  The European Commission has recognised the Roma people as one of the most vulnerable ethnic groups in Europe.  Ireland has developed its own national Traveller and Roma integration strategy, but it contains significant shortcomings.  In fact, it meets only four of the 22 criteria.  A comprehensive strategy would work to include Roma and Traveller women in society in a way that would ensure their economic independence and give them the knowledge to access services and protections.</p></speech>

Our approach is to contextualise the whole sex trade as one that is fundamentally predicated on inequality.  We are part of an international network of front-line services working directly with people involved in prostitution, which includes organisations in India, Canada, Denmark, France and Germany.  We are taking part in an event in New York which will highlight the fact that throughout the sex trade, in every country, women with the fewest opportunities are disproportionately represented.  This include first nations women in Canada, women of the lowest caste in India and poor migrant women from ethic minority backgrounds, including Roman women, in Ireland.</p><p>  Ruhama worked with more than 300 women last year, 80 of whom were suspected victims of trafficking.  In the case of women who were not trafficked, in many instances they were operating out of the same locations as women who were trafficked.  Prostitution is the cause of trafficking for sexual exploitation; it is where it happens.  The International Labour Organisation's report shows that the larger the sex trade, the greater the number of victims of trafficking.  Trafficked women are advertised in the same places and on the same websites as non-trafficked sex workers and are often located in the same places.  In other words, in terms of how sex buyers access sex workers, whether trafficked or non-trafficked, it is very much the same.</p><p>  The Commissioner with responsibility for trafficking has repeatedly stated that sex trafficking must be tackled in the context of prostitution.  As I mentioned, the European Parliament has passed a resolution which confirms that all forms of prostitution are regarded as violence against women and human rights abuses within which trafficking occurs.  Responses to combat trafficking must take that into account.</p></speech>

She mentioned that her organisation, which functions in a co-ordinating capacity, does not receive funding.  If a person comes to her group who has been gravely assaulted and needs help, what happens then?  Does Ugly Mugs refer the person to existing services?  The Health Service Executive, for example, has a sexual health clinic on Baggot Street.  We received a very detailed presentation from its management last year.  Is that the type of service to which Ms Smith would refer people?</p></speech>

When someone makes a report she can tick a box allowing details of the offender to be shared.  This is then recorded in two police databases, one of which is a database of serious sexual offenders which is used for intelligence purposes, while the second is the north west regional hub, which is subsequently distributed to local police forces.  The details recorded relate only to the offender, rather than the sex worker.  The police will then contact Ugly Mugs in the UK and ask whether they can speak to the victim.  This request may then be facilitated.  Ugly Mugs in Ireland does not have a facility to feed information to the Garda.  If such a facility were in place, we would use it.</p></speech>

The system has only been operating in the United Kingdom for approximately 18 months.  I understand a series of 20 robberies in London was resolved and people prosecuted as a direct result of the system.  Another case related to a serial sex offender was also solved.  A number of positive justice outcomes have been achieved within the first nine months of the trial process, which was the pilot scheme.</p></speech>

The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has a membership of hundreds of thousands.  As a member of three trade unions, I was never consulted about the Turn Off the Red Light campaign.  How did ICTU arrive at its decision to support the campaign?  Did it engage in a consultation with members or was the decision taken at a high level?  I ask because a recommendation has been made, notwithstanding a statement by the Swedish authorities eight years after the introduction of new laws on prostitution noting that it was not possible to give an unambiguous answer to the question of whether prostitution had increased or decreased in the meantime.  To cite the relevant document, "At most, we can discern that street prostitution is slowly returning".</p></speech>

There is, therefore, a strong argument to be made in light of the fact that Sweden has not reported any success with its law.</p></speech>

All unions feed their thoughts and proposals to their representatives on the executive committee.  The committee came to its decision, having consulted various trade unions which had dealt with this particular issue.  The Senator asked how ICTU arrived at its decision in this matter.  That is the norm for making decisions.</p></speech>

Ms Mulcahy's reply is very helpful.</p><p>  I have a question for Ms Counihan because she is involved in legal matters.  I listened with great interest to what she had to say.  On the business of violence, trafficking and so forth, I return to the Swedish model.

The hearings specifically examined the issue of prostitution and investigated the Swedish approach.  The Department held a conference attended by several members of the committee and representatives from different countries which take different approaches to prostitution.  The joint committee subsequently made its recommendations.  We have, therefore, interrogated the issue.  The focus of today's proceedings - perhaps the rapporteur may clarify the position - is domestic violence and gender based or sexual violence.   This is distinct from the issue of prostitution as violence, which the joint committee has considered and addressed.</p></speech>

A Swedish Government report, which includes significant elements about violence against women who engage in the sex trade, makes the following statement: "One starting point of this work has been that the purchase of sex services is to remain a criminal offence".  As an academic, it seems an odd procedure that one would start with the answer and work one's backwards to confirm what one believes.

Her submission states the following:<blockquote><br />There is a considerable body of evidence showing that, people with disabilities are at a higher risk of violence and abuse compared to others, and are more likely than others to have experienced multiple incidents of sexual violence.  Irish data shows that those with severely hampering disabilities were 2.9 times more likely to have experienced domestic and violent abuse than other adults.   </blockquote>On what research is this conclusion based?  Ms Barron will be aware of pending legislation on assisted decision making.  How will the legislation impact on this whole area?</p></speech>

The findings do not differ significantly from data in other countries such as Canada and the United States.</p><p>  The assisted decision making legislation will focus strongly on capacity to engage and a presumption of capacity in the first instance, which will be very important.  Having listened to the contributions, it should be noted that developments in mainstream services, including in the non-governmental sector, will make much of the difference.  The work being done under Cosc - the national strategy, as it were - is very important because much of this will be about consent and capacity, as well as awareness in respect of people who are victims of violence.  There is a lot happening to a funding stream under Cosc so that organisations can review their materials and decide what activities they do to reach out to people with disabilities to enable them to avail of services.  Of equal importance will be the availability of counselling supports, the right skill sets and awareness to the Garda and others.</p></speech>

I do not believe we can answer it until the longitudinal research that will allow us to make the comparison becomes available.  We have research which shows that the reporting rates for sexual violence have certainly increased.  However, there is still a large disconnect between actual reporting and getting cases to court.  That is worrying.  One of the reasons reporting rates have been increasing is that during the past 15 years we have been having an input into the education and training programme at the Garda training college in Templemore.  This has had an immensely positive impact and has given rise to a sea change in terms of the attitude of garda&iacute; when they meet victims.  In turn, victims now feel more confident in reporting crimes to garda&iacute;.  This needs to become the case right across the criminal justice system.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Ciaran McEntee, Mr. Padraig McNamara, Mr. Brian McGann and Mr. Sean Martin of the Irish Postmasters Union.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, tehy are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

My name is Brian McGann, general secretary of the union.  I am accompanied by our union's president, Mr. Ciaran McEntee, our vice president, Mr. Padraig McNamara and our treasurer Mr. Sean Martin, each of whom is a serving postmaster.</p><p>  The Irish Postmasters Union represents the vast majority of the 1,100 postmasters in Ireland.  Postmasters, many of whom come from generations of postmasters, are deeply rooted in the communities they serve.  They and An Post are trusted servants of the community providing valuable services such as banking, welfare payments, mail services, foreign exchange, investment products, Postfone and many other products and services.</p><p>  The post office serves 1.7 million customers every week over five and half days, including Saturday.  Every post office is fully automated and is capable of providing any of An Post's services in any part of the country.</p><p>  The post office is trusted, flexible and accessible.  When customers walk through the door of a post office they know that they are dealing with people they can rely on and trust, and that the sensitive information they provide, in order to do their business, will be safe, secure and treated in confidence.</p><p>  In 2011 the union launched its Open for Business campaign which is based on making the country's sub-post offices more sustainable by making greater use of the retail network of post offices.  A key element of this campaign was the development of a suite of business proposals which the union argues could be implemented to the benefit of the post office network and the taxpayer.</p><p>  In 2012, the union commissioned Grant Thornton to independently assess our proposals.  Following its assessment of a number of the union's proposals, Grant Thornton prepared a report and this was published by the union.  The Grant Thornton report found that each of the proposals examined would have a positive cost-benefit outcome and it estimated that if these proposals alone were implemented, more than &euro;80 million in savings could be achieved, much of which would accrue to the taxpayer.</p><p>  However, despite the benefits that would accrue to all parties from adopting the approach put forward by the union, the Grant Thornton report recognised that these proposals alone could not replace the very substantial undermining of the viability of the post office network if the welfare payments business was taken away from An Post.</p><p>  In 2013, following extensive investigation and consultation, this committee published a report on promoting a sustainable future for the post office network.  This report contained many ideas and valuable recommendations on how the post office network could be sustained.  In 2014, at our request, Grant Thornton undertook a second study of the issues facing the post office network.  Its findings, published last week, make for stark reading.</p><p>  While much good work has been done, both by this committee and by the IPU, no real action has been taken to secure the future of the network.  Indeed, much has happened since last year to give rise to real concerns that the post office network could be in greater danger of collapse than ever before.</p><p>  This morning we wish to address some of the key problems facing the network and also highlight some of the main findings of the most recent Grant Thornton report.  Members will be aware that the postmasters, through a number of Independent Deputies, have put forward a motion which, if adopted, would greatly help to secure the future of postmasters, their families and staff and would also help to underpin the future existence of many communities throughout the country.</p><p>  Before I deal with some of the issues facing post offices today, I wish to dispel a few myths about postmasters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-26a.1193" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian McGann" time="09:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014022600004#E00100"><p>First, postmasters are not employees with good salaries and pensions.  In fact, postmasters get paid for the transactions they conduct and if they do not have business to transact, they do not get paid.  In the House last night the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte stated that he was not going to close any post offices.  The fact is that if there is no business to transact in post offices, then post offices will be closed in any event.  While the Minister may not actively sign any order closing post offices, Government inaction in this regard will close post offices.</p><p>  Sometimes people maintain the post office is part of the old way of doing things.  The reality is that we have the most up-to-date technology available in every post office and our systems have the capacity and flexibility to take on new business easily and quickly.  There are modern technologies in the marketplace but some things can only be done face-to-face.  Computers cannot smile at us and one cannot squeeze a loaf of bread online.</p><p>  Sometimes people tell us that we are too expensive but that comparison is unfair because the post office offers far more than a simple transaction.  Post offices are an important strategic asset for Ireland and we must ensure that the network is sustained for the future.  The Grant Thornton report highlights how important the post office is for communities, especially in rural and disadvantaged urban areas and for the elderly, disadvantaged and financially excluded.</p><p>  An Post recently won the contract to deliver welfare payments on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  The contract, which is for two years, can be extended for a further four years beyond that.  Many people believe that this has dealt with the welfare payments issue and that everything is rosy in the garden but that is not the case.  The Department of Social Protection stated in the current contract document that An Post will be required to assist the Department in achieving its objectives to move to electronic payments based on the Departments electronic payment strategy.  This will involve forcing many of the 51% of people currently receiving welfare payments over the counter to move to using a bank account.</p><p>  The Department plans to issue a second tender and has already issued a request for information.  This tender will see the introduction of a system of direct electronic payment of welfare and, if implemented in its current form, the Irish Postmasters Union is gravely concerned that the sustainability of the post office network will be undermined to such an extent that hundreds of post offices throughout the country will close and this will have a seriously negative impact on people, especially in economically disadvantaged urban areas and in rural areas as well.</p><p>  Despite winning the contract, post offices are losing business since it is being driven out of our offices into the banks on a daily basis by the Department of Social Protection.  I have before me an example.  It is a letter to a claimant and it states that in order to give a decision on the person's claim the Department needs the following information: the name and address of the bank, account number, sort code and the name of the account holder.  What person looking for payment of a benefit from the State would refuse to give that information if it is demanded of him?  There is no choice in that letter and no option.  Clearly, the Department of Social Protection is driving people out of post offices and into the banks.  People are not being given a choice and if this continues by 2017 post offices will not have the welfare payments business and hundreds of offices will be forced to close.</p><p>  The State savings contract is due for renewal this year and the revenue from the contract is almost of equal value to the welfare payments contract.  Any loss of remuneration from this contract will also seriously undermine the sustainability of the network.  Rural post offices have been subject to the loss of rural mail delivery offices and the closure of these facilities undermines the financial position of post offices in the longer term since this represents an important source of income for postmasters.  The greatest issue facing post offices is the fact that the Government does not have a plan.  Despite making a commitment in the programme for Government to maintain the post office network, the Government has no plan to ensure that the commitment is delivered on.</p><p>  Government policy is forcing An Post to operate on a commercially feasible basis without any recognition of the social policy role played by post offices throughout the country.  This policy is leading to the closure of post offices but more concerning is the establishment by An Post of an alternative network to the existing post office model.</p></speech>

This move is a direct consequence of the lack of a Government plan for the network.  While some products and services are not currently available, the systems employed in this network are capable of offering the full range of services.  We know that An Post plans to extend this network to other supermarket multiples.  The Post and Pay offering is different to the Postpoint channel in that it is a branded network but to the average man or woman on the street it simply looks like a post office without the protective screen.  However, the staff operating these outlets are not fully trained or vetted nor are they bound by official secrets legislation.  We are not aware that the staff are trained in anti-money laundering requirements.  All this represents a downgrading of the post office network and an increased risk to the certainty that customers have that their business can be transacted on a confidential basis.</p><p>  The only outcome of this move by An Post will be to dilute the existing business of the network.  In the past the supermarkets flirted with the idea of 24 hour opening but since it made no significant contribution to increasing the overall level of business for the most part they have abandoned the idea.  This partnership with Tesco and others alone could destroy the network within two years.  On behalf of postmasters in Ireland, the union cannot allow this development to go ahead unchallenged and if An Post continues to push ahead with this ill-fated plan, the union will take action to oppose the establishment of an alternative network that will cannibalise the existing post office network.</p><p>  While it is Government policy to support the post office network, the realisation of this support requires a significant degree of political will and the development of a conscious regard at departmental level of the benefits of utilising more fully the network of post offices.  An example of the mismatch between Government policy and departmental actions is the recent decision by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport not to make the provision of driver licence renewals available through the 1,150 post offices.  Instead, the Department decided that the provision of driving licences should be restricted to just over 30 locations.  In addition, members of the public can no longer apply by post to renew their driving licence.  Instead, people must travel to one of the few locations to have their photograph taken.  Given the distance that people may be required to travel and the time that will be taken to process driving licence applications at these locations, the new system is less accessible, more costly and more time-consuming for customers.</p><p>  People may ask why An Post did not win the contract.  Simply put, calling on a network of 1,150 outlets to bid for a contract requiring only 30 outlets gives the post office little chance of competing fairly with other operators.  In the light of the well-established and highly successful passport express model, why did the Government not simply replicate that model for driving licences instead of spending time and money reinventing the wheel?  It makes no sense unless the purpose was to create yet another quango.  We believe there is a strong argument to ensure that all Government agencies actively examine the benefits of using the network but a strong political will is required to make this happen.</p><p>  When it comes to drafting tenders for Government business, the IPU believes that all tenders should be structured to ensure that they can be evaluated on the basis of economic and social policy criteria.  In France, for example, the Government adopts this approach and one does not find the French police driving Fiats.</p><p>  In 2012 we asked Grant Thornton to assess some of our business proposals.  Based on the firm's assessment, our proposals on motor tax alone could save the Exchequer &euro;60 million over a five year period while other proposals could realise further savings of &euro;16 million over the same timeframe.  The committee has examined the issue of sustaining the post office network and many of the findings mirrored the conclusions of Grant Thornton.  Late last year we asked Grant Thornton to revisit its earlier study and to report on the issues facing the network today.  The findings are a matter of grave concern to postmasters throughout the country.  As committee members will have seen from the presentation slides that were circulated, Grant Thornton highlighted the heavy reliance of the network on the welfare and National Treasury Management Agency contracts.  This is consistent with the findings from the committee's report last year.  What Grant Thornton is altogether clear about is that without the revenue generated by these two contracts the network cannot survive.</p><p>  Grant Thornton also revealed in the report that between 2006 and 2012, a total of 209 post offices closed, a decline of 15% in the network.  Grant Thornton examined some scenarios and concluded that if 75% of the welfare payments business was lost, fully 444 offices would close, while if the network loses all of the welfare payments business then the number of post offices that would close would number 557.  Clearly, the effect on the post office network would be devastating.</p><p>  Grant Thornton highlighted the fact that the post office network is a key element in the Government's financial inclusion strategy.</p></speech>

It is too valuable to lose.</p><p>  Do we want to let this important facility wither on the vine, do we want to have a modern, vibrant, sustainable post office for ourselves and for future generations, or do we want a society where communities disintegrate and where people become disengaged from the society within which they live, and all the social disorder that follows from that sort of breakdown?  Today we have a choice.  Tonight in the House, Deputies will be able to vote on the motion looking for an action plan.  We do not want yet another review.

On behalf of all of us, I thank them for the work they do in their communities, which they represent in the post office network and the postmasters.  Mr. McGann has outlined in great detail what I see as a call to action by the postmasters on behalf of their customers for the Government to follow through on commitments made in the programme for Government.  On page 62 of that programme, the Government clearly sets out its intention to maintain the local post office network.  I support fully the motion before the House tonight.  The witnesses have used the facilities of the Independent Deputies, but as Mr. McGann pointed out, it is a motion on behalf of the postmasters and the people they serve.</p><p>  I do not know whether the witnesses have seen the Government amendment to the motion.  If they have, do they believe it meets their needs?  Is it representative of the commitments given in the programme for Government or do they believe it is yet another vague commitment to provide services some time in the future and some assistance to the post office network?  What level of interaction has the Irish Postmasters Union had with its customers?  Do the witnesses believe the motion they have put forward, which the Government will attempt to amend tonight, would meet the needs and expectations of the customer base they serve?</p></speech>

The postmasters are asking for action.  The Minister is possibly offering us some sort of review that might do something at some point in the future.  What we want is action.  What our customers want is action.  What is happening on the ground is that by 2017, we will have lost the welfare payments business and &euro;20 million in revenue will be lost directly by postmasters.  They will be forced to close the door of their offices.  We are calling on the Government to take action.  The Government made its promise in the programme for Government.  All we are asking is how that promise will be kept.</p><p>  The Minister's motion essentially proposes that the Government is prepared to sleepwalk into a situation where the welfare payments business disappears by stealth.  On behalf of postmasters in this country, we are not prepared to accept that as an outcome.  We want to know what is the plan.  We are prepared to put our shoulder to the wheel.  We have been proactive in developing business proposals and having them costed.  We will come up with the ideas and do the business where and when it needs to be done.  We will meet our obligations, but the Government needs to have some plan and needs to give direction to An Post.</p><p>  Our customers are overwhelmingly asking us to ensure we start a petition they are prepared to sign at every post office throughout the country demanding that their post office be kept.  I think our customers clearly feel that what is proposed in the Government's amendment would not meet their needs in the long term.</p></speech>

In our view, the amendment does not come within an ass's roar of that.  If the postmasters' motion is lost tonight, we will not just be talking about the sustainability of a network, we will be talking about the sustainability of communities and the disintegration of rural and urban communities in this country.  This will become a much bigger issue.</p></speech>

I am a sub-postmaster and have been a member of the Irish Postmasters Union since 1992, so this is my 22nd year as a postmaster.  When I took over that office, it was a manual office like all other offices throughout the country.  It became automated in the mid 1990s.  In 1997, I recall a protest taking place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-26a.1212" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian McGann" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014022600006#G00200"><p>I would like to respond to those points.  Deputy Harrington refers to the Bantry letter, as it is called.  I do not know that it is the only one in existence but I am getting calls from postmasters throughout the country who tell me they are losing customers because the customers have been pushed towards the banks.  I am not in a position to say whether it is the only letter but there are other items of correspondence suggesting people should use the banks because the post office is a nuisance.  From the reports we have received from around the country, there is no doubt that on the ground the Department is pushing people into banks.  Regardless of the letters in existence, I refer the Deputy to the tender document the Department of Social Protection issued when it put the contract out to tender.  A table shows the payments being driven by the Department from 51% to 3%.  Effectively, this is driving the business out.  It is not a matter of whether we get the odd letter from around the country.  The Department's document sets out its timetable to try to drive the business out of the network.</p></speech>

I apologise for leaving in the course of the presentation, but I took the opportunity to read it.  I represent the Sligo-North Leitrim constituency, in which Sligo is the major town and the rest of the constituency is mainly rural with small towns and villages.  I think any member of the Oireachtas who represents a similar area will fully appreciate the benefit and value of the post office network.  The service it provides is much more than selling stamps and paying out social welfare payments.  It is part of the fabric of the communities in which it is located.  I am passionate in my defence of the post office network.  We will be supporting this motion tonight.  I have not yet seen the Government amendment to the motion that will be voted on tonight, but I am sure I will see it at some stage during the day.</p><p>  We need to be realistic.  We will not stop electronic mail or electronic funds transfer.  It is disturbing to learn that Government is putting undue pressure on people to accept electronic funds transfer.  If that assertion is accurate, it is disturbing because people should have a choice.  Any business model that is built on resisting the increasing electronic funds transfer or electronic communications will fail.  It will be like King Canute trying to hold back the tide with a rake.  It will not work.</p><p>  Mr. McGann stated we need a Government action plan.  In my view An Post needs a business model and an action plan.  Government must give its full support to that action plan.  I do not think the Government should come up with the business model for An Post but An Post should have Government support for its proposed model.  It is a reasonable expectation that An Post, together with the post office network and the postmasters, would have Government support for its plan, once it is in place.</p><p>  What was the value of the licence for the national lottery before its withdrawal from the post office network ?  Were arrangements made to compensate An Post for the withdrawal of the national lottery?  It appeared to be running successfully and be of benefit to the post office network.</p><p>  It is not clear from the Grant Thornton report on its analysis of An Post whether its staff met the management of An Post or explored different possible business models with An Post.</p><p>  I attended a briefing by the postmasters' association last week at which I suggested that at a time when the banks are closing left, right and centre, it must present an opportunity for An Post to work with the Irish League of Credit Unions to give credit union members easy access to a full range of credit union services at the post office.  That is an example of the lateral thinking that is needed by the credit union movement.  Someone must have been listening last week as I was delighted to learn the Minister picked up on that point.</p><p>  This issue is greater than politics.  Not only was I disappointed by the Minister's response last night, I was also disturbed.  While I welcome a whole of government analysis, that should have been done when this committee issued its report.  We have lost valuable time.  I see commercial and trading businesses moving from small rural towns into supermarkets based in larger county and provincial centres.  That is deeply disturbing.</p></speech>

Given the intrinsic value of the post office network is the ease with which every citizen can access the range of services provided in the post office, did Grant Thornton try to figure out with An Post management how the range of services could be widened?  We talk about competitive tenders, but we must take account of how business can benefit from the huge plus of a post office network that is accessible to the public.  If it is the intention of Government to minimise travel to access essential and desirable services, can it not see the benefit of the post office network?  It will not happen by accident but An Post must develop a business model that exploits its strengths.</p></speech>

We were in the House last night to listen to the Minister.  He referred to the phenomenon of retail concentration with businesses based in larger county and provincial centres, but that raises the issue of what will happen to small towns and villages throughout the country.  From what we heard last night it seems the Minister and the Government are presiding over the death of communities in the country.</p></speech>

It is important to put on record that the postmasters are prepared to deliver social welfare in whatever form the Government wants, electronic or otherwise.  We are prepared to work with the company, An Post, to ensure that we will offer electronically operated systems through the post office.  As Mr. McGann alluded to, the difficulty we have  is that the social welfare report stated that the Department wants to go from 47% down to 22%, which is a reduction of 25% of our business that the Government wants to transfer through the bank.  If that happened it would decimate post offices.  As we have all said, the bedrock of the post office is the social welfare contract.  Unless we can continue the social welfare contract at its current level then we will not be able to sustain the network.  Grant Thornton also reports in its independent report that it will be no less costly to deliver social welfare electronically through the post office than is presently being delivered.  That means there will be no cost savings for the Government in terms of electronic delivery.</p><p>  It is important that Deputy Colreavy understands what the amended Fine Gael motion stated, which was stated by the Government Department last night.  It states that it wishes to debate "the role of An Post, as a commercial State company, to provide a nationwide retail network of economically sustainable post offices".  That is the most important part.  My colleague, Mr. McGann, alluded to the fact that 48% of the network does 11% of the business.  That means that 48% of the network is unsustainable and is not economically viable.  The Government has now told us to get rid of the 48% of the uneconomical post offices, run the business through the remainder of the network and let it set up an alternative network through Tesco or any other operation that wants to do the business, to the detriment of rural communities and societies.  That is not what we, as postmasters, want for our communities.  We want to sustain our communities and deliver Government front office services whatever way the Government wants us to do so.  We are not here to stop progress.  We are here to deliver on whatever the Government wants to deliver as front office through our network - electronic or otherwise.</p></speech>

Even the motions have been spoken about it, on the political front.  I ask the union to tell me the tangible efforts that An Post is making to attract new business.  For example, AIB does some business through the network but other banking outlets around the country are closing.  Has An Post made an effort to engage on a realistic level to deliver business through the network?</p><p>  Community awareness is a fundamental issue and Deputy Harrington also referred to it.  If a survey was conducted the union would be surprised by how many members of the public and citizens are unaware that when they do business through the banks that it has a serious consequence on the postal network.  Has An Post or the union launched campaigns to raise awareness of the negative consequences of such actions on the rural postal network?  Has the union seen tangible efforts being made by An Post?  The issue needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

Somewhere in Government a decision was made to have 30 or so locations where a person could renew a driving licence.  It is  important to remember that when decisions like that are being made it is very difficult for companies like An Post to tender successfully for such business if they are not being asked to compete basis on the strength of its network.</p><p>  An Post has also sought the motor tax renewals business.  I am aware that the chief executive of An Post met a number of people in the Department.  Nothing has happened except a local government efficiency review which does not appear to have achieved anything or there has been no outcome. </p><p>  An Post needs to compete for the business but the Government needs to recognise the extent and structure of the network and what the network can and cannot do.  One of the things that An Post and the post office network can offer is accessibility to people for face-to-face over the counter transactions.  That is the business that the post office network is in, that is the business that the post office network is good at and that is the business that many people want.  The company must be able to compete fairly for contracts.</p></speech>

Somebody in Government needs to get An Post and the credit unions to meet and let them know that what the country needs is a bank that people can trust in, that people can sign up to and one that people will want to do business with.  The one thing that we are certain of is that there is no banking system in this country that people trust, want to sign up to and want to do business with so there is an opportunity to be availed of.  The Government needs to give everybody a push and to make sure that they come up with a plan to do so.  Have I covered the Vice Chairman's question?</p></speech>

There is no doubt that the alarm bells are ringing and I want to commend the Irish Postmasters Union.  The union's political actions are raising public awareness, as is the fact that this committee is also engaged.  I have met Mr. McGann previously and he knows my experience of this.  I witnessed the closure of Kill post office in County Waterford, which An Post handled very badly by not communicating with the public.  Hundreds of people packed a hall after the horse had bolted because the closure had already happened.  That is the problem as I see it.  Many of those people had inadvertently moved their business away from the post office and had thus contributed to the closure.  Whether we like it or not, that is a fact and the publics need to understand that.</p><p>  As a Government backbencher I will be trying to force Departments to take the necessary action.  As we all know, however, Departments operate as silos.  They examine their budgets to make savings but there is no interconnectivity.  The An Post network is falling down because there is not a cross-cutting strategy by all Departments to address the issue of sustainability.  I commend the Irish Postmasters Union on its ongoing efforts, but packing hundreds into a community hall after the horse has bolted is not the answer.  We need to get these issues addressed now, rather than after the event.</p></speech>

It is clear the post office network is the largest infrastructural organisation in the country.  It comprises 1,100 postmasters in 1,100 post offices as well as thousands of jobs and many more from the spin-off of that valuable work.  The inaction being displayed on this important matter reminds me of the Department of Health's policy some years ago, through the health boards, which closed down district hospitals.  They are now known as community hospitals and we are fortunate that they survived.  At the time, the government did a health policy U-turn.  The current post office situation reminds me of the community aspect involved because we can now see how valuable our community hospitals are.  They form the bedrock of the health service.  Similarly, local post offices are the economic bedrock of the community.  In addition, the one-stop-shop facility is socially important.  My local post office, for example, is also a shop and filling station so all these services complement each other.  It also acts as a visitor centre for finding information.  We could roll out tourist information centres in such post offices which should be tied into all aspects of State and local authority services.</p><p>  An Post is part of a consortium that will be in charge of the national lottery, so the Government should amend the regulations and allow all post office outlets to be national lottery agents.  It is a glaring omission in the regulations, given An Post's involvement in the new lottery licence.</p><p>  The activity of the Irish Postmasters Union is timely following the Grant Thornton report.  I hope decisive action will be taken so that, hopefully, we will have a positive outcome.  It is a complex situation but most of all we need to restore many of the services that are being outsourced to major corporate firms, which is totally wrong.  We are getting away from the concept of support for our post offices.  </p></speech>

We would certainly say that every post office should be able to offer national lottery products because the network should be used to its maximum extent.  Whether people live in Donegal, Kerry or south Dublin, we firmly believe they should be able to avail of the same service at every post office.  We agree with Deputy Fleming about the national lottery.</p></speech>

I welcome the presentation by the Irish Postmasters Union, including the Grant Thornton report that has been circulated.  An issue that arose last week at one of the briefings resonated with many people - it concerns how we can encourage people to avail of the existing post office service, rather than seeking increased electronic funds transfer.  Our experience as public representatives includes filling out forms for people.  A party colleague said it all in stating that when he first entered the D&aacute;il the vast majority of people would gladly have received social welfare benefits over the post office counter.  Now, however, social welfare recipients want to receive payments electronically through a bank.  That will have an impact on the post office network.  What suggestions does the Irish Postmasters Union have to encourage the public to avail of the post office network's services while they are still there?  As Deputy Coffey said, putting 200 people into a hall when the post office sign has been taken off the wall is a total waste of time.</p><p>  A second point concerns the competing strength of businesses when it came to An Post's application for the driving licence franchise.  Did the IPU engage with An Post either before or after that application?  During last week's presentation, Mr. McGann referred to the number of centres that are currently available to process driving licence applications versus what the post office network could have provided under the auspices of An Post.  Did An Post, the IPU or anyone else challenge the baseline number of outlets that were to be provided by the national driving licence service?</p></speech>

I had the opportunity of listening to them last week as well at the briefing in Buswells Hotel.  I agree with most of the contribution made by my colleague Deputy Colreavy.  As I also come from County Leitrim, I am fully aware of the social importance of the continuing viability of the post office network.  It is interesting that even though I would be involved actively across several counties, most of the representations I have received on this issue have come from County Leitrim.  People are very concerned there about post office closures because it is a sparsely populated region.  It seems that the elephant in the room is An Post.  The changing nature of Irish society is such that people are voting with their feet and increasingly receive payments electronically, rather than through the post office network.</p><p>  I have tried to explore the attitude of the banks and their relationship with An Post, which is rather interesting.  In the submissions the banks made to this committee last year in advance of the report, all of them had a common theme.  For example, AIB said that such is the importance and breadth of the existing and potential relationship between AIB and An Post, that AIB will ensure that the relationship continues to be managed at a senior level in the bank.  Danske Bank viewed the services provided by An Post as crucial to its business model and meeting the needs of its customers.  The bank said that the partnership with An Post has been a very important, positive, professional, solutions-oriented and customer-focused development.  That is praise indeed for the post office network and its professionalism.</p></speech>

In regard to IPU engagement with the Government, has it discussed with the Department of Social Protection the possibility of post offices being used as a measure to reduce the amount of social welfare fraud, on the basis that the more often a person presents at a counter, the more likely they are to be detected if they are claiming fraudulently?  I know the Department of Social Protection has significant targets to reach in terms of the detection of social welfare fraud, which is a huge problem and is a cancer in society that needs to be removed.  Has the IPU, in its engagement with the Department, raised the issue of the service it can provide in terms of providing information to the Department of Social Protection on people who either do not present or present irregularly for payment?</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses and thank them for the campaign they have been running over the last weeks and months in trying to highlight the problem that is facing our post office network throughout the country.</p><p>  I must lead a boring life because the last thing I did before closing my eyes last night was to re-read the speech the Minister gave in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  It deserves to be reread.  I would like to hear the views of the witnesses of my take on the speech.  Does the IPU take the same impression that I do from his speech, namely, despite what he said, the thrust behind it amounts to the final death-knell over the coffin that is our post office network?  The reason I say this is because of his assertion that people are moving away from the high street and, if we do not follow or, in other words, if the postal service does not tie up with the big multinationals, it is going to be left behind.  Right away, what does that tell us about the real rural network of-----</p></speech>

The Minister made great play yesterday in the media of trying to say the Government is not closing down post offices and so on.  However, if one takes his speech to its ultimate, is he not saying that yes, post offices are going to close?  That is one question.</p><p>  With regard to an item touched on by other Deputies and Senators, the issue of the post office working in an <i>ad hoc</i> way in conjunction with members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, does the IPU agree that, as has been proven, garda&iacute; and those who want to carry out checks on who is who and what is what have always found the knowledge in local post offices to be very beneficial in dealing with their affairs?</p><p>  With regard to the Department of Social Protection, it is true to say it is asking people for their bank details, in other words, it is telling them that it wants to pay them through the bank.  The Department tells us, and has told me on numerous occasions in response to parliamentary questions, that for it to direct people to the post offices would be unfair as it would give the post offices an unfair advantage, and that it could not do that.</p></speech>

As far as we can see, what the Minister proposed in the D&aacute;il last night amounts to little more than a recipe for doing nothing.  The view among the postmasters in the Visitors Gallery was that it is another example of a Minister kicking the can down the road.  What we asked for in our motion - with respect to those who are facilitating its passage, it is our motion - is action.  What we have got in its place are some vague non-specific promises that a Cabinet committee might look at social policy and something might be done.  Two years ago, we showed the Government that it could save &euro;60 million over a five year period by implementing our motor tax proposals.  What became of those proposals?  Where is the action on the report this committee produced last year?  As far as we can see, there has been none.</p><p>  Many people find postmasters' local knowledge very useful, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In terms of the Minister presiding over the vetting of post offices, the reality is that any post office which is not getting the business through the door will eventually close.  The Minister might not sign a piece of paper to close the office, but if the business is taken away, the door will close.  The Deputy knows this because he is in business the same as every other postmaster.</p><p>  Senator Mooney referred to Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's suggestion of framing contract tenders in respect of the provision of services and the accessibility of those services within a specific radius.  That is a very sensible suggestion which would ensure people have access to services in accordance with their preference, whether online or over the counter.  The Government has a huge role to play in the framing of those tenders.</p><p>  Reference was made to the emergence of a cashless society.  The reality is that people in this country are wedded to cash.  I do not like walking out the door of my house without cash in my pocket because I do not know when the next banking system crash will occur.  I do not know when I will be faced with an ATM that will not dispense cash because the banking system has collapsed.  I know many customers of Ulster Bank who, a year or so ago, were left without the ability to pay for their weekly shopping because the system collapsed.  That is why people want cash.  In particular, people who do not have much money want cash because it gives them more control over their spending.  When one has to decide between buying a loaf of bread and a bottle of milk or paying &euro;10 off an ESB bill, cash offers greater flexibility and control.  One does not want the bank pressing a button and taking money out of one's account.</p><p>  It is true that people vote with their feet.  The question is what we can do to encourage people to use our services.  The first thing a shop owner does is make sure the products customers want to buy are on the shelves.  People will not come in to buy bread if there is no bread on the shelf.  One has to put in place the products and services that people are seeking.  Banking is an integral part of the future of the post office network in terms of the delivery of welfare payments and other transactions people find useful.  If postmasters are given the tools to do the job, they will get the customers in.  The 800,000 welfare customers who come through our doors every week appreciate the services we provide and how we help them to manage the small amount of money they have to manage.  They are fully aware of the services we provide.  By expanding those services, we will attract many more customers.</p><p>  I will use an analogy to illustrate my point and ask members to think about it.  Some years ago people would not get on buses in this city because one could not go anywhere in them.  A structure was put in place by the Government to provide bus corridors and now the bus service offers one of the most efficient methods of motorised transport.  We are saying to the Government that an action plan is needed that will achieve a similar result, in tangible terms, for the post office network.  An Post absolutely has to be driven to develop a better business model.  In particular, the post office network needs to become a full partner in the banking system.</p><p>  Deputy Healy-Rae is absolutely right in his point regarding the Department of Social Protection.  We are repeatedly told that people cannot be encouraged to use post offices, but it is apparently acceptable, without any objection at all, to drive people into using the banks.  We are simply asking for a fair opportunity.  New mothers are being signed up to banks to receive their child benefit while they are still in the maternity hospital.  Where is the post office being promoted?  Why is the Department of Social Protection, as an arm of government, promoting the use of private profit-making enterprises over the post office network?  We are mystified by that.</p></speech>

Post offices play a very significant role in terms of the return of unclaimed payments to the State.  How much will it cost the State if it loses that fraud deterrence element - if the money just disappears into the ether and is never seen again?</p><p>  Deputy O'Donovan asked whether An Post challenged the driving licence tender.  Companies do not challenge Departments when they issue a tender.  No one does that, in either the private or public sector, because it is not permissible to do so.  Somebody at Government level signed off on a tender document in respect of a process which we could have done much more efficiently.  Why is it that one can renew a passport, which is a more important document, at any post office in the State, but one has to take a day off to renew a driver's licence?</p> <p>That does not make sense.  Somebody sitting in an office somewhere did not realise the solution was in front of them and chose instead an option with which the post office network could not compete.  A Government action plan is required.  The issue is not solely the responsibility of the Government because the Irish Postmasters Union, An Post and other stakeholders must have an input in the plan.  What is clear is that we need a post office network for the future, one which provides the services that people want, when and where they are wanted.  While we are prepared to play our part in achieving this, we also need other people to be on the pitch, playing the game.</p></speech>

It is probable that every person in this room renews his or her passport using the passport express service, under which one submits an application at the local post office and receives one's passport within ten days.  Why could this not be done with a driver's licence?  That is the real issue.</p></speech>

They are being informed that the current system is being abolished.  As such, they are not being given a choice and, furthermore, they cannot have their payments paid into a post office savings account.  Many people use their post office savings account as it does not incur banking charges.  We are being told, however, that they will not be allowed this option.</p></speech>

The Grant Thornton report highlights this issue where it asks what value has been placed on the fraud deterrence role of post offices and the amount of money being returned to the Exchequer and what value has been placed on the possibility that financial exclusion may increase if the post office network deteriorates.  This issue is being viewed in a highly simplistic manner.  The Government has not considered what would be lost if we moved to direct electronic payments.</p></speech>

Has the Irish Postmasters Union engaged in discussions or negotiations with An Post to ascertain how the role of the Post Office Savings Bank could be expanded to allow for electronic transfers of salaries and social welfare payments?  I would prefer customers to continue to claim their social protection payments over the counter using their social services card.  The card is photographic identification and allows postmasters to verify the identity, signature and date of birth of the claimant.  We can be certain, therefore, that we are paying the correct person the correct payment every week when the person presents.  We are unable to facilitate customers who wish to have their funds transferred into an account through electronic transfer.  Customers must be given this option if the post office network is to remain viable.  Has the Irish Postmasters Union had discussions with An Post as part of an effort to expand its role in this area and ensure post offices remain viable?</p></speech>

This requirement is in place for obvious security reasons to ensure the claimant is not outside the State and so forth.  Further, the postmaster needs to be able to make an electronic funds transfer at the counter into a person's bank account or post office savings account.  One of the key issues, however, is that An Post must want to get involved in providing enhanced levels of banking services.  If it cannot present a model that generates savings, while also offering security and allowing the postmaster to process the transaction electronically, we will face a serious problem.</p></speech>

However, without the &euro;20 million revenue we receive for delivering that business, postmasters will not be in business.  The bottom line is that we need income from business to survive.  We are flexible and we will do what is needed.  At one point, social welfare recipients had to a have a book of vouchers and if a social welfare payment increased, one could end up with three or four such books.  That system was eliminated when a card system was introduced.  Post offices can continue to be flexible in future.</p></speech>

We have had discussions with An Post on the use of State savings accounts.  The company tells us that the National Treasury Management Agency is not willing to allow these accounts to be used for that purpose.  We are, therefore, in a position where one arm of the State is preventing us from doing what another arm of the State requires.  What we need is a banking solution that will allow us to deliver the social welfare payments contract and other payments business through the post office network.  We need the tools to do our job and the income we receive from that business to keep our doors open.  That is the bottom line for post offices and anybody else in business.</p><p>  I have listened to Professor Ray Kinsella, an expert in retail banking with whom some members may be familiar, speak on this issue.  Professor Kinsella is strongly of the view that we need another banking force.  Why does the Government not invite An Post, the Irish Postmasters Union, the credit unions and Professor Kinsella to a meeting at which we could have a substantial conversation on the issue?  We could then find out who is prepared to step up to the mark and who is not prepared to do so.  Postmasters are certainly willing to do so.</p></speech>

They have done the committee a service.  As they will be aware, following lengthy deliberations, the joint committee published a report last March.  At the time, we asked whether the document would end up on a shelf.  The delegation, by appearing before the joint committee, has helped to ensure this will not happen, as has the decision to table a Private Members' motion in the Chamber last night.  I listened to all the arguments and counter-arguments in the debate last night.  I assure our guests that representatives of An Post will come before the joint committee in a couple of weeks to respond to many of the points they raised in their submission.  While the committee does not have the power to call everyone into a room, we will certainly ensure everyone involved comes into this room to try to advance this issue.  The witnesses articulated the problems, suggested solutions and identified what they were willing to do.  As I stated privately to a number of those present last night, it is important that all stakeholders step up to the mark here.</p></speech>

One must, therefore, look at the longer term.  From 2006 to date, 209 offices have closed.  If, as I said earlier, the welfare payments business is removed from post offices, then within three years the network will be halved.  Grant Thornton has stated that in its estimation and based on the loss of that contract, 557 post offices will close.</p></speech>

I am merely stating that the impression has been given that this just happened in the past couple of years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-26a.1265" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian McGann" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014022600013#O00400"><p>Unfortunately, one of the things which has sustained the network in recent years is the high number of jobseekers.  As a result of their being made unemployed, many people have unfortunately been driven to use the post office network.  I could go back 20 years and show members huge figures in respect of this matter or I could show them very small figures from last week.  I am absolutely certain that if we lose the &euro;20 million we get from the social welfare payments contract, then hundreds of post offices will close.  If any of us are still here in three years time, that is what we will be contemplating.</p></speech>

The number of payments rose dramatically between 2008 and this year as a result of the economic downturn.  However, during the so-called boom times closures were still taking place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-26a.1267" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian McGann" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014022600013#O00600"><p>Yes but that is the point.  The Minister stated that there have been few closures since 2010 but that is because since the end of the boom times very large numbers of jobseekers have been coming through the doors of post offices.  Those individuals would have taken a little time to flow through.  That is why there has been a smaller number of office closures in the past couple of years.  When one looks back, one will see that the numbers are much greater.</p></speech>

Despite the business relating to social welfare payments - on which the network has been over-reliant - closures were still occurring.  This illustrates that even from the mid-part of the previous decade there was a need for An Post to provide a more broadly based and diversified service.  I return to my original comment to the effect that An Post remains the elephant in the room.  The company must develop a new business model.</p></speech>

In pure monetary terms, that section of the network will never be economically viable on its own.  There is a social policy aspect and that must be valued.  There is a need to sustain the network and this must not simply be from the point of view of economic or commercial concerns.  The approach must be broader than that and that is where Government must play its part.</p></speech>

In light of the commitment contained in the programme for Government and that provided by the Minister last night to the effect that a Cabinet sub-committee will review this matter, I am of the view that he and his officials should be requested to come before the committee in order that they might provide an update on progress in the context of how it is proposed to sustain the network.</p></speech>

The committee has a responsibility in respect of this issue and it will certainly do whatever it can to ensure that progress is made.</p><p>  I thank Mr. McEntee, Mr. McNamara, Mr. McGann and Mr. Martin for their presentation and submission and for engaging with members during these proceedings.  This has been a very worthwhile exercise and I am of the view that it is perhaps easier to tease this matter out to an even greater extent here than in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  We fully appreciate that the Irish Postmasters Union plays in respect of the post office network.  We all want to get this process across the line in order that the post office network will be maintained and sustained.  I hope the latter will be the outcome when the process to which I refer has concluded.</p></speech>
