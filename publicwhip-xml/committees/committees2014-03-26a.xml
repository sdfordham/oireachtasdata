She was a Member of the D&aacute;il since 2007, and before that a Senator, for the Fine Gael Party.  She was an excellent representative and a colleague and friend to members of the committee.  On behalf of the committee, I express our sympathies to her family and colleagues.</p><p>  I welcome the witnesses.  I wish to draw their attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise them that the opening statements they have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect of the privilege statement I have just outlined.</p><p>  Today's meeting is on the entitlement of self-employed persons to social protection payments.  It is one of a number of meetings that we have held.  Several members, in particular Deputy Butler, requested this meeting.  It follows our meeting with the Dundalk-based Self-Employed Alliance, SEA, last year as well as our meeting with the advisory group on tax reform.  A number of other meetings related to self-employed people in the PRSI system.  A number of reforms have been proposed in the advisory group's report.  Given our consideration of its proposals and the fact that a number of stakeholders have commented on them, Deputy Butler suggested that we have a follow-up meeting with ISME, the Small Firms Association, SFA, and the SEA to sustain the debate and progress the issue.</p><p>  To get our discussion under way, I invite Mr. Martin to make his presentation on behalf of the SFA.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-26a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Martin" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014032600003#C00300"><p>The SFA represents approximately 7,500 companies and has seven affiliated organisations.  Ireland is trying to encourage more people to create jobs, take risks, set up businesses and become self-employed, but there are many restrictions on people who become self-employed.  For some time, we have been arguing for a voluntary additional PRSI contribution to be paid by the self-employed.  We are not asserting that all such people want to pay a full PRSI rate, but they should be allowed to retain the benefits of PRSI to encourage them to start up businesses.  A self-employed person who pays the S class stamp only qualifies for the widow's or widower's pension.  He or she gets a guardian's payment, the State pension eventually and a restricted maternity benefit.  An ordinary employee can get maternity benefit straight away, whereas a self-employed person must be self-employed for at least 12 months.  This is discriminatory, particularly given the fact that we are trying to encourage more women into the workplace and to set up businesses.  The self-employed also get the adoptive benefit and the bereavement grant.  This system needs to change.</p><p>  Recently, I was speaking with someone in the UK.  Were I an owner-manager of a business in the UK, I would effectively pay the same social welfare stamp as my employees.  If my business closed down, I would also qualify for unemployment benefit.  It would be means tested eventually, but I would initially get the same as my former employees.  Self-employed people in the UK pay approximately 11%.</p><p>  The tax rates paid by the self-employed are also at issue.  We all discuss the reduction of rates, but the self-employed pay higher rates of tax and PRSI than anyone else.  We are meant to be the people generating jobs.  We are taking risks and putting our necks on the line but we are getting nothing in return.  That Ireland is a high-tax country has been recognised and discussed for some time.  The person taking the risk must be rewarded.  Self-employed and employed people should be treated the same.  We live in the same country and use the same services, so why are we discriminated against?  I can understand why it was the case years ago, but most of my colleagues and I pay ourselves on the same basis as we pay our employees, for example, monthly.  We do not pay our taxes 12 months in arrears unless, for example, the tax relates to investment rental income, but that is true of PAYE workers as well.  Why does the system discriminate against us, particularly in terms of voluntary PRSI?</p><p>  Our members believe that a voluntary system is the right approach.  I have been suggesting it for two or three years.  A compulsory system would turn people off.  Instead, people should be allowed to opt in.</p> <p>For example, if I am an A1 contributor and I decide tomorrow to set up my business, I then become an S1 contributor and I lose all the benefits I have paid in the past 30 years.  That is wrong.  One should be able to retain those benefits in some manner.  They could be restricted for a five year period or whatever to enable the person to take the risk because we know many businesses fail within the first year.  All the statistics are available.  We have to recognise those failures but encourage such people to get up off the ground and start again.  If somebody who was running a business failed it is unlikely they will go to work for somebody else; they will try to start again.  That is why we would like to have a voluntary system in place.</p></speech>

Our sympathies go to her children, Caren and Eoin.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</p><p>  The Irish Small and Medium Businesses Association, ISME, represents just over 9,000 member companies employing approximately 225,000 employees, and we welcome this opportunity to make this submission.  The sector we represent accounts for 99.8% of all enterprises, two thirds of all employment, and over 50% of all added value created in Ireland.  Those enterprises play a decisive role in Ireland's economy and in the society.  We are drivers of innovation and we also ensure social and regional stability but we rely on the Members of the Oireachtas to understand not only the role but also the needs of the SME sector and ISME, the only independent representative SME organisation, will work with the members of this committee to achieve a comprehensive, sustainable and socially reliable private business sector.</p><p>  If I came in here today and told the members that 324,000 of our citizens were being discriminated against because they are from the Traveller community, were black, gay, disabled or even Protestant, they would be able to immediately sort it out for me.  They would right the wrong and give me a solution, but there are 324,000 self-employed people within the SME community who are being treated differently from others because of who and what they are.  They work the same as everyone else; some would say they work harder.  They pay the same taxes, actually we pay higher taxes.  They pay the same rates and the same property tax yet they are treated differently.  They are even regarded in many areas throughout the country as local heroes because they employ thousands of people who were responsible for the economy of many small towns and villages.  However, when things go wrong for them their treatment is deplorable in comparison to others, in particular their own employees.  It is our experience that the vast majority of the self-employed who subsequently become unemployed have already invested their savings in an attempt to keep their businesses afloat and are therefore very much on the bread line when their business closes.  They have no additional income and in many instances they are highly indebted.</p><p>  We have heard the Minister for Social Protection on this issue.  She constantly and consistently outlines that despite constraints, the Government is determined to do its utmost to protect the most vulnerable in society and among the most vulnerable in society currently are the self-employed people who have lost their businesses.  That is borne out by many spokespersons from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Salvation Army and other similar organisations.  </p><p>  The system in Ireland is completely unfair as it is based on antiquated, bureaucratic and cumbersome legislation.  There is something badly wrong when a system that provides automatic welfare entitlements to employees in the event of a company closing down will not give a cent to the company owner, leaving thousands of individuals and their families on the bread line.  The system is driving some of our entrepreneurs to emigrate.  That is in total contrast to the United States where business failure is regarded as a badge of courage and entrepreneurs, with the scars of business, are seen as local heroes.</p><p>  The facts are that an employee who loses his or her job has an immediate entitlement to benefits.  A self-employed person has none.  There is no means test for the unemployed employee but the self-employed person is fully means tested.  The personal savings of the employee are not assessed.  All the savings of the self-employed are assessed.  Any other income in the employee's case is not assessed but all income is fully assessed for the self-employed.  The co-habitee income is not assessed on the employee but it is assessed on the self-employed person.  The value of all property is ignored for the employee but the value of all the property other than the family home is taken into account for the self-employed.  Invalidity is covered for the employees but it is not covered for the self-employed, and disability is covered for the employee but not for the self-employed.  </p><p>  Right down the line, when it comes to the social welfare system, a self-employed person who loses their business and loses their job is at the end of the queue.  We are happy that the self-employed people generate employment and wealth, and pay higher taxes, but in the event of those people becoming ill, incapacitated or unemployed, they find themselves without the support given to their employees.  That is economically unsound.  It is a disincentive to entrepreneurship as well as morally repugnant.</p><p>  It is bad enough that the self-employed are crippled by the loss of their business in many cases, and they have lost their life savings, without being further penalised and humiliated by the State.  We urgently require reform of the social welfare system.  ISME is recommending that the self-employed and proprietary company directors be allowed choose a higher PRSI contribution, as has been mentioned already.  It will be an opt in or opt out, therefore, if they choose to pay a higher rate of PRSI they will be covered.  If they do not, they will remain as is, so to speak.</p><p>  The current method of assessing the self-employed for jobseeker's allowance should be simplified with regard to income, spousal income, and assets and savings.  We also believe there is a need for a national awareness information campaign aimed at the self-employed in regard to their entitlements and their benefits.  Information also on the classification of different types of employment - the difference between contracts of and contracts for service - must be included.</p><p>  While ISME acknowledges that it is not the role of the social insurance system to promote and encourage entrepreneurship, we would also say it is not its job to hinder it.  The current system is acting as a disincentive and an inhibitor of entrepreneurship, which significantly and unnecessarily penalises the self-employed.</p><p>  As I stated at the outset, we rely on the Members of the Oireachtas to understand not only the role but also the needs of the SME sector and I ask them to consider the needs of the 324,000 citizens who are currently discriminated against as self-employed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-26a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis Dolan" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014032600004#D00500"><p>The Self-Employed Alliance from Dundalk would like to thank the committee for inviting us back to further highlight our case.  It is clear that the self-employed are treated in an unequal, unfair and inequitable way compared to the PAYE sector.  We all strive, want, need and aspire to a fair, equal, just and transparent working society for all without any discrimination or a two tier-society yet as we outlined in detail in our previous submission, inequality and discrimination exists to this day for self-employed individuals.  They were continuing to come knocking on our door up to 24 March 2014.</p><p>  In the past six weeks, one of our members had to let his only two members of staff go after two years working for him.  They both went to the Department of Social Protection, registered and were in receipt of all supports and services within a very short period enabling them to sustain some semblance of a lifestyle.  When the self-employed owner whose business had ceased went to the same Department of Social Protection office seeking help and support, he got nothing.  Essentially, he was interrogated and asked about potential assets but he had none other than the family home.  He was asked for the two previous years' accounts to allow them be scrutinised.  He was informed that after some time an assessment officer would be appointed to examine his circumstances, etc.  The individual literally has got nothing.  All his funding and effort went into the business yet, unfortunately, his business failed.  During the course of his time in business this person paid all his rent, rates, staff, etc.  That has generated revenue for staff families, which in turn circulated to the benefit of the local economy.  The same individual has been left high and dry, and quite clearly is treated as a second class citizen.</p><p>  The system in its current form is not fit for purpose and clearly treats self-employed people in a discriminatory and unequal way.</p> <p>Clearly there are simple and effective measures that can be implemented immediately to provide a level playing field. </p><p> It seems many self-employed are deemed to be great when things are going well, generating employment and revenue for all concerned as is pointed out in various CSO reports, but if suddenly that self-employed individual hits hard times and ceases trading, all supports and services are pulled and a barrage of unnecessary hurdles are put in place.</p><p> The enormous contribution self-employed people bring to the social and economic fabric of our society is acknowledged.  I will give a snapshot of the contribution small and micro businesses bring to the Irish economy.  Small workplaces employing fewer than 50 people account for just over 1.25 million, 60% of the Irish workforce - 940,000 employees, 209,000 self-employed and 104,600 self-employed with employees.</p><p> Small enterprises employing fewer than 50 people generated more than half of the total turnover in the service sector.  Turnover of small service sector enterprises increased by 65% between 2000 and 2004 to reach almost &euro;74 billion in revenues based on CSO figures, a not insignificant amount.  Small enterprises in the service sector employ an average of five people and have an average turnover of just under &euro;900,000.  In the second quarter of 2006 three quarters of all people in employment in small work places were classified as employees.  Just over 8% were classified as self-employed with paid employees.  Nearly 17% were self-employed without any paid employees.  Of the 4,418 enterprises, employing three or more people in Ireland, 81% accounted for small industrial enterprises.  Almost half of these enterprises had fewer than ten people employed. </p><p> Our alliance, representing the self-employed and its ever-growing numbers, predominately represents what I would call self-employed micro businesses employing approximately three to five people.  We feel it is somewhat disingenuous to bundle us in with the CSO definition of having up to 50 employees.  The dynamic of a micro business employing three to five people is significantly different from those small business employing ten people or more.  Therefore a distinction or a category change is urgently required.</p><p> Although the valuable contribution of the self-employed to the Irish economy is acknowledged, nothing has changed and glaring inequalities remain.  In fact things on the horizon may make things worse for the self-employed, notably the looming threat from the banks, which has in fact passed the threat stage as banks are now stopping loans and calling in overdrafts, targeting in particular small and micro businesses.  Allowing this to happen will have dire consequences across the entire social and economic infrastructure of Ireland, especially bearing in mind the contribution of the self-employed as a whole.  We should not forget that the taxpayers ultimately bailed out the banks.</p><p> On 19 March I called to the social welfare office in an effort to establish what supports are available to a self-employed person.  The level of ignorance, and the lack of knowledge and transparency are alarming.  Not only did I encounter this, but having spoken to many of our members it is clear that little or nothing has changed even though in October 2012 we were told social welfare offices could and would provide pertinent information.  When I requested a copy of the publication, Your Social Security Rights in Ireland - A guide for EU Citizens from the Department of Social Protection, I was met with blank stares.  Having eventually located it on the web all I can see are two minuscule general references to self-employed with no detailed information whatsoever.</p><p> The Government is encouraging more and more people to embrace the self-employed route and entrepreneurial spirit.  While we welcome this, some of the more cynical might suggest it is a safety valve because if these enterprise fail, then as legislation stands the Government has to give them little or nothing.  As we all know, the percentage of start-up failures is very high.  So with few if any support structures in place for the self-employed it is akin to walking the high wire without a safety net.  The current clarion call by the politicians encouraging people into the self-employed route should come with a clear health and safety warning </p><p> Since we submitted our 17 reasons or disadvantages for the self-employed nothing seems to have changed and as pointed out things are nominally worse. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-26a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1059" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014032600005#E00200"><p>I thank the people for their presentations which are very clear and coherent.</p><p>  For means-tested payments such as job seeker's allowance and disability allowance there is no justification for a difference in treatment between calculating the means of a person who has been employed or a person who has been self-employed.  I note the differences Mr. Dolan has pointed out - I come across them regularly in my constituency work and we will need to continue to bring them to the attention of the Government.</p><p>  In the course of my constituency work I have also noticed that if somebody who had been employed goes off the jobseeker's benefit and applies for jobseeker's allowance, in most cases it is a fairly routine process and the person will be fixed up fairly quickly.  However, there seems to be a mindset among some people in the Department that when formerly self-employed people present they must prove their case and that the default position is that they are not entitled to it.  I have come across cases where people have had to go through several Gestapo-type interrogation sessions just because they happen to have been self-employed, which is wrong.  I believe that some serious re-education on the part of some social welfare officials is necessary and desirable.</p><p>  Regarding the contribution aspect, I take it that the witnesses are proposing that people could opt for a higher rate if they wanted to be included in, for example, an illness-benefit scheme, and could opt for a higher rate again if they want to be included in both an illness-benefit and jobseeker's benefit scheme.  I take it that the witnesses are proposing that the rate would be calculated to make it cost-neutral for the State.  Is that correct?  I do not know if they have worked out the rate.</p><p>  We did some research on this and we produced legislation on the matter.  I believe we proposed a rate of between 3% and 4% extra to cover both on the basis of a voluntary opt-in system, for which there is plenty of precedence.  However, the Minister keeps telling me that it would not work, although I am not clear why.  In so far as I can deduce, the logic of her replies seems to be that at the 3% to 4% level it would not cover the cost and would not be cost neutral.</p><p>  If it is possible to come up with a figure that is reasonable and people can opt to contribute extra to get into one or both of those schemes - illness benefit and jobseeker's benefit - then it is a no-brainer.  What is proposed is changing the law so that people can make their own contributions and get into the system if they are willing to pay for it.  However, I would like to know if the witnesses have worked out the rate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-26a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1079" speakername="Ray Butler" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014032600005#E00300"><p>I thank the various groups for coming today.  I wish to give some insight into what has been happening in this committee over the past three years.  This was a huge issue in the 2011 general election.  I have been pushing this because it affects me personally.  I come from a self-employed background.  I had a shoe shop for 24 years, which unfortunately had to close because of the recession.  When I first became a member of this committee, we met representatives of the Department of Social Protection.  High-ranking civil servants proposed a 30% PRSI contribution for the self-employed.  That was the first figure.  We subsequently invited in representatives from various groups, including the Self-Employed Alliance from Louth and Meath.  They outlined how their businesses collapsed with no access to social protection.</p> <p> There followed the Mangan report, commissioned by the Government, which recommended that a new stamp be introduced at between 4% and 5.5%, which is a long way from the 30% originally suggested by the official from the Department of Social Protection to whom I referred.  We had to wait nearly two full years for that report to be published, after which various groups pronounced that a 4% to 5.5% stamp could not be introduced when small businesses were struggling so much in the recession.  We can see all sides of the issue, but my question to these groups is whether, having dismissed the report entirely, they engaged with the Department and the Minister in a meaningful way.  Did they, for example, make any inquiries about the implementation of the proposals contained in the report?  I would like answers to these questions because I have raised the issue of introducing social protection measures for the self-employed with the Minister, Deputy Burton, on many occasions in the past three years.  She told me that it was never her intention to bring in a full 1.5% rise straight away but rather to introduce an increase of 0.25% in the first year, after which the scheme would be reviewed over a period of time, depending on the state of the economy.</p><p> We are all agreed that the current position in regard to the self-employed is not satisfactory.  We have an obligation to address the social protection shortfalls in the system in respect of that cohort.  Ireland is the only industrialised nation in the European Union which does not offer such protections.  In Britain, for example, benefit is allocated on the basis of profits.  A self-employed person in that country whose business profits are below &euro;7,000 - I am giving the figures in euro - can apply to be exempt from paying any contributions.  Those with profits of &euro;7,000 to &euro;15,000 pay &euro;3.30 per week.  Where the company's profits are between &euro;15,000 and &euro;50,000, the owner pays 9%, which entitles him or her automatically to sick pay and disability pay, with assessment for long-term payment arising thereafter, where applicable.</p><p> I am asking ISME and all the other organisations representing the self-employed to put their weight behind the proposal for a new stamp in order to assist those who contributed so much to the general economy and take some of the burden off the shoulders of PRSI workers.  In fairness to the Minister, she has reduced the threshold such that some self-employed people are now receiving social protection.  However, self-employed people are not putting into the fund; it is PRSI workers who are funding it.  As we know, self-employed people do not want to be begging for anything.  They want to contribute their share.</p><p> We must push for change in this area.  The jury is out, in my view, as to whether any new system of contributions should be mandatory or voluntary.  I really do not know which is preferable.  I have seen many instances in this country where something that is voluntary has fallen by the wayside.  In that context, I am leaning towards making this system mandatory as we move forward. Starting with 0.25% and working up from there gives everybody a chance to get on board as we proceed.  Voluntary systems do not seem to work in this country, looking at how things have worked out on previous occasions.</p><p> I took part in a discussion on local radio recently during the course of which a woman rang in to relate what happened to her family when her self-employed husband became ill.  She was working and bringing home &euro;450 per week to support two adults and two children.  Her husband was assessed as being entitled to &euro;1.60 per week.  As I recall, their mortgage was &euro;1,600 or &euro;1,700 per month.  It is time to stop the grandstanding and move forward on this issue.  We must work together and get the new stamp up and running.  Self-employed people, when the economy starts moving, will begin employing people and helping to rebuild our economy.  We must put in place a system to safeguard them so that if anything goes wrong or their business fails, there is inbuilt protection for them and their loved ones.  I am pleading with all the organisations represented here today to get behind this proposal.  It has been discussed at Cabinet and the relevant Ministers are in favour of it.  I hope all the delegates will leave this meeting prepared to put their weight behind it.  I am confident it can be introduced, if not in this budget then in the following one.  Certainly, I hope we have a system up and running before the end of the Government's term.</p></speech>

Since he and I were appointed to the committee, we have constantly raised the situation of the self-employed.  We have always fought their case in this forum.</p><p>  I thank the delegates for their presentations.  As Deputy Butler has covered most of the ground, I have only a couple of issues I would like clarified.  The portrayal we have had today of the self-employed versus employees carried a suggestion that the latter enjoy unlimited benefits.  In fact, an employee will only receive jobseeker's benefit - for nine months and no more - if he or she has made contributions in the governing tax year.  It is not an automatic entitlement; applicants must meet the criteria that apply.  When we had representatives of the expert group before the committee we spoke at length about the percentage the self-employed would have to pay under a new system.  Those witnesses suggested that self-employed people would have to contribute up to 14.5% or 15% to qualify for the same benefits as employees.  The delegates might like to consider what the return would be for an extra 10% of their earnings in a year, which could suggest that the benefit is not as attractive as one might think.  For a single person, for instance, the payment for nine months of jobseeker's benefit would be approximately &euro;6,700.  I agree that people who get sick must be looked after.  There is not a shadow of a doubt in that regard.  A person who experiences long-term illness is in big trouble, whatever else happens.</p><p>  An issue I find strange and which I am constantly raising is the situation whereby even if a self-employed person is fortunate enough to access jobseeker's allowance, he or she does not receive a credit contribution for that money.  Despite having paid one's self-employed stamp all along, one's pension entitlements will be eroded because in coming off self-employed and onto jobseeker's allowance, one does not get a credited contribution.  That is an anomaly we must review.</p></speech>

I welcome the focus on this issue and commend Senator Moloney and Deputy Butler on their endeavours in this area.  They have been extremely exercised on this urgent issue, which we have found to be prevalent on the doorsteps.  I tend to concur with Deputy Butler on the question of whether any system of contribution should be compulsory.  My concern is that there might be a lack of awareness if the contributions were voluntary, which could result in people falling between the cracks.  Will the witnesses comment on the question of compulsory versus voluntary contributions?</p></speech>

I am particularly pleased to see the witnesses who have come from my own part of the country and who do valuable work in the Dundalk area.  My colleagues, Deputy Butler and Senator Moloney, are very passionate about this issue and have done a great deal of work on it.  My husband is self-employed and I absolutely appreciate the difficulties and fears facing people throughout the country.</p> <p>The big worry is that if somebody gets sick that there is nothing there and one has no comeback.  I agree with Deputy Butler when he said that we need support across the board for the stamp and that it should be made compulsory.  The quicker it is introduced the better and the more progressive it will be.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-26a.27" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Fielding" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014032600007#G00500"><p>I shall mention a couple of things.  Deputy O'Dea asked how much it would be to opt-in but his question was answered by one of his colleagues.</p><p>  With regard to the invalidity and sickness benefit, it would increase by about 1.5%, as mentioned in the Mangan report.  Senator Moloney mentioned 14% or something which was the figure for full entitlements.</p><p>  With regard to the issue of a mandatory or voluntary increase, we must think in terms of competitiveness at the moment because any increase in costs for businesses - self-employed or otherwise - will stop the creation of jobs.  There is a misnomer that self-employed are out of the woods on this issue.  The troika only left a month and a half or two months ago but we still struggle to make ends meet and maintain jobs in this country.  We are lucky that we have seen an increase of 60,000 jobs over the past year.  I hope that will continue but there are still areas where businesses cannot afford an increase in costs.  A mandatory increase would be an increase in taxation.  </p><p>  A point was made about businesses being discriminated against.  The Taoiseach has asked for us to be the best small country in the world for business and I would like it to be the best small country in the world for small business.  On the one hand, a successful business is taxed at the higher rate of 55% compared with 52% for employees.  If a business is unsuccessful and goes wallop one is discriminated against again in this matter.  Whether we talk about voluntary, opt-in, opt-out or whatever, we need to start talking in terms of the entrepreneur.  To become the best small country for business we need to start cherishing entrepreneurs which we are not doing at the moment if we tax them higher, humiliate and penalise them when they are not as successful as they could be.  We are driving these people out of the country.  It is from that point of view that we need to be careful.  A mandatory system will cost jobs.  The scheme can be brought in over a period but there is an opt-in situation.  Small business owners are quite able to understand the differences and can insure themselves if needs be but that needs to be done on a voluntary basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-26a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Martin" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014032600007#G00600"><p>I concur with what Mr. Fielding from ISME has said.  I would not like to see a compulsory charge imposed on anybody.  The nature of self-employment and trying to create one's own business is to make a profit.  One intends to make money at the end of the day and not to fail.  A percentage of people will automatically opt out of anything because they think that they will be very successful and become multi-millionaires so we cannot put restrictions in place.  When one starts a business - and it does not matter what it is - cashflow is crucial in the early years.  If one must suddenly pay an extra 10% in PRSI, for example, it will kill the business from the outset.  We must encourage people instead.</p><p>  I suggest that we look at what happens throughout Europe.  Other European countries have an opt-in or opt-out situation.  Why make it compulsory in Ireland when we must compete with the rest of Europe?  Let us look at what is happening in Europe, take the best of what we think is in Europe and introduce it in Ireland.  We do not have a system that is fit-for-purpose at the moment.  If we are, as the Taoiseach has said, to become the best small country in the world in which to do business then we must take best practice from other countries and adopt it here.</p><p>  With regard to means testing and similar issues, the self-employed situation can be easily changed to automatically include business assets.  For various reasons a lot of people in small businesses - mainly to provide for their old age or avoid paying tax - were encouraged to buy properties by their accountants, for example.  They bought properties to save them from paying capital gains tax and all of the other bits and pieces such as corporation tax.  Let us explain what happens if a limited company goes wallop but the assets are privately owned and there is a mortgage of &euro;0.5 million or &euro;1 million.  One cannot pay the mortgage because the business is gone and one cannot sell it because nobody wants to buy the property.  If one has a property worth &euro;200,000 then it is deemed that one has a notional income of &euro;8,000.  The reality is that one cannot sell the property, nobody will rent it, one cannot get rid of it and one owes the bank money, yet one is still deemed to have a notional income.  That property should be excluded when a self-employed person seeks means testing under the present system.</p><p>  Let us compare the extra benefits an employee has with those for a person who is self-employed.  As Mr. Fielding has said, every extra benefit that we want costs approximately 1% extra.  That is a simple way to look at the matter.  We cannot afford what is being argued for.  If we all became employees and paid the same PRSI because every self-employed person joined a large company or whatever, the country would not be able to afford it.</p><p>  The argument put forward by the Department of Social Protection is that everybody will fail.  We know that only a small percentage of people will claim so I think that it will be a net win.  It is a bit like reducing income tax.  Everyone would benefit from reduced income tax and would, therefore, spend a little bit more money.  If we all contributed a small amount of money only a very small number of people would make a claim.  Over the past 20 or 30-year period businesses have survived, apart from the past couple of years of the recession where lots of businesses have failed.  The majority of small businesses have survived and not failed so there will not be major claims.</p></speech>

I changed my shop ten years ago and in the past ten years I have paid &euro;110,000 in rates to my local authority with no reduction in charges since the recession commenced.  People who sought a reduction in rates from the local authority were basically told, and I have it on record, to pay up or close up.  We have contributed to the system but, without doubt, we have been treated like second-class citizens.  We said the same on the last occasion that we were here and we  stand by that claim.  We want all of our payments taken into consideration and we are not just looking for a hand-out from the Government.  I shall refer to a point made by Deputy O'Dea.  When someone who is classed as self-employed goes to a social welfare officer he or she is classed as an unemployed self-employed person and, as Mr. Dolan said earlier, is met with blank stares because the staff in the social welfare office do not know how to handle such cases.  The first thing that we seek is equality.</p></speech>

Second, in our submission, we also make the point that those in the Self Employed Alliance Dundalk are predominantly in businesses where one individual is perhaps employing three to five people.  These are minuscule or micro enterprises and it is wrong to be bundled, as we are, into the Central Statistics Office's category of "1-50", when the dynamics are so significantly different.  The three of us sitting here are at the minuscule or micro level - call us what one likes.  We are one individual, one owner or one self-employed person.  To mirror the 0.25% increase in order to recognise this point would be a contribution to enable us to get those supports should things go pear-shaped.</p></speech>

I come from this background myself and I see this in my constituency all the time.  The biggest issue that arises for people in the SME sector is that they try everything in their power to stay in business, and social welfare is normally a very last measure.  In many cases, the human dimension kicks in, or the wife says, "We just cannot keep going".  The individuals then apply for jobseeker's allowance because they cannot get benefit and, invariably, they then end up going to the community welfare officer for supplementary welfare allowance.  I am not suggesting nobody qualifies but many do not, and they need something.  However, in many cases, they will go back to being self-employed in another area.  Do the witnesses consider there might be a way of bringing in such a system on a transitional basis, so that instead of the period being six or nine months, it would be three months?  Is there merit in putting forward that case?  I believe it needs to come in and I would like to hear the views of the witnesses thoughts in that regard.</p></speech>

As Mr. Dolan said, he is talking about people who have one to five employees whereas Mr. Fielding could be talking of companies employing a workforce of 50 to 100, with both being termed a small enterprise.</p></speech>

When I was self-employed, if my accountant had told me I had to pay another 1.5% onto the 4.5%, and given I would be paying my income tax or, if I was not making a profit, I would be paying tax on my drawings, then surely to God I would have swapped a little of this to put onto a stamp in order to protect my home and my wife and children.  Let common sense prevail.  When the Mangan report was published, many groups came out and categorically said small businesses could not do this.  We all know small businesses are suffering but nobody spoke to the Minister or the Department about what way it was going to be implemented.  If that was the case, the Minister would have said, as she said to me immediately afterwards when I brought it up under Topical Issues, that she never had any intention of putting 1.5% straight away onto the 4%, and that she was going to introduce this in stages.</p><p>  We could be further down the road in this regard.  The big question is whether we make it voluntary or mandatory.  We have seen things done on a voluntary basis in this country before and I keep repeating that they have not worked.  I believe the way forward is to do this on a mandatory basis and to bring it in at 0.25%.  As Mr. Dolan and the others are saying, let us move on and see if it works.  Then, if the economy is going better two or three years down the road, we can then bring in another 0.25%, but at least we will have started to recognise self-employed people for the first time in the history of the State through social protection.  This would mean they do not have to beg for their payments or wait to see if the community welfare officer is up to speed on self-employed people and social protection, because if the community welfare officer is not up to speed on this, there is no money to feed the person's family or pay the mortgage.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, before we can jointly get together to make a push to achieve something we need to have some clarity as to what exactly we are trying to achieve.  Mr. Fielding said the figure for the extra social insurance benefit to qualify would be 1.5%.  That is based on a mandatory system, as the expert report stated.  If social insurance is applied across the board to all the self-employed and everybody had to pay, the figure would be 1.5% to make the extension of these benefits cost-neutral.  However, the Minister and her Department are saying, and I happen to agree with them on this occasion, that if there is a voluntary system, that 1.5% contribution will not work.</p><p>  With regard to the voluntary, opt-in, opt-out system that some are recommending, nobody seems to have a figure for what would work with such a system.  This is probably because it is contingent on a number of things which we do not yet know, such as how many people will sign up and so on.  We want to progress this and to move ahead, but we have two different points of view coming across here from the witnesses who have come in.  Some are opposed to a compulsory system and-----</p></speech>

That is a crucial issue because the solution to this, if everybody agreed on a compulsory system, is a 1.5% increase, which can be done gradually.

The current situation is that there is a shortfall in the PRSI pot which is then subsidised by general taxation.  This goes for everybody but if this was to be done for the self-employed, it would be subsidised out of the general taxation pot, so it is not like nobody is going to pay for it.  It is not even that the Government is paying for it as it is the taxpayer who pays.  That is an important point.  Mr. Martin said the contribution was 7% in the UK.</p></speech>

We met the Minister prior to the publication of the Mangan report and, as Mr. Martin stated, this is an issue we have been raising for the past two or three years.  We discussed the voluntary proposal with the Minister and she was very clear that if she or her Department considered it, then it would be from a mandatory perspective.  The question we must ask in that regard is "Why?" and the answer is that the system is just not flexible enough to allow it to be voluntary.  It seems a little backward that we have a social welfare system which does not allow us to be voluntary or to be reflective of the current environment.  Many other European countries can facilitate this voluntary opt-in, opt-out model.  It is the system, as much as anything else, which is not allowing this.  We sought a meeting with the Minister following the publication of the Mangan report.  We did not receive a response from her Department.  We have spoken to her about this issue but we have not had a formal, face-to-face meeting with her following the publication of the Mangan report.</p></speech>

When he passed away, he was working for the health board.  We all expected that my mother would receive a pension from the health board but when we delved into the matter, we discovered that my father had opted out of the widows and orphans scheme.  He probably only saved &pound;2 or some similarly small sum per week by doing so.  If people are given the choice of opting out and if they believe they might save some money as a result, then they will do so.  Like my father, they are not thinking about the future.  As a result of my father seeking to save money by opting out - or, perhaps, by choosing not to opt in originally - my mother was left without a widow's pension from the health board.</p><p>  Reference was made to the assessment of capital or business property in the case of self-employed people and that fact that the latter are treated differently.  I must point out that if a claimant owns property that he or she is not personally using - such as the formal business premises - and which is no longer used in the context of operating the business, then the value of this asset is assessed using a standard formula and the first &euro;20,000 of the capital is disregarded.  That is exactly the same as employees who claim jobseeker's benefit or allowance.</p></speech>

I take this opportunity to point out that I was previous self-employed.  Many of the witnesses referred to discrimination and the fact that they want the self-employed to be treated equally.  If we are introducing a voluntary code of PRSI for the self-employed, then that is a further discrimination albeit one that is positive in nature.  I am of the view that this runs counter to the argument to the effect that they should be treated the same.</p></speech>

We are not being treated the same at present.  That is the point.</p></speech>

We can go down the road of describing all the ills visited upon self-employed people.  I have been self-employed all my life and I never want any other person to go through what I endured when I lost my business.  I did not have a penny for 14 or 15 months.  I did not even have enough money to feed my children.  There were nights when I sat in a dark room wondering from where I was going to get the money to put food on the table not to mention to pay the mortgage.  That is why I am here.  I am passionate about this matter and I want us to do something.</p></speech>

We are of the view that we are being discriminated against and that we are not getting the same crack of the whip.  If we want to get this right, then it must be done gradually over a period.  Allowing us to opt in over such a period is probably a better way to proceed rather than hitting us with a big stick from day one.  I am aware that jobs will be lost if we do that.  It must be remembered that we are dealing here with risk takers.  Owner-managers of small businesses are the risk takers.  They will assess whether it is good to opt in and they will accept what they will ultimately receive.  If they do not opt in, their names will not be in the pot in the long term.  Again, we must take into account-----</p></speech>

A person who owns a small business and who is experiencing a rough time will, with the best will in the world, drop certain things.  Everyone agrees in principle that there should be jobseeker's benefit for the self-employed.  That is a given.  The question that arises, therefore, is how to design it in such a way that will allow everyone to buy in.  It would be a terrible shame if we could not find a way for everyone to move forward.  I accept that there may be a need to reconsider the position in respect of a number of areas.  Self-employed people become so battered down from trying to obtain social welfare payments, that this, in itself, almost becomes a business for them.  Some of them lose their entrepreneurial flair as a result.  They must be facilitated in the context of obtaining something in the first couple of months of unemployment.  Many of those to whom I refer will return to self-employment when they get their next venture off the ground.</p><p>  I apologies for interrupting Mr. Fielding.  Everyone present is on the same page but the question which arises relates to the method we might use in order to encourage people to come on board.</p></speech>

A voluntary contribution will not work.  The contribution would have to be mandatory.  The Minister has agreed to the introduction of a contribution of 0.25% for the first couple of years.  My argument is that a self employed person who is told by his or her accountant that he or she is required to pay X amount of income tax, or, if not making a profit, pay tax on drawings could opt to have 0.25% of that money paid in PRSI to ensure he or she is protected in terms of income to support his or her family and to pay the mortgage.  It is common sense.  The witnesses are suggesting that the contribution be voluntary.  However, nothing voluntary has ever worked out in this country.  Let us be honest and call a spade a spade.</p><p>  I have been visited at my constituency by many self employed persons, some of whom were men who had worked all of their lives and as a result of the recession became unemployed.  The fear and desolation in their faces was awful.  On top of this, because they were self employed there were entitled to nothing.  Let us be honest, some of these people went on to do awful things to themselves.  We must put in place something to assist the self employed and whatever is put in place must be mandatory.  One quarter of one per cent will not make much difference in the longer term.  </p><p>  It was mentioned earlier that this could result in the loss of jobs.  That is not true.  As the economy improves we can increase the contribution.  It is important a new system is put in place.</p></speech>

We are speaking predominantly about businesses employing one and two people.  It is important that distinction is made.  A system akin to that introduced in the UK would work.  We replicate so many of the laws and so on introduced in the UK.  The introduction here of a system similar to that being introduced in the UK would in my view appear to be a logical starting point.</p></speech>

In regard to the contribution being voluntary, I recall that previously when a person's salary exceeded &pound;1,600 he or she could opt-in to paying additional tax or PRSI - I am not sure which it was - for which he or she would get a slightly higher old age pension.  On the advice of my father and my employer at the time, I voluntarily paid that extra money.  At the time I was working for a large multinational company.  Everybody with whom I was working paid the additional money in the hope of getting higher pensions in the future.</p><p>  In regard to the 0.25% contribution rate, to what will payment of that contribution entitle people?  In previous discussions I had with the Department on this issue, it was stated that contributions of 3% or 4% would be required in respect of one benefit.  What will the person who pays that 0.25% contribution get for doing so?</p></speech>

There is no perfect solution in regard to the position of self employed persons and social welfare entitlements.  While what is being proposed is not perfect, it is a start.</p></speech>

In regard to whether the contribution should be voluntary or mandatory, the only way forward is for it to be mandatory.  What is proposed is that self employed persons pay 0.25% in the first instance and that the contribution then be increased to 4.25% over time.  This can be reviewed in the future when the economy recovers.  If the scheme is successful, the contribution can be increased by a further 0.25% and so on.   It is a simple way forward, which is fair to everybody.</p></speech>

At the time of the issuing of the Mangan report, many companies said they believed the scheme was a great idea.  However, when they realised it was not giving them the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, they pulled back a little.  As Mr. Martin asked, what will they be getting for it?  I recognise the Deputy's point that we are all on the one page in contending we need more recognition of the importance of self-employment through the PRSI and social welfare and protection systems, but it is a question of a voluntary arrangement.

Perhaps it would be a good idea to invite the Minister for Finance to come to our next meeting.  We could discuss this with him in addition to the Minister for Social Protection.</p></speech>

If the arrangement is made mandatory, with a figure of 0.35%, this results in a figure of 4%.  I have lived long enough in this country to know taxes increase all the time.  That is my difficulty from a small business perspective.  If I am taxed more, I will be unable to make any more jobs that would allow us all to get out of this recession.

We are joined by Mr. Feargal &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, principal officer in the EU and international division, Mr. Antoine Mac Donncha, head of the legal unit, Mr. Enda Newton, senior lawyer in the financial services division and Mr. Paul Keogh, assistant principal officer in the financial services division.  An written invitation to attend was sent to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, but I understand he is not in a position to attend.</p><p>  The witnesses are here to assist the committee in its examination of the draft heads of the Central Bank Bill 2014.  These draft heads were referred to the joint committee last Wednesday, 19 March and I understand the Minister intends to seek the approval of the Government next week to publish the Bill, with a view to enactment by the end of April or as soon as practical after that.  Procedures relating to consideration by committees of the draft heads of Bills are relatively new and the Houses of the Oireachtas Service is finalising a protocol with Departments aimed at ensuring the system works smoothly and that committees can do their work properly.  Timely notice of the heads of the Bill and adequate time for consideration at committee is part of this.  That said, discussion will begin with opening remarks from Mr. &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in and Mr. Mac Donncha, following which members may put appropriate questions.</p><p>  I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. </p></speech>

This legislation has two purposes, the first of which is to extend Part 3 of the Central Bank Act 1971 so that it will apply to building societies as well as to banks.</p> <p>Specifically, this will make provision for the effective and expeditious transfer of the business and other assets and liabilities of building societies, and for those and other purposes to amend the Central Bank Act 1971.  The second purpose is to make provision for certain payments out of the central fund to the account established by the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, as agent on behalf of the euro area member states to receive payments for the purpose of providing financial assistance to the Hellenic Republic and for related matters.  I will deal with the measure for the Hellenic Republic while my colleague Mr. Mac Donncha will deal with the amendment of the Central Bank Act.</p><p> The second purpose of the Bill relates to measures for the Hellenic Republic, which I will refer to as Greece from now on.  This is to provide a legislative basis for Ireland to make transfers to an intermediate account operated by the ESM on behalf of the euro area member states.  These transfers are to be an amount equivalent to the income that accrues to the Central Bank of Ireland from the securities market programme portfolio of Greek Government debt.  In November 2012, as part of a package of measures designed to help Greece, the euro area member states agreed that the securities market programme-related income of member states would be transferred to Greece under certain conditions.  In January 2013 the euro area member states agreed that the ESM would be the agent for making such a payment.</p><p> The ESM accordingly established an intermediate account into which the euro area member states can place an amount equivalent to the income of the securities market programme portfolios accruing to the national central banks as from budget year 2013.  Member states under a full financial assistance programme are not required to participate in this scheme for the period in which they are in receipt of financial assistance.  As Ireland exited its EU-IMF programme of financial assistance in December 2013, the measure now applies to us.  The next transfer date for this measure is 1 July 2014, which is the earliest date by which Ireland could be required to make a payment.  The necessary legislation needs to be in place by then.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-26a.168" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Antoine Mac Donncha" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014032600004#F00200"><p>The essence of this aspect of the legislation is to extend the application of Part III of the Central Bank Act 1971 from its current application, whereby it applies to banks only, to also apply to building societies.  Only one building society exists in the State, ICS Building Society.  The extension will enable the transfer of assets and liabilities from building societies to banks.  There is existing legislation analogous to Part III of the 1971 Act which applies to building societies under Part X of the Building Societies Act 1989, however those provisions would enable the transfer of engagements from ICS only to another building society, of which there are none.</p><p>  In July 2013, Bank of Ireland agreed an amendment to its restructuring plan which had been agreed with the European Commission in respect of the State aid received by Bank of Ireland.  This amendment allowed Bank of Ireland to retain its life assurance subsidiary, New Ireland Assurance Company.  As part of this amendment Bank of Ireland committed to certain substitution measures which included the sale of the ICS distribution platform together with, at the option of any acquirer, up to &euro;1 billion of mortgages and up to &euro;1 billion of matching deposits.  Bank of Ireland has until 30 June 2014 to execute this commitment.  Bank of Ireland is not required to sell ICS, rather to offer certain specified assets and liabilities of ICS for sale.  To facilitate this potential sale, the State committed to enact appropriate legislation by 31 December 2013.  This deadline has not been met but the Department of Finance has continued to liaise with the European Commission to keep it informed of our progress.</p><p>  The Central Bank Act 1971 can be used by banks as it stands to transfer between each other their assets and liabilities under a scheme of transfer.  Part III transfer schemes have been used successfully many times.  This legislation is not currently available to a building society but is limited exclusively to banks.  The amendments proposed in these heads of Bill would bring building societies within the scope of the existing provisions which apply to banks and enable the transfer of assets and liabilities from ICS to a bank pursuant to that framework.  Any transfer of assets and liabilities pursuant to the 1971 Act is subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Central Bank.</p><p>  If the Bill is enacted, it is anticipated that ICS would apply, pursuant to Part III of the 1971 Act, to transfer of the bulk of its assets and liabilities to Bank of Ireland.  It is further anticipated that an onward transfer of some of those assets and liabilities to a third party could subsequently be effected.  The restructuring plan agreed between Bank of Ireland and the European Commission requires that the Commission would approve any purchaser of the ICS platform.  The primary purpose of this condition in the restructuring plan is to enhance competition in the mortgage intermediaries market.</p></speech>

The provision relating to ICS-Bank of Ireland resulted from an amendment to the restructuring plan which was approved by the European Commission.  It was part of that process and was a condition which had to be put through.  For ICS to effect that amendment, an amendment is required to the Central Bank legislation so that assets can be first transferred to Bank of Ireland, which can then sell them on.  Is that what is happening here?</p></speech>

As part of that restructuring plan the State committed to enact the necessary legislation which would enable the transfer of the ICS platform to take place.  The mechanism we are using to give effect to that undertaking is to amend the 1971 Act.  We could potentially have legislated in other ways to do it but this is the way we are giving effect to it.</p></speech>

In that sense it could be seen as a precursor.  The securities market programme was announced by the ECB in 2010.  The aim was to address tensions in certain market segments which it considered were hampering monetary policy transmission mechanisms.  Under the programme, euro area national central banks and the ECB could conduct interventions in the euro area public and private debt securities markets.  It began in May 2010 and the last purchases took place in February 2012.</p> <p>The programme was formally terminated in September 2012.</p></speech>

The position outlined at the time was that these measures were considered applicable to Greece.  Ireland, as a country heading to the exit of its programme, had different requirements and we would seek measures appropriate to Ireland.  As I noted, all the measures provided for Greece come with conditionality attached.  We have exited our programme and its specific conditionality.  Other measures were provided to us, including extension of maturities of the European Financial Stability Facility and ESM loans, as well as the arrangement for the promissory notes, both of which are very important to Ireland.</p></speech>

We thought for the sake of convenience it could be attached to another Bill.  That was not well received and in view of that response the Minister considered it was not appropriate to do that.  It could have been done soon afterwards, late last year, but the other issue relating to the ICS measure was current and the two were attached and finalising the ICS measure was more complex.</p><p>  The Greek measure needs to be done by 1 July but the ICS element is more urgent.</p></speech>

Preparing it for the deadline of 31 December is one thing but we have to wait for the next vehicle, or legislation, to which it can be attached.  It is travelling with this legislation on its own rather than wait for a vehicle to come along.  That is partly why there is a gap.</p><p>  We have been liaising with the European Commission.  The legislation is a commitment in the restructuring plan to enable any onward sale but in the run-up to Christmas there was no immediate, pressing prospect of a sale of the ICS platform so there was no particular reason to have the legislation in place to facilitate that.</p></speech>

The bonds might be bought on the secondary markets at a lower price than the price at which they issued but they are redeemed at the full price.  Once they are redeemed the difference is the profit.  The value at purchase would be known.  They mature in the early years so there is a lot less maturing in the later years.  Therefore because there is less maturing the amount of profit reduces accordingly.  I do not know what the individual rate on these is but this is the calculation that was agreed and fixed at a point in time.</p></speech>

The position outlined last year was that these were the measures considered appropriate to Greece, and Ireland would pursue measures appropriate to itself in the context of its exit from a programme.  More fundamentally all these measures for Greece come with conditions attached.  The question is whether it was appropriate to seek those measures and to continue in conditionality.</p><p>  While we still face many challenges, the other euro member states would have to agree to this and the question is whether this was something one wanted to ask other euro member states, some of which, notwithstanding our current difficulties, have considerably lower GDP per head than we do.  The decision was taken that there were other approaches more appropriate to Ireland.  Other arrangements have been made for us in respect of the extension of maturities on our EFSM loans and the promissory note.</p> <p>To enact this legislation would be a breach of our commitment given in the November 2012 ECOFIN meeting.

There is potential for an unregulated third party to purchase those loans, in which case we will have a repeat of what is already under way in terms of mortgage holders no longer being protected by the Financial Ombudsman and the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  Has that issue been considered or is it not relevant to the current discussion?</p></speech>

It cannot be ruled out that an unregulated financial service provider might ultimately try to acquire these assets.  That is not something we are aware is likely to happen but clearly it is not impossible and the statutory scheme would not necessarily preclude it.  However, it is worth bearing in mind that the purpose of including in the restructuring plan the requirement to sell assets on is to encourage competition in that sector of the market.  For somebody to participate properly and compete in that sector of the market, authorisations would be required.  I suggest the Commission would be unlikely to approve a sale to somebody who was seeking to acquire these mortgages simply to extract value from them and who was not operating actively in the market to generate business.  It is much less likely in this instance that the assets would travel to an unregulated provider but clearly it cannot be ruled out.</p></speech>

It is not the case that the protections would not be needed.  I will not support the legislation if it facilitates the sale of &euro;1 billion in home loans to an unregulated third party and leaves mortgage holders without protection.</p></speech>

I cannot say that is certain, however.  The legislation enables the transfer of assets from ICS to Bank of Ireland, or any bank that is a regulated financial services provider subject to the code of conduct and other protections.  It is anticipated that there will be an onward sale.  It is not clear at this stage who will ultimately acquire the assets but there is no indication as matters stand that they will be sold in a subsequent sale to somebody who is not a regulated financial service provider.</p></speech>

I am sure we will have ample time to debate the Bill on Second and Committee Stages.  Could we include a provision that the assets can only be sold on to regulated institutions given that the Bill only amends the Central Bank Acts in respect of ICS?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-26a.277" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Antoine Mac Donncha" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014032600007#J01700"><p>Effectively, the Bill enables the anticipated transfer of assets from ICS to Bank of Ireland.  Those assets will then be held by a regulated financial service provider, along with all the other assets currently held by Bank of Ireland, and they will occupy exactly the same legal position as the bank's other assets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-26a.278" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014032600007#J01800"><p>The problem is that we know these assets will be sold on to a third party.  We do not have that knowledge in respect of the other assets in Bank of Ireland.  If that bank was to sell a big loan book, Mr. Mac Donncha can rest assured that Opposition Deputies, at least, would argue that the same protections should be put in place.  It stretches our generosity to ask us to facilitate the transfer of assets in the knowledge that they will be sold to a third party which could be unregulated and it is not something I am willing to approve.  Mr. Mac Donncha still has not answered my question on why we cannot include a provision preventing the transfer of the assets.  That would not address the broader issue but we know this will happen soon after the legislation is passed.  The excuses given on the other transaction related to the role of the special liquidator and potential court cases.  There is no such excuse in this context.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-26a.279" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Enda Newton" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014032600007#J01900"><p>I refer the Deputy to the protections afforded by virtue of requiring the Commission's approval for any transaction that may occur in respect of these assets.  In order to receive the Commission's approval, a prospective purchaser must be reasonably expected to obtain the necessary approvals from a relevant regulatory authority.  There is a certain security in considering the matter from the Commission's perspective and realising that if it is appropriate and necessary for approvals to be sought, the Commission would require this before it approved the transaction.  The Commission has a role to play in authorising certain transactions, having regard to the regulatory status of the purchaser.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-26a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1107" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014032600007#J02000"><p>I will begin where Deputy Doherty left off.  I would love to share Mr. Newton's optimism but I do not trust the European Commission for one second, given all that it has been party to in respect of this country.</p> <p>Nor do I trust the Government, because the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has no difficulty allowing sales to happen without any protections of the type of which Mr. Newton speaks.  For what Mr. Newton is suggesting to be true, the European Commission would have to be insisting on a higher level of guarantee than the Minister for Finance and Government are happy with.  It is not Mr. Newton's area, as this is an area of policy, but I do not share his comfort in any way.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, will happily allow these assets be sold to the highest bidder, and to hell with the mortgage holders, just as he is doing in letting the special liquidator for IBRC do what it is doing.  The Government's position on this is clear.</p><p> The question Deputy Doherty asked, which was not answered, was whether we can legally ring-fence these assets as they transfer into Bank of Ireland so that under Irish law - I will not be relying on the European Commission to protect anyone in Ireland - Bank of Ireland could be prevented from selling them on to an unregulated entity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-26a.282" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Antoine Mac Donncha" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014032600008#K00200"><p>The primary difficulty with that approach would be that if we were to introduce a provision of that nature, anybody who is looking to purchase any assets from Bank of Ireland thereafter would have to satisfy himself or herself that those assets were not part of this bundle of mortgages, for example, that transferred in from ICS, and that would inevitably lead to enormous complications down the line.  If one tries to differentiate a particular class of assets such as that which will be transferred into a larger pool, one will give rise inevitably to legal complications.  That is aside entirely from the fact that would, I suggest, inevitably give rise to issues as to whether Bank of Ireland would be well advised to seek to transfer from ICS into Bank of Ireland to invoke that sort of restriction because of the complications or contamination effect it would be likely to have on the rest of the bank's pool of assets.</p><p>  The issue of whether it would be legally possible is primarily a matter for the Attorney General, not necessarily us, to consider, but it is clear that it would certainly give rise to complexities if we were to attempt to do it.</p><p>  It is worth bearing in mind that what is being proposed here is to effectively transfer from one regulated financial service provider to another.  That is what the legislation is giving effect to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-26a.283" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1107" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014032600008#K00300"><p>It is not.  Deputy Doherty has covered this.  That may be what will be contained in the Bill, but it is clear that Bank of Ireland will have a requirement to sell on many of these assets and it is not true to state that all we are looking at here is a transfer from ICS to Bank of Ireland.  We are clearly looking at a transfer from ICS to Bank of Ireland to a third party.  I cannot think of any regulated entity that will be interested in buying loan books in Ireland.  None of them is buying any of the other loan books.  Those who are coming in to buy them are the distressed asset specialists.  They are the folk from Dallas and from all of those other places.  Those folk are getting ready to start bidding on Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB and all sorts of other distressed assets and we know that will happen.  As for who will buy them, they will be bid for by the same unregulated entities that are bidding for the IBRC loan book.  Whilst it might be technically true on this Bill, it is not accurate to state that all we are talking about is a transfer from ICS to Bank of Ireland.</p></speech>

It is worth bearing in mind that the core of what is being transferred is the ICS platform.  That is something that is of interest, not to an hedge fund which is looking to exact value out of existing assets but to somebody who will be generating business.  Such a purchaser will almost inevitably be seeking authorisation.  As matters stand, we have no indication whatsoever that there is any likelihood of this.  First, it is not necessarily the case that the mortgages would be transferred on.  That is something that will be there at the option of the purchaser - whether mortgages and matching deposits are included as part of the transaction.  Even if they are, it is unlikely that any purchaser would not be a regulated financial service provider because it will want to maximise the value of the ICS platform.</p></speech>

If one buys a platform, one buys intellectual property and other assets that enable one to carry out a business, which, I am sure, any potential acquirer would intend to grow.  There are options as to whether any particular acquirer acquires mortgages and matching deposits.  I suppose it is not a forgone conclusion that any particular acquirer would acquire any mortgages or deposits.  This is a measure that is intended to promote competition and competition, necessarily, from an acquirer's perspective, involves the growing of one's business.  It would not necessarily attract the type of entities to which Deputy Donnelly referred.</p></speech>

That would be a bizarre situation.  While I accept that it is not a foregone conclusion, it is highly likely.  One will not buy a platform without bringing the mortgage book in with it.  One will not have the whole back end of a retail banking operation sitting there waiting for the first few mortgages to gain approval.  One will have a mortgage book on which one's staff will work at the back end and one will add to and subtract from it all the time.  Am I correct?  There is no way anyone will buy a banking platform and not attach an existing loan book to it.  Would Mr Newton agree?</p></speech>

The conversation we have just held suggests that ICS, as a brand and a retail network with all its IP, whatever that IP may be, will continue to exist.  From the public's perspective, it will not see anything.  This is an ownership issue.  Essentially, ICS will continue to operate.  The staff will continue to be employed.  There will, undoubtedly, be a loan book plugged in to the front end, the retail end.  Is that the idea?  The idea is not that ICS disappears and that this is essentially an asset transfer.</p></speech>

Certainly, it is ironic for me to be concerned about loans leaving Bank of Ireland.  To have one's mortgage owned by an unregulated entity will be an unenviable position for these mortgages holders to be in.

On the basis that Bank of Ireland owns ICS, is it essentially the same suite of so-called solutions being used?</p></speech>

We are clear that is the case so all of them are receiving the same level of protection that is extended across the system as a whole.  I anticipate that if there were some particular difficulty in terms of contrast between ICS mortgage holders or Bank of Ireland mortgage holders, it is something of which we would be aware.  I am not aware whether that particular inquiry has been made.  That is not to say that I am certain nobody has looked at whether there is any difference in approach between ICS and Bank of Ireland.  It is just that I am not in a position to say to the Deputy that somebody has looked at that specifically.  I would be very surprised if there were any significant contrast in the approach being taken by Bank of Ireland, effectively, towards those mortgage holders who are in ICS and those who are in Bank of Ireland.  I do not see any reason it would be likely to differentiate between them.</p></speech>

The answer may be that they are all under the CCMA but AIB and Bank of Ireland customers are under the CCMA even though they are being treated in completely different ways by the two banks.</p><p>  If the Department of Finance wants to credibly appear before this committee and say that it is satisfied that the Bill it will put before it will not adversely affect ICS borrowers, it must know whether they are currently being treated in a different way from Bank of Ireland borrowers.  That is not an unreasonable thing to ask.  Will someone in the Department take a look at that?</p></speech>

It is not to challenge the Bill as such but to scrutinise it.  The Deputy is making a very interesting observation in terms of scrutiny of the Bill that if the loan book of ICS moves in a particular direction, the customers of that loan book, whether their loans are in distress or are performing, would be given an indication as to where they are going.  I think that was the Deputy's request.</p></speech>

They should be informed that legislation pertaining to them and which could affect them in a very substantial way is now being discussed.  They might have views.  We just discussed whether it might be the case that Bank of Ireland would deal differently with mortgages than ICS or whether another third party purchaser might deal even more differently with them.  We can speculate on that.</p><p>  Would it not be fair and reasonable that we should hear from the mortgage holders, or at least that they should know about this and have the opportunity to express their views in the pre-legislative discussion because they might tell us building societies have quite a different regime in terms of how they deal with mortgage holders than banks.</p> <p>Building societies have quite a different regime to banks in terms of how they deal with mortgage holders.  ICS might tell us.  I do not know enough about ICS to say it but part of the reason a distinction was made between banks and building societies in the Central Bank Act 1971, which precluded them from selling on or transferring those assets, was precisely because of the unique character of building societies because they operated on a different philosophy, which one might argue is a slightly more benign, less commercially profit-orientated approach.</p></speech>

The first element the Deputy asked about is whether people should be notified of the legislation.  As matters stand, the Government has not decided to bring the legislation forward but it is something we anticipate it will do.  If the decision is made &ndash; I am not trying to prejudge the Government but it is my expectation that it is likely to happen - then the legislation will be published and there will be an opportunity to engage with people before the legislation is ultimately debated and finalised in the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas has every prerogative to change, amend or reject the legislation as it sees fit.</p><p>  In terms of the second element where Deputy Boyd Barrett is talking about the existing building societies legislation permitting transfer of engagements only to another building society and the different regime that applies to building societies, it is correct to say that in general building societies were, for example, mutual organisations and the profit that would accrue would eventually go back to members.  That is not the case any longer in terms of ICS because although it is a building society there is no economic ownership in the society by its members in the way that would have been the case in the past and as was traditionally the case with building societies.  Effectively, the transfer from ICS to a bank is not the same as would have been the case if one was transferring from a traditional building society to a bank.  One is really moving from like to like.</p></speech>

There are questions to which we do not know the answers in terms of what this might mean for ICS customers.  I do not know how we would do it but I suggest to the Chair that in discussing the heads of the Bill in the pre-legislative stage that ICS customers might be given the opportunity to give their views.  I do not know if that is possible or how we would go about doing it.</p></speech>

The difference between pre-legislative scrutiny and consultancy is an ongoing bugbear.  We do much pre-legislative scrutiny.  Consultancy is an issue for the lead Department while the role of the committee is to scrutinise legislation.  I say that bearing in mind that it is setting a precedent for other matters coming down the line.  Distinguishing between one and the other is a bugbear with all committee Chairs.  A composite position will be taken following today&rsquo;s meeting taking all statements into account.  The point made about the legislation and the Department engaging consultants will be part of the report that will be finalised following the meeting.</p></speech>

I would make the point to the Department and whoever is listening -  I hope the Minister is listening &ndash; that some effort should be made to alert the customers that legislation is being considered which could impact on their mortgages or deposits so that they might have an opportunity to come forward and make their views known.  We do not even know the number involved but it probably runs to thousands or tens of thousands.  That is an entirely reasonable suggestion.  I hope it will be taken on board.</p><p>  I wish to turn to the other issue relating to Greece in order to get clarity on it.  Europe had a bond-buying programme whereby it bought Greek bonds on the secondary market at a significant discount, therefore anticipating a significant profit.  We were part of that.  The anticipated profit made from buying distressed Greek bonds will be given back to Greece.  Europe, and Ireland as part of Europe, is making a benign decision not to profit from Greece&rsquo;s misery but to give the money back to Greece and the legislation will facilitate that.  Is that a reasonable layman&rsquo;s summary of what we are doing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-26a.348" nospeaker="true" time="16:35:00" ><p>Mr. Feargal &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in Yes, it is.  It was not Europe it was the ECB that engaged in the bond-buying process, so it was one part of the EU institutions.  Essentially, it is the estimated or imputed profit that would arise from the difference between the purchase price and the redemption value that would be returned to Greece on the basis of each member state&rsquo;s central bank&rsquo;s estimated share, as it were, of the profit.  It is an amount that is equivalent to that.</p></speech>

The Government had made that clear.  Europe decided not to offer such a deal and we decided not to ask for a similarly benign deal.  That is shameful.  Therefore, it seems reasonable we should do this for Greece but it is an awful pity we did not ask for the same for ourselves.  Mr. &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in said the difference between the two situations is that there was conditionality on Greece getting this deal but there was conditionality on us too in terms of what we did or did not get, depending on how one looks at it.  Is it not true that we had lots of conditions attached?</p></speech>

The disbursement of the funding for the continuing period will be subject to the satisfaction of conditionality.  It will be subject to conditions continuing up to 2026 in the case of Greece.</p></speech>

Consequently, while a commitment is made forward on the income accruing, Ireland's share of that being &euro;126 million, for any particular year, it is just the amount that is assessed to accrue in that year.  For 2014, the assessment is that Ireland's share of the income that will accrue in 2014 will be &euro;31 million and that is what is being provided.  That obviously is based on an assessment that the bonds will be redeemed at par.  It is an annual assessment and so it is the annual redemption each year.</p></speech>

However, if the bonds were not redeemed, we would not get our money back.  Am I correct?  I ask just so members know.  As it happens, I still believe we probably should do it because it is a benign thing to do but if members are passing or discussing legislation, they should know what is involved.  In this case, what is involved is that Ireland will be paying out money from the Central Fund in anticipation of making a profit from these bonds if they are redeemed.  The assumption is they will be redeemed but it is possible that they might not be redeemed.</p></speech>

Dr. Michalis Stavrinos, ambassador of the Republic of Cyprus to Ireland.  He is accompanied by Mr. Mckrikios from the embassy.  They are both very welcome.  I wish, first, to extend my condolences to the ambassador on the sudden death last Saturday of the Defence Minister in Cyprus, Minister Mitsopoulos.  He was only 48 years of age and died from an aneurysm and associated cardiac failure.  He had been promoted as Minister for Defence earlier this month following a reshuffle and prior to his appointment to that position he was Minister for communications.  On behalf of the committee and the members of the committee, I wish to offer my sympathy and condolences to the ambassador's government and to the late Minister's family.  I hope he will convey those sentiments to all concerned.  </p><p>  The ambassador is here today to address the committee on the relaunch of the Cyprus peace talks and the committee very much look forward to hearing about the progress of these talks.  I am sure over the years we have had many discussions in this committee before I became chairman on the Cyprus peace talks but to no avail.</p> <p>After stalling for several years talks have begun again and I look forward to hearing about the headway made in these negotiations.  There is a direct Irish connection as the first Cypriot ambassador to Ireland, Andreas Mavroyiannis, has been selected as the Greek Cypriot negotiator.  His time here will have been important to him.  He was here some time ago and knows what happened in the talks on Northern Ireland.  This experience will be important for him.  I am sure the committee will join me in also wishing the Turkish Cypriot negotiator the best of luck in the coming months.</p><p> We will hear from the Ambassador, followed by questions and answers from committee members.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the honour and the privilege of addressing it on a very important issue of European and international interest.</p><p>  To examine the prospects of achieving a lasting solution to the Cyprus issue, we need to clarify from the beginning the legal and political parameters of the problem.  Cyprus became an independent state in 1960.  On 15 July 1974, the military junta then ruling Greece, with the collusion of a handful of Greek Cypriot collaborators on the island, carried out a coup to overthrow the democratically-elected government of Cyprus.  Although during the five days until the date of the Turkish invasion, 20 July, not a single Turkish Cypriot was killed or even injured Ankara, using the coup as a pretext and in violation of the UN charter, the rules of international law and the Treaty of Guarantee of Cyprus to which it is a signatory, invaded Cyprus purportedly to restore constitutional order.  Even if such a pretext had, for argument's sake, any value, constitutional order was restored three days after the Turkish invasion.  However, instead of withdrawing its forces, Turkey occupied 36.2% of the territory of the country, and has continued to do so for the past 40 years, in spite of UN resolutions calling for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Cyprus.</p><p>  It suffices at this juncture to stress the following point.  It is a paradox, to say the least, for a country occupying EU territory, to even commence accession talks for joining the EU, let alone progress in such a course, while continuing to violate the sovereignty of a member state and fully disregarding all relevant values and principles enshrined in the treaties of the Union.  Impunity for Turkish aggression sends the wrong signal regarding the acceptability or legality of these acts.</p><p>  I come now to the efforts to solve the political problem of Cyprus.  As the Chairman mentioned, successive rounds of UN-sponsored talks over these years have been unsuccessful, always due to the Turkish intransigence.  In 2004, a proposal by the then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem, was put to simultaneous referenda before the two communities of Cyprus.  A total of 75.8% of Greek Cypriots voted against this specific plan, while 64.9% of Turkish Cypriots voted in favour.  However, it was only when illegal settlers from Turkey, who have no legal right to vote, were allowed to do so that this result was achieved.  The Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot votes can easily be explained by the following elements, which were not widely known internationally.  The Annan plan legitimised the presence of nearly all illegal settlers from Turkey, who outnumber the Turkish Cypriots.  It provided for the permanent presence of Turkish troops on Cyprus, and afforded Turkey the right to intervene in Cyprus as it saw fit.  Yet the most abhorrent widespread provisions of the plan were those depriving all Cypriots of fundamental rights guaranteed for every other EU citizen, such as the right to settle in their ancestral homes in the occupied part of Cyprus and exercise their democratic right to own a property, irrespective of the bizonal and bicommunal administrative arrangements of the proposed solution.  The negative outcome of the referendum rendered the Annan plan null and void.</p><p>  Some valuable time was lost recently due to the Turkish side's decision not to have any contact with Cyprus during the Cypriot Presidency of the EU, and to wait passively for the result of the presidential elections in Cyprus which took place a year ago.  As soon as it assumed its duties, the Government of President Anastasiades focused on dealing with the financial crisis that struck Cyprus last March and applied itself to the Cyprus issue in the autumn of 2013.  Following the insistence of the Greek Cypriot side on the need for defining and reaffirming the parameters that would be contained in an agreed solution, the two communities of Cyprus spent a period of productive exchanges which led, on 11 February 2014, to a joint communique prescribing the shared principles on which the renewed talks would be based.  This development was welcomed as historic by the Secretary-General of the UN, the EU, Greece, Turkey, the UK, the USA, Russia, and the majority of the political forces in both communities.</p><p>  I will now outline the provisions stipulated in the joint communique.  The <i>status quo</i> is unacceptable.  A settlement would have a positive impact on the entire region, while first and foremost benefiting Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, respecting democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as each other's distinct identity and integrity and ensuring their common future in a united Cyprus within the European Union.  The leaders expressed their determination to resume structured negotiations in a results-oriented manner.  All unresolved core issues will be on the table, and will be discussed interdependently.  The leaders will aim to reach a settlement as soon as possible, and hold separate simultaneous referenda thereafter.</p><p>  The settlement will be based on a bicommunal bizonal federation with political equality, as set out in the relevant Security Council resolutions and high-level agreements.  The united Cyprus, as a member of the United Nations and of the European Union, shall have a single international legal personality and a single sovereignty, emanating equally from Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots.  There will be a single united Cyprus citizenship, regulated by federal law.  All citizens of the united Cyprus shall also be citizens of either the Greek-Cypriot or the Turkish-Cypriot constituent state.  This status shall be internal and shall complement and not substitute in any way the united Cyprus citizenship.  Neither side may claim authority or jurisdiction over the other.</p><p>  The united Cyprus federation shall result from the settlement knowing the settlement's approval by separate simultaneous referenda.  The federal constitution shall prescribe that the united Cyprus federation shall be composed of two constituent states of equal status.  The bizonal bicommunal nature of the federation, and the principles upon which the EU is founded, will be safeguarded and respected throughout the island.  Union in whole or in part with any other country or any form of partition or secession or any other unilateral change to the state of affairs will be prohibited.</p> <p>The negotiations are based on the principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  The appointed representatives are fully empowered to discuss any issue at any time.  The leaders of the two communities will meet as often as needed.  They retain the ultimate decision-making power.  Only an agreement freely reached by the leaders may be put to separate simultaneous referenda.  Any kind of arbitration is excluded.  The sides will seek to create a positive atmosphere to ensure the talks succeed.  They commit to avoiding blame games or other negative public comments on the negotiations.  They also commit to efforts to implement confidence building measures that will provide a dynamic impetus to the prospect of a united Cyprus.</p><p> The two sides have appointed negotiators who meet each week and examine their respective positions on all aspects of the Cyprus issue.  At this stage, it is expected they will complete mapping each side's positions.  At a meeting to be held on 31 March 2014, the leaders of the two communities, President Nicos Anastasiades, and the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mr. Dervis Eroglou, will assess the process.  Following this first stage of the negotiations, the second stage, which will begin immediately afterwards, will concentrate on narrowing the gaps between the positions expressed by the two sides.  Despite the general positive atmosphere, statements by Turkish and Turkish Cypriot officials still talking today about two &quot;peoples&quot;, two &quot;states&quot;, two &quot;sovereignties&quot;, etc., leave limited space for justified optimism.  However, the firm commitment of the Greek Cypriot side to continue unabatedly towards achieving a viable solution based on international and European law accompanied by the renewed interest of the UN, the EU, the US and other international actors in safeguarding a secure corridor of stability, peace and security as well as a safe alternative energy supply source for Europe within a volatile and explosive broader region allow us to look to this renewed effort with reserved optimism despite positions expressed by one side in violation of the agreed communiqu&eacute;.  At the same time, a Turkish naval research vessel, the <i>Barbaras</i>, violates systematically the territorial sea and the exclusive economic zone, EEZ, of Cyprus, despite calls by the UN, EU, US and Russia for respect for Cyprus' maritime zones.</p><p> New elements in the broader equation, including the discovery of significant amounts of natural gas in the EEZ of Cyprus and the adjacent EEZ of Israel and Egypt, as well as the parallel initiatives for the construction of a liquified natural gas, LNG, station in Cyprus and-or a south-eastern Mediterranean pipeline to provide Europe with alternative energy supply lines, create an unprecedented conducive environment to establish on a reunited island the much needed peaceful co-operation and prosperity for all stakeholders involved.  In the meantime, confidence building measures, especially, the acceptance of the proposal for the return of the ghost city of Famagusta to its legitimate citizens, are a must as they would permit a better climate to boost reconciliation.  Such a gesture on behalf of Turkey, which is also demanded by Security Council Resolution 550 of 1984, would also allow benefits for all parties involved, including Turkey.</p><p> I would like to underline that a lasting solution of the Cyprus problem in strict compliance with international and European legality would be a win-win situation for the two communities on the island, Turkey itself, the EU, broader western interests and the entire region, and they would provide for an enhancement of global stability.  In the strenuous efforts to positively exploit this very promising new prospect, the firm support of every single actor is highly valued in order not to miss such a unique opportunity.  In this regard, I consider the involvement and initiative of the Chairman and members of the committee as a valuable one and I thank them for their interest and the opportunity offered to me to brief them on the latest developments.  A visit by an Irish parliamentary mission to Cyprus in support of the ongoing peace talks on the above described principles might be a good idea to be explored.  I express once again the appreciation and gratitude of the Government and people of Cyprus to the Irish people for their continued principled support as expressed by successive Irish Governments.  The committee's meeting with the ambassador of Turkey in the near future on the same issue will offer it the opportunity to express to the key actor its principled commitment to a lasting solution of the Cyprus problem based on international and European law, which will also relieve Turkey from its most serious impediment towards accession to the EU.  We cannot afford the luxury of missing such an historic opportunity.  I thank the committee very much for its attention and I am at members' disposal for any questions or clarifications they might ask.</p></speech>

Of course, there have been very good relationships between our country and Cyprus over the years.  In 2001, a resident ambassador to Cyprus was appointed.  We held the Presidency in 2004 when Cyprus acceded to the EU.  The ambassador mentioned the Turkish application for membership of the EU.  When he discussed this matter with the European enlargement Commissioner, what was his response in respect of the point made by the ambassador where the sovereignty of a member state is breached by a country with an application for membership under consideration?</p><p>  Under whose auspices were the referenda referred to by the ambassador held in 2004?  As the Chairman said, the renewed interest is welcome, and it is to be hoped substantial progress can be made.  Is there a deadline or timeline where it is hoped that negotiations could conclude successfully?  What is the status of the Security Council resolution referred to by the ambassador relating the return of the city of Famagusta to its legitimate citizens?</p></speech>

Dr. Michalis Stavrinos" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014032600004#C00500"><p>In respect of the discussion of the issue with the European enlargement Commissioner, the position is that although as a matter of principle, the EU is against any foreign occupation, it thinks that having a channel of communication and a process with Ankara might lead to the solution of the problem in a way that fits European rules and principles.  That was also the reason Cyprus as a member of the EU accepted the beginning of accession negotiations.  Despite all these good efforts from the European side, the Turkish side did not fulfil its part, including the full implementation of the Ankara protocol.</p> <p>The protocol and customs union with all member states applied to all member states except Cyprus.  In every EU text on Turkish accession, all of those issues are raised and put to the Government of Turkey.  We expect that very soon the effort, which was recently undertaken, will give them the opportunity to prove they respect those positions and principles.</p><p> I move to the referenda that were provided for in the Anan plan.  They were undertaken by the two communities, theoretically under the auspices of the UN.  I use that word because there was no concrete supervision and control of the lease of the borders.  Some violations occurred therefore because settlers in the occupied part took part in the referendum which they should not have done.  There is no deadline because the wish of both sides and the United Nations was to avoid any pressure.  Intervention was also excluded for that reason.  Both sides wish to finish this exercise as soon as possible in so far as it guarantees a positive and lasting outcome.</p><p> The resolution was adopted by 13 votes in favour.  There was one abstention and one against.  It is a mandatory resolution.  As with every resolution of the UN and its Security Council, all member states are obliged through the charter of the UN to implement it.  Unfortunately, and despite reference to the resolution by later resolutions, Turkey continues to deny its implementation.  We hope that, with the new prospects for the solution of the Cyprus problem, it will implement the resolution as a confidence-building measure.  In exchange, our side offers to Turkey and Turkish Cypriots very positive counter gestures.  These include that if the city is opened to the legitimate previous citizens, the port of Famagusta will open under UN or EU auspices for trade from the occupied part of Cyprus.  The reconstruction of the city will allow both sides to come closer.  After 40 years, it needs to be rebuilt from scratch.  If Turkey fully applies the Ankara protocol, Cyprus intends to defreeze certain chapters of Turkey's accession to the EU.  That is why I described those measures together with the effort as a win-win situation in the case that they are implemented.</p></speech>

The idea of inviting him and the Turkish ambassador was to allow the committee to be somewhat helpful to the process.  It is also about us trying to get our heads around the way the talks process will move forward.  There will probably be a significant view around the world that this cannot be done or solved.  We know from our own recent history that things people felt could not be solved or moved on can be.  We have prime examples in South Africa with the end of apartheid and the end of the so-called Iron Curtain and even in Ireland with the peace process.  Today is about expressing solidarity but also support in relation to the ongoing negotiations between Cyprus and the Turkish Government.  I wish the negotiators well while acknowledging the significant problems they face.  With compromise and people wanting a positive solution, things can be moved forward.</p><p>  The ambassador mentioned the Farnagusta declaration and its potential.  The Irish experience was that there was a need at certain times within the talks process for confidence building measures.  Does the ambassador see the declaration as such a measure?  He says the port will be open.  The city as it stands is like a war memorial and a shrine to what happened in the past.  The ambassador spoke about building a new city and bringing people in to work together to create a shared city in its true sense.  How does he see that developing and what role can Ireland and the EU play?  I tried to raise the matter with the Taoiseach in the context of European Council meetings, but did not get an opportunity.  I raised the matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, as I know the matter came up at the European Council meeting, but there was no sense of what Europe will do.  Can the ambassador outline the role the EU can play?  Is it a matter of sponsorship, funding or of putting pressure on or encouraging the Turkish side on the initiative?  Is the initiative coming purely from the Cypriot side or is there some support on the Turkish Cypriot side?</p><p>  We have spoken about the issue of settlers in the committee and been addressed in the context of Palestine and Israel.  It will be one of the key issues within the talks.  We know the current leader in the north of Cyprus, Mr. Eriglu, has stated that illegal settlers in northern Cyprus should receive citizenship in any unified state.  I do not want to cause problems for the talks and if necessary the ambassador may avoid my question.  What impact have the settlers had on Turkish Cypriots in particular?  My understanding is that many Turkish Cypriots have left that part of Cyprus as they were unhappy with the regime and environment.  Has there been significant movement and has it changed the genesis of what Cyprus was?  How difficult would it be to get the settlers to go back to Turkey?  The other settlers are those Europeans who have bought properties on the so-called Turkish side of Cyprus.  What impact will this have in relation to it?  I know there have been court cases.  I am sure Irish people have bought properties on the Turkish side.  What impact will an eventual settlement have on what these illegal settlers?</p></speech>

The European Union at every opportunity reminds Turkey of its international obligations, including the specific one, yet, it has never been put in front of Turkey as an ultimatum, that either it does this or there will be certain consequences.  There is some space.  We expect that with the new positive environment that the leadership and the Government of Turkey will prove to be bold enough to make this gesture but it has to be seen.</p><p> On the issue of settlers, there are two reports by the Council of Europe, one by Mr. Cuco and one by Mr. Laakso, proving that this policy of colonisation is well planned and implemented in stages and that it is a crime against humanity with the purpose of changing the demographic structure and balance of the occupied part of Cyprus.  It is a crime which has to be condemned.  Of course, sometimes we hear some voices talking about the humanitarian aspect of it.  There is a basic principle in international law that illegality cannot produce legality, therefore, any product of a crime cannot be accepted.  The Annan plan had some ideas, for example, to pay a kind of compensation to those people in order for them to return to their original places.  On the question of how they have impacted on the occupied part, the Turkish Cypriots are not happy with the presence of the settlers and there are very good reasons for this.  The Turkish Cypriots were Europeanised, while the settlers come from Anatolia which is one of the less developed areas of Turkey and they bring with them a fanatical, extremist Islamist outlook.  Their culture and traditions are completely different from those of the Turkish Cypriots.  Although before 1974, very few Turkish Cypriots were emigrating abroad, after that time they have emigrated in great numbers which combined with the massive implantation of settlers has resulted in the Turkish Cypriots being a minority in the occupied part of Cyprus.  This problem needs to be dealt with by means of international law.  The original and actual percentage between the two communities is 8% Greek Cypriots, 18% Turkish Cypriots and 2% Maronites, Latins and Armenians who have come to be on the island for historical reasons.</p><p> Because the two communities were widespread all over Cyprus and there was no homogenous area exclusively Turkish Cypriot or Greek Cypriot, Turkey is implementing a plan to "Turkify" the occupied part of Cyprus.  For this reason it has "confiscated" all properties belonging to the Greek Cypriots.  Approximately 200,000 Greek Cypriots became refugees within their own country by leaving the northern part in terror at the advance of the Turkish army in 1974.  Their properties were taken with most of them given to settlers coming from Anatolia and some properties were illegally sold to foreigners.  There are numerous European Court of Human Rights decisions clarifying that those properties remain in the ownership of the original Greek Cypriot owners.  I refer to a famous case, the Orams case, which involved a British couple who bought property belonging to Greek Cypriots.  The case was taken to the Cypriot courts and then to the British courts.  The final decision was supported by the decision of the EU Court of Human Rights that the properties remain in the ownership of the original owners.  If the law is followed then there would be a proper solution to the problem.</p></speech>

The seven-point joint communiqu&eacute; is a very strong basis for moving forward.  If agreement can be achieved on those seven points it will be a major step towards achieving peace and reconciliation although I know the island has been at peace.</p><p>  The negotiating team is very strong and is composed of very well qualified individuals.  I understand they have access to all of the stakeholders which is a positive situation for moving forward.  The ambassador has given a good explanation of the property issue.</p><p>  I have some questions about education and culture and the roles of both in bringing about a unified and united Cyprus.  I ask the ambassador to give his views.  Is it correct to say that people are divided as being Greek Cypriot, Turkish Cypriot and Cypriot?  I note the role of the Greek Orthodox Church in particular with regard to property issues.  I ask the ambassador to comment.  I ask the ambassador to comment on the British military presence in Cyprus which is an issue outstanding.  I cannot help but ask how Cyprus is managing because it has the same relationship as we had with the troika, the IMF and the ECB.  I hope it is in order to ask that question because the meeting is discussing another matter but it would be good to hear the ambassador's view.</p></speech>

There are still thousands of missing people.  Civilians - who were not fighters - were killed in cold blood.  There is an atmosphere and propaganda from one side that does not allow the people to think clearly and positively.  Before 1974 the two communities were living very peacefully together.  Every village and city had a church side by side with a mosque.  People followed their own religion without any real problems until some expansionist plans came on the scene.  There is a renewed effort in parallel with the talks to improve the texts used in books and to preserve the monuments and churches in the occupied part and which had been impossible for the past 40 years.  I refer to a very good gesture with regard to the Apostolos Andreas monastery.  This was a positive step which would have been unimaginable a few years ago.</p><p>  Deputy O'Sullivan asked for clarification on the terminology of identification.  There is Cypriot nationality.   </p> <p>This is clear and it is provided in the constitution of Cyprus.  Then there are two communities - the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot - signifying their national origins or their religious beliefs.  However, there is no distinction.  That is why we have other minorities who keep their traditions and culture but who remain Cypriot citizens as well.</p><p> It was recognised as a positive gesture by the Turkish side that the church of Cyprus welcomed the joint communique and expressed its support for President Anastasiades in his effort to achieve a solution.  Just two days ago, there was a meeting between the Archbishop of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot Mufti, and they agreed to exert every effort in order to preserve the monuments on each side, and also to allow people to access churches and mosques freely.</p><p> The British bases represent a very hot issue.  During the talks for the Annan plan, the British Government offered to abandon half of the area covered by the bases in favour of a future federal state.  Although there was no specific discussion of the issue, our understanding is that it remains valid for the new effort as well.  It is true that the whole area covered by the British bases is too big for merely military or defence purposes, and there was a recent agreement between our Government and the British Government that the development of those properties should be allowed to go ahead after so many years without any limitations, unless they obstruct military or defence purposes <i>per se</i>.</p><p> The last question was about the IMF and the economic situation in Cyprus.  We entered the programme just a year ago and all the signs were not good.  Cyprus was the victim of experimentation in respect of the bail-in and other things that we could not imagine before.  These things damaged not only the Cypriot economy but also trust in the euro internationally.  If the free economy - based on respect for the value of money and accounts - was damaged, then the damage was done by those who made these decisions.  Unfortunately, the Cypriot people were the victims of it.  A kind of acceptable propaganda was used against the foreigners who were investing in Cyprus.  Talk about money laundering, dirty money and so on proved to be completely wrong.  All that money moved to other EU countries and nobody is talking about the colour of that money now.</p><p> Cyprus is doing very well.  We have had the third visit of the troika and its members expressed their satisfaction that the economy is performing better than initially expected.  We hope to follow the example of Ireland in a couple of years and return to the markets.</p></speech>

It is good to hear that talks are going on.  That must be seen as a positive thing.  I do not have many questions because the ambassador covered many of the things in which I was interested.  I was particularly interested in the problem presented by membership of the European Union.  I was interested to see that one of the stipulations is that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  That has a familiar ring to us in view of our peace settlement, but it is absolutely essential because there will have to be very difficult compromises by both sides.</p><p>  I have a friend who is a politician in Cyprus and I know how emotional she is on the issue of the island and what she sees as its occupation.  One of the emotions she has expressed strongly is the sense of abandonment by the EU of Greek Cyprus.  We have allowed the occupation of the island to continue.  To what extent is that a widespread view?  Is it resentment of the EU?  Has it changed since the bail-in?  I was in Greece recently and although they are reporting that they are doing well and hope to exit their own bailout programme shortly, nevertheless a quarter of a million depend every day for food on charities such as the churches.  Is that the scenario in Cyprus as well?  Is it happening in another EU country that so many people are dependent on charity?</p></speech>

However, the Cypriot people were always pro-European.  Zeno of Citium, a Cypriot of the fourth century BC, was the philosopher who came up with Stoic philosophy.  Many of today's philosophical values such as tolerance, acceptance of difference, cosmopolitanism and so on, were initially preached by a Cypriot.  All Cypriots have felt like Europeans since long ago.  There is a mixture of disappointment.  They were expecting more from the European Union, especially on the solidarity issue, which was not seen.  There is a feeling that Cyprus was used as an experimental project without any thought for the human aspect.  Nevertheless, the Cypriots decided to play by the rules of the game.  They are working very hard.  They suffer a lot and the results of the economy show that despite any weaknesses and shortcomings in the programme, by following it they can come out of it.</p><p>  I should talk about the economic situation in Cyprus.  The total population of the country is less than 1 million people, so we can make the analogy with Ireland.  It was dependent mainly on tourism and services.  Because of the damage to the banking sector, half of the economy was destroyed.  Nevertheless, people are trying to find new avenues for getting back to growth with the guidance of the Government.  The results up until now show that this is possible.  We are very optimistic that in the foreseeable future we will be able to come out of it.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman as well, given that he agreed to an in-depth analysis of a crisis that occurred 40 years ago.  I congratulate him also on his recognition of the Western Sahara issue, which also has been forgotten for 40 years and which we will be discussing in greater detail in future.</p> <p>We are far apart geographically, but we have a lot of historical comparisons.  They are both divided islands and both have northern sectors.  We have been talking about the English court's proper decision to deem illegal the actions of British residents who had taken over land and properties in northern Cyprus.  We did have Northern politicians who had found a great escape for themselves in acquiring property in northern Cyprus.  I hope one day that the chickens will come home to roost and that they will have to account for themselves.  Cyprus has its cultural and religious divides; therefore, we have a tremendous amount in common.  We have a gas field off Kinsale, while Cyprus has massive potential to produce gas.  </p><p> The Cypriot and Turkish Governments are going through an extremely complex process, with which we wish Ambassador Stavrinos well.  These are exciting times for the people of Cyprus and they should also be exciting times for the peoples of Turkey and Greece.  Is the discovery of substantial gas deposits a unifying factor, or could it play a potentially negative role?  We know that if this gas is exploited, Israel, Turkey and the people of Cyprus stand to benefit.  As we know historically from Africa and elsewhere, when great deposits of minerals, gas or oil are discovered, sometimes it does not work to aid the unification process; it can work against it and create divisions.  What is Ambassador Stavrinos's analysis of the potential benefits of these gas finds?</p><p> Cyprus has been a member of the European Union for about ten years, while Turkey is an aspiring applicant.  How do Turkish Cypriots view the European Union from their perspective, given the horrendous difficulties, including the bail-out, Cyprus has gone through in the past decade?  The parallel is that we are opening more chapters with Turkey.  Ambassador Stavrinos may not be able to interpret the minds of Turkish Cypriots, as it may be more appropriate for the Turkish ambassador to do so.  However, I would like to know from Ambassador Stavrinos how he thinks they view the European Union and the potential unity of the island.</p><p> This process has been 40 years in the making.  It vividly jogged my memory when I saw the presentation on Famagusta by Cypriots.  It brought back a lot of memories of Archbishop Makarios and the 1974 invasion.</p></speech>

It is a phenomenal sight and this is happening in the European region.</p><p>  I wish Ambassador Stavrinos every success with the review.  I am looking forward with bated breath to what will happen on 31 March to see how the review is being analysed.  I hope we can progress to the second stage of the process.  There are approximately 840,000 Greek Cypriots and the ambassador spoke about the influx of settlers from Turkey.  How many Turkish residents are there on Cyprus?   I wish the discussions every success.  There are many comparisons between Ireland and Cyprus.

There are all of these global issues in the picture, including what is going on in the Middle East and further north, as well as in Europe, China and the United States.  Therefore, having a safe alternative source of gas and, possibly, oil could be a game-changer.  It is not only the amounts that were discovered off Cyprus but also those in the neighbouring exclusive economic zones of Israel, Egypt and, possibly, Lebanon.  The assessment by American companies in the area is that the deposits already discovered could cover the needs of the European Union for many years to come.  Of course, for all of them to be exploited we need a safe and secure environment, in which all actors involved in the Cyprus problem can play a role, including Turkey.  As long as Cyprus remains an issue, it is naturally impossible to have any co-operation with Turkey on this matter.  If the problem is solved based on the principles we mentioned in a commonly acceptable solution, why not co-operate with Turkey?  After the problem is solved, the benefits will be the same for Greek and Turkish Cypriots alike.</p><p>  The Turkish Cypriots look to Cyprus's membership of the European Union very positively.  Suffice it to say all Turkish Cypriots, including the most notorious polemicist on the Turkish Cypriot side, the late Mr. Denktaş, held Republic of Cyprus passports and were, therefore, EU passport holders.  All Turkish Cypriots are benefiting from holding these passports and can thus study at European universities while paying EU tuition fees.  There are a significant number of Turkish Cypriots in Ireland who are using these passports; therefore, they enjoy the benefit of being EU citizens.  </p><p>  The only question concerns how Turkey can explain to Turkish Cypriots that they are being held hostage to its own policy, whereas Turkey wishes to become a member of the European Union at any cost.  In solving the Cyprus problem, it should allow Turkish Cypriots to fully enjoy the benefits.  It is only because of the buffer zone and the presence of 40,000 soldiers that Turkish Cypriots are not fully free to enjoy them.  Despite the economic difficulties, a significant number of Turkish Cypriots are crossing to the free part in order to find employment.  Of course, the current economic situation has affected both Greek and Turkish Cypriots.</p><p>  The Famagusta project is a confidence-building measure which could offer benefits to everybody.  As Deputy Eric Byrne said, it is a city which after so many years will have to be reconstructed from the beginning.</p> <p>This will give a boost to economic activities on both sides through co-operation.  It would be a new opening to the international world.</p><p> I was asked what the committee could offer.  As I mentioned in my initial address, the committee could issue a statement supporting the starting of the negotiations, which the President was kind enough to do in the past, and also to express support for the proposal for Famagusta as something that was demanded by resolution of the UN and that has to be implemented.  This will offer opportunity to everybody to enjoy the benefits.  Finally, the visit either of a delegation of this committee or a broader one of the Parliament would be very beneficial.</p></speech>

I congratulate all parties to the discussion that is taking place at present., which represents a great opportunity.  Forty years is a long time and many changes have taken place.  There has been considerable polarisation and things do not heal with the passage of time when there is division.  Given our experience here, I hope there can be continuity of the discussions now taking place with both sides committed to resolving the issues, regardless of their causes 40 years ago.  Going back 40 years will not resolve them so we have to move on from here.</p><p>  Special emphasis should be placed on the positive aspects of what is likely to take place - the issues both sides have in common as opposed to the issues that divide them.  The time will come to deal with the divisive issues, but the first issues to be addressed are obviously those of common interest to both sides which both sides are prepared to concentrate on resolving.</p><p>  It is a good idea that the meetings are taking place three times a week.  I presume it is Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  The reason for spacing out the meetings is to give time to both sides to consider their positions, to address issues that may arise and to be able to move forward having considered the issues themselves.  In addition, it is good that they have decision-making power.  Recognising that the negotiating parties have that power does two things.  First, they must have the confidence of the respective groups they represent, which they obviously have.  They, in turn, will respect that.</p><p>  The time has come for us Europeans to deal with issues of such a nature.  We cannot go on forever living in the past, referring retrospectively to the issues that caused division.  The time has come for us all to prove what we can do outside Europe.  When Europeans emigrate outside Europe, we get along very well together, as we have shown in the United States, Australia and elsewhere.  That raises the question as to why it should be so difficult to resolve issues in our own backyard, for want of a better description.</p><p>  I believe it would be greatly beneficial to Europe, the solidarity in Europe, the relationship between the two parts of Cyprus, and the relationship between Greece and Turkey, which is also important.  That is because of the European Union's ongoing partnership negotiations and its neighbourhood policy.  I hope this is an historic event that will lead to a satisfactory conclusion.  I do not believe either can afford to conclude without reaching a solution.  It would be a sad reflection on the ability of two groups of people within the European Union not to be able to come to an amicable settlement.</p></speech>

Many times they publicly disagree with their leadership when it refers to two states, two sovereignties and two peoples.  There have been many meetings between the political parties on both sides of the dividing line, which is very promising.  If the Turkish Cypriot community was left alone with the Greek Cypriot community, I am more than positive that the problem could be solved yesterday and not tomorrow.  Unfortunately, we need to consider the bigger picture, as I mentioned in the beginning, including specific actors both in the region and far away.</p><p>  I fully agree with the Deputy that this is a golden opportunity for the Cypriots, for the countries in the region and also for the European Union to play the role it is destined to play.  If the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of the European Union was the solution of the divisions of the past, Cyprus is today's challenge and we hope it will respond to it positively.</p></speech>

It is a window of opportunity that should not be missed.  I congratulate the negotiators from Turkey and from Cyprus on this initiative.  It is a step-by-step process.  The negotiators need to take small steps at a time.  The ambassador spoke about words, but words can be overturned and changed as we have seen in Northern Ireland.  We wish the negotiators well.</p><p>  There will be an opportunity for the Turkish ambassador to appear before the committee in the coming weeks and we look forward to that meeting.  The committee is available to assist both sides to reach a peaceful resolution.  We have had the experience within our own island - a divided island - where two communities work and live closely together.  There will always be challenges and, as we know from our experience with Northern Ireland, there will also be challenges in Cyprus.</p><p>  We thank the ambassador for the invitation to visit his island.  If it is possible we will try to do so if we can be of any assistance.  We will keep in touch with the ambassador.  We wish him well in his role as an ambassador.  He has been very forthcoming and open during his time here.  I wish him well for the rest of his time here.  We look forward to working closely with him.</p></speech>

Members will be aware that the joint committee has considered this petition on a number of occasions and agreed at its meeting on 5 February 2014 to write to RTE to seek further specific information on its recruitment policy on the employment of people from different ethnic and racial groups.  It appears from the response received that RTE is trying to actively promote itself as an employer that embraces diversity and proactively creates a learning environment.  It is proposed that a copy of the response from RTE be forwarded to the petitioner.  I understand Senator Susan O'Keeffe wishes to comment.</p></speech>

RTE makes the point that because of its constrained circumstances it is not enagaged in much recruitment at this time.  However, I would like to seek Mr. Sharkey's response because, clearly, he is concerned about the number of on-screen presenters and the shortage of non-Irish people in that regard.  Given that this is the window to our society which RTE is reflecting to the world, it is important that it reflect a multicultural society.  I would be grateful, therefore, if the response received from RTE could be forwarded to Mr. Sharkey.  We should await his reply before proceeding further.</p></speech>

The petitioner is of the view that as a result of the current financial situation in the country, the Government should study the system adopted by Australia, whereby working visa holders, subclass 457, with children attending government funded primary schools, must now, in addition to the income tax they pay, pay an additional fee per child attending school.

As the Chairman noted, I am joined by a number of colleagues and I hope that, between us, we will be able to answer any questions members may have.</p><p>  As part of the section 124(8) five year review of public service broadcasting, RTE submitted a detailed five year strategy to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, early last year.  Last June, having concluded the review process, which included a detailed analysis of RTE's plans by consultants, Crowe Horwath, the BAI recommended to the Minister that the level of public funding to RTE should be increased, with certain conditions.  In July, the Government, in its response, affirmed its ongoing support for the concept, purpose and practice of public service broadcasting in Ireland.  It also welcomed the BAI review and considered the report and recommendations submitted as comprising an important step in ensuring that public service broadcasting will be sufficiently well funded and these funds will be used in a transparent manner.</p><p>  The Minister recommended a number of additional initiatives and reviews related to public service broadcasting, specifically RTE.  Following this lengthy process, RTE published its five year strategy last September and sent a summary of the document to a range of stakeholders, including every Member of the Oireachtas.  The five year strategy is an important document for RTE.  It was developed following a review of everything we do and how we do it.  It was informed by analysis of the market, our audiences and responsibilities and the impacts of changing technology. The brief was simple - to reshape RTE for the future and make it fit for the times we live in and the diverse audiences we serve.</p><p>  We developed our plans mindful of the society and economy within which RTE sits and the changed circumstances of our audiences and licence fee payers.  In that context, we were clear that the first stage of our strategy must be to return RTE to a sound financial footing by ensuring our operations are run as efficiently as possible.  This objective has been achieved.  We will soon publish our annual report for 2013 in which we will report a small financial surplus for the first time since 2008.  I acknowledge and thank RTE staff and members of the independent production sector who worked closely with us to achieve this turnaround. </p><p>  As with many organisations, Ireland's economic collapse had a deep impact on RTE's finances.  The organisation is dual funded and its commercial revenues, primarily advertising, declined by &euro;95 million between 2008 and 2013.  In addition to this 40% reduction in commercial revenues, public funding levels reduced by &euro;19 million in the same period.  Combined, this revenue loss amounts to &euro;113 million over the past five years.  The most recent national budget for 2014 resulted in a further &euro;5 million reduction in public funding.  In response and to return to a financial break-even point, RTE has reduced its operating cost base by 30% since 2008, while maintaining - this is a critical point - all of its public services.  The scale of RTE's operating cost reductions to date is unique across the semi-State sector.  The organisation also delivered digital terrestrial television, DTT, allowing the State access to an &euro;875 million dividend from the sale of spectrum and enabling the electrical trade to benefit by approximately &euro;150 million in retail sales.</p> <p> The impact of restructuring on RTE has been very significant.  Between 2008 and the end of 2013, almost 500 staff departed.  This reduction of 21% in our workforce was more than double that which occurred across the public service and semi-State sector over the same period.  In 2009, RTE was the first public body to agree and implement reductions in basic salary for all staff.  Pay reductions ranged from 2.35% to 12.5%.  No bonuses have been paid since 2009 and average basic pay for RTE staff in December 2013 was &euro;56,300.  Between departures and pay cuts, total staff costs have reduced by 25% in RTE since 2008.  Between 2008 and 2012, RTE's total staff cost reductions were more than double the average achieved across the public and semi-State sector.  An independent review of managers' salaries conducted by Hay shows that salaries for RTE managerial and professional staff are at the mid-point of a representative large industry sample, including semi-State organisations.  When short-term incentive payments are included, RTE managerial and professional salaries are below market average, as variable pay for these grades has ceased for the last five years.  The survey was completed in November 2013.  We have submitted the report in full to the committee along with more detailed financial and staffing information.</p><p> RTE's annual report publishes the director general's remuneration package annually.  The annual report is prepared in accordance with IFRS accounting standards and makes full disclosure under IFRS.  RTE has implemented the Government pay cap for semi-State chief executives and is also adhering to the other recommendations for semi-State remuneration made by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2011.  We have achieved substantial reductions in presenters' contracts as they have been renewed over the past number of years.  Reductions range from 21% to 68%.  The average reduction across the top ten is well in excess of the 30% reduction we committed to achieving.  Like the general public, RTE values enormously the work all our on-air talent does.  As the committee will no doubt be aware, we lost one of our most experienced presenters to a commercial radio station during contract negotiations last summer.  While we have tried to protect services and programming as much as possible, investment in indigenous television programme production at RTE and in the independent production sector - a vitally important part of the Irish creative digital economy - has been reduced by almost &euro;75 million during the period 2008 to 2012.</p><p> While it is important for the committee to be aware of the financial context in which RTE developed its five-year plans, there are other important contexts too.  The committee will agree that the public space occupied by the media is crucial.  Within a highly competitive international media environment, we have made the argument in our five-year strategy that a small country requires a strong national public service broadcaster more than ever.  RTE has obligations and responsibilities which commercial companies do not have.  It is established as a dual-funded, not-for-profit, statutory body.  Its purpose and activities are guaranteed by legislation, it is independently regulated and it is not accountable to wealthy business people, offshore private equity investors or the Government, but rather to the public which funds it.  RTE's core public purpose has never been more relevant or important than it is today.  RTE retains a unique connection with Irish people.  In our own regular tracking analysis, with which I am not sure the committee is familiar, we see the evidence for this continually.  In 2013, RTE reached 96% of Irish adults on a weekly basis across the full range of its services.  Public trust in RTE is now at 72% while 68% of Irish people believe RTE enriches their lives and 78% say RTE is an Irish brand of which they are proud.  Some 71% of people believe that what we do is of high quality.  No other media organisation in Ireland comes close to that level of engagement and reach.  Despite all of the cutbacks we have had to make, these measures have improved over the past year.</p><p> None of this means that RTE does not at times upset certain sections of society or people who hold particular views.  It does not mean RTE does not broadcast programmes that some people dislike or that it makes no mistakes.  It means that sustaining, reinvigorating and constantly improving RTE is important and matters to most Irish people.  It matters particularly now that we find ourselves in a digital world where information is delivered on increasingly diverse platforms by increasingly diverse sources.  It matters when original reporting everywhere is declining and the ownership of Irish commercial media has consolidated considerably.  It matters when the forces of globalisation within media are diluting national and local culture like never before and when some of the largest multinational media organisations in the world are taking crucial revenue out of the Irish creative and media sector.</p><p> In the television market alone in the last 18 months, the number of UK television channels selling Irish advertising has grown by 33% to a total of 36 channels.  Sky added Irish advertising to two new channels in January.  UK public service broadcaster Channel 4 is now selling Irish advertising.  UTV will launch a new Irish television channel here next January.  In reality most of these channels treat Ireland as a lucrative profit centre and invest little or nothing in Irish-focused content for Irish audiences.  Their combined effect is to suck revenue out of the economy away from investment in Irish-focused programming and into the pockets of some of the most well-resourced global media companies in the world such as BSkyB.  In contrast, RTE's contribution to national output in 2013 was of the order of &euro;310 million while sustaining 3,000 full-time equivalent jobs in the Irish creative economy.  For every &euro;1 in licence fee income, RTE contributed &euro;1.70 to the Irish economy, including taxes.  Of RTE's total operating spending, 86% was among Irish-based personnel and suppliers.</p><p> We have argued in our five-year strategy that Ireland, as a small country, needs a media organisation that can compete with international media and guarantee a distinctive Irish voice and perspective on the world.  This, after all, was one of the primary reasons RTE was originally established.  Now, with satellite and internet technology, the threat is far greater and multifaceted.  Our five-year strategy sets out how we plan to meet the challenges of increasing competition and the changing needs of audiences in the digital age.  The central theme of RTE's strategy is to move from being a public service broadcaster to a public service media organisation which delivers distinctive, diverse and high-quality programming and content to audiences across devices.  One of the key conclusions of the Crowe Horwath report prepared for the BAI was that while RTE receives the least public funding of any of the five comparable dual-funded public service broadcasters studied, its share of the advertising market was far exceeded by other public service broadcasters.</p><p> As with all public expenditure today, the public must be assured that it is being used effectively and efficiently.  Few, if any, public bodies in Ireland have undergone the level of independent scrutiny and review on its efficiency and performance which RTE has undergone over the past 18 months.  A total of three independent external reviews - by Crowe Horwath, Indecon and, most recently, New Era - were commissioned by the BAI or the Department into all that RTE does and how it does it.  RTE has also commissioned its own internal reviews and analyses.</p> <p>Across these reports and reviews, all our operating costs have been benchmarked against the public service, semi-State sector, private sector and other public service and commercial media organisations around the world.</p><p> While accepting that organisations can always be more efficient, I genuinely believe a reasonable analysis of all of this material, much of it published, gives a clear sense of what has been achieved by RTE.  RTE is now at a crossroads.  Without action, the range of factors I have outlined can lead only to a decline in both RTE's relevance, audiences and commercial viability.  A diminished RTE serves no public or commercial interest.  Those that are likely to gain most from a decline are not other Irish-owned media organisations, but large international media providers.  Much is at risk beyond RTE's own future because a viable independent production sector, investigative journalism, significant Irish drama, national regional coverage and international news coverage all add significantly to Irish life.  These are not services or activities sustainable on any scale without a strong RTE.</p><p> I have said RTE should have responsibilities and obligations in return for public funding, particularly increased public funding if there is to be a new broadcasting charge.  We believe that firmly and totally accept it.  What we want are circumstances in which we can increase our investment in programmes produced by the independent production sector and within RTE.  We want to invest much more in our news operations and news channel by adding more live bulletins, regional news and international news, and by re-opening our London office and having more feature programming.  We want to invest more in ground-breaking investigative reporting, science programmes and high-quality Irish drama, and we seek to develop Ireland as a key international hub for such drama production.  We want to be a key supporter and developer of increased investment in Irish comedy and to increase our commitment to the Irish arts and sector.  We want to use digital technology to develop new ways to showcase the best of Irish talent.  Consequent to <i>The Secret Life of the Shannon </i>series last year, we want to make more natural history and wildlife programming showcasing Ireland's extraordinary natural beauty.  We need to invest in crucial technology, such as the future development of the free-to-air Saorview platform and other digital infrastructure.  These are just some the things we want to do and in respect of which we want to make commitments and be subject to obligations.</p><p> The Government indicates that it plans to introduce the public service broadcasting charge in 2015.  By decoupling the charge from TV ownership, the new system promises to be fairer, more efficient and reflective of current media usage.  As is clear from the documents published in August last year, the change has the potential to yield more public funding for public service broadcasting than the current TV licence system while, importantly, not increasing the burden on very stretched Irish households.  We look forward to developments in its implementation over the coming months.</p><p> In the meantime, we will continue to invest in Irish stories and to facilitate debate in Ireland.  One of the topics that Deputies wish to discuss today is a recent defamation settlement made by RTE.  We are happy to answer questions on that.  However, may I say on a general level that no individual settlement or decision will weaken RTE's resolve to present a wide range of views on current affairs topics and allow forthright debate.  We have strict and restrictive legal responsibilities under Irish defamation law.  We operate within these legal boundaries.  The Defamation Act 2009 is due to be reviewed this year and we would like to see some changes.  However, we also fully understand that for many people, particularly those who have suffered within this society because of their sexual orientation, homophobia and discrimination are very real.  We need to remember that one of the positive outcomes of the recent controversy was a substantial increase in the level of debate around homophobia, equality and same-sex marriage, much of it conducted on RTE programmes.  That will continue.</p><p> I hope members have had a chance to read the letter and the comprehensive guidance note on protection of reputation already submitted to the committee by our director of legal affairs, Mr. Eamonn Kennedy, who has joined us today.  We have attached an additional note on opinion that I hope will be useful in the debate on defamation.  I thank the committee.  We will do our best to answer any questions members have.</p></speech>

It is a good day for them to be here.  I have a couple of questions.  I was expecting this session to be benign enough, going through the deficiencies in RTE and its plans for the future.  The director general lamented that one of RTE's leading lights left the broadcaster last year but I contend the sky did not fall in.  RTE has survived after the individual's departure.  I have been saying constantly over recent years that the fees RTE is paying to some presenters are outrageous and without justification.  There are plenty of others with the same talent whom RTE is not recruiting.  This has been shown quite clearly over the past eight or nine months.  It is a matter of which RTE needs to be mindful.  It challenges to the core the manner in which it has conducted its business over the past 15 years or more.</p><p>  I have a few questions based on the presentation.  Reference was made to defamation law and likely changes thereto.  What changes is RTE hoping for, and what does it envisage?  What is RTE's vision for 2FM?  What is its future?</p><p>  A constant criticism concerns the number of RTE staff who attend high-profile events overseas.  At such events, there tends to be one presenter for the morning news bulletin and another for the evening bulletin.  A constant issue that arises concerns the degree to which RTE is efficient.  I note that there were considerable reductions between 2008 and 2013, yet RTE has still continued as the national broadcaster.  This demonstrates quite clearly that there were massive inefficiencies.  Does RTE believe it is as efficient a national broadcaster as possible?</p><p>  The presentation referred to the broadcasting charge.  If the charge is to result in increased revenue, it should be distributed among the community-based radio stations.  Not as much should go to RTE as might have been going to it in the past.  These are my main issues.</p><p>  If RTE is true to what it stated in its presentation, it should represent every sector, both urban and rural.  Its challenge is to ensure balanced coverage of what is happening in the regions in addition to the capital rather than just having half-hour programmes on the regions a couple of times per week.  It really needs to address this.  There is competition in the regions.  Statistics on listenership in the regions show that listeners are far more likely to listen to local radio stations during the day than to RTE stations.  This presents a challenge.  Perhaps the delegates will address these issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-26a.447" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Curran" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014032600006#G00100"><p>In terms of the Deputy's opening remarks - I do not think there was a question in them - we are concerned about the genuine public concern over fees paid to some of our presenters.  I have said publicly, and I say it again, that it was RTE's fault and not the presenters because people will negotiate the highest fee they can.  We became aware of the matter and have taken significant action.  We have reduced it by over 30%, as I have outlined, and when the process is complete, it will be closer to 40%.  RTE is publicly funded and is in a very privileged and powerful situation within Ireland, so we expect criticism.  We will get political criticism and a lot of other criticism.  We were responding to what we felt was public concern around the issue when we took the initiatives we did.</p><p>  In terms of the future of 2FM, we are not happy with how 2FM is performing, and I have made that clear publicly.  We have introduced a significant amount of change in that regard.  We have pushed that change through but it has been difficult for everyone involved over recent months.  We want to see a better performance by 2FM, and both I and senior management in radio have made that clear.</p><p>  In terms of some of the issues around 2FM, if one looks at other public service broadcasters and if one goes back to legislation, the Amsterdam protocol has accepted the public service broadcaster's need to produce as wide a range of programming as possible, including entertainment and other programming.  That has been backed up in the past eight to ten years by two separate resolutions from the Council of Europe.  Our own Broadcasting Act says that RTE needs to service all audiences.  If one looks at other public service broadcasters, one can see that the BBC, Austria, Belgium, Poland, Portugal and Croatia have a station like 2FM.  I can list 15 European countries where the public service broadcaster has a similar station.  I understand that the matter is a cause for concern, particularly for the commercial radio sector.  As much as 41% of 2FM's audience is under 35 years, it has a weekly reach of 800,000 people and a daily reach of 400,000 people but half of the commercial minutage of commercial rivals.  We have plans for 2FM, we are not happy with it, we are introducing change and we expect it to improve its performance.</p><p>  I ask my colleague, Mr. Bakhurst, to comment on overseas coverage and regional activity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-26a.448" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Bakhurst" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014032600006#G00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  We are very aware of the scrutiny, which is quite right, of the money we spend on overseas coverage and the number of people we send abroad.  We are also aware of the market in which we operate.  We compete with international news organisations on big events.  It is important we cover such events, particularly the ones that are, in my view and that of my colleagues in news, relevant and important to the people of Ireland such as the election of the new Pope last year.</p><p>  With regard to recent events in Ukraine, where my colleagues, Tony Connelly and Paul Cunningham, did a great job for RTE in very dangerous and difficult circumstances, we had two reporters and a one man camera crew there, but we had two people there at any one time.  I understand the BBC had 75 people in Ukraine.  These are the kinds of numbers we might be competing against.  While being careful and prudent, we also need to deploy resources to big events, such as the upcoming visit by President Higgins to the United Kingdom, to service our range of programmes.  I take the Deputy's point about presenters working on more than one outlet, particularly across the day in radio and television, and that is what we will be doing.  We will do a lot of live broadcasting for the President's visit as well as presenting some of our television bulletins and radio programmes from the UK.</p><p>  With regard to the regions, the last time I was before the committee, we talked about a new way of cementing our presence in the regions which has moved on quite rapidly since we were last here.  The committee will know that RTE has a permanent office in Cork.  We have no plans to change that situation and we produce a lot of content out of Cork.  We have created partnerships with the institutes of technology in some of the other regions which are going extremely well.  Our office in Dundalk has successfully moved to the Dundalk IT and the partnership seems to work very well.  We will bring a big broadcasting conference to Dundalk next year.  We are in the process of moving our Athlone office to premises at the IT there plus there are other aspects to the partnership.  In Waterford, we moved into new premises towards the end of last year.  Our partnership with Waterford IT has been very successful so far.  The institute has been extremely helpful and it has been a very constructive partnership so far.</p><p>  I am sure Mr. Kennedy will talk about the changes we would like to see in the defamation law, which is very important.  It is very restrictive, in my view, and it has an impact around the edges on public debate.  I would say one thing, which is that people may not be aware that, for example, right now, there are four or five political figures here who are either in the process of taking legal action or threatening legal action against RTE in this area.  It is an area that we need to look at.  If political figures in the public arena are in that space, that is a danger sometimes to robust public debate.</p></speech>

I will ask Mr. Kennedy to go into detail about defamation because we have discussed this.  There are issues for me around honest opinion.  Some of the language is incredibly complex and incredibly difficult.  The concept of it, as introduced in the last amendment, was a positive move.  I know the UK has moved towards that in recent legislation but we have not seen precedent on that .  That which should be the cornerstone of our defence has some provisions and complications.  I also think that some of what the UK has done in terms of setting a level of causing serious harm and stating that a defendant must prove that the libel has caused serious harm is something for us to look at.  Many defamation cases never reach court and are never settled because we defend them to the hilt.  Perhaps there should be a threshold from the start for some of those cases which use up an awful lot of time and resources.</p><p>  There are other issues.  One can look at what has happened in America.  I do not believe that we will ever have the first amendment protection or that we will have the malice protection the US has, but there are issues around that and around opinion.  For a jury, and these are juries of our peers who are deciding these issues, cornerstones of defence should be as uncomplicated as possible, although that is not always possible.  I will ask Mr. Kennedy to comment on the issue presently.</p><p>  On the Deputy's two other questions, the first one of which was whether we are as efficient as we can be, it is hard for any organisation to say, across the board, that it is as efficient as it can be in every single thing it does.  RTE is substantially more efficient than it has ever been.  In terms of all the outside reviews that have come in, and the NewERA review, which will be critical in this regard because that is its brief, we are very confident that we are a very efficient organisation.</p><p>  In terms of the community radio issue, I have a huge amount of sympathy and support for community radio in terms of the work it does.  In terms of local commercial radio, when I go up home, there are two stations, LMFM and Northern Sound.  I listen to them, I think they both do a tremendous job, and I do not say so in a remotely patronising way.  They do public service broadcasting.  I think there are issues outside of community radio.  Ultimately, it is for the Minister to make the decision.  It is not going to be an RTE decision.</p> <p> The battle has sometimes been painted as David and Goliath versus RTE but in assessing a decision we need to stand back from some of this area.  UTV or Communicorp own 35% of the stations.  UTV purchased LMFM for &euro;9 million in 2012 and Galway Bay FM for &euro;20 million and Communicorp bought Today FM and Highland Radio for &euro;200 million so radio stations are valuable.  They are less valuable now than they were at the height of the boom but nobody should be under the illusion that if the adverting market returns that radio stations will not be valuable.   UTV has just announced a pre-tax profit of &euro;20 million and Communicorp is one of the largest radio owners in the UK.  </p><p> We also need to stand back and look at how a decision would impact on provincial newspapers.  It would impact much more on such newspapers than on us in terms of advertising.</p><p> I have tried to have a very good relationship with the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland.  I met its chairman, Mr. John Purcell, the other day and said to him that I would like to meet him again in the next number of weeks to see if we have common interests.  I appreciate what it does do but let us stand back and examine the facts.  All of the licences for commercial radio are exclusive.  Even if I owned a provincial newspaper anyone could set up a provincial newspaper and come into the area to set up a free sheet.  Commercial radio is different, particularly national commercial radio.  I shall not give a definitive statement on the matter but it is a complicated area.</p><p> To this day I have never heard the chief executive of UTV or Denis O'Brien say that they want to access public funding for their stations because they know that such funding carries obligations.  RTE is reviewed annually by consultants and we must publish talent-presenter fees.  Community radio, in particular, is not-for-profit.  I am not saying that it does a better job than commercial radio.  A lot of local commercial radio does a terrific job.</p><p> My final comments may answer some of the questions that may arise later and I ask Mr. Kennedy to comment on some of the defamation issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-26a.453" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamonn Kennedy" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014032600007#H00200"><p>I shall give some background.  The current legislation in Ireland is the Defamation Act 2009 which replaced the 1961 Act.  Since the foundation of the State there has only been two pieces of legislation that have amended common law defamation.  Section 5 of the current Act provides that the Minister for Justice and Equality must commence a review within five years of the passing of the Act so I presume that a review will be announced during the course of this year.</p><p>  The 2009 Act brought some useful changes.  It moved the process along whereby defamation claims could be settled or brought to a conclusion in a much speedier way; it provided for an offer of an ends procedure which is helpful in that regard; and it also allowed for the lodgement of money without an admission of liability which for publishers was a useful change.  There has also been a movement towards diffusing the costs, certainly for defamation claims which are significant.  In 2008, Oxford University carried out a study that ranked Ireland second in Europe in terms of the cost of dealing with defamation claims and Ireland was a factor of ten times more expensive than the next country ranked third, which was Italy.</p><p>  There are issues that most publishers would view as problematic.  The recent events around the "Saturday Night Show" focused our minds on the issue of opinion and how that is protected in the legal system.  I have forwarded a paper to the committee that outlined a number of concerns about how the defence of honest opinion, that is present in the 2009 Act, works in practice and it is something that we would make a submission for a review.</p><p>  There are probably a number of other issues that could be usefully addressed by making some changes.  Countries like Australia and the UK have carried out reviews in the past number of years and we could draw some useful ideas from them, not least being the creation of a statute written in simpler form.  Let me give an example.  The last Irish Act introduced a defence of fair and reasonable publication in the matter of public interest.  Last night I counted that the provision runs to 60 lines of text but its UK equivalent runs to 20 lines and is written in relatively simple language.  I can go through the legislation if the committee wishes.</p></speech>

Other issues will probably crop up during the debate.  Deputy McEntee is next.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-26a.455" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1180" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014032600007#H00400"><p>I thank the delegation for the presentations.  RTE provides an excellent and valuable service and none of us want to see its quality or programmes reduced.  A lot of the presentations focused on funding and increased funding was sought but that is like asking how long is a piece of string.  What kind of funding is sought?  It has been said that funding comes with conditions and I want to know what they are.  We are talking about public funding and public moneys.  What proposal does RTE wish to put to the public?  It has been stated in the report that RTE broke even in 2013 and it has been just been stated that there was a surplus.  What are the projections for the coming year?  </p><p>  The members of the delegation stated what would be done with more funding.  What can the public expect from RTE if more funding is provided?  Will it create jobs?</p><p>  I have read the report and know that RTE prides itself on being open, transparent and efficient.  Many of us are well aware of anonymous social media messaging from speaking on local radio stations.  The debate during the presidential election campaign was also a key issue last year.  What steps have been taken to deal with anonymous messages?  People should not be able to submit anonymous text messages and they should state where the message comes from and whether the details are true or false.  Something needs to be done and I ask the delegation to elaborate on the matter.</p><p>    The delegation has said that it hopes to facilitate and open up a bit more to independent producers and educational institutions.  My brother is an independent producer who works in an educational institution and I consider the sector to be a closed book at present.  Can the delegation expand on how it hopes to help young producers and up-and-coming people get into the industry and work into the future?  </p><p>  I had a question on the debate surrounding Rory O'Neil and the show that took place not too long ago but the delegation has already answered it.  How will RTE handle the same-sex marriage debate and prevent something like that situation from happening again?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-26a.456" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Curran" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014032600007#H00500"><p>With regard to funding, we specifically did not insert a figure in the five-year strategy because the matter is unclear.  The Minister has made it clear that there will be no individual increase imposed on households.  We are not clear about how the new charge will be collected, who will collect it and whether there will be a business charge element.  We therefore found it hard to make a calculation.  Figures have appeared that range between &euro;18 million and &euro;20 million.  When we see the final details for how the scheme will operate, who will collect it and the charges imposed then we will be in a much better position to supply a figure.  We decided to hold back rather than put out a figure that is pulled out of anywhere.</p><p>  We have tried to highlight the areas.  We have said to the public that if this measure is introduced and there is additional funding then we will concentrate our investment on things that we provide uniquely.  We have outlined some of these.  I refer to the news channel, investigative programming and drama which are things that the market finds difficult to produce because of the costs involved.  We are also looking at technology and SAORVIEW.  It was important for us to say the following to people in terms of entering this debate.</p> <p>We have known for a couple of years that the debate around the broadcasting charge was on the cards.  We took a conscious decision not to go into that debate saying that RTE needed more money because it is broke.  RTE needs more money because it cannot survive.  We took the actions outlined to show we are as efficient as possible.  We are also saying that we face decline because of international competitive pressures.  What we are saying to the public is that any additional funding will as much as possible be invested in programming, particularly programming the public cannot get elsewhere.  </p><p> In regard to the question on the independent sector, we have given a commitment that a minimum of 50% of any additional funding received by RTE will go to the independent sector.  This is where the job issue arises.  It also arises in terms of the protection of employment in an organisation that has lost 500 people over the last number of years.  We are consciously trying to look outwards rather than inwards.  We are consciously trying to meet our obligations around employment and the wider economy.  This is the reason we committed for the first time to a minimum of 50% of additional funding being spent on the independent sector.  </p><p> I will ask Mr. Bakhurst to respond to the questions regarding social media.</p></speech>

A range of safeguards have been put in place to ensure the mistakes made during that programme, in terms of the use of a tweet, do not happen again.  As I have stated previously, I am confident they will not.  I rest my reputation on saying that they cannot and should not happen again.</p><p>  Social media in the wider context, particularly the anonymous use of social media, is an issue not only RTE, but for all of us, including politicians.  There is not a huge amount that any of us can do about it.  Frankly, nor can politicians because Twitter, Facebook and so on are international organisations.  Currently people can use those media anonymously to say what they like about people.  Much of the debate in this regard-----</p></speech>

It is difficult when going through that level of contraction to hold public competitions for the recruitment of new talent into the organisation.  However, we are very conscious that we have to renew the organisation.  This can only be done through creative talent.  This means we have to attract younger people into the organisation.  We plan to engage with the third level colleges around internships of up to two years.  As a public service broadcaster, it is crucial we reflect the lives of everybody and crucial that we tap into that talent.  We are keen to progress those plans.</p></speech>

I and most people would agree with the vision as outlined by Mr. Curran on behalf of RTE.  Visions are beautiful things in that they do not have constraints.  However, strategies and plans do.  I count myself among the 71% of people who believe that in general RTE does a quality job and that this country and its people would be the worse off without that quality public service broadcasting provided by RTE.  I acknowledge that RTE has and continues to try to streamline operations and maximise the return and investment by taxpayers in the organisation.</p><p>  I would like to raise a couple of specific issues.  It is stated on page 5 of the submission that competition is the major obstacle facing public service broadcasting over the next 20 years.  It was also stated that this increased competition would be great for Irish audiences and the Irish creative economy if it included new Irish programming content but that it does not.  The reality is that it does not and this is sucking revenue out of the country.  Is there an implicit expectation in this regard that Government should introduce some form of protectionism or special support measures for Irish produced programming over and above that which is currently produced?  I am unsure as to the intent of the statement on page 5 of the submission.  I am also unsure of the expectation of the witnesses from the committee and the Government in that regard.</p><p>   I note that RTE now sees Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta as a core service rather than, as previously implied, a complementary service.  I welcome that.  However, I would like to know the change of management thinking in this regard.  In particular, how will RTE ensure that the necessary staff and resources will be made available to enable Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta to fulfil its remit as a core service?  I would welcome if the witnesses could advise the committee on RTE's recently drafted Irish language policy, including how it is to be implemented and if and when a person will be engaged to oversee its implementation. </p><p>  In regard to the recent controversy around the defamation issue, there are two issues of concern to me.  The first is the specific incident itself.  I received the documentation in this regard from Mr. Kennedy, for which I thank him.  I tried to read it last night.  It is not easy reading.  It would in my view induce nose bleeds in most people.  I accept the point made that as legislators we sometimes ask questions of organisations which we should be asking of ourselves because we are the ones who introduce and enact legislation.  However, there is another aspect to this, which relates to a frame of thinking.  My concern is in regard to how easily RTE rolled over during the homophobic defamation incident and what chance it would have if, for example, the Government tried to insist on its point of view being put across unfairly to the population.  It is not the legislation but the frame of mind in that regard that is important in the context of accepting that we as legislators must ensure the legislation is correct.</p> <p>In that corporate frame of mind, how will Mr. Curran resist potentially much stronger influence or perhaps intimidation when he rolled over so easily during that episode? </p></speech>

Visions do have constraints.  In our five-year strategy we tried to produce a realistic document as well as a document with a vision.  If the Deputy reads through it, he will see that there are two elements to it.  There is a base-case, effective survival element and there are the wider proposals and suggestions in terms of any increase in public funding.  However, I agree with the Deputy that there is no point in producing a vision document that is not underpinned by some sense of the financials.</p><p>  The question of what we do around the number of opt-outs is very interesting.  The thing is to ensure that RTE can compete because otherwise we will be swallowed up.  These are very big players.  Sky is a massive player.  Liberty Global, which owns UPC, is a massive layer.  Google is also a massive player.  The first thing for me is whether RTE is, or can be, in a position to compete.  </p><p>  Some interesting debates are happening about government protectionism, particularly in France.  Actions are being taken concerning opt-out channels which are not producing domestic programming.  Some interesting debates are taking place at a European level on the implications of that for certain economies.  At European level there are new debates and people are beginning to say that this is not just a phenomenon that is happening in Ireland. </p><p>  As regards other elements, we want to see investment in Irish programming and encouragement can be given across the board.  People say that RTE is the only one investing and that it has a monopoly on it.  We want a vibrant independent sector and want to see as many broadcasters as possible investing in that.  For them, the economies of scale do not make sense because buying acquired programming, or effectively dumping UK programming where one has already paid for the rights and written it off in UK accounts, is just easy money.  It is not a straightforward question but there are certainly actions we could take.  The first one is that we are in a position where we can compete with them.</p><p>  I wrote personally to the BAI to say we were moving Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta from a complementary service to a core service.  It was a mistake on our part to put it in as complementary.  It was a tool in terms of dividing up services.  There were no recommendations attached to being a complementary service compared with a core service.  I went down to Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta and heard an impassioned articulation of how they felt about that classification.  My colleagues and I came away from that meeting and changed our policy on it.  That in itself is, I hope, a signal of where Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta fits.  If there is additional public funding, the Irish language is a core element of what we do as a public service.  It would benefit from that also.  We are also investing in a digital hub and a range of different things around the Irish language.</p><p>  As regards the leadership position, we only published the report two or three weeks ago.  We are absolutely committed to that leadership position.  Because the report was confidential we were not able to open discussions as to where this persons sits, who he or she reports to and what are the reporting lines.  It was not a widely known document.  The document has now been published so I can assure the Deputy that those discussions on where that person sits, who he or she reports to and exactly what authority he or she has are now openly taking place.  We hope to conclude those discussions sometime in the next couple of weeks and then move forward with an appointment.  That appointment is key because one of that person's first jobs will be to come back with a plan for implementation of the rest of the Irish language policy.  I have been heartened by the reaction we have received from a lot of different groups to that policy.  There is an expectation out there and I have told people that we will be pressing ahead with it - now that we can talk more openly - once we iron out where this person sits within the organisation.  </p><p>  I will ask Mr. Kennedy to talk about the specific defamation issue.  On a general level, we do 40 hours of live news and current affairs every week.  We do more investigative journalism on our main channel than the BBC, which has a budget of &euro;7 billion.  We do more investigative journalism and live programming than almost anyone else among our European counterparts.  That is going to mean that we will make mistakes but we have not pulled back from it.  We made a dreadful mistake in recent years and in the middle of all that, at the height of the controversy, we put out an award-winning programme on the trafficking of women for prostitution.  We have put out programmes on cr&egrave;ches and a range of other issues, plus what we do on a daily basis.  We are not a weak organisation.  We deal with this on a daily basis and we receive legal threats every week.  We should not get a pat on the back for it because this is the space we are in.  We are committed to it, need to do it and are publicly funded.  There is no weakening of resolve.  We make individual practical decisions on what is before us and then move on.  </p><p>  I want to assure the committee that is very much the case in this regard.  I will ask Mr. Kennedy to comment now.</p></speech>

The standard text on defamation is about 1,000 pages long and is very dense.  I sweated blood and tears over that document, which summarises as best as possible how the strict liability system works.  Even if one does not get through it all, if one gets through the first 22 pages, one will see in practical terms how the system operates.  I can understand the Deputy's point that the Government might seek to push RTE.  However, it is highly unlikely that the Government or Ministers would try to use defamation law.  That is a rarity.</p><p>  I assume the Deputy is talking about a situation where Government Ministers and Departments try to force RTE to take a certain line.  That is an entirely different kettle of fish to the system that works down in the courts.  </p><p>  The first point the Deputy made was that RTE rolled over, but I am afraid I cannot agree with that.  I would not agree with it for the following reasons.  There is a range of cases that RTE has to deal with, as do most publishers.  They invariably give rise to a range of issues that all publishers are familiar with.  In some instances one can work with what the law provides to try to defend them, whether that is to hold the line or run them and win in court.  However, there are often circumstances where to continue to defend something in terms of the system that operates down at the Four Courts is foolhardy.  That is the situation that RTE finds itself in, as do a lot of the other publishers.</p></speech>

Ireland is the most open market for advertising in Europe.  The number of stations that sell advertising in Ireland has doubled since 2008.  We are dual-funded so 53% of our revenue comes from the licence fee.</p> <p>The balance must come from other sources, but there has been a huge decline in our ability to generate income through other means because of the intense competition that now exists.  This issue is crucially important in terms of policy, because the amount of revenue we have is likely to decrease unless some stability can be brought to bear around our public funding.  We are looking at the potential for achieving efficiencies that will help to create that stability but, overall, the amount of funding available to us for public service broadcasting is in decline because the advertising market is being shared by so many different players, many of them major international players.  To give an example, the subscription market in Ireland is valued at &euro;600 million and there is massive discounting and content dumping taking place which is targeting advertising expenditure.  One cannot do anything about that - it is the nature of free competition - but it does have implications for an organisation like RTE which is dual funded.</p></speech>

It is important that we continuously evaluate what RTE is delivering in terms of public service broadcasting.  I am generally supportive of the content it delivers, which is often of a high quality.  The Irish people acknowledge that quality, particularly in terms of its coverage of national events and national and regional news coverage.</p><p>  On the issue of sustainability, the current management inherited an organisation that was established at a time when there was not nearly as much penetration from competing broadcasters.  That in itself is a weakness and, as such, the decision to review how RTE does its business and its entire broadcasting model is welcome.  Pay structures, most notably, had become totally unsustainable.  I do not raise this to make a cheap political cut.  It is beyond belief that we got to a stage where some broadcasters were receiving in excess of &euro;700,000 per annum.  RTE is not alone in offering hugely inflated wages - many other organisations did the same - but it is now left in the position of having to revise its entire business and service delivery model in a context where it faces ever greater challenges and a much more competitive environment.  The organisation is fighting on several fronts, which we should acknowledge.  I urge Mr. Curran continuously to revise the contracts of highly paid broadcasters when they come up for renewal.  As Deputy McEntee observed, young broadcasters have the potential and talent to deliver if given the chance.  Nobody is indispensable, including politicians and broadcasters.  There is always somebody else to step up to the mark.</p><p>  RTE is facing significant challenges in terms of competition in the market with the advent of digital television and the proliferation of international producers of content.  In addition, there is the on-line challenge from platforms like Netflix, which appeal to young people in particular and inevitably eat into RTE''s revenue-raising advertising share.  How does Mr. Curran propose to address these types of challenges and does he any have specific strategies in this regard?  I commend all those involved in the launch of SAORVIEW, which was a massive undertaking with RTE at its forefront.  Are there new opportunities for RTE in the area of digital television?  I understand that when the new digital platform was being introduced, it incorporated a significant quantity of spare bandwidth.  What are RTE's plans to penetrate younger markets via digital platforms?  There are potential niche areas of growth for RTE in that area.</p><p>  Does RTE intend to continue competing in areas where it has already lost the match, so to speak?  Its 2fm radio station is aimed at 15 to 24 year olds but has only 8% of the listenership in that demographic.  When I was growing up, 2fm was the only station aimed at young listeners and was very popular.  I remember that when 2fm DJs were travelling the country, it was the only gig in town.  These days, of course, 2fm is competing with regional commercial stations.  I am from the south east where Beat 102-103 has almost 60% of the market.  Is 2fm trying to compete in a battle which essentially is already lost?  I note that it has engaged a number of celebrities in an attempt to boost its figures.  Stations like Beat 102-103 have young broadcasters doing the business and they have won that market.  Instead of trying to win back lost ground, should RTE not instead be prioritising the development of niche areas where it can win?  Does that approach not offer a better chance of sustaining its business?</p><p>  I note the delegates' concerns in regard to defamation law.  It is essential that we, as legislators, seek to protect robust public debate.  We will note the views put forward today.</p></speech>

In regard to digital television, the challenges in that regard are something of which we are acutely aware.  We are working and living with them every day.  The Deputy is right to highlight the advent of services like Netflix and others.  It is important to bear in mind that we live close to one of the most well funded and best broadcasting markets in the world.  We have faced that competition since our foundation.  We are now facing increasing competition from huge multinationals like Sky which are looking increasingly at exclusive acquired programming rights, including the sports broadcasting rights market.  It will be interesting to see where that ends up over the next period.  As I said, we are used to facing that kind of competition.</p><p>  Digital poses particular problems and challenges for us, which is why we launched a new digital strategy.  We have restructured our digital division by moving it out to the different divisions.  Digital has been completely integrated into the newsroom, for example, a development which my colleague, Mr. Bakhurst, might talk about presently.  Our News Now app is one of the most downloaded apps in the country and we are constantly reviewing it.  The RTE player has been very successful for us and we are already considering where we go from here with it.  These are issues we discuss on a daily basis.  On top of that, we must not lose sight of the fact that Irish people like traditional linear viewing.  In fact, they are watching it in increasing numbers, even among the younger demographics.  What is different is that they are doing other things while watching, which poses particular problems for us.  These are issues we have been working on for several years.  We have introduced a number of innovations in this regard and are very conscious of the need for continuous development.  Despite what some people externally might think, RTE has reacted to competition.  We reacted to the UK channels, to TV3 and to Newstalk.  We can adapt and we are adapting, particularly in the digital space.</p><p>  SAORVIEW has been much more successful for us than we ever anticipated, particularly in second homes.  The latest figures are  above 700,000.  Although a significant portion relates to second televisions, we really did not expect to be in 700,000 homes at this stage.  That success has led us to consider what the next innovation should be in regard to SAORVIEW, an issue that was discussed only a few weeks ago at the executive board.  I cannot go into too much detail at this stage other than to say that we are developing the proposal in our strategy document, SAORVIEW Connected.  It is about growing SAORVIEW as a brand and a proposition and positioning ourselves for what we expect is going to happen in terms of broadband penetration.  SAORVIEW is a national brand which could well become the largest platform in the country in the next 12 months.  We have started to look at how we can position and utilise that brand to best effect.</p> <p> Reference was made to where we are competing.  I will ask Mr. Bakhurst to discuss some of the digital changes, particularly around the newsroom, but I do not believe we have lost the match on 2FM.  We have taken a hammering in the first half but I do not believe we have lost the match.  We have made several tough decisions in RTE in recent years because we have had to.  No one in this organisation has been afraid of making tough decisions if they believed it was necessary.  The station has an 8% share and an 800,000 or 400,000 daily reach.  Fully 41% of the audience is under 35 years.  The equivalent figure for Radio 1 and others is 10%.  Those listeners are still the youngest audience we have and we are moving it even younger in terms of the changes.  We have not given up the ghost on 2FM.  Some of the changes need to be bedded down and then we will assess where we are.  We will see.  No one is under any illusions about the fact we need to turn 2FM around.  However, it provides a service to a much broader range of younger people than most people realise.  Mr. Bakhurst will answer the question on digital changes.</p></speech>

We review contracts when they come up and we will take a tough position to get value for our licence fee payers.  Deputy Coffey mentioned young broadcasters.  As a public service broadcaster, it is important for RTE to bring through new young talent.  Deputy Coffey is absolutely right on that.  We have programmes like "News2Day" in the newsroom.  Presenters have come through that programme, including Carla O'Brien, who came in from outside.  She did one year on that programme and she is now a news reporter in the newsroom.  There is a new presenter on that programme, Orla Walsh.  She came in through an open condition having finished a media course.  Several people did screen tests.  I have no wish to flatter her too much but she is talent for the future, I am sure.</p><p>  Overall, in news and current affairs in terms of the balance of talent, we should be bringing through new talent, younger talent and good value talent.  However, it is critical for us that on our key high profile programmes like "Prime Time" and "Morning Ireland", we have some of the best talent because that is what the audience expects.  We will lose some people.  I know our competitors are talking to one or two people whom they are hoping to lure away from us.  It is a constant battle.  Let us consider "Prime Time" last night with Miriam O'Callaghan and Claire Byrne.  On a very important high profile programme the presenters must have credibility, a suitable background and the journalism.  That is what audiences expect.  There is a constant balancing act between value for money and having the key talent that the audiences deserve and expect from us.</p></speech>

I believe we really did that in 2012.  We undertook large organisation-wide restructuring.  We examined all our areas of activity across the board in that period and completed a major restructuring programme, which the committee will have seen references to in our 2012 annual report.  More than 350 people left the organisation during that period and in excess of 500 people had left during the previous five years.  However, we continue to make broadly the same level of programming and support the same level of services.  We have really restructured.</p><p>  Significantly, our cost base has been restructured.  The opening statements referred to how our cost base has reduced by 30% in the past five years, a significant achievement.  The challenges for us will continue to be on the funding side.  We have a history of managing our costs, although one might suggest we have come from a high base.</p><p>  Another question mentioned earlier was whether we were efficient.  We have benchmarked ourselves against our European counterparts and we compare favourably.  The work is never complete and we are continuing on that road.  Our five year strategy has specific targets for efficiency and will continue with that.  Much of that work was done in 2012 when we restructured.  The reduction we have achieved in the area of top talent is on average of the order of 30%.  We have been perfectly open about the cuts.  They are significant and range from 20% up to 68%.  We will continue to monitor them.  We disclose our figures on top talent.  If we were to draw up an Ireland-wide top talent list, they would not all be from RTE.  Probably four or five of the top talents from around Ireland would be non-RTE people at this point.</p></speech>

I welcome the presentation from Mr. Curran.  I am very much a supporter of public service broadcasting.  I support fully the remarks Mr. Curran has made about the commercial sector and the issues around the control by wealthy individuals and organisations.  That is a difficult challenge RTE must face and one in respect of which the organisation should get more support from the Government and the political process generally.  The emergence of the large private commercial sector has implications for balance, fairness, impartiality and accuracy.  This is something the Legislature should examine more carefully.  On balance, I believe RTE does a hell of a good job.  We have had our issues and RTE has been before the committee in respect of these.  Rightly, they are dealt with in that way.  However, it the case of today that we should recognise what RTE does.</p><p>  Mr. Kennedy set out the legal case very well and I thank him for the documents with which we were provided in advance.  It has helped to take some of the heat out of that particular issue.  I have no wish to get into the specifics of the matter but I believe that had RTE allowed the case to run and it ended up costing the organisation tens of thousands of euro, or perhaps more had it run into millions, we would have had the representatives of RTE before the committee and we would have asked why they did not settle more quickly.  I maintain it was a job well done in that regard.</p><p>  Some points have not been addressed, specifically the decision of UTV to come into the television market in this jurisdiction.  Obviously, it is another channel similar to how one might view Google, BSkyB or whatever other challengers are around.  Does RTE have specific concerns about UTV's presence in the not too distant future, as that organisation has set out?</p><p>  The representatives from RTE have addressed the matter of the broadcasting charge and that RTE does not have an issue around community radio stations.  That point has been covered.</p><p>  Ms O'Keeffe made it clear that RTE has done cost restructuring.  From the documents I have seen, I largely support that view.  Streamlining and cost reduction through efficiencies have an elasticity, and an organisation can get to a point where these changes begin to affect the quality of the programme and the type of support structures around the development of programming which are such an important part of public service broadcasting.  It is important to allow RTE to have the balance, fairness, accuracy and impartiality that is the bedrock of public service broadcasting.  It seems to me that RTE is reaching that critical point below which the organisation cannot go.  I say this in the context of the Government's decision, through the budgetary process this year, to reduce the RTE licence fee revenues further by &euro;5 million.  How did RTE manage to survive considering that prior to the cuts the organisation had budgeted to include that expected &euro;5 million?  Has this had implications for RTE's capacity to continue to deliver on its mandate?</p><p>  I cannot recall the exact report but one of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland reports which I read some time last summer clearly stated that if RTE was to take on the challenge it had to take on in terms of developing more Irish content, more moneys would be required, including more State funding.  Does RTE envisage this coming from the broadcasting charge?  Does RTE believe the State will have to assist it in some other way?</p></speech>

Like the previous speakers, I support much of the work RTE does.  In particular, initiatives in recent years like "Love/Hate" have lifted the bar.  However, we would be failing in our duty in this committee if we did not separate what RTE is doing well from what it could be doing better.</p> <p> Following on from what previous speakers said about sustainability, and salaries in particular, the company might bemoan the fact that a high profile figure has left RTE but there must be a differentiation between RTE and the others.  RTE is a public company and they are not, and there is a greater expectation on the part of the public of RTE in the same way as it has a greater expectation of us.  Some of the figures on presenters' pay that emanate from RTE are still far too excessive for people to accept.  I find it particularly irritating to hear somebody on a Saturday or Sunday morning trawl through what Deputies, Senators, councillors, the Taoiseach and Ministers earn, quite rightly, when she might be earning twice or three times what the Taoiseach or a Minister earns.  Until recently she might have earned twice what the President of the United States of America earns, and currently she earns more than the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany.  People find that hard to take, particularly given that RTE, as an organisation, would require additional supports from the taxpayer by way of the broadcasting charge.  They might appreciate there is a public service element to that but we are all in this together and nobody can be excluded from the type of haircuts that are required.  Certain personalities in RTE seem to be insulated in terms of their salary, which I do not believe has been taken seriously enough.  The representatives will respond by saying that some people's salaries were cut by 17%, 20% or 30% but that is not the point.  The point is that the baseline figure was ridiculous in terms of what one would expect from a public service entity.  Those Celtic tiger baseline figures must be forgotten and salaries benchmarked on what is sustainable in 2014, and I do not believe RTE has reached those figures yet.</p><p> I refer to an issue very close to home.  It is a bugbear of mine which I have raised here previously with the representatives.  &quot;Oireachtas Report&quot; is probably RTE's only interaction with the public in terms of the work done by this committee, for example.  &quot;Oireachtas Report&quot; appears to be broadcast for the benefit of insomniacs, people home from the pub where they should not be or those working nights.  It is broadcast at a very bad time.  Some people might believe we do not do much in these Houses but RTE broadcasting the programme at a time when it does not expect people to watch it, perhaps only very small numbers, is in stark contrast to what UPC has done with broadcasting Oireachtas debates.  It started broadcasting them on I believe Channel 800 on a trial basis.  I believe it is now broadcasting them on Channel 200, which proves that people tune into us.  I am sure there are people tuned into what is happening in the D&aacute;il Chamber now but one cannot find those debates on RTE on a daily basis.  One must either go online to the Oireachtas website or watch them on the UPC channel.  If we contrast that with BBC Parliament, it broadcasts proceedings from the national Parliament on a daily basis.  As legislators we are criticised about attention to detail and so on, and rightly so, but when people tune into &quot;Oireachtas Report&quot; they see only two people sitting in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  They do not see the people working in the four committee rooms questioning people such as the representatives.  That is a disservice to democracy and as the public service broadcaster, RTE has an onus to address that.</p><p> Mention was made of 2FM.  I was particularly disappointed with the representatives' reply in that regard.  2FM broadcast a strong flagship programme from Limerick.  RTE closed the London office, which was probably the wrong action to take at the time.  Last night, we saw Sharon N&iacute; Bheol&aacute;in broadcasting from in front of Buckingham Palace.  It was obvious that there was not a London office from which to do that, yet that office could make a huge difference in terms of the upcoming state visit by the President to the United Kingdom and so on.  RTE broadcast a very successful programme daily from Limerick and it was scrapped.  As a result, 15,000 people went on Facebook to try to have it returned but they were unsuccessful.  I wonder about RTE's commitment to the regions, particularly given that show had a huge listenership and traction, yet it was scrapped.  In the Limerick area 45% of the listenership do not listen to 2FM; it is only 11%.  However, that programme broadcast in the regions was ended.</p><p> In terms of what people are doing when they are watching programmes, those watching the Ukranian-Russian events proved what people are doing when they are watching RTE; they are tweeting.  I know RTE had a severe technical glitch the day of that broadcast, which in fairness was addressed, but it proves that people are engaging with the broadcaster, yet sometimes the broadcaster is behind the curve in regard to that engagement.  </p><p> Mr. Bakhurst might reply to this question.  What level of monitoring does RTE do of the tweets and online traction in response to the programmes it broadcasts, and how does it improve programming as a result?  Consumers using Twitter or Facebook to make a complaint is better than sending in a postcard.</p><p> People are often critical of RTE, and I am one of them.  We expect a great deal from the public service broadcaster but the annual Christmas schedule is like the recurring problem of the weight of schoolbags or the back to school costs for parents, and invariably there is a post mortem of the schedule after Christmas.  On behalf of people sitting at home at Christmas and as a member of this committee, I decided to watch RTE but if we compare an <i>RTE Guide</i>from three years ago to this year's <i>RTE Guide</i>, &quot;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&quot; is still on the schedule, as is &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;.  New Year's Eve is supposed to be a happy night but this year RTE wheeled out a person who is on the radio Monday to Friday.  I accept he serves an important role in terms of listening to people's concerns but New Year's Eve is supposed to be a happy night, yet in the countdown to 2014 we had to listen to everything that went wrong in 2013 - talk about starting off the year on a happy note.  If RTE expects people to stay at home and not go to the pub, and in fairness RTE did not encourage me to go to the pub, would it please look at these schedules?</p></speech>

The licence fee and public funding brings us together today.  For many households the &euro;160 annual licence fee is a lot of money but I believe it is good value for money for the content we get.  If I took my family to Croke Park for a concert or whatever, I would probably end up paying twice that.  If we are talking about fees, we should consider the context.</p><p>  On the content, much of it is subjective.  I would not appreciate all of the content but the content I am interested in is of extremely good quality.  That is what encourages most of us to watch RTE as much as we do.  Obviously, we do not watch everything and therefore we rely on the listenership figures and, increasingly, we are getting better value for money.</p><p>  On the financial side, we are presented with reports on a constant basis, many of them from public bodies, and every one of them will indicate that in the past five years the organisation's funding is down 10% or 20%, that it has maintained its service levels, done exceptionally well and so on.  I could mention every local authority doing exactly the same.  Having listened to many of their representatives for so long, one has to conclude that such huge reductions in funding and maintaining service levels was difficult and painful but there were many easily extracted costs.</p> <p>Now it is coming to the more difficult areas in terms of achieving those financial objectives.  RTE is not the only body to experience that kind of reduction in funding and still claim it maintains the service.  While it does so, this applies throughout the nation and everyone has suffered in that regard.</p><p> On the strategy, I listened to a report this week indicating that companies such as Facebook are investing millions of dollars in new technologies.  Is a five-year strategy for RTE too long in an environment where technology is changing as rapidly in broadcasting, advertising and all the different headings?  Is a five-year strategy tying the organisation down and not allowing it the flexibility it needs to adapt?</p><p> The witnesses mentioned the potential threats to the Irish market by the global players that are increasingly coming in and taking the advertising revenue.  What efforts is RTE making to go against the flow and target the much vaunted and publicised diaspora of tens of millions of people throughout the world who might be interested in accessing and paying for RTE content on a daily basis?</p><p> Is RTE realising the full potential of SAORVIEW?  Mr. Curran said earlier that it was a great success - more than RTE had bargained for.  However, could more be done there?</p><p> I listened to what Mr. Kennedy had to say on libel, etc.  The RTE submission stated that our system is dangerous for freedom of expression and that cannot be ignored.  From both this meeting and in engagements we have had with other media organisations, it is clear they would like to have something along the lines of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution apply here.  I am not sure if that is the right way to go.  We must also remember that the United States also has an amendment relating to the right to bear arms.  While I know certain people in this country would like the right to bear arms, I do not believe many of us would agree that is the right way to go.  It is about achieving a balance.</p><p> In that regard reference was made to the recent controversy on the "Saturday Night Live" programme and "A Mission to Prey" which this committee addressed approximately 18 months ago.  In any or all of the examples he gave of the different jurisdictions in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, United States, could Mr. Kennedy say that either of those two would not have ended up with the same result?  Are we using those two issues as a Trojan horse to make a case to change legislation?  I agree we might need to make a change because I have read RTE's examples of how opinion has to be dealt with in Ireland and the opinion of someone else on whose opinion it relies is dealt with.  It seems a bit onerous, but we need to be careful we do not use extreme cases that equally might not have succeeded in other jurisdictions to make a more substantial case to revise legislation in the area.</p></speech>

They are reaching the point of overload with the questioning from four of us together, so I will try to be as brief as possible.</p><p>  In some sections of the media RTE bashing is the done thing, which I never quite understood.  The great majority of the work RTE does is valuable and positive.  When I grew up on the western seaboard in the 1980s and 1990s it was very much two-channel land.  As a child, many of the events in my life were shared with RTE, including New Year's Eve in 1988 and watching the 1994 World Cup.  As we did not have too many options, RTE shaped many of my generation.  One of my earliest television memories is of the debut of Zig and Zag on afternoon television.  That is where I am coming from.</p><p>  I do not believe anybody today mentioned RTE's sports contribution to Irish society.  I have always been very impressed that for a relatively small country with small national broadcaster we are up there with the best in terms of coverage.  While we cannot compete with companies such as Sky for live English Premier League soccer action, there has always been excellent coverage of sporting events.  I compliment the recent addition to the television sporting schedule, "Soccer Republic" which covers much domestic as well as international soccer and is an excellent programme.  Unfortunately, RTE lost its English Premier League soccer highlights programme this year.  Perhaps a more affordable way of bringing that back to our screens could be considered for the 2014-15 season.  Now that Liverpool is going well, it might be nice to see it screened on Irish television.</p><p>  I am baffled over how the State broadcaster would consider screening some programmes, including celebrities getting married or couples competing with each other to have the best night out possible in the city.  I do not understand how RTE regards that as coming under its remit.</p><p>  Regarding 2FM, we have a number of commercial radio stations which cover that remit.  Is it necessary for 2FM to continue to come under the auspices of RTE?  I am not seeking the discontinuation of 2FM but I wonder if RTE should maintain responsibility for it into the future.</p><p>  Last year there was a very serious current affairs issue with certain tapes that were discovered.  It was very prominent in nearly all sections of Irish media, both print and broadcast, and yet RTE would not touch it.  I am sure the witnesses know the case to which I am referring.  Why did the State broadcaster not cover it?</p><p>  While I welcome RTE's improving financial situation, what is the forecast for 2014, 2015 and 2016?  Are those years expected to be positive?</p><p>  What controls are in place to ensure that the payment of costs for transporting guests and staff to and from RTE is not abused?  What system does RTE have for the procurement of transport?  What is the procedure where national or international "celebrities" appear on programmes?  What is the system for paying for their transport expenses?  While I do not wish to point to any individual case, I believe this needs to be highlighted.</p> <p>Some weeks ago, there was a lady on "The Late Late Show", which I would see as an institution that has done very positive work in informing debate in this country, who was brought over from the United Kingdom and had absolutely nothing to offer public debate or anything else, other than to be what I would call a freak show.  How much was spent in bringing that person here?  Did RTE pay the expenses for someone who I would see as self-promoting?</p><p> As Members of Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann, we all have an allowance for travel and accommodation and so on.  Why is it the case that if Oireachtas Members are on various programmes, their travel expenses are covered?  By all accounts, one Deputy ran up a &euro;500 taxi bill to go on an RTE programme where he was promoting himself.  Why is that the case?  That is just one example, and if it is happening across the board, why is it allowed to continue?  If RTE is looking at reducing costs, is it not something that should be tackled immediately?</p></speech>

It has come in under a particular section of the Broadcasting Act 2009, for which it has taken criticism.  I do not think UTV deserves criticism for that because it is entitled to come in under that section.  It means that UTV is not subject to the broadcasting levy and that it does not have requirements for Irish programming.  Frankly, if I was the chief executive of TV3 I would be very unhappy about it, but at the same time I think that is an issue for legislation.  Another issue to examine in the future is the split that seems to exist.  There are things UTV does not get, such as automatic carriage and a whole range of different things, but there are so many platforms now that businesses will get carriage if they negotiate it.</p><p>  UTV is a very good company.  It knows how to make money and has proven that everywhere it has gone.  I expect it is not coming into this market out of some sense of public service or for the good of its health.  Its management think there is money to be made here and that is an issue for all of us.  It is probably more of an issue for some of our competitors, because UTV does not have the requirement to invest in Irish programming, so its character will be much more distinctive from the character of RTE.   However, it is a crowded market and another player is coming into it.</p></speech>

I welcome hearing what exactly that entails.  I have huge respect for UTV.  It is very good at making money.  It is coming into a crowded market and still it thinks it will make money, so the commercial pie is shrinking.  The digital operators are increasing.  Sky is launching more opt outs and now we have UTV coming in, and there is only so much of that commercial income to go around, so I have a concern on that front.</p><p>  The &euro;5 million reduction relates to a couple of other questions around profitability for this year.  We budgeted to break even this year.  That was based on introducing a range of different costs.  I heard about the &euro;5 million when it was announced.  That had not been signalled and I understand Cabinet confidentiality and confidentiality about the budget.  There also seems to be some confusion, or perhaps not confusion-----</p></speech>

We need to get those reductions out of the way and then work through what we are going to do, but it is difficult for us.  We start working on a budget in August, and if we get a &euro;5 million hit in December, that will throw us, so we are working through that.   Several sports rights are up for negotiation at the moment and the loss of that &euro;5 million is bound to impact on what we can bid for those rights.  We are working through where we are at the moment.</p><p>  More State funding is for programmes.  This is through the broadcasting charge.  I have heard people say publicly that when things go bad for RTE, we start looking for public money.  We have not sought a licence fee increase.  We have submitted in the appendices the increases that all semi-State and comparative private sector companies have received.  We decided that we would sort ourselves out and sort out our own finances.  We are looking at the new broadcasting charge and we want to make a commitment on programmes, and I think the specific question was about what we were going to do with it.  Our commitment will be to programmes.  It would be absolutely untenable for me to come in here or to go to a Minister and say that we want to get a share of whatever is the new broadcasting charge because we will not exist if we do not get it.  That is not the position we have taken.  We have said that we are looking for increased public funding to compete with our competitors and to provide more to the public.</p><p>  I know Deputy O'Donovan from being here previously, but I also know the public have had a lot of concerns about salaries.  That is why we took the action we took.  I firmly believe that five of the top ten paid presenters in this country are not on RTE.  We are not like them and we are not like our commercial competitors, but we do compete with them.  I do not want to get into individuals and I do not want to get into criticism because it is a natural comparison, but if we pay someone &euro;290,000 on a contract, which is the reduced fee, and if we take Ministers, Chancellors and Prime Ministers around Europe - <i>The Irish Times</i><b><i></i></b>did an interesting actuarial survey on what those pension payments are worth - there is no pension payment on top of what we pay.  That is not to say they were not overpaid.  That is not to say the public do not have concerns.  I just think that some of the comparisons made directly between this-----</p></speech>

If that person has not made provision for his or her pension over a 20 year period, having been paid in excess of &euro;300,000 in today's money, then that is that person's problem.</p></speech>

All I am saying is that the comparisons with the people used are complicated.  If people use figures of two times and three times, that is complicated.  However, that is not the issue here.  The main issue is that we addressed the problem.  It was a difficult problem to address, frankly.  We got co-operation from the people involved - again I need to say this publicly - and we have taken substantial reductions out of that.  This does not mean that we will not judge each case on an individual basis, nor does it mean that we do not realise that the public has concerns about this issue.  That is why we took the action we took.</p><p>  I will ask Mr. Bakhurst to answer the question on "Oireachtas Report".</p></speech>

It is tricky.  There must quite a lot of insomniacs because the audience is quite substantial, even though the programme is on late at night.  The other thing we have managed to do by producing it more quickly is that we run it earlier now.</p> <p>We re-run it the following morning, so using the News Now channel and also using online, people do get that opportunity.  The News Now channel, which is basically available in Saorview and UPC homes, covers a lot of business here and a lot of committees, as well as business in the D&aacute;il itself.  That is well viewed and we cover a lot of parliamentary occasions on that channel.  People do appreciate that.</p><p> The question was asked about monitoring social media and we do monitor it systematically.  The central communications department at RTE monitors all social media about programmes.  I was monitoring the Ukrainian-Russian episode myself.  I went out quite quickly to respond to it, much to the disgust of my press officer.  I did so because I thought we needed to respond to it straight away.  Sometimes it is a good gauge of where the audience is but, on the other hand, it is not representative.  A lot of people are on there because they have their own causes.  It is useful to monitor it overall and is quite useful sometimes to gauge how a programme is going.</p><p> There were a lot of comments about "Prime Time" last night and a high level of interest in what they were doing last night.  On the other hand, a lot of people just have singular obsessions and use social media, including the hash tag of "Prime Time", to come on and say whatever they like to say.  That is their prerogative but it is not, therefore, a definitive guide to where the audience is.  It is a useful tool, however, and we do monitor it.  Weekly, the central communications department gives us a summary of the social media activity which we now include in our audience information.  We have whatever e-mails or letters come in and we also have a summary of social media activity and comments on social media.  That goes to all programme makers and is available within RTE.</p></speech>

We went through a massive financial restructuring with substantial cutbacks.  We closed the London office, as the committee has highlighted.  We want to reopen that office when we can afford to.  That was a difficult decision for us, but we have not closed regional offices.  We have gone into local arrangements and have moved offices, but we have not pulled out regional correspondents.  That could have been a very easy, simple decision.  It was a matter of a commitment we have that we are a national broadcaster.</p><p>  At a forum like this, I do not want to start talking in detail about individuals.  As regards the changes that were made in 2FM around Limerick, the person has not left 2FM.  They have moved to a different part of the schedule, which is worth noting.  On a general level, when I came into this position, a new plan had just been launched for 2FM.  I felt we needed to let that plan run.  That plan stabilised the station and I congratulate everyone involved in that, but it stabilised the falls and that is not good enough.  These are difficult decisions but stabilising the falls in 2FM is not good enough for us, so tough decisions have to be made.  That does not mean we are in any way pulling back on our commitment to the regions.</p><p>  Commercial broadcasters, particularly in Ireland, ignore the Christmas schedule.  They do not make much money so they largely ignore it.  That is not a criticism, as it is an understandable decision.  We do not make much money but we invest heavily in the Christmas schedule.  It does not mean that everyone is going to like everything what is on, but if one looks back through the most viewed programmes, we continually do better than our competitors.  We never paint it as a public service but it is in a way, in that our commercial rivals invest very little in that schedule.  I agree that it is an important programme.  Without going into individuals, we had reviews of some of the new year's output last year in which I was involved.  It is fair to say that some worked and some did not.  The ones that did not are unlikely to be repeated in that way.  That is what happens with programmes that one makes across the board, and I am not singling out any individuals.</p></speech>

He also mentioned a lot of other semi-State companies that have come in and have a similar story because similar economic conditions apply to them as well.  We have taken &euro;130 million out of the cost base.  There was some low-hanging fruit earlier on and it was taken out.  However, even in the last two years, we have taken over &euro;50 million out of the cost base through a wide-scale restructuring, so it was not just low-hanging fruit at that point.  We are continuing to do that so it is an ongoing journey for us, although where we can go at this stage is very minimal because the cost reductions have more or less been done.</p><p>  The Deputy also asked what other semi-State companies have done.  I am not here to throw cold water on anything that any other semi-State company has done because it is difficult for anyone in receipt of public funding to have that funding reduced.  Our own public funding was reduced by the order of &euro;20 million over the past five years, but the large part of our funding disappeared because our commercial revenue declined by &euro;95 million.  We suffer from that aspect of being a dual funded broadcaster in that our commercial as well as our State funding has been reduced.</p><p>  In the appendices we submitted today, we gave the committee comparisons with other semi-State companies.  We would argue that we have done more than double what others have done because we have had to.  We are not crowing over that but we have had to do so because of our funding requirement.</p><p>  As regards whether we have done enough, cost cutting is only one metric.  We have spent quite a bit of time benchmarking against our European counterparts, that is, other broadcasters such as ORF, Danmarks Radio and NRK in Norway.  We would compare favourably with them on a cost per hour basis.  We have also done studies on the cost of our orchestras and we compare favourably in that regard.  We believe we benchmark reasonably well or fairly well with other broadcasters in that respect.</p><p>  Deputy Dooley mentioned the conflict with cost reduction, that at some point one begins to start cutting into programmes.  Questions were raised about the London office and various programme cuts, and that will always be the tension.  Cost reduction gives rise to certain casualties that are not always appealing.  However, we try to maintain output, and despite all those cost reductions, our output levels have not been reduced that significantly over that period.</p></speech>

The answer is yes, but it was a legislative requirement.  When we saw it, I went to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and expressed the view that in a changing technological world, five years was a very long time.  The BAI accepted this and said that the concentration could be on the initial two to three years with the rest not quite aspirational but less concrete in terms of the actual plans and on a broader level.  I agree with the Deputy on that matter but we were aware of that and clarified it with the BAI which accepted it.  Therefore, the three years were very concentrated in terms of what we wanted to do and the rest were on a broader level.</p></speech>

There is a continual review because the commercial income did not meet our expectations last year.  We are continually reviewing it.  The Deputy will have seen that in the statement we made concerning Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta as well.</p><p>  In terms of premium, I said two years ago that it was an important service for us to provide internationally.  I felt we should be providing it internationally.  It is not absolutely within our control.  There are elements of this in terms of public value tests and other tests.  I would hope that we will be in a clearer position in the next three to four weeks to know, not what our plans are because we know what they are, but whether we can move towards some kind of an announcement in that regard.  I would reiterate that this is and has been a priority for us.</p><p>  I agree that more can be done and will be done with Saorview.  We have not had the marketing budget and have been constrained financially in linking the Saorview platform with platforms like Freesat in any overt way such as through combination marketing.  We believe that the combination of Saorview with some of those satellite services is a potent service, but we have been restricted in how overtly we can say that.  However, we have plans in that regard.  I have talked about Saorview being connected and we have other marketing plans.  I accept the findings of the recent BAI report from Ono, but it highlighted that Saorview and FirstView homes were 160,000 and may reduce.</p> <p>I felt very strongly that they completely ignored the second television phenomenon.  Having the Saorview platform in 700,000 homes, be it in regard to the first or second television, gives us a marketing tool that we need to expand on.</p><p> I will ask Mr. Eamon Kennedy to address defamation.  A specific question was asked on whether we are crying wolf in some respects.  Perhaps that is not the language that was used.  If the "Saturday Night Show" conversation &mdash; I am not judging the rights and wrongs to some degree &mdash; had been on the Jay Leno show, there would not have been a question of a defamation case.  The first amendment, the actual malice criterion and a range of other measures would have applied.  Had the conversation been in the United Kingdom, with its new changes to defamation law, the requirement that serious harm must be proven early on might have had an impact.  Certainly, we need to wait to see what legal precedents arise from the UK application of honest opinion.  I do not know whether Mr. Kennedy has a different view from me on that.  What I have expressed is as much a personal view as anything else.  Mr. Kennedy is free to contradict me.</p></speech>

Ultimately, a constitutional change would be required.  Even then, I wonder whether the first amendment approach would comply with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p><p>  The other interesting point is that while people say the first amendment is wonderful and permits much free speech, it must be noted that there are other aspects of the American structure that are less protective of free speech.  I refer to the protection of journalists' sources, for example.  It is not always black and white and absolute.</p><p>  The second document I sent in, on opinion, should be borne in mind.  The recent controversy necessitates a long, hard look at the detail of the new legislative provision for the protection of opinions.  This inspired the document.  There are some significant issues in this regard to be considered, not least the fact that Ireland has two constitutional provisions dealing with speech, one of which pertains to freedom of expression, or the public aspect of speaking, and the other of which is the right to communicate, which concerns the more private or day-to-day stuff.  When one considers these provisions and what has been included in legislation, including the language used in this regard, one finds that there are genuine concerns behind many of the issues raised.</p></speech>

People have a right to sue under current legislation.  There is no point in our blaming people.  If we defame people, there is no point in our blaming those who sue us or the lawyers.  Lawyers do not run RTE.  We take advice from lawyers and make decisions, and we need to take responsibility for that.  We need to be responsible in what we broadcast.  We are not looking for <i>carte blanche</i> authority to say what we like.  We feel that in the case of opinions, particularly those expressed by individuals in the public domain but also those of others, added protection is required.  Some of the language on honest opinion has proven to have been very complicated.  A number of issues arise but, importantly, we are not looking for a <i>carte blanche</i> to say what we like about people.</p></speech>

I can only talk from our point of view, but I believe the newspapers and other broadcasters would share my perspective.  We are expected to and obliged to have and facilitate debate.  We broadcast so much live debate that mistakes will be made.  Mistakes aside, people will interpret statements and react to them.  Facilitating reasoned debate &mdash; I do not mean mud-slinging or saying what one likes about people &mdash; to which people, particularly in public life, can take exception requires protection for broadcasters.

He asked a general question on how we control those kinds of matters.  We manage them individually based on programme budgets.  Each programme will have a budget.  Within each, there will be line items.  There are strict guidelines and appropriate levels of expenditure, including on guest fees and transport.  The Deputy mentioned some guests on "The Late Late Show".  Many guests promoting their own book or film do not receive a fee because it is a promotional event.  However, in the case of many others, for whom there may be international competition, we pay fees to attract them and make the show popular.</p><p>  With regard to transport costs, I believe the Deputy mentioned a taxi fare of &euro;500.  That would abnormal.  I certainly have not come across anything like that.  We tender for taxis.  Where we provide the taxi fares for contributors to programmes or programme guests, the programme producers or PDAs make sure in the first instance they have the most cost-efficient way of getting to the studio.  It is not always by taxi.  One can come on one's own steam.  Where we provide taxes, we tender the arrangements and ensure we get the most cost-effective one.  We operate a number of controls.</p></speech>

We probably went down that route less than others but there is an audience, particularly a younger one.  As I stated, we provide our legislative obligations through the broadcasting legislation and in doing so we are required to provide as wide a range of programming for as wide a public as possible.  We do much less reality television than some.  I do not want to say "the crasser end" but am referring to the reality shows of the kind one sees on the satellite channels.

Does one go to a market failure?  Does one say RTE's job is to provide anything that commercial television does not provide?  In that case, commercial television would basically tell us what programmes we should show.  I do not believe the Irish public wants to pay a licence fee for that.  It is a question of volume and where the programming sits in our schedule.  It usually sits on our second channel late at night.  One must ask where it sits, its priority, the expenditure thereon and what should be shown around it.</p> <p>I believe that RTE should have a wide schedule.  If we went too far down that road, we would have serious questions to answer.  Our policy of having entertainment programmes is underpinned at European and national level.  As I said earlier, it is also underpinned by the public, which wants us to do entertainment programmes as well as everything else.</p></speech>

This issue was covered in parts of RTE but not in as high-profile a way as the newspaper involved would have liked to have seen it covered.  It was a purely editorial judgment, not just on my part but also involving senior people around the place.  When we were criticised in one of the newspapers about our lack of coverage of the matter, I spoke to several people who had been deeply involved in the coverage of the tribunals and the whole matter that was covered in the tapes to see whether their judgment was that the tapes added a huge amount more to the story.  The judgment of a number of individuals to whom I spoke was that it merited some coverage but probably not as much as the newspaper involved would have liked us to have given it.  As I said to the editor of that newspaper, all of this sparked interest in several related areas which we are still looking at.</p></speech>

Our coverage of international events in sports like rugby also represents a critical part of our public service.  Sport is expensive.  We had an absolute bubble in the sports rights sector when Setanta initially expanded and TV3 received an investment of private equity.  We managed to hold on to the bulk of what we had.  I think people like Glen Killane and Ryle Nugent in our sports department deserve full credit for that.  It is getting more difficult.  Sky is a huge entity with huge resources.  It is becoming more difficult for us to hold on to all of these things, particularly following the reductions in public funding.  We compete in an international market.  We are committed to sport.  We are committed to holding onto sport, but it is becoming increasingly difficult.  The Premier League suffered because we needed to make a cutback.  We had to decide whether to drop a number of GAA games or to drop the Premier League.  We decided to drop the Premier League.  We are now making such choices on a daily and weekly basis.  We have managed to hold on to sports rights.  I think it will be increasingly difficult for us to do so.  There is no point saying otherwise.  It may have seemed that the hit we took in the budget involved a small amount of money, but &euro;5 million a year would secure an awful lot of domestic sports rights.</p></speech>

I do not know whether she will be able to answer it.  Many television and radio advertisements are currently telling people what will happen if they do not pay.  Are they working?  Does Ms O'Keeffe know whether they have resulted in an increased number of people paying the television licence?</p></speech>

An Post is the agent that is responsible for collecting the licence fee on behalf of the Department, which in turn grants us approximately 83% of the overall licence fee pot.  Evasion is an issue.  While the figures with regard to the level of evasion vary between RTE and the Department, there is agreement that it is between 16% and 18%, which is pretty high.  It is one of the highest levels in Europe.  The current advertising campaign followed last year's increase in evasion, which can be seen as a response to the economic downturn.  We accept that &euro;160 is a great deal of money for a household.  I suppose the advertising campaign is helping people to understand that they need to pay the licence fee even if they have a Sky or UPC subscription.  I think it is having an impact.  The modest recovery in the economy is probably helping as well.  Evasion continues to be an issue for us.</p></speech>

I wanted to wait until the end before making a few comments.  He said in his presentation that RTE "is established as a dual-funded, not-for-profit, statutory body".  He explained that "its purpose and activities are guaranteed by legislation, it is independently regulated and it is not accountable to wealthy business people, offshore private equity investors or the Government, but rather to the public which funds it".  There is a lot in that statement.  Is Mr. Curran suggesting that people with bottomless pockets, who are neither accountable nor regulated, are putting RTE at a serious disadvantage?  I feel this is an aspect of Mr. Curran's presentation that needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

RTE is a not-for-profit body.  When RTE was generating surpluses during the boom, they were not distributed back to the management or to outside shareholders.  Those funds were reinvested when we started looking at digital terrestrial television in the context of the legislative requirement in that area.  I think we are different in this respect.  When we make money, we reinvest it in programming or other elements of the schedule.</p></speech>

The broadcaster in question has said on the record that when he was approached, his published fees were immediately quoted.  The fact that we had published his fees meant that people knew exactly what to aim for.  That is what he said.  We are absolutely at a disadvantage in terms of access to funding across the board.  That is why I made a point earlier about the debate on commercial operators receiving public funding.  I am not speaking about the subsidiaries at a local level - I am speaking about people at managing director and other levels who need to realise it will be very difficult for them to get access to public funding without undergoing some of the strictures we undergo.</p> <p>The managing director and other levels need to realise that it will be very difficult for them to get access to public funding without undergoing some of the strictures we do.  We publish commitments every year in terms of hours of programming.  An independent consultant comes in and says whether we have met those commitments.  We have regular reviews in terms of efficiencies and have had two of them this year.  We publish our top presenters' fees.  If others are going to access public funding, I can only assume they will have to follow some of that.  I have to yet to hear senior figures in either of the two big media companies who acknowledge that this will be the case saying that in return they would like some more public funding because they are prepared to fulfil those obligations.</p></speech>

It goes on and on.  There is a huge public service commitment.  When one costs that, it is very significant.  Cherry-picking can take place where people ask why they cannot get a bit of that.  If one looks at the sheer expansiveness of section 114 and the public service obligations placed on RTE, including bringing Saorview to the public, on which RTE has been complimented, and ensuring it is free to air and a very good service, one can see this places many financial obligations on us as a service.</p></speech>

On the other side, 2FM has been referred to here as well as the definition of public service broadcasting.  People on the commercial side would say that public service broadcasting is not part of 2FM and that 2FM is losing money and can be propped up by funding money from the licence payer.  They are alleging that this is an unfair advantage.  For example, Today FM would be a similar type of station but if Today FM was not paying its way, it would be cut adrift whereas 2FM is not cut adrift.</p></speech>

In terms of the debate around 2FM, the Chairman is correct in that 2FM sits within RTE and RTE receives public funding.  2FM has a range of restrictions that commercial radio does not have in terms of things like minutage.  Under EU and Irish legislation, we are obliged to provide a wide range of programming and 74% of the Irish public in the BAI survey - not our survey - said they wanted RTE to have entertainment programmes.  I have come across this argument for a very long time and I understand it and that things are difficult for everyone.</p></speech>

What they are saying is that the funding RTE puts into 2FM from the taxpayer is covered under state aid rules but these same rules prevent them getting funding for the public service remit they produce.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-26a.553" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Curran" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014032600018#T00600"><p>The difference there is twofold.  When it comes to 2FM losing money, the commercial radio sector was much more critical of 2FM when it was earning money.  Over the past ten years, 2FM in total has contributed &euro;10 million which has been invested in public service programming elsewhere.  It has had a difficult few years and we want to see it turn around.  One must look at 2FM within that context.  I am all for people with a profit motive and people making money in the commercial sector and they can make money.  When a commercial radio station is sold, shareholders benefit.  The Chairman mentioned Today FM.  Today FM was sold as part of a &euro;200 million deal.  I am sure those figures would not apply today but if commercial revenue increases, they are still valuable properties.  We saw that in the sale in 2012.  One cannot have one's cake and eat it.  One cannot just say that we will have some of that public funding but will not have all those disclosures or release the top presenters' fees and if we sell and make millions, we will not pay back to the State whatever moneys we got but just distribute them among our shareholders.  That is the weakness in the argument.  Again, I sound very negative about commercial and I am not negative.  I think commercial radio does a fantastic job.  I think community radio, which is absolutely not for profit, does a terrific job as well.  However, this is not a straightforward argument but a nuanced and complicated one.  If someone can come forward with a plan which says that companies like Communicorp, which is one of the biggest radio operators in the UK, and UTV, which earns &euro;20 million per year pre-tax, should get public funding without any kind of requirement or onus on them as to how that money is being spent efficiently, it is a difficult argument to make.</p></speech>

In the interests of clarifying the situation, what was the process and the legal advice?  Is it true an apology would have avoided payments?</p></speech>

Let us talk about what is typical, and this is no different from most cases.

These matters get settled by two sets of lawyers negotiating and one gets to a finish which one hopes brings the matter to an end.  Unlike personal injury cases or breach of contract, the problem with defamation cases is that they are not popularity contests of people or ideas.  Once a person raises a complaint in the way one can raise it according to the way the defamation system works, there is a system there.  I am not saying it is utterly wrong.  That is not the point and I have never made that point.  Once someone raises a complaint within the system, one must deal with it in a rational way.  The point was made earlier that if this was defended for another six or 12 months, a white flag was run up the pole at the end of it and the costs were &euro;1 million, people in this room would take issue with it.</p></speech>
