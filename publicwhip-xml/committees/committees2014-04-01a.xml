    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dorothea Dowling" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014040100003#B00300"><p>I would like to make some introductory remarks before I pass over to Ms Byron to give members a summary of the last decade of operations since we opened our doors in July 2004.  I thank the joint committee for inviting us back to report on developments since we were last here in October 2008.  We rely heavily on the support of the committee which has been so instrumental in securing reductions in the cost of motor and liability insurance of 40% since 2002.  Members will recall that jobs were being lost because of the high cost of insurance.  We face similar challenges today in job creation, albeit for a different reason.</p><p>  Establishing the PIAB was one of the 67 recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board which was a <i>pro bono</i> group which worked from 1998 to 2004 on an investigation of the insurance industry.  Unlike many other reports, it did a little more than gather dust on a shelf somewhere, although I am told it is a cure for insomnia.  There were some fairly explosive findings, not least of which was that for every &euro;1 paid in compensation to injured parties, another 46% was spent on litigation overheads.  Not only have these professional fees been tackled in two thirds of cases which do not now need to go into the courts system but, through the injuries board model, people who are injured are receiving compensation in a matter of months - currently, seven months - as opposed to having to wait years in court.  This is good for rehabilitation, as well as for the financial consequences.  </p><p>  This is a non-adversarial documents-only procedure which focuses on medical assessments; it does not deal with legal disputes.  Almost 250,000 claims have been handled to date.  It is likely, therefore, that all members' constituents have either benefited from this approach as policy holders in paying reduced premiums or as injured parties in securing quicker compensation, either by direct early settlement within the first 90 days or through a formal award.  Maintaining this major saving in the cost of insurance is vital now more than ever for household budgets which are, as members know, under strain and also for struggling small businesses which are so important to the recovery of the economy, in particular the SME sector.  Unfortunately, it seems there is no Minister responsible for ensuring the cost of insurance is equitable for consumers and businesses; therefore, the role of the joint committee is vitally important.</p><p>  Members know that the establishment of the insurance reform programme arose form a previous economic challenge.  As a result of the escalating cost of motor and liability insurance, in 1998 the Motor Insurance Advisory Board inquiry was established.  Premium rates had increased by 48% since 1991 when court jurisdictions were last increased, largely because the promised reductions in legal costs were had not been delivered, and it had resulted in long delays in trials coming up in the lower courts.  It remains to be seen whether legal costs for litigation cases decreased after the recent increases in limits which commenced on 3 February 2004.  I find myself in the unusual position of being in agreement with the Law Society of Ireland that there are reservations about whether this will cause very long delays in the Circuit and District Courts in personal injury cases.  These are the cases that would rightfully be in the courts, not the assessment-only cases which are dealt with by the PIAB.</p><p>  The PIAB has faced repeated challenges by certain small sections of the legal profession.  The first judicial review was launched within weeks of opening our doors in 2004.  A decision in the case of O'Brien and the Law Society <i>v. </i>the PIAB was ultimately delivered in December 2008, a couple of months after we last appeared at the committee.  Members may be interested to know that when the case was over, we were presented with the plaintiff's legal bill for &euro;2 million.  Of course, we challenged it and the figure of &euro;2 million was reduced by the High Court Taxing Master to &euro;393,000 in June 2010 - an 80% cut - but he commented that there needed to be some deterrent to the submission of excessive legal bills.  I suggest this is a role for the pending legal services regulatory authority.  </p><p>  In the context of questionable injury claims, there are strong deterrents in the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to overstating one's case, with potential fines of &euro;100,000 and jail terms of up to five years.</p> <p>If a respondent has any reservations about the genuineness of a claim, he or she can take it to court rather than to consent to it being assessed through our non-adversarial process.  It could be said full revision of the non-adversarial process could only be fully exploited since October 2010 when Mr. Justice Sean Ryan dismissed the test cases challenging our refusal to award legal costs under section 44.  Despite all these hurdles, the PIAB through the executive management team, many of whom are present, has fully delivered on its statutory remit.  We have also achieved a self-imposed, self-funding model.</p><p> Additionally, entirely on our own initiative, we repaid the &euro;6.9 million set-up costs for which a cheque was delivered to the Minister's office in December 2011.  This financial outcome is in stark contrast to the projections by various notable experts engaged by both the Law Society and the Bar Council in their resistance to the reforms in 2002 but I am pleased that 99% of the profession has embraced the new reality and is working effectively with the board.</p><p> The consumer perspective is more important than that of the lawyers.  The AA conducted a survey recently and indeed gave evidence to the Joint Committee on Transport last September that ten years previously the average motor insurance premium in Ireland was twice that of the UK whereas now it is half that of the UK.  The CSO has confirmed a 40% reduction in costs, which Ms Byron will address.  All this was achieved through the MIAB implementation plan and a Cabinet sub-committee involving this committee and it is a good example of joined-up thinking which I suggest could be used in other areas rather than people operating in silos.</p><p> I refer to the long-term future.  Because of the increasing internal efficiencies generated by Ms Byron and her executive team over the past decade and the successful defences of the judicial reviews, the board has financial reserves in excess of &euro;10 million, which members will have seen in our published accounts.  Those funds were raised in accordance with our legislation solely for the purposes of assessing personal injury claims.  This presents the Government with an ideal opportunity to establish at zero set-up cost an alternative to the courts for medical negligence clams, as was originally intended and as was envisaged in most recent Fine Gael manifesto.  This would not only achieve substantial savings for the Exchequer but also relieve the stress of adversarial litigation from injured parties in those cases which should be regarded as assessment only, which was recently commented on by the High Court.  This reform is not about the PIAB taking over the role of the State Claims Agency whose position is that of an insurer to any respondent who needs to investigate liability but about extending the option for suitable cases to be resolved quickly without adversarial litigation and costs.  In this context, medical negligence includes slips, trips and falls on hospital premises and not just complex medical procedures.</p><p> Important people said this could not be done and it would not be done but here we are and we have delivered.  We thank the committee for its support.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia Byron" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014040100004#C00200"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to address the committee.  Because it is ten years on, I thank politicians for the cross-party support, which was fundamental; the board, including Ms Dowling and Mr. O'Toole, who have travelled with us on a robust journey; the executive who are present in the Gallery and our staff.  It has been truly a combined effort to reach today.</p><p>  I would like to talk about the context we have emerged from, our results, the impact on society, the reform agenda, which is the at the centre of all the Government is looking at currently, citizen-specific impacts and how to harness organisational capacity and capability for the good of the Exchequer, the taxpayer and society at large.</p><p>  The board was established ten years ago.  It was many years in the making.  There was a joint Oireachtas committee report in 1986, a Deloitte &amp;amp; Touche report in 1996 and the MIAB report in 2002, which Ms Dowling chaired.  We had cross-party political support.  The proposals that were made were seen as sensible and that has proven to be the case.  This is recognised today.</p><p>  Our function is quite different from the State Claims Agency which is a respondent to any claim.  We are a quasi-judicial entity akin to the Courts Service.  Our specific work is in the delivery of personal injury awards and our mandate was to lower the handling costs, increase delivery timelines and ensure consumers received the same level of award.  We have removed cases from costly litigation which was the key driver of insurance prices and the closure of businesses at the time.  The six o'clock news was awash with stories of various businesses closing down because of the cost of insurance just ten years ago.  It is important to understand that personal injury claims which have a higher value but the volume of which has lowered, drives the cost of insurance premia rather than, say, the higher volume of property damage claims.</p><p>  With regard to results, we have made 70,000 awards to date amounting to &euro;1.5 billion in compensation to citizens.  The highest award was in excess of &euro;1 million and there is no ceiling to the award we can make.  Our timeline for cases is 7.3 months and the legislation requires a nine-month turnaround.</p><p>  When we opened our doors, it took on average three years from the date a writ issued to somebody receiving compensation.  The awards are consistent and we follow a book of quantum, which is reflective of court awards.  We continue to get feeds from court data to ensure ongoing consistency.  There has been direct savings of &euro;500 million in cases that go as far as a formal award.  However, we opened a service centre operating between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. and we facilitate and support further claims which conservatively deliver savings of another &euro;500 million.  That gives a total saving of &euro;1 billion over the ten years.</p><p>  Our delivery costs are less than 8% of any award we make.  Litigation costs at the time we opened were 46% and today run at 58%.</p><p>  I refer to the impact on society.  We deliver the same level of awards as the courts.  We are faster than them and we are more effective in delivering these particular type of claims, which are assessment claims.  Dispute claims remain within the court system.  We have worked hand in glove with the court system to ensure it can deal with contested cases and clear courts for other activities.  We have reduced our processing fee.  At one stage it was &euro;1,050 but it is now a flat fee of &euro;600 per case.  We have reduced the demand on court services and allowed the court rooms and the Judiciary the capacity to hear other cases.  We allow people to return to worker faster, rehabilitate faster and to contribute to the economy.  There is less strain on medical services.  Over a three year period on average there were repeat medicals at least every six months but that does not happen anymore.  People can process their claims directly with the board or go through a third party but we do not pay legal fees by and large unless a legal issue arises.  This is not a legal system; this is an administrative process.  Car insurance costs in terms of asset results are down 40% according to the CSO.</p><p>  With regard to reform initiatives, we have also looked outside the board and we have contributed and participated in the call for reform across the public sector.  State employees who were involved in motor accidents and had their salaries paid were not required to include that in their claim for recoupment from the offending party as happens as part of people's contracts in the private sector but that is happening now.  There was also no requirement for welfare benefits paid to accident victims to be part of the insurance claim and recouped to the State but that is now required.  We are in the process of completing a significant framework tender for back office administration services, document management, financial transactions, medical appointments, registration of claims and other initiatives - high volume, high value triage activities.  The framework will not only be open to this board but also to every other State agency.  We believe this is true efficiency.  There are other pending reform initiatives.  We are drawing up a tender in association with the Garda to source general practitioner services.</p> <p>We are considering a framework tender for medical consultants and very open to working with other entities across the State in driving value and reducing the need for repeated tenders.</p><p> With regard to medical negligence cases, we obviously believe there is potential for significant savings, with some &euro;600 million standing in reserves in the State Claims Agency.</p><p> On a specific delivery for the citizen, the cost of insurance premiums has reduced.  Therefore, if one runs a business or insures one's car or any product bought over the counter, the cost of insurance runs through it.  There is no requirement to have an adversarial system.  The book of quantum ensures predictability and consistency.  From a public interest perspective, we have made many public interest comments on claims harvesting which is being promoted by a number of entities in the public arena in order to promote claims.  Obviously, members will have heard our views in that regard.  The insurance industry is stating there is a case for increasing the cost of insurance premiums in the State, but we cannot see the need.  The industry is on record time and again, through the Irish Insurance Federation, as implying it is the cost of personal injury claims that drives premium costs.  If we are reducing the cost of processing &mdash; in fact, there is an increase in the volume of claims &mdash; we cannot see a case for increasing insurance premium costs.</p><p> The board is open from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. and people may talk to or correspond with it.  Obviously, the website is available for 24 hours a day.  We have online application forms and launched an app.  There is no need for third party representation which adds to the cost of the process.  There is no representation during the process.  There are no oral hearings, nor is there a mounting of the case.  We focus on the facts, medical evidence, invoices and bills, which is what drives an award.</p><p> We have a very high customer satisfaction rating.  All of our e-services have been in development in recent years.  We have a plain language website and a list of frequently asked questions.  We also present a variety of case studies.  For 2014 we plan to develop a number of portals for those who are doing business with us, through which one can gain access and deliver information.</p><p> How have we created this capacity and model?  From day one, we segmented core and non-core activities and outsourced.  The initiative to which I refer is another to which we have been contributing across the public service in regard to the capacity of the service to outsource more, where appropriate.  This allows for a focus on core activities and, of course, one to drive quality.  When one keeps the core activities in-house and uses one's technical experts to focus on these activities rather than having them chase paper, telephone calls or general queries, it allows one to meet that objective.  One of the key deliverables of the board was outsourcing from day one.  This system offers scalability, flexibility and capacity and keeps fixed overheads to a minimum.  We have specific capability in respect of outsourced service provision and can take on more work.  Our self-funding model obviously speaks for itself.  When we opened the doors of the injuries board, we had a set-up grant from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  We paid it back with a cheque of some &euro;7 million just two years ago.  The board is entirely self-funding and on a sustainable basis.  We can now say that with confidence ten years on.  As for the future, the State should be considering more redress schemes, employing a non-adversarial model.</p><p> With regard to insurance, there should be greater transparency associated with the data insurance companies provide for the State, customers and shareholders as they consider their options.</p></speech>

The work the board has done for the past ten years has led to impressive results.  Ms Dorothea Dowling, as chairperson of the board, her board members and Ms Byron, the chief executive, have done great work.  They are flagging very important issues on which we must work in the future.  The results speak for themselves.  As a committee, we should certainly be taking the advice of the board.  This hearing is to decide how we should move on and take the next step.  I compliment the delegation on the results achieved and a job well done.</p></speech>

I pay tribute to Ms Dowling, her executive team and the board.  I welcome back Mr. Joe O&rsquo;Toole who is now on the other side of the fence.  The work done is really impressive.  Those who doubt public sector reform can be achieved should note this model.</p><p>  We had a good briefing with the board a few weeks ago in Buswells Hotel and the representatives have furnished us with this presentation.  I have since been doing some work in comparing the board with the State Claims Agency which in 2013 paid out &euro;85 million in legal fees under various headings.  The average lifetime of the various claims from the date of lodgment with the State Claims Agency to completion is three years for public liability claims.  For employer liability claims, it is 2.7 years.  For clinical claims, it is four years.  The fast and efficient model of the PIAB compares favourably with these figures.  Would the delegation dare to suggest different models?  Would the PIAB have suggestions on how the State Claims Agency could up its game and, perhaps, look to the board to do its work more efficiently?</p><p>  Will Ms Dowling clarify the position on the management of health claims, including claims related to slips and trips?  If I went into a hospital today and fell over a mat, I would have to go through the State Claims Agency, in the same way I would have to with a negligence claim.  It should really be dealt with by the PIAB.</p><p>  The delegation mentioned redress.  Has the board ever been consulted by the Department of Justice and Equality or any Department that has established a redress scheme in the past ten years on involving the board or its model in such a scheme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dorothea Dowling" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014040100005#D00600"><p>I will deal first with the question on policy issues from a board perspective.  We have made numerous submissions to our parent Department and, in turn, the Department of Justice and Equality on taking from the courts some of the cases that would be appropriate to our non-adversarial documents-only medically focused system.  Thus, they could be assessed quickly and at a low cost.  This has nothing to do with how the State Claims Agency handles claims.  That agency's role is to investigate the liability and talk to the various individuals who might be involved.  The difficulty is the way in which legislation was formed in that if the agency considers its client needs to answer a case, it must take the litigation route.  We are suggesting there be an option for claimants who happen to have a fall, slip or trip that is being dealt with by the State Claims Agency.  We believe they should have the same redress option as any other claimant, that is, to use the non-adversarial PIAB system.  I wonder whether it is even constitutional for somebody to be required to go through a litigation system.  If one were to fall in a supermarket, one could go through the non-adversarial system.</p><p>  The board secretary was very much part of our team at the time we were organising all of this, that is, before there was a board.  When the legislation was being drafted, an unfortunate coincidence was that the enterprise-wide liability system for the medical sector was being negotiated.  There was a slight exception clause inserted into the legislation that stated the medical negligence aspect would not be catered for at the time because it was under discussion.  However, it was always intended that we would be covered.  The idea of the enterprise-wide liability system in respect of medical negligence cases and the idea of the new system that the Judiciary is calling for mean that it should not matter to the injured party whether the doctor, nurse or hospital is involved where there is a case to be dealt with.  There is no point in 60% of the State's money being spent on sorting out who takes what percentage when, in fact, the person injured may have to fall on State services in the meantime.  I refer to periodic payments, in accordance with the Medical Insurance Advisory Bureau's recommendations, rather than one lump sum, and to circumstances in which one's care costs would be dealt with annually on the basis of care as the needs arises.  The other side of the current system is such that someone who receives &euro;6 million or &euro;10 million may not know how to manage idt for the entirety of their lives.  Perhaps their life expectancy is not as great as originally anticipated.  Such circumstances should be compared with those of somebody else who may be in deficit over a similar period.</p><p>  It is not a case of our setting ourselves up in competition with the State Claims Agency.  We have very different roles.  What we are saying is that, rather than having all cases dealt with by the State Claims Agency enter the old litigation system, claimants should have an option of using the non-adversarial system operated by the PIAB.  It seems that if there are slips, trips and falls in a hospital, they are all within the ambit of medical negligence procedures.</p><p>  In regard to the issue of redress, we have not been consulted on many relevant matters to the extent that we might have liked, but Ms Byron has been in discussions on some of them.  She will elaborate on the issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia Byron" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014040100005#D00700"><p>We were asked by the Department of Justice and Equality to consider some redress schemes, but it did not work out.</p> <p>We think primary legislation would have been involved.  </p><p> In relation to medical negligence, a document was examined by the Departments of Health and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, but we found that the boxes to be filled in did not account for the timeline to delivery, outcome and processing costs.  We considered it to be a fundamentally flawed approach not to consider these.</p><p> Regarding medical negligence <i>per se</i>, intentionally or unintentionally, people tend to confuse cause and effect.  With regard to cause, one must identify if we are in the circle of the State and whether it has caused an offence.  The question of whether we gave the wrong tablet can be easily identified, but the output could be a complex injury.  There is no difficulty in assessing the injury which is what we do, as members can see from figures for the past ten years.  As with motor accident and workplace and public place claims, in the medical negligence sphere there must be an option to save the taxpayer more money.  Prompt investigation in a hospital, akin to prompt investigation of workplace claims, which we do, should identify quickly whether the State has caused an offence.  This does not apply to all claims but to a large volume of them.  Thereafter, there is an assessment of the value of the award.  We follow medical reports and make the award.  Some say the nine month timeline in primary legislation is unsuitable in medical negligence cases.  I agree, but that does not mean that members cannot change the primary legislation on medical negligence claims.  If there is a sum of &euro;600 million in reserve and we take out &euro;200 million and allocate half of it, &euro;100 million, to legal costs, what can we do with the savings?  Conservatively, &euro;50 million is not a high figure.  There are huge opportunities in that space, but I will not become overexcited by that alone.  The culture of looking at redress in a non-adversarial way will yield much more for the citizen and the State.</p></speech>

Doing something in a period of seven months rather than what it used to be, three years, is deserving of congratulations.</p><p>  My query concerns negligence cases.  In my experience in the supermarket business, there were a number of occasions when people sued us because they had fallen on the floor in the supermarket.  They assumed that, because it had happened in the supermarket, we were liable, but the judge found we were not negligent in that we had done everything that was expected.  I am thinking of one particular case in which a woman slipped on a grape and injured herself, but we were able to prove we had two well trained cleaners on duty that day who had done what the judge described as all that could be expected.  It does not make sense that it becomes a case of medical negligence because someone slips on the floor in a hospital.  I do not know how one goes about solving this problem.</p><p>  Will the delegates explain what is meant by shared services and the extent to which it is possible for the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to share services with other State boards?  Perhaps the Personal Injuries Assessment Board does this already.  Ms Dowling spoke about joined-up thinking and it seems that is what we need.  If there is an ability to share services with other boards, it is a huge opening.  Is this something the Personal Injuries Assessment Board is already doing or is it taking the first steps towards it?  Does the board need legislation to facilitate it?</p></speech>

I suspect there is great scope for outsourcing within the Civil Service system.  We have reforms elsewhere in the wider public service and need to drill down into them.  Shared services are separate from the negligence issue.</p><p>  On the issue of slips, trips and falls, it is supposed to be the law that those who lose cases have costs awarded against them.  It should not be a risk-free journey.  My suspicion is that in the case referred to by Senator Feargal Quinn an insurance company was involved; such companies tend not to pursue recovery of costs actions, as they are very time-consuming and take a long time.  The general message is that people might as well have a go and that there is no downside.  The first two recommendations implemented from the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, included a ban on advertising by solicitors with the words "no foal, no fee".  It is false advertising because there is no such thing as "no foal, no fee".  Suing someone in the wrong means accusing someone in the wrong and an order for costs will be made.  In the insurance industry where the concern relates to the underwriting cycle and closing files quickly in order that firms get their pricing right firms are not prepared, much like the members of the self-insured task force in the State sector, to pursue matters by taking &euro;5 a week.  It is very annoying and does not seem to be cost-effective, but it has an electrifying effect on those who might be thinking about having a go without a proper basis for doing so.</p><p>  On the theory of negligence, I am addressing a conference in Limerick on 24 May.  The level of duty of care is an international issue, but it is not the responsibility of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to influence it in any way.  We must respect the law of the land in that regard.</p></speech>

We have been working closely with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and spoken at many conferences.  Our framework is almost complete and includes three major companies.  People can draw down very quickly and choose from 60,000 calls to be answered in a crisis or 1 million pieces of paper to be triaged or scanned.  Our portals will be available to bring the work through.  We have positioned ourselves in regard to providing capacity.  That is what I was referring to in respect of scale and flexibility which we can bring to the table across the public service.  After that, public servants are in a position to act as technical experts.  In my office in Tallaght our technical experts focus on making quasi-judicial awards, whereas our outsourced service centre in Cork brings in the paperwork, uploads it and encourages people to use online services.  We do not see any paper in Dublin.  We are endeavouring to bring the shared services model across the public service.  It is there for the taking and harnessing, but I am not sure it is being exploited or recognised.</p><p>  With regard to negligence cases, things have changed enormously.  The law requires that investigations be carried out within 90 days.  The clarity of the case where it is truly defendable can become clear to us and we allow it to go straight to the courtroom for a full defence.  Where the inquiry identifies that someone spilled some orange juice, for example, and a lady was injured as a result of the supermarket's negligence, the latter must consent to our process and we will make the award within a matter of months.</p></speech>

We read in the media about blunderbuss outsourcing, where people cut down jobs and have things done elsewhere, but that is not what we mean by outsourcing.  It means keeping our staff doing what we want them to do and creating employment in other places by obtaining a service.  We are talking about other arms of the State being able to do what they are doing more efficiently by sharing the service.  It is probably done outside the Department or organisation concerned and there is huge potential in this regard.</p></speech>

This has been done very successfully by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>In respect of external shared services, the State should not continually invest in the technology that is changing, not just by the month but by the day.  We can buy or drop the services and connect with these external suppliers, as we wish.  We have been doing this for ten years and we have the capacity to do and grow it.  A common framework could be put in place for all State registrations and paperwork which could then be brought into the technicians.  Although the quality of the public servants who have been appointed is very high, maybe they should not administer general queries on paper and so forth.</p></speech>

That is an estimate because there is nobody in the business of finding out what it should be, which is a discussion for another day.  It is largely based on analysis by the National Consumer Competitiveness Council of the cost of doing business in Ireland, and the rate at which legal costs have gone up where all other professional fees have come down since 2006.</p></speech>

It was X% regardless.  I have in mind three of those inquiries: the Competition Authority; the Haran report on legal costs and one for the Miller report on the implementation of legal costs</p></speech>

The effect can be quite a complex injury but that is for the medical people, not the lawyers, to determine.  We would make an award when the medical reports were submitted, if we were handling that.  Finding the cause is akin to investigating in a shop, an office or any other very determined environment.  We also deal with public liability claims and if there is a hole in the street we have to establish whether, for example, Eircom, ESB or Bord G&aacute;is opened it up.  Those claims go through our board.</p><p>  If one is in a hospital environment these people are in the hospital&rsquo;s employment, and it has health and safety obligations to report and record.  It is more a question of duty of candour where the culture does not position people to say they were in theatre and used the wrong implement or that there was a lack of oxygen for five seconds.  The outcome of that cause can be very complex but that is for a medical person to determine and it is for us to put the figure on it.  Cases where there is dispute over whether it was the implement used, the skill of the technician, the surgeon, the nurse or whoever, can be released to the courts, as now similar cases in respect of motor, public place and workplace claims are released.</p><p>  At the moment the State uses its insurance company, the State Claims Agency, under motor, public place and workplace claims to go to litigation for contest cases, those it feels it can and should defend.  For other cases, where it has identified itself as being in the circle, it uses the PIAB.  Why would it not use that system for medical claims, especially when it has reserves of &euro;600 million? </p></speech>

I spoke to an <i>Irish Times</i> journalist before Christmas about remarks made by a High Court judge about the way some cases had been dealt with and how they could have been dealt with differently.  The judge&rsquo;s article was discussed in that interview and I received a letter from the State Claims Agency telling me to withdraw my opinion.  It said the basis for that was that, &quot;Over the past number of years the agency&rsquo;s proactive and efficient management of clinical claims has made significant savings in respect of the independent, actuarially predicted spend on clinical negligence litigation&quot;.</p><p>  That just focuses on the outliers.  Our point is that there are other straightforward matters in there.  The injuries may be quite serious but the case may be straightforward because, for example, the doctor said to the woman after a delivery that there would be no cover-up, that they made a mistake and would deal with it.  However, the woman then finds that it takes years to deal with it on the basis of full defence and is told she will have to pay costs.  Unfortunately, I did not have a chance to respond to the letter because I was dealing with the public sector reform programme for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin.  The State Claims Agency has sent that letter to all members of the board. </p></speech>

This is a useful forum in which to tease out those issues.  We can revert with helpful suggestions.</p></speech>

We were set up at a time of crisis.  There was an employment control framework at the time from which we were exempt and as we do not draw a cent from the Exchequer and have repaid the set-up costs of &euro;7 million, we feel very strongly that we should not be curtailed by the employment control framework in not being able to replace people who leave for various reasons, including retirement.  That just means the work must go somewhere else at a greater cost.  No case has successfully been made for us to be exempted from the employment control framework.  As I depart from the chair, I am aware that Ms Byron's team has performed under extreme pressure, and there is a point beyond which cost cutting does not continue to pay.</p></speech>

Before we begin, I remind members that we should approach this discussion from the remit of this committee.  Therefore, I ask them to concentrate on issues with which we are concerned, the first of which is the  location of any proposed windmill in Ireland and the consultation process to be engaged in to allow the views of local communities to be heard and their concerns met in so far as is possible.  The second concerns how the installation and operation of windmills will contribute to Ireland's obligations to meets its carbon reduction targets and to what extent they will reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels.  The Minister is joined by Mr. Kenneth Spratt, whom I also welcome.  I invite the Minister to give us an overview of the current position.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.67" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014040100003#D00300"><p>I thank the Vice Chairman and the joint committee for organising a series of hearings on this issue and inviting me to address them on the generation and use of electricity in Ireland and the potential export of surplus electricity to the United Kingdom.</p><p>  First, I need to distinguish between different types of development connected with power generation and supply.  These are often rolled up together and presented as one, but there are at least three types of development we need to consider: wind farms to generate power; transmission lines to carry power from where it is generated to where it is consumed; and the infrastructure needed to export to another country any renewable electricity surplus to our requirements.  What is driving all of this is the pressing need to transform the energy system in order to reach the goal of decarbonisation.  The committee will not need to have explained to it the shocking implications of this week's latest instalment of the UN report on climate change.  Therefore, renewables will continue to form a hugely significant part of Ireland's and Europe's energy portfolio.</p><p>  I will begin by dealing with the issue of electricity generation.  Ireland's immediate goal is to achieve its EU 2020 target of 16% of energy coming from renewable sources.  This imposes challenges for us in terms of rate of build.  These challenges will endure for the remainder of the decade.  Specifically, we must move from an average historical build of approximately 170 MW per year to 250 MW.  We have made significant progress to date.  The contribution of renewable energy to overall energy demand rise from 2.3 MW to 7.1 MW between 1990 and 2012, with renewable electricity contributing 4.1 MW to the overall energy demand in 2012.</p><p>  It is not enough to build renewable generation facilities.  The power produced must be transported, often from remote locations, to where it is needed.  EirGrid's Grid25 project is its strategy for Ireland's future electricity transmission network and it is a long-term strategy for the development of a network that will provide a safe, secure and affordable electricity supply throughout the island.  This strategy is crucial in planning for the new infrastructure needed to cater for growth in demand on the island, for economic recovery and fresh growth, for balanced regional development and for the integration of additional generation facilities, both conventional and renewable.</p><p>  Renewable generation requires new infrastructure and the transmission system requires new infrastructure.  This reality raises planning and other environmental questions.  In July 2012, at my request, the Government approved a policy statement on the strategic importance of transmission and other energy infrastructure.  That policy restates in clear terms the need for development and renewal of all of our energy networks in order to meet our economic and social policy goals.  It is the planning process that provides the framework for ensuring all necessary standards are met and that comprehensive consultation is built into the process.  In our policy statement we formally mandated the State companies not simply to plan their developments safely, efficiently and economically, but also to address and mitigate any human, environmental and landscape impact in delivering the best possible engineering solutions.</p><p>  The review by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, in conjunction with my Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, of the existing wind energy planning guidelines is key to ensuring wind farms do not impact negatively on the environment.  Responses to the public consultation are being considered, with a view to the final guidelines being published in mid-2014.  In regard to transmission, last January I established an independent panel of experts, chaired by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, to decide terms of reference for comprehensive, route specific studies of overhead and underground options for both Grid Link and Grid West.  The outputs from these studies which will be required to be complete, objective and comparable will be published before proceeding to the next stage of public consultation on these two projects.</p> <p>The two studies will take account of environmental, including visual, amenity impacts, technical efficacy and cost factors.  The panel has now commenced its deliberations, including considering what work, if any, it might usefully undertake on the North-South transmission line.</p><p> There is potential for Ireland's excellent renewable energy resources to be developed for export.  Last year I signed a memorandum of understanding with my opposite number in London as a first step towards an intergovernmental agreement to facilitate trade.  From an Irish perspective the potential benefits examined include jobs, community gain, interconnection benefits, corporation tax receipts, a dividend on value, and local authority rates.  Significant employment can be created, for example, employment arising from a 3GW project would be expected to be in the order of 3,000 to 6,000 job years in the construction phase, with the actual number dependent on the construction schedule to 2020.  The New Economic and Recovery Authority, NewERA, advised that there would be approximately &euro;1 billion worth of construction spending on civil engineering over two to three years.  Additional jobs will also be created in the ongoing maintenance of turbines over a 20 year operating life.  Further employment opportunities would arise if turbines or components were manufactured in Ireland.</p><p> On the Irish side, we have done immense preparation towards concluding an intergovernmental agreement, IGA.  The prize is a big one, including holding out the prospect of a new mission for Bord na M&oacute;na, a State company that controls tens of thousands of acres of unencumbered cut-away bog in the midlands.  Over recent weeks, however, it has become apparent that the economic policy and regulatory complexities involved and the key decisions yet to be taken by the UK would make 2020 delivery very difficult to achieve given project lead times.  At the Anglo-Irish summit in London in March, the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister agreed that the exploration of a possible new architecture was required if an intergovernmental agreement on the export of renewable electricity was to work to the benefit of both jurisdictions.  My Department and the Department of Energy and Climate Change in the UK have been examining the outcome of the London meeting.  It is clear, however, that key policies and regulatory design decisions remain to be taken by the UK Government, which means that we are still a considerable distance from settling on the specifics of what the Irish Government and the renewable generators believe must be the basic components of any intergovernmental agreement.  Even if the timeline for the commercial opportunity to deliver renewable energy to the UK by 2020 cannot be met, the long-term opportunities to export renewable energy will endure as Europe moves to an increasingly interconnected electricity market, supporting increasing amounts of renewables to achieve sustainability and to enhance security of supply.</p><p> In realising our renewable energy potential for domestic and export purposes, and its inherent economic benefits, we must ensure the concerns of communities and citizens are properly addressed.  The concerns of communities must be at the heart of the move to renewable energy.  The environmental and economic benefits of renewable energy are real.  Early ongoing and transparent communication is critical, if we are to deliver vital energy infrastructure and to ensure this benefit is realised for all citizens.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.69" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1102" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014040100004#E00200"><p>I thank the Minister and his officials for coming to the meeting today.  It is useful for them to be here.  I live in Laois and the export project is a major issue there and across the constituency in Laoighis-Offaly, Westmeath and South Kildare.  It would appear that there is disagreement between the two parties in the British Government on the direction of the export-led projects.  The nuclear lobby, the fracking lobby and North Sea gas seem to prevail.  The export project seems to be on hold, which we welcome.</p><p>  We have several concerns.  The county in which I live and the surrounding counties are being turned into giant wind farms to produce electricity for the British market.  I have no problem with exporting anything.  The more we can export, the better.  However, we have been asked to accept something that the British public would not put up with in rural areas.  There is serious concern about this because in order to capture wind energy in the midlands the turbines must be of a height the Minister and I have never before seen.  They are absolutely enormous.  The proposal is to locate them in areas not zoned under county development plans.  The Minister is aware of some of the problems in respect of buying up land rights.  We want all of this put on hold, regardless of what the British are doing.  That they are holding it up is good news.  The Irish Government should be holding it up and taking a second look at it.</p><p>  There is not even a cost-benefit analysis for this project.  Financiers now say that it is cheaper for the British and other governments to buy electricity produced by nuclear power and other sources.  I want to see it produced from renewable sources.  Will the Minister address the economics of this project?  With respect, we have done it the wrong way around.  The Government has been in power for only three years but we need a cost-benefit analysis before doing this.  We should address our own energy needs because people in the midlands wonder why they should have a giant turbine almost in their back garden while they suffer from fuel poverty.  The electricity bypasses them.  They will not benefit from it and will not have the cheap energy from the wind farms.  That is of great concern.  The priority must be to serve the economic needs of this State and the needs of households and industry.  I would like to see cheap energy for industry in the midlands, throughout the State and the island of Ireland.</p><p>  I am puzzled about the planning of wind farms.  Most of us here are former members of local authorities.  There are significant regulations around housebuilding, rightly so, and there have been some improvements in that regard.  Why build something that is many times bigger than any house, in the middle of the countryside, without regulations?  There are no regulations governing its development in terms of the height, set back and shadow flicker.  Guidelines are like an elastic band, they can be pulled in any direction, depending on who interprets them.  The Government is bringing forward necessary major reform of local government and says it will empower communities and local public representatives.  Laois County Council voted yesterday to ban turbines.  That is a political statement.  It has little effect in law.  It is important because it shows the level of local anger and frustration that all parties in the council chamber yesterday banned wind farms.  The areas that the councillors zoned are not even being taken into consideration, the wind farm companies are going off-site.  Will the Minister address that point?</p><p>  We are constantly told that wind offers the best financial return.  There are question marks over that.  We do not have a cost-benefit analysis for what is proposed in the midlands.  We did not have wind energy when we needed it during the cold spells in the past two winters.</p> <p>When electricity demand was at its highest, we did not have wind energy.  Sinn F&eacute;in has huge concerns in regard to the fact we do not have an overall energy strategy.  The position we are taking seems to be a bit like a re-run of the house building insanity and we seem to be putting all our eggs into one basket.  I believe I understand that is not the Minister's wish, but I am concerned that is what is happening and that all of a sudden we are going to get 2,200 turbines in a relatively small area.  We seem to be rushing headlong into this.  What has happened with regard to hydro, wave and geothermal energy generation?  What has happened in regard to biomass?  No matter who I talk to in the industry, they tell me these are now pushed aside and are now on the back burner.  This is my concern in regard to an overall energy policy.  Have the Department and the Government given adequate consideration to whether we are putting all our eggs into one basket, perhaps to the detriment of a more rounded, sustainable energy policy, particularly in view of the fact that wind is intermittent?</p><p> I want to be clear.  I support alternative energy.  We must support it for the reasons the Minister has outlined.  The UN report published yesterday has crystallised this issue for everyone.  We must do this and we are on the one page on it.  I ask the Minister to address the four issues I have raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.71" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014040100005#F00200"><p>Deputy Stanley is correct.  There is significant concern in his local county about this.  I believe a great deal of this concern is due to a misunderstanding, some to misinformation and some due to disinformation.  One cannot say that one is concerned about the trend towards nuclear energy in Britain and that one is in favour of renewable energy, but not in his or her county.  We cannot do that.</p><p>  In regard to the issues Deputy Stanley raises about trade, all we are seeking to do is to comply with European law in terms of the requirement to agree an intergovernmental agreement to facilitate trade.  We are not exporting anything, but just preparing the ground legislatively speaking, as required by the European directive.  The Deputy will know about a number of developers who will want to bring forward proposals in this regard.  We have carried out an extensive cost benefit analysis in circumstances where we have drawn inputs from the ESRI, NewERA, from outside consultants and from internal economists.  That detailed cost benefit analysis persuades me, beyond doubt, that there is considerable economic value for both countries, but for Ireland in particular.</p><p>  In regard to the Deputy's county or neighbouring counties being covered in wind turbines, this is not the case.  This will not happen and was never intended to happen.  The Deputy can check with his colleague who shadows my Department and see that time and again I have put on the record the huge depth of work my Department has engaged in, including the development of a national planning framework that will prescribe where wind farms may or may not be built.  Developers will have to comply with this framework in any projects they bring forward and An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to that.  Therefore, there is no question of the cart being put before the horse.  We have a very coherent policy.</p><p>  In regard to the Deputy's remark on policy, our policy will be further updated and within the next two or three weeks we will publish a Green Paper on energy.  We are deliberately publishing a Green Paper and it will facilitate committees like this and the Deputy, as an elected Member for the midlands, to make whatever input they feel is appropriate.  There is a coherent, thought out policy surrounding this area.  The Deputy or some others may not agree with that policy and that is fine, but the policy is there.  I take a pragmatic approach to this.  Industries in this country that employed large numbers of people in the past have disappeared, but the nature of modern business is that through innovation and other means, we create new employment for new products that were unheard of 20 years ago or less.  What we see here is that because of our uniquely propitious wind resources, we have the capacity to sell green energy to the neighbouring island.  If we can do that and create a revenue stream for the Exchequer and the local authorities involved, create employment in the construction stage and attract anchor tenants in terms of the manufacture of turbines or parts, this is a good news story for Ireland.  We would only do this within the constraints of a national planning framework, which will be very demanding.  </p><p>  This comes back to whether one has confidence in the institutions that are there.  I believe they are rigorous.  We never hear about the wind farm applications that have been turned down by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We must continue to look for new opportunities for creating employment and generating wealth in this economy.  Can we do that without in any way despoiling the environment or unreasonably intruding on the rights of communities?  This is the challenge.  I do not know whether the intergovernmental agreement will be concluded, but it is purely a legislative preparation to enable developers to bring forward proposals.  I am not bringing forward any proposal.  I do not propose to sell wind energy to the neighbouring island or anywhere else.  However, we have wind and if it can be harvested and exploited for wealth generation and job creation, it is a matter for the developers in that area to bring forward proposals and we can examine those proposals.</p></speech>

I welcome the levels of engagement of various sectors of society in regard to energy security, climate change challenges and energy sustainability.  I am only sorry this did not happen to this level five or six years ago, because we are now well down the road in regard to developing policy and are now implementing policy that will help us decarbonise our electricity system.  I firmly believe we cannot be all things to everyone.  We cannot say on one hand that we support the decarbonisation of the electricity sector and on the other hand oppose every technology or proposal made.  I do not direct this comment at the Minister, but, perhaps, at other politicians here.</p><p>  The Minister stated the Green Paper on energy will be published within three weeks.  I welcome that as it will give us a  further opportunity to engage with all sectors and stakeholders and enable us decide what we want for Ireland in terms of energy security and reducing carbon emissions.  The Minister may be aware of a debate taking place on alternatives and last week biomass was being pushed as a real alternative to the wind energy policy being pursued currently.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.  I believe biomass is not the answer to everything, because we have a limited supply chain for biomass type generation.</p> <p>There are consequences.  If we were, as suggested, to convert the Moneypoint power plant to a full biomass station, from where would the supply of material to burn come?  What is the Department's view?  It has been very high profile in the past couple of weeks.  It will take a combination of technologies to decarbonise the electricity sector</p><p> The Minister spoke in detail about wind energy.  I have mentioned biomass.  We have neglected hydroelectricity to a degree.  Although not on a large scale like wind energy, oil or gas, there is still potential for hydroelectricity schemes to be developed around the country.  Our first large-scale hydroelectricity scheme was at Ardnacrusha, followed by the scheme at Turlough Hill which has received many engineering awards over generations.  We could consider further such schemes to complement and diversify our electricity generation.  The debate on fracking is happening and geothermal and solar power are other possibilities.  I would be interested to hear whether there are plans for further hydroelectricity schemes.  While it would not be the answer, it would contribute to decarbonising the electricity sector.</p><p> Much criticism is directed at the Government that not enough is being done to convert existing power stations.  In my region, the south east, SSE is converting Great Island generating station from oil to gas, a far cleaner technology, and doubling its capacity from 220 MW to approximately 480 MW.  Are there plans for further conversions at plants such as Moneypoint or in the midlands to more energy efficient or less carbon intensive energy generation?</p><p> A few weeks ago the environment committee met people involved in the wind energy sector who told us that if they were building wind farms, they would build specific networks to connect to the transmission network.  There is much confusion and controversy about the pylons issue.  Is it true that the volatility of energy generated by wind farms requires the transmission networks to be upgraded, as proposed in EirGrid's Grid25 project?  Is it true, partly true or not true?  There is much confusion and some people are creating it for their own political purposes.  Some say the only reason we need to upgrade the transmission network is wind farms are being generated and we are exporting electricity to the United Kingdom.  Is that true or not?  We need clarity on the issue.</p><p> The Minister did not mention the possibility of having an interconnector to mainland Europe, which would contribute to sustainability in electricity generation for Irish businesses and households.  It would provide further options for the export of electricity and the possible importation of nuclear energy supplies.  I presume we already import nuclear energy supplies through the UK interconnector and the more options we have available to us, the more competitive we can become as an island nation.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right about the conversion at Great Island.  In a country that has very few significant building projects left it is a very big building project.  I went to look at it and it is immensely impressive.  The conversion from using oil to gas is to be welcomed.  It is a very big new limb in terms of our energy security.  I am aware of the report published in recent days on the possible conversion of the Moneypoint power plant.  The ESB and EirGrid, separately and in a different context, are assessing that issue and it is not as simple as it seems.  There are technical and financial questions, but, more importantly, the Deputy identified the question regarding the supply of raw material.</p><p>  I have representatives of private sector combined heat and power projects coming to me demonstrating a willingness to create a significant number of jobs in some rural parts of Ireland and the question is whether I can guarantee them a supply of raw material.  They say they cannot source it because they argue Coillte has a demand for whatever biomass becomes available.  If one had to import biomass to feed such a station, one would have to consider the economics.  It is not as simple as some consultants claim.</p><p>  I forgot to answer Deputy Brian Stanley's question on wave and tidal energy.  Wave and tidal energy technology is at research stage.  Given our status as an island nation, it could be very important in the future.  Despite the straitened times we have come through, we managed to continue an investment in the research projects ongoing at a number of locations from Cork to Belmullet, but we will not have an answer today or tomorrow.  The same applies to hydroelectricity.  One cannot say one is on the side of the angels, in favour of all renewables, and then when we discuss a particular one such as wind energy, ask, "What about hydro?"  When there are difficulties with hydro schemes, people propose wave and tidal energy projects.  I have had discussions in the Seanad in which there was extraordinarily strong support for renewables, except the particular renewable under discussion.</p><p>  I am aware of a private sector hydroelectricity proposal.  It is a proposal for a remarkable pumped storage scheme which is still being examined and very interesting.  To some degree, we are avoiding the issue, which is not whether we have the capacity to generate enough energy to meet our needs however it is broken down between oil, gas, wind, hydroelectricity or biomass.  As energy Minister, I would be reasonably comfortable about this and the public does not reflect too much on it.  However, when one sees events in Ukraine, for example, there is cause to be nervous at night.  Everybody takes it for granted that when one plugs in the kettle or flicks a switch, there is power.  Having entered that caveat, I am fairly comfortable about our ability to meet our domestic needs. The hard question Deputy Brian Stanley asked me was related to whether it was wise to create a new traded sector in selling green energy for economic value to the country in terms of employment and revenue.  Deputy Paudie Coffey's committee and the elected representatives in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann will be able to make their own input and contribution via the Green Paper.</p><p>  The expert advice available to me on the transmission system is that given that we have mandatory obligations, we have to upgrade the transmission system.  Deputy Paudie Coffey asked to what extent that was due to wind energy generation.  We have to upgrade the transmission system if we are to guarantee the people a safe, secure, affordable energy supply and if we are to address questions of dispersal and regionalisation.</p> <p>We really do not have a choice in the matter.  We do, however, have a choice about how we do it and this is where the debate should be centred.  People have strong views, which is fine.  Let them have strong views, but they should not take up a position of opposition to modernisation of the grid and having a grid which is fit for purpose.  I do not suggest anyone on the committee has done so.  Whether we put it underground or overground is a reasonable issue for debate but opposition to the notion of modernisation of the grid is Luddite.</p></speech>

It would be relevant to any wind farm development proposed, or, at the very least, the big ones.  Is there a cost issue at stake?  We hear from some people that the cost has been calculated at the point of generation as opposed to the end point of delivery and that there is a sizeable difference between the two which makes it uneconomic when one adds in the transmission network which would have to be developed.</p><p>  Siemens has announced a pylon scheme development in Hull which is likely to rule out any prospect of it being replicated here.  Is this a factor in the number of jobs that might transpire here?  People will be involved in various elements.</p><p>  A key issue for me concerns our approach to the Aarhus Convention and I have made a submission in this regard.  Companies such as Greenwire signed up landowners without taking any real note of the concerns of neighbours.  I do not see communities being put at the heart of this.  It is a box-ticking exercise with regard to the Aarhus Convention.  People will no longer be told this is good for them and that it is required for job creation; they will make up their own minds on whether they think it is a good proposal.</p><p>  I accept there is misinformation and that very often the presumption is, if something is proposed, it will happen, even though it must go through a planning process which it may well not survive.  However, the planning process seems to be deficient such as with regard to the 2006 planning guidelines.  What arrangements will the Minister have with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government for upgrading these guidelines?  This is a matter which will come before the committee.</p><p>  If this development is seen as being of strategic importance, it will be done through An Bord Plean&aacute;la; it will not go through local authorities.  The input of citizens will, therefore, be limited and I do not believe people will accept this.  They will want to have their say and be included.  They want the Aarhus Convention to mean something and it should be central to anything we do.  Unless we have a proper structure and do not just have a box-ticking exercise with regard to the convention there will be a strong negative reaction.</p><p>  The Scottish approach is interesting, whereby there is a state-funded initiative and case studies have been undertaken.  This involves 294 projects at community level involving a small number of wind turbines.  They are not large industrial level projects.  They include projects involving schools and football clubs and community ownership models.  We do not seem to be going down this route and there is no comparable organisation to facilitate this type of development, which would be far more likely to gain support.  I am interested to hear what the Minister has to state on this.</p><p>  The NESC report commissioned by the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, identified a large export opportunity, but it had to do with wave and offshore wind energy production.  We all accept that our unique dispersed population pattern does not lend itself to providing us with an enormous number of usable onshore wind energy sites.  We are not putting ourselves at the forefront of wave and offshore wind energy technology when one considers what happened to Wavebob, an issue I have raised many times through questions.  People who had gained expertise were dispersed to other jurisdictions, including Scotland.  This means that we are following, rather than leading, in its development.  If we are not at the forefront of frontier development in this regard, will we miss a big opportunity?</p><p>  I attended a useful presentation on biomass.  I accept that it was one party putting forward its side, but interesting comparisons were made with a successful development in the United Kingdom.  The Minister mentioned Bord na M&oacute;na lands earmarked for turbines.  They could equally be used as a resource to generate biomass.  It is not good quality land that could be used for food production.</p></speech>

There is a huge lead time in any major energy project and, from that point of view, as I have said - I announced it publicly a few weeks ago - there is a doubt about the capacity to conclude that at this particular time.  The summit meeting in London between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister asked the two Ministers to look at whether there would be an alternative architecture that might facilitate it.  As I said earlier, we are looking at the outcome of the London summit.  I can tell the committee that site costs versus delivery point, as the Deputy put it, is not the issue and is not an issue in these discussions.  Deputy Brian Stanley has welcomed the British position, but if one is enthusiastically in support of an agreement between two countries, one must admit it takes two to tango.  One does not enter into a bad agreement purely because the other side is demanding X, Y and Z.</p><p> As regards the Siemens development in Hull, I am not sure that is relevant.  The advice we have from the prospective developers and prospective manufacturing projects brought to us by the IDA is that it would make great sense in a project such as this to have the manufacturing close by because it is immensely expensive.  Whether that is all or part of it, and so on, is open to negotiation, but that would be a very important aspect of it.  It is not irrelevant in the context of the way the UK Government might be looking at it, because if one had a significant manufacturing project on the east coast of Ireland, it could service more than the Irish need.  I tend to think that the Deputy is not the first one to think about that.</p><p> With regard to the Aarhus Convention, I have tried to hammer this for months - but apparently with little success - by explaining that the renewable energy policy planning framework will be subject to a full strategic environmental assessment, SEA.  I have said that many times.  People read what they want to read and believe what they want to believe, but that is the situation.  This committee knows more about SEAs and the planning area than most.  People either accept that or do not.</p><p> Deputy Catherine Murphy wanted to know the prospects for offshore wind energy, wave and tidal energy and so on.  A month ago I published the offshore renewable energy development plan, OREDP, which sets out, in 40 pages or so, our approach.  We have had a very interesting exchange of views so far, but nobody has mentioned wind, except Deputy Brian Stanley, who is opposed to it - opposed to its being sold to the Brits, that is.</p></speech>

The fact of the matter is that wave and tidal energy is still a twinkle in the research eye of the scientists.  That is the first point.  The second point is that, yes, we are investing in the research, but if a private company such as Wavebob goes down, it goes down.  It is not the job of the State to support private companies.  The fact of the matter is that this would be regarded as normal in any other country or in the US, where a company supports a research policy and innovation with a view towards breaking new ground and bringing it to commerciality.  In the particular case mentioned by the Deputy, it was not successful.  We examined it and we did not think the State should come to the rescue, even if there was a line of funding for that kind of thing.  There are others that have been successful in County Louth.  I have forgotten the name of the French company that came in and purchased it.  Some are successful and some are not successful.</p><p>  In terms of the point the Deputy made about community involvement, there are very successful examples in this country, such as Tipperary Energy.  Some months ago I opened a wind farm in Templederry.  Would I be wrong in describing it as a co-op?</p></speech>

It is enthusiastically supported and we do support initiatives like that.</p><p>  We will have a look at offshore wind energy in the future.  As I said, we have published the offshore renewable energy development plan.  I hope that if developers come forward with offshore projects they will get a fair wind - no pun intended - but we will see.</p></speech>

For the most part, when we discuss this issue, we do so from the point of view of energy security or carbon emission reductions.  If we drill down and think about what is relevant to most people, other than, as the Minister said, what happened in Ukraine recently, people ask what happens if the gas is switched off.  It probably promotes more depth of thought about how it affects the individual or his or her business.  The major challenge for us in terms of how we plan and what we plan for is how to reduce energy costs for the individual in order to bring people out of fuel poverty, which is increasing, and how to reduce energy costs for business so as to make Ireland a more competitive place in which to locate one's business and to invest.  The blueprint that we have to follow, with all the other considerations and targets, must set this out clearly.  That is where the discourse begins with the public rather than consultation on individual projects.  I am aware that Grid25 is not an individual project, but that is what happens.  We start consulting when we are on the ground, and that is not a comment on the merits or demerits of the actual consultation that takes place.  In many cases, people will say they were doing their best in regard to consultation.  There are broader brush strokes that have to be established and accepted and the public has to be brought along from the point of view of the democratic process; otherwise, we are in an uphill struggle to get buy-in.  The issue of greatest concern to people is energy costs.</p> <p>I am wondering what-----</p></speech>

I welcome the setting up of the review commission chaired by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness.  There is absolutely nothing to hide here; it is about transparency.  As it is a complex situation, that is where confusion can arise.  It is about putting everything on the table.  To go some way along the road with Deputy Paudie Coffey, there are two aims for Grid25: to reinforce and upgrade the grid and to put renewable energy generating projects on the grid.  It is not all being developed for the same reasons, and people know this.  In some cases, if renewables are being taken out that does not mean there is a need for pylons.  When will the terms of reference be made available for the review commission?  When they are made available there will have to be cognisance of the fact that the Grid West project, by EirGrid's own admission, is being treated as shallow development.  Therefore, it is not being developed or rolled out to upgrade the grid for energy security or standard operational reasons but to bring out the renewable energy.  A full debate is needed because there has been a vacuum and that is where the speculation comes in.</p><p>  The practicalities include community gain and community contribution.  There are very fine noble aspirations in many documents about this, whether it is renewable energy strategies or the programme for Government and the gains that might be had.  It is sadly lacking when it comes to individual projects, as community gain is very much meted out to communities on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  It depends on the developer and the local authority.  If a local authority wants to make a stipulation setting out what the community gain should be, it does not have the statutory authority to do that.  That issue needs to be addressed.  There is also the issue that not all of the community is affected.  That some are near neighbours means they are immediately affected.  I have heard individual wind farm developers or promoters speak about this but I do not think there is a comprehensive document that can be employed by the planning decision makers to ensure uniformity in this regard, rather than pot luck depending on whether one has a good or a bad developer.  For example, in my area, some large wind farm projects have been proposed, two of which will be subject to oral hearings, the first of which - about an ESB-Bord na M&oacute;na project, the proposed Oweninny wind farm - is next week.  The majority of objectors are not objecting to the wind farm but to lack of proper engagement in respect of community gain and how it is up to them to try to get the best deal they can.  Even though it is not a project for decision by the local authority, its hands were tied.  It has a draft document on community gain but it has no statutory basis.  That issue needs to be addressed.</p><p>  There is also the issue of local employment.  People want to see jobs on the ground.  If wind farms are coming to an area, surely the local people must have a stab at getting those jobs.  That is not a given, especially if contracts are given outside the area.  In respect of State companies there are mechanisms that they can at least attempt to employ, such as seeking a derogation from procurement rules, to try to accommodate employment in the construction of such projects where there is disadvantage and high rates of unemployment due to the collapse of the construction sector.  How can that issue be addressed given the <i>ad hoc</i> nature of community gain?</p><p>  What is the position in regard to the intergovernmental agreement and the memorandum of understanding since the Anglo-Irish summit?  I understood that the issue was to be re-examined after a number of months and, perhaps, a new approach adopted.  What interaction has taken place between the two Governments on the matter?</p></speech>

As Zhou Enlai said about the French Revolution, it is too early to say, but one formal meeting has taken place.  I agree with a great deal of the thrust of what Deputy Mulherin has said.  If the Chairman will permit, I will make a brief comment on the costs issue.  The problem is that it is a commercial marketplace - the Deputy understands that - so many of the cost elements are outside of the control of the suppliers.  One is dependent on issues such as international gas prices, but there are things we can do, such as to have the most efficient transmission system, to put a greater emphasis on energy efficiency - as we did last week when we launched the &euro;70 million energy efficiency fund - to go outside the residential sector, and to focus on public and commercial buildings.  That can make a big contribution.</p><p>  The Deputy referred in passing to energy poverty.  She will notice from figures announced yesterday by the regulator that there was a large reduction in disconnections this winter and that is largely due to the emphasis we have put on the installation of pay-as-you-go meters.  The Deputy is right that people relate the energy debate to how it affects their domestic budget.  There is no disputing that.</p><p>  As regards the expert panel, I have had no contact with it other than thanking it for agreeing to conduct the task.  I am advised that following its next meeting it experts to be in a position shortly to announce the terms of reference.  That expert panel is chaired by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness.</p><p>  Community gain is a hugely important aspect.  The more we try to introduce it into the debate the more somebody will say that we are trying to bribe communities in order to deliver transmission.  I do not see it that way.  It is right that communities should benefit and it is certainly included very prominently in the proposals we have been preparing for the intergovernmental agreement.  In fairness, it has become the practice among developers to actually offer it.  The intellectual argument is one that is also being considered by my colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and my Department has an input into that.  Those who attended the briefing by EirGrid will recall that it too has accepted that there is an obligation on it in this particular regard.  The developers with whom I have been speaking acknowledge that they have to make a contribution in that regard. </p><p>  I hope that following its next meeting in the first week of May the expert panel will have the terms of reference.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that he has agreed that the value of MOUs is not as he once thought under other guises when speaking about MOUs entered into between, for example, the previous Government and the troika.</p> <p>It appears the Minister has found now that this MOU he entered into with the British Government does not hold much water.</p><p> Secondly, the Minister has been vague in answer to Deputies Mulherin and Murphy.  On foot of the relaxation of the EU 2030 renewable energy targets, he correctly stated plans by Mainstream Renewable Power, Bord Na M&oacute;na, Element Power to harvest 10 GW of Irish wind energy for sale to the United Kingdom and the Continent are in doubt.  That has been known for a number of weeks.  On the meeting that was held between the Taoiseach and the UK Prime Minister on Wednesday, 12 March, can the Minister confirm that officials were given three months to investigate if the plan for the multi-million euro wind energy project in the midlands can be saved?  Can he confirm that there was three months agreed between both parties by which time investigations and negotiation would take place, and a review would be completed in three months and published thereafter?  What would that bring us to - March, April, May?  We might even be in time for the 23rd, which would be of benefit to everybody concerned.</p><p> I will move on to the specific guidelines that were being put in place in relation to projects for export.  Are they how on hold?  In the event of this exercise being carried out by the Minister's officials and British officials confirming that this 10 GW of Irish energy for sale is no longer something in the short to medium-term future, will such guidelines be revised?</p></speech>

The Minister had specific guidelines for projects for export as against guidelines for projects for our own use on the national grid.  Where stand those guidelines in the event of that group confirming, as the Minister has done in recent months, but categorically, that there will be no such development to meet the targets of sale to the United Kingdom and the Continent.  Could the Minister clarify merely to confirm that the summit between the Taoiseach and the UK Prime Minister agreed a process, agreed that such process would be three months in duration, and agreed that the findings further to that process would be definitive and that the public would know where it stands on in the short to medium-term development of any such projects for sale?</p></speech>

I dealt with that in my formal remarks and I will give him a copy of them.  To repeat, I had made a formal statement in the Seanad a couple of weeks ago - I cannot remember exactly how long ago - before the summit asserting my judgment that given the timeframe imposed on us by the availability, for example, of the supports system - for example, the developers here, if they did manage to get a project up and running, were dependent on the British supports system, not the Irish ones - the 2020 deadline would apply.  I expressed my view that I found it difficult to see, given the lead-in time, how that could be delivered as envisaged.  A week later, ten days later or whatever it was, the two Prime Ministers met in London on a number of agenda items and at that meeting, they agreed to ask the two Ministers whether they could look at an alternative architecture to facilitate conclusion of the IGA, and that is what we have been examining.</p><p>  If Deputy Cowen is asking me if I have changed my mind, I would have to say that my best assessment of the information in my possession is that I have not changed my mind.  It is difficult to envisage how we can comply with that deadline.  I can certainly promise the Deputy - 23 May, for some reason, is on his radar - that I will personally have an answer delivered to him before that date.  I hope that is satisfactory.</p></speech>

I do not see any definitive decisions until there is a new Commission in place.  Look at yesterday's report from the United Nations on climate change.  It is inevitable that renewables will continue to be an important aspect of the energy mix, but as regards clarity and definitive policy in the remaining few months of the lifetime of this Commission - there is one more meeting of Energy Council Ministers - I do not think it will happen in the lifetime of this Commission.</p><p>  On the export projects, the only project contemplated is the midlands one.  That may well have involved a number of partners and as I stated on several occasions, I could not see how it could be delivered also within the timeline without the main landowner in the area being involved where there are unencumbered tens of thousands of cutaway bog, a commercial State company looking for a new mission, etc.  That was the project envisaged.</p><p>  My intention is that I would continue the work that we have done - the first phase of consultation was out - and that I would continue to try to develop the national planning framework because, whatever happens on the three months' deadline or on the IGA, the wind will not go away, trade between this country and the neighbouring country will not go away, and we should continue the work in that area.</p><p>  As regards what lesson Deputy Cowen thinks that I might have learned from an MOU, the MOU is a statement of aspiration leading to an agreement.  The MOU with the troika was a binding bailout agreement for all of the reasons of which he will be aware.  Deputy Cowen is the one who raised it and if he wants to bat it back and forward, I will bat it back and forward with him, but it is not analogous to the attempt to come to an agreement between two countries about trading green energy.  We will see what the outcome will be, but I can assure Deputy Cowen that the process, whatever the outcome, will be completed in advance of the three months.</p></speech>

Is it easily accessible on the Department's website or is it on some other website, such as that of Sustainable Energy Ireland?</p><p>  There are communities in Offaly where it looks like the bulk of this project would be located who are concerned about the spectre or 600 ft. turbines in every second field across the midlands because that is the impression that they are under.  They feel strongly that they have not been adequately informed about what is happening.  In that context, I wondered whether the Department is compliant with the terms of the Aarhus Convention to which they all refer.</p><p>  If the agreement on the energy for export proposal is ironed out, what would be the timeframe in respect of the development and subsequent execution of the proposal?</p> <p>The Minister should indicate whether a new interconnector will be going ahead, because I seem to recall one energy company advising that a new interconnector would be required between Ireland and Wales.  In addition, is there another proposal for an interconnector between Ireland and France, for example, to avoid being completely reliant on exporting to Great Britain and to enable exports to other countries?  Is such a proposal in the pipeline?</p><p> I refer to Ireland's capacity for energy independence, while acknowledging this meeting is focused on the export of energy to the United Kingdom.  To what extent does Ireland have energy independence, in terms of the capacity to keep the lights on at any given time?  Does Ireland have a problem in respect of being independent?  First, what is the capacity and second, will the Government be considering flexible plants to support such independence or is this a matter the company exporting the energy must also consider?  As someone has noted, if the wind is not blowing here, it will be blowing someplace else.  However, in the event of the wind not blowing here, people have concerns that fossil fuels still will be required to back it up.  This point is being raised quite a lot.</p><p> I would be very interested to hear about community gain, as I frequently hear complaints about how it might be construed as bribery.  However, has the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources considered measures such as, for example, an investment bond?  Under such a scheme, citizens or communities could buy into particular proposals, be they for the energy export proposal or for the national grid.  This proposal has been raised with me to an extent, certainly as it applies to citizens, because some people believe community gain may only be of benefit to one if one is interested in a particular community project that may gain therefrom.  It does not necessarily mean that an individual who is obliged to sit beside a 600 ft. high structure will get anything out of it.  Perhaps one even might examine the potential for people to have free electricity.  Is that a possibility the Department might consider?</p><p> In addition, I have received many complaints from people about how option agreements are being acquired in areas that are not designated at all for wind and are outside county development plans.  Is there a role for the Minister in dealing with such activity or is such speculation simply allowable because we are capitalists here?  The Minister also should confirm when the Green Paper on energy will be produced.</p></speech>

Obviously the Government would not wish to show its hand, except as it chose, with its prospective partner.  However, when all this is over, I will be willing to examine this again.  Two different sets of circumstances offer, the first being a scenario in which I have an agreement.  In such a case, I probably would need to be selective on what I would reveal, given that I then would have a commercial partner.  If there is no agreement, I would be in a different position.  However, I assure the Deputy that I took this very seriously and got the best advice I could on what were the economic prospects.  Certainly, when the talks have concluded, successfully or otherwise, I will be glad to put information in this regard into the public domain or at least to supply it to Members of these Houses and this committee.</p><p>  I refer to the general thrust of the quality of engagement the Deputy raised with regard to local communities and all that kind of thing.  While I was not avoiding the question but forgot it, someone earlier raised the issue of these developers who have bought land or options on land or who have purchased lease options or whatever.  Deputy Corcoran Kennedy asked whether this is the correct order.  The problem is that I do not have a role in preventing any would-be businessman from seeking to purchase interest in land in any part of the country.  I did not send them down to the midlands with a whip and tell them to buy up land options there.  Business people try to gain-----</p></speech>

Business people try to get first-mover advantage and make these decisions and so on.  Unfortunately, I believe the Deputy is right.  It has led to unnecessary concerns in some communities because the proposition that Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy's county will have wind turbines in every second field is not going to happen in her lifetime or mine.  I agree that communities have concerns, some of which are not justified because they will not be included and so on.</p><p>  As for an interconnector with France, as the Deputy now is aware there is an interconnector between Wales and north Dublin.  The Government was never willing to have a situation in which merchant developers would throw their own cables across the Irish Sea to plug into the British grid.  That would not be acceptable as it must be regulated properly and it is a matter for the two Governments to agree how that would be done.  On whether there will be an interconnector with France in the future, all I can say about that is the entire thrust of European policy is to have a single integrated market in energy, greater integration, greater interconnection and so on.  The agency charged with future planning for the State of course is engaged in research on something like that but it will not appear on the horizon before Deputy Cowen's date of 23 May or anything like that.  It is a matter for the future.</p><p>  I believe I know what the Deputy is getting at when she referred to flexible plants and so on.  She is correct in that technology keeps changing and developing all the time.  It is true that fossil fuels are needed at present in respect of backup and flexible plants will come into their own.  For reasons of which Deputy Corcoran Kennedy is aware, it is an extremely complex issue that is primarily but not solely an issue with the regulator.  The regulator, EirGrid and so on are looking at the interests she has on behalf of her constituents in this regard.  I am not sure where it will go in the future but she is correct as the kind of flexibility that would be provided is the kind of thing that is needed.</p><p>  Finally, I have heard the proposals she mentioned about the community somehow buying into the adventure and so on.  It is a particularly interesting proposal.  While I do not know of this happening on any kind of broad mass scale, in small projects such as that to which we referred earlier in Templederry, in the Vice Chairman's native county, on a local basis the local farmers were signed up and essentially are shareholders.  Is that a fair description of that project?  Theoretically, there is no reason similar models cannot be developed in the future.  However, it is difficult.  For example, members should note the announcement by Bord na M&oacute;na about its own green energy hub.</p> <p>There are a number of members here who would have some experience of it but my understanding is that when Bord na M&oacute;na started to hold town hall meetings and explain what it was about, it got a very high measure of approval, support and understanding.  Perhaps that shows us the way.  I know Bord na M&oacute;na has a uniquely acceptable brand to the local community in the midlands for all the reasons we know.  I accept the reality that in respect of some people, for whatever reason, there is nothing I can say that would ever bring them on board.  As somebody wrote in a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i>, if we had not built the railways, we certainly would not be able to build them now.  Building big infrastructure is a problem and there is no point in pretending otherwise.</p></speech>

As most people in the midlands know, we have all attended a large number of public meetings on this topical issue and they have been highly emotional with the halls and venues packed to capacity.  I agree that public concerns must be taken on board.  We have not got the factual information sought regarding the health and safety issues that have been raised at those meetings.  I refer to the health risks associated with living near high voltage power lines, the health effects of shadow flicker and other problems such as sleep disturbance that were raised at those meetings.  We have not been given concrete information on what is factual and what is incorrect in that regard.</p><p>  Another issue is the fact that we are still working on the basis of the 2004 planning guidelines when the turbines proposed at that time were of the scale of the industrial turbines being proposed now.  My colleague and the Minister's good friend, Deputy Penrose, has a Private Members' Bill in waiting for quite a long time, the gist of which proposes that no turbines greater than 25 m should be allowed within 2 km or a public building or a dwelling house.  What is the Minister's stance on that or does he envisage that Bill will come before the D&aacute;il and, if it does, would he support it, or what is his view on it?  On a related issue, can the Minister confirm whether EirGrid has postponed the North-South interconnector planning application pending the outcome of the independent review?</p><p>  A further issue that is constantly raised at meetings on wind farm developments throughout the country is that the chairman of EirGrid stated in December 2013 that he would not like to live beside a pylon.  What is the Minister's view on that?  That issue was never adequately addressed and it is still a problem.  When the chairman of that body was not happy with that type of proposal, where do we stand on it? </p><p>  Like Deputy Corcoran Kennedy and others who spoke, I am concerned also about the failure of companies to adequately inform communities about their long-term plans.  That is a serious problem.  As a politician one is fighting a losing battle when one attends one of these meetings because the people who turn up are totally opposed to any form of alternative energy projects.  </p><p>  Another issue that is raised at those meetings is the massive landslide in Derrybrien in Galway in 2003 which caused a great deal of pollution, as a consequence of which 100,000 trout were destroyed in the nearby river.  Neither the company that was developing that project nor the ESB took responsibility.  They talked about when something would happen such as when the foundations would be put in for the wind turbines.  If we move on to a new form of energy, nobody will take responsibility for the removal of the huge amount of mass concrete that is laid to support those wind turbines and they will be ugly monstrosities across the landscape.  Nothing is permanent except change and perhaps the form of energy that is in use today will be an old form of energy tomorrow.  The Minister might elaborate on some of those points.</p></speech>

He is right in that there have been very emotional public meetings - there is no disputing that.  Without going back over what I have said several times, on the Deputy's specific question about health, the Deputy will be aware that as part of the decision I took in respect of the expert panel, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is required by the Government decision to engage expert advice to review the EMF question as between 2006 or 2008, or whatever year it was, to date.  He is to bring his report to the Government as soon as it is complete to bring us up to 2014 in respect of that particular concern.</p><p>  As regards EirGrid postponing the North-South interconnector until the panel completes it work, that decision has not been made.  As Deputy Mulherin established earlier, the expert panel, under the chairmanship of the former Supreme Court judge, Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness, has not yet published its terms of reference.  The Deputy can imagine the task they have been engaged in terms of bringing themselves up to speed with the reports that have been done and the complexity of the issues that are at stake.  What I said to Deputy Mulherin was that I expect, without knowing, that after its next meeting it is likely to publish its terms of reference but no decision has been made by EirGrid to postpone the planning application.  </p><p>  As regards John O'Connor, the new chairman of EirGrid, and his statement that he would not like to live in close proximity to a pylon, I must say that his answer greatly encouraged me that I had appointed the right man to chairman of EirGrid.  If his honest belief is that he would not want to live in close proximity to a pylon, surely it was correct that he said that and answered it honestly and let people make what they will of it.  That is the man's view and he is a man of very strong views.  In my own view, as somebody who lives beside plenty of pylons on Clondalkin, if the Deputy has ever driven through it, I must say he is the right man for the job.</p><p>  On the Deputy's question about wind turbines, the clean up afterwards, the residue and all of that, I do not think in 2014 that is a problem.  It is a bit like the problems we used to have with mining in this country - the problems we had Tina Mines, for example.  That could not be replicated today.  The remediation process has to be looked after by the mining authorities and the mine owners, as in the case of the Vice Chairman's constituency where we are dealing with some of the issues at present.  It would be a requirement that whatever is the residual situation, it would be remediated and put back in proper condition.  </p><p>  I am not going to intrude into the area of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  In respect of the planning consultation that they are assessing, I presume they will announce their conclusions. </p> <p>I presume the conclusions of the planning consultation will be announced.  I do not know how early they will be announced but it will be reasonably early.  The public consultation phase has concluded and it is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Ministers of State at the Department to make their decision.  </p></speech>

I do not welcome the British position on energy.  However, while I think it is a terrible position, I welcome that it has pressed the pause button on what was happening here.  By the Minister's own admission we are putting in place a new planning regime.  The new regime will probably not be what I want but it will certainly represent an improvement on the current regime.  That is to be welcomed.  The Minister has also admitted that we do not have a policy.  This is why he will be issuing a Green Paper on energy.  Deputy Coffey tends to deal with issues in a narrow way and dismisses anything put forward by the Opposition but I am trying to be constructive.  I welcome that the Minister is preparing a Green Paper but it indicates that we do not have our act together on the issue of energy and alternative energy.  I accept these areas were not addressed during the boom years.  We tend to wait until we have a crisis or are forced to act by the EU.  We should have been working to develop sources of alternative energy instead of building houses during the boom years.  Does the Minister agree that it was probably as well that events played out as they did because the public are now engaged in the process?  Extreme views have been expressed on all sides but we will have a better planning regime.  We will not know if it is good enough until we see it and my party would like it to be more regulation based.  I look forward to engaging with the Minister on the development of energy policy.</p><p>  The Minister was somewhat dismissive of wind power but I argue that it will be part of our alternative energy solution.  In terms of sustainability - I speak as somebody with a background in environmental issues - even though wind is an intermittent source of power, six months ago there appeared to be a stampede to utilise wind and when we tried to generate a debate an other sources of energy we got the sort of response we received today from Deputy Coffey.  We are not blessed with sunshine but we can produce a certain amount of solar energy.  Other sources of energy, such as geothermal energy, are being developed continuously.  I am not an engineer but I know that hydropower will play a small part in our overall energy policy because I take the time to inform myself on these matters.  The Minister is correct that there is insufficient land on this island to grow a large volume of biomass but there is potential to develop willow crops.  We need a more rounded approach and I hope the Green Paper will give us an opportunity to engage on the process of developing a sustainable alternative energy regime.</p><p>  The Minister did not address my earlier question on fuel poverty.  Reference was made to the Ballinderry co-operatives and greater acceptance.  As a former employee of Bord na M&oacute;na, I recognise there is greater acceptance, for various reasons.  Another way of persuading communities to accept new forms of energy is to create community gain in regard to fuel poverty.  I accept that energy prices have decreased somewhat but people who one would think were comfortably off were freezing in their houses in recent winters.  Does the Minister see a need to address the issue of chronic fuel poverty in tandem with developing alternative energy policy?  </p></speech>

I hope the Green Paper will address the issues Deputy Stanley raised and I assure him that its recommendations will not be confined to wind.  I am not bringing forward the Green Paper because there is confusion about policy.  It is being prepared for two reasons.  First, the White Paper on energy was published 2007.  We do this work every five or six years.  Second, the world has changed.  When the White Paper was being prepared in 2006, nobody could have forecast what has happened since.  For example, nobody forecast what has happened in the United States in terms of hydraulic fracturing.  Those are the reasons I am bringing forward the Green Paper, which will subsequently be refined and published as a White Paper for the coming six years.  I draw Deputy Stanley's attention to the offshore plan and the fact that we will be publishing a bioenergy proposal in the next few weeks.  We have already devised a national renewable energy action plan which deals with many of the issues he raised.  Whatever scarcity might exist, it is not a scarcity of policy.  The Deputy can be assured that the Green Paper will take a comprehensive view of energy and I hope this committee, as well as my own committee, will have an input into it because there is an obvious interest in dealing with the thorny issue of planning.</p></speech>

We have to work with what we have - we have wind - but we must use it in the best way possible.  New methods are coming on stream every day.  It is now possible to put a wind facility 1,000 ft. above the earth.  This is being deployed in Alaska.  It tethered by a string rather than a pole and the wind turbine is contained inside a helium balloon.</p> <p>That is there but it will not be for Ireland because it is for more remote districts.  We must be realistic in saying what we can do.</p><p> Everybody is talking about biomass.  The Drax plant in Yorkshire converted from burning coal to sustainable biomass.  The EU said wood is carbon neutral but there is a debate now as to whether it is.  Only one station at the Drax plant has been converted and it is shipping shiploads of wood pellets from North Carolina, which is depleting forests there as this is not thinnings or anything else.  The station burns a shipload of wood pellets, shipped in the largest cargo ship on earth, in 16 hours.  It takes 100 years to grow a tree which sequesters more CO2 from the environment than anything else.  Biomass is not all it is said to be.  When looking at biomass, we must ensure we know what we are talking about.  When we take into account the transportation of biomass fuel 3,800 miles from North Carolina to Yorkshire, carbon neutrality goes out the window.  All of this must be taken into account.</p><p> We have had a very good debate.  There are many policy papers available but I look forward to the Green Paper on which this committee will have a good debate.</p></speech>

In fairness to Minister Ed Davey, he made the point when we signed the memorandum of understanding, that he was an enthusiastic supporter and I believe he is one, as am I.  However, he said it was subject to the figures adding up, meaning that he will look after his country's interests and I will like over my country's interests and so on.

The second theme was the transmission network to carry the power.  I have often been asked if there is some reason there is no project, or proposed project, in the greater Dublin area where most of the power is used.  There is much wind in Dublin; it is not just down the country.  There is no onshore or offshore project in the Dublin region.  Is Dublin a specific area, like a special area of conservation?  I have been asked this on many times at public meetings.</p></speech>

The other issue was community gain.  It is not equal across the country.  There are many proposals that the community should benefit substantially from this.  The Minister mentioned Templederry, which is a good example, but it is in the same county as Sws Wind Farms in Lisheen.  There is also the wind farm proffered by Bord na M&oacute;na, the Bruckana wind farm.  The community in Lisheen is very happy with the response it got but is not as happy with the response it got from Bord na M&oacute;na in regard to the Bruckana wind farm.  There needs to be a level playing pitch.</p></speech>

The people working on planning are not the people dealing with the economics of it or dealing with the regulatory side of it.  We have given the people dealing with the planning an injunction to address that issue.  Do they come up with a one-size-fits-all?  I have not made up my mind on that yet.  There might be an argument for different models, even if one has that disparity, about which the Vice Chairman talks.  For example, the Templederry example is very attractive.  There is a world of difference when one meets people who say, "Look at what we have created, it is a nice little local enterprise and we are earning a few bob from it".</p></speech>

At approximately 2.30 p.m. the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, will attend to discuss the draft national reform programme, a key element of the new European semester process.  In advance of that discussion I welcome Councillor O'Loughlin.  The Committee of the Regions comprises 344 local and regional representatives from across the European Union.  When we met the committee earlier this year, one of the issues that arose concerned the need to promote awareness and provide an opportunity for local government representatives to engage on key EU issues.  As a committee, we agreed to have a discussion on the European semester process and the draft national reform plan would be a good starting point to ensure a flavour of the Committee of the Regions is included in the process of awareness promotion.  It is for that reason we have invited Councillor O'Loughlin to attend.</p><p>  Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>  I invite Councillor O'Loughlin to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

We have provided the committee secretariat with a short written contribution on our experience of the European semester process which I hope has been circulated to committee members for their information.  The submission deals specifically with the Europe 2020 strategy and the national reform programme which is a fundamental component of the semester process.  We do not address the stability and convergence programmes, as they have less direct relevance for local and regional authorities and the work of the Committee of the Regions.  The submission very much reflects our experiences to date, both as EU level representatives and members of local and regional authorities.  </p><p>  It might, perhaps, be useful if I were to take a few minutes to summarise the key points.  In our experience the Irish approach to the Europe 2020 strategy and developing the national reform programme specifically is that while it presents many positive opportunities, it has four fundamental weaknesses.  There is a general lack of awareness of the strategy and Ireland's contribution to achieving its targets; a lack of real engagement and meaningful consultation with stakeholders in the process; a seeming lack of joined-up government in terms of the measures it contains or fails to include; and the absence of a local and regional dimension which makes it impossible to assess if measures are effective in all regions and whether the pursuit of purely national targets leaves some regions further behind.</p><p>  It seems that the lessons learned from implementation of Europe 2020's predecessor, the Lisbon targets, have not been learned.  Despite guidance from the European Commission and a commitment made by member states to foster greater ownership of and responsibility for the strategy and to have a more inclusive partnership approach in reaching the targets set, there has been little or no improvement in the way we in Ireland have approached the development of the national reform programme.</p> <p>In short, we would like the Government to initiate a process among policy stakeholders which, first, raises the profile of the Europe 2020 strategy to create a greater awareness of it and the Irish response to the targets it sets out.  For example, many county managers and local authorities were unaware of the national reform programme, NRP, until we informed them of it and its significance.  I suspect many are still unaware of it.  Second, we would like the Government to establish a more structured, systematic and meaningful process of consultation on the development of the NRP and the achievement of its targets.  In the past our regional assemblies have been given less than a week to make comments and few if any of the comments or suggestions have been acted upon.  In addition, no implementation roles are assigned at local or regional levels.</p><p> As well as the weakness in the process, we also have particular concerns regarding the structure and content of the NRPs that have been produced to date.  First, Ireland&rsquo;s national reform programme is spatially blind and the concept of balanced regional development is not reflected anywhere in the text as a key policy objective.  Second, there is no real recognition of the key regional challenges facing Ireland, and the programme says nothing of the specific competitiveness challenges facing the weaker regions.  In this regard there are only national targets; there are no regional targets of any kind.</p><p> Third, we would like some regional targets and regional measures for some of the priority actions.  In the submission we have included some tables which illustrate clear regional divergence.  In our view the one-size-fits-all approach does not necessarily work in all cases.</p><p> Fourth, no practical roles have been assigned to regional or local bodies in meeting the national targets despite the range of activities that these authorities currently undertake, and will undertake following the recent local government reforms, to support economic development and job creation.</p><p> Fifth, there is little recognition of the planning framework and the contribution of regional planning guidelines to help meet Ireland&rsquo;s climate change targets.  We think there needs to be a more coherent approach to land use and economic development.</p><p> Finally, I wish to make a more specific point on the implementation of the European Regional Development Fund programme at regional level.  The regional assemblies, in drafting the operational programmes, are required to demonstrate the strategic alignment of planned investment priorities at regional level with the NRP and country-specific recommendations which do not have any regional dimension.  There is a little more detail on this in the submission, as it is a requirement of the regulations, but despite submissions on it to the Department nothing has been done to date to resolve the incoherence.</p><p> In our submission we also refer to two very recent documents which support the points we are making.  I am sure members have already seen the stocktaking report on the Europe 2020 strategy from the European Commission, published on 5 March.  That gives an assessment of progress in meeting the strategy&rsquo;s targets but also makes some relevant observations on the growing gaps between member states and within member states.  In addition, it underlines that experience has shown that the active engagement and participation of local and regional authorities is key in the delivery of the Europe 2020 objectives.  Those are two issues that we suggest the Government needs to carefully consider, especially in the context of the Europe 2020 mid-term review over the next 12 months.</p><p> The other document is a declaration adopted by the Committee of the Regions on 7 March which is based on a survey of more than 1,000 local and regional authorities across the EU.  It calls for a renewed Europe 2020 strategy based on stronger partnership and ownership by all levels of Government, the introduction of a territorial dimension, more transparency and accountability and multi-level governance, to include national parliaments.  The declaration makes a number of other points which I recommend to the committee as they are most relevant in the Irish context.</p><p> We consider that with the process of ongoing reform of the local government sector there is now a real opportunity to actively work towards the possibility of all regions in Ireland building on their potential and to achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.  The next national reform programmes and the European semester process could help facilitate that.  There is room for a more innovative, ambitious and tailored approach to our future economic well-being, and I hope we have made this case coherently in the submission.</p><p> We have also included a set of questions which reflect some of our concerns and we hope the committee will raise some of them with the Minister.  I again thank the committee for the invitation and the attention of members.  I am happy to respond to comments or questions members might have.  I look forward to ongoing consultation between the committee and the Committee of the Regions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.166" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014040100003#B00300"><p>Thank you, Chairman.  I cannot stay very long as, unfortunately, I have business in the House.  I welcome the delegation and congratulate Ms O&rsquo;Loughlin on her presentation.  The submission is an extremely well-focused document which touches on all the points that have been of concern to many of us for a number of years, and it is no harm to discuss them now.</p><p>  The fact that the submission from the witnesses is circulating now is useful.  As the Chairman has just said, the matters raised will be referred to in the course of other discussions.  We spoke previously about ownership of the European project, which is hugely important from the point of view of the person in the regions, whether he or she is in business, public administration or social Ireland.  At whatever level people interact with the European institutions, it is hugely important that we recognise each other's existence and that the submissions made from each area of the country are taken seriously by European and national institutions.  For too long we have seen intermittent development.  For example, Table 1 on page 34 of the submission shows Ireland and the regions, including the BMW region and the Southern and Eastern region.  Until such time as we achieve a balance in all areas of development we will not function in the way that was intended.</p><p>  Whenever I hear the term &ldquo;land use&rdquo; I wonder what is meant by it.  I would have thought that regional development should take account of the ability within a region to develop in accordance with the national strategy and the European strategy in such a way as to be able to avail of assistance and support from the European Union, not to the detriment of any other part but in its own right.  Last night on television we saw pictures of flooding that has taken place in recent years in certain regions.   We must also ask questions about climate change or global warming, what it means to us and how we can address it.  I prefer to refer to climate change.</p><p>  We must also address the question of energy, alternative energy and emissions and the extent to which we have a cohesive policy that will encompass what is best for our own regional and national development at any given time.  The document goes a fair distance towards identifying the issues that exist.  It refers to strengthening research, technological development and innovation.  One does not have to be based at Dublin Airport to do that; one could do it in any part of the country.  How one does it is by utilising as best one can the facilities available.  One should not regard any part of the country as an outback or region that is not part of the central thrust of what we are about.</p><p>  ICT infrastructure is hugely important.  It brings with it the ability to develop and to attract industry and investment, both indigenous and foreign.</p> <p>I am not certain that we are all singing from the same hymn sheet on the low-carbon economy.  In general, Ireland is in line with the overall European objectives in this regard.  However, a report could easily lead to a change in emphasis on the European Union&rsquo;s part, resulting in Ireland requiring a greater input in the use of non-fossil fuels.  We are particularly vulnerable in this regard, as our European colleagues have far more alternatives on which to draw such as nuclear power, oil, gas and fracking.  These are all energy sources which we cannot use, although I have no particular wish to opt for nuclear power, for example.</p><p> There are scores of houses and housing developments which are boarded up and have been shut down in various regions.  In the eastern region the opposite is the case where there are upward pressures on prices, as well as demand pressures on local authority housing, with a significant number of applicants for units on every housing estate that becomes available.  There are no surplus houses in the region, which is the reverse of the national position.  Development - the rising tide - is supposed to lift all boats, but it is not doing so in the way it should.  If regional policies are adopted along the lines suggested, as well as the right investment and proper infrastructure, the regions will develop in tandem with the most developed parts of the country.</p></speech>

This has been a problem for years and the semester process is taking the local dimension further away from the European Union.  Are there measures that could make a significant difference to communication and get to those more at the coalface of local development and issues that this committee could support?  There are many ideas about EU scrutiny and further engagement.  What ideas at local level would the Committee of the Regions suggest to have more effective communication with European institutions?</p></speech>

Durkan and Senator Catherine Noone for their positive remarks on the presentation from the Committee of the Regions.  I also thank my colleagues, Mr. Conway and Mr. Crowley, for their work on it.  I agree with Deputy Bernard J. Durkan on the need to balance the issues and challenges we face.  Being public representatives in County Kildare, we know well about the long housing lists which run to almost 10,000 people and the difficulties with housing and renting.</p><p>  Senator Catherine Noone asked about the need to ensure better engagement with European institutions.  This meeting is the first step.  The Chairman, when he spoke at one our meetings last year, gave a commitment that our delegation could meet the committee.  This was useful and helpful.  It is a significant commitment from the committee to engage with us on an ongoing basis.</p><p>  With next year&rsquo;s review of the economic and spatial strategy, there will be an opportunity to realign several processes to ensure a balance in regional development and growth.  In meetings with some local authority managers we noted that there was a lack of engagement at that level too.  Measures need to be taken to ensure local authority managers are included in the process.  There is meant to be a European officer in every local authority, but we have found that is not the case.</p></speech>

Donegal County Council, for example, has excellent European representation.  The Committee of the Regions can organise for county managers and delegations to come to Brussels for meetings.  Mr. Robert Collins in our office is always very helpful in this regard, having recently brought over a delegation from the local authorities in counties Meath, Wicklow and Kildare.</p></speech>

There is much scope for promoting awareness at regional level and, I dare say, outside Dublin.  It is important that we sell Ireland as a region in which it is good to do business.  Within Ireland we need to develop the other parts that are not getting the benefits Dublin has received.  With the greater infrastructural improvements we have achieved in the past few years, it is important to sell other regions.</p></speech>

I extol everybody who has any influence on the European institutions to consider what is required.  There is no sense in complaining about climate change.  We can avert some of its effects by adopting a proper drainage policy all over the country.  That must happen or we will cede large areas of the countryside unnecessarily.  Some people with a climate change agenda will say that is a good idea and something we should have more of, but I disagree.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, who has special responsibility for European affairs.  He will brief the committee on the draft national reform programme update for 2014.  The Government is consulting with the Oireachtas on the draft document in advance of its consideration by the Cabinet and its submission to the European Commission in Brussels, which must take place in April.</p><p>  The preparation of a national reform programme is a key input for each member state as part of the annual European semester process for economic policy co-ordination.  Ireland is now participating fully in the 2014 European semester process and this is the first time we will submit a full national reform programme.  Today's meeting is welcome in the context of the European semester, and as part of the evolving engagement with the Oireachtas, to ensure the necessary democratic accountability and legitimacy of the process.  </p><p> I will ask the Minister of State to address the committee in a minute.  Before I do so, I wish to inform him that we have just had a very useful session with Councillor Fiona O'Loughlin, a representative of the Committee of the Regions.  She was kind enough to give her committee's views of the national reform programme.  No doubt a copy of that presentation will be made available to him.  Some of the comments that she made will be raised by some of this committee's members, because we are trying to ensure they have an input into the programme.</p></speech>

A copy of my speech is on its way to the committee and we will have an opportunity to circulate it during the session.</p><p>  First, I thank the committee for its invitation to join members here today and welcome the opportunity to engage with them on the European semester process and the preparation for Ireland&rsquo;s national reform programme, NRP, a draft of which I understand has been circulated to the committee.   Engagement with national parliaments is rightly regarded as an important part of the process.  I believe it is an essential aspect underpinning its democratic legitimacy.  In addition to this session, issues related to the semester are being considered in other sectoral committees, which is very welcome.  In this regard, I understand that the Minister for Finance will separately arrange a briefing for members for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on our stability programme update, SPU, which will be submitted to the Commission alongside the national reform plan in the coming weeks.</p><p>  I wish to emphasise something the Chairman said earlier.  This draft, which has been circulated to the committee, was agreed and noted by the Cabinet this morning.  Therefore, we are holding this session with the committee as soon as we possibly could and are making a draft of the document available to them in order to facilitate as much discussion and engagement with the document as is possible.     </p><p>  Before addressing the contents of the national reform plan I would like to set the context against which the plan is being prepared.  This year, as has already been said by the Chairman, is the first time Ireland will be a full participant in the European semester process.  As a result, we will receive fully-fledged country-specific recommendations, CSRs.  Previously, we were only required to continue implementing the terms of our EU-IMF programme.  It is, therefore, an important statement of how we see the reform undertaken as part of the EU-IMF programme being carried forward into the future under our own steam and direction.</p><p>  It builds on the medium-term economic strategy that the Government published in December, which provides the overall framework for our future economic development.  The mid-term economic strategy is based on three pillars, which are reflected in the national reform plan.  They are as follows: ensuring debt sustainability, financing growth, and supporting employment and living standards.  The three pillars are closely interlinked and inter-related.  We will not be able to deliver growth and job creation unless we get our spending under control and ensure that our debt is at safe levels.  Action on all fronts is mutually reinforcing.</p><p>  The submission of the national reform programmes in mid-April is an important milestone in the European semester process.  As the committee will be aware, the process begins in the autumn with publication of the Commission&rsquo;s annual growth survey.  This identified five priorities for member states to pursue: pursuing growth-friendly fiscal consolidation; restoring normal lending to the economy; promoting growth and competitiveness for today and tomorrow; tackling unemployment and the social consequences of the crisis; and modernising public administration.  I would make the same point regarding these objectives as I made in relation to the objectives of the national reform plan and the medium-term economic strategy, which is to say that they all reinforce each other.</p><p>  Following the examination of national reform plans, and the stability programme updates that are submitted by member states at the same time, the Commission presents country-specific recommendations to member states at the start of June.  These are tailored, concrete recommendations for reforms that are considered in the relevant Council formations - on what is called a "comply or explain" basis - and finally endorsed by the European Council at the end of June.</p> <p>In the past the country specific recommendations given to other member states have covered such topics as public finances, pension systems, measures to fight unemployment, education and innovation.  </p><p> The semester process embraces Europe 2020, the European Union's ten year plan, adopted in 2010, based around five headline EU targets in the areas of employment, innovation, climate and energy, education and social inclusion.  Under Europe 2020 each member state adopts national targets in these five areas and progress is monitored within the framework of the European semester and reported on annually by member states in their national reform plans.  The Commission recently published a communication outlining a process to review the Europe 2020 strategy and I encourage the committee, as well as the sectoral committees, to engage with this process.  I believe this was a subject of engagement between the committee and the Secretary General of the European Commission, Catherine Day, when she appeared before the committee recently.</p><p> Since exiting the EU-IMF programme of financial support the Government has made a strong commitment to maintain the reform momentum necessary to achieve our goals to support job creation and the enhancement of living standards.  As I mentioned, the framework for this is the mid-term economic strategy.  In the national reform programme which we are discussing we will be expected to report on progress made under our programme towards our Europe 2020 targets.  We will also be mapping out the continuing process of reform that lies ahead.  This will sit within the overarching framework provided in the mid-term economic strategy.  While the national reform plan is expected to be reasonably comprehensive, it is also expected to be concise.  As such, it is not possible to include every detail in every policy area, nor can the plan elaborate on the full extent of Government action across each issue.</p><p> The introduction of the plan that the committee has received provides an overview of our macroeconomic position and the policies being implemented to promote competitiveness, growth and job creation.  These are in line with the priorities set in the annual growth survey.  The Department of Finance&rsquo;s current macroeconomic forecasts were published in October 2013, at the time of budget 2014, and will be updated closer to the submission date as the stability programme update is finalised.  </p><p> Supporting economic recovery is the Government&rsquo;s key priority.  A very strong driver of our approach has been An Action Plan for Jobs which contains actions and targets for all Departments and State agencies.  Its focus is to ensure all efforts are made to improve the overall enterprise environment, boost job creation and retention and bring about economic growth.  The next part of the plan involves reports on implementation of our programme, including those which have been the subject of follow-up action in recent months, including health, legal services and debt overhang in the economy.  As we are well aware, there are many challenges facing the health and social care system.  In 2012 the Government published Future Health outlining how it would reform the health system across the four strands of health and well-being, structural reform, services reform and financial reform.  The aim is to achieve a sustainable health and social care system which ensures access to high quality services based on need, not income.  Arising from this plan, the Department of Health is actively taking forward an ambitious reform programme.</p><p> The Commission has also expressed an interest in reform in the area of legal services.  As the committee will be aware, the Legal Services Regulation Bill is advancing with the aim of establishing the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority by the end of 2014.  Enactment of this important legislation will better balance the interests of legal professionals and consumers of legal services in a way that is appropriate to a modern, open and recovering economy.</p><p> As regards debt overhang in the economy, a number of actions were completed pursuant to the EU-IMF programme to address non-performing SME loans and mortgage arrears.  This work is continuing as a matter of priority for the Government.  We recognise that SMEs are the lifeblood of the economy, playing a vital role in our recovery and job creation.  We have, therefore, launched a suite of lending initiatives for SMEs.  As set out in An Action Plan for Jobs, our focus for 2014 is on increasing new lending to SMEs; increasing participation in Government sponsored access to finance schemes for SMEs such as the microenterprise loan fund, the credit guarantee scheme, the seed and venture capital scheme, the seed capital scheme, the employment and investment incentive scheme, the National Pensions Reserve Fund, SME funds and the Credit Review Office; raising the level of awareness among SMEs and entrepreneurs of the full suite of developmental business supports available to them; enhancing the financial capability of SMEs; and enhancing research and policy evaluation of access to finance for SMEs.  We are also stepping up our efforts to ensure the business community is aware of the supports available to it.  This will principally be achieved through the newly established local enterprise offices.  We have also developed an online tool which we will be rolling out in the near future to help SMEs to easily identify those programmes or supports of most immediate relevance to them. </p><p> I want to address our national targets under the Europe 2020 strategy.  These targets are across all of government, for example, employment and poverty reduction strategies.  They ensure effective implementation of our cross-departmental plan and, when delivered, will be mutually reinforced and supported by common policies.   The first key area is employment, in which the target is to raise to 69% to 71% the employment rate for women and men aged 20 to 64 years, including through the greater participation of young people, older workers and low-skilled workers and the better integration of legal migrants, and to review the target level of ambition in 2014 in the context of a proposed mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy.  For 2013, the employment rate for women and men aged 20 to 64 years was 65.5%, an increase of almost two percentage points from 2012.  This increase demonstrates the beginning of an improvement in the labour market after a fall from a high of 74% in the employment rate in 2007 to 71% in 2008 and less than 64% in 2012.  For us to reach the 2020 target, the employment rate will have to increase by 0.6 percentage points each year.  We see this as feasible, provided the recent recovery is maintained into the medium term.  We are continuing to tackle unemployment and support employment through the twin strategies of An Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work.  Key area of focus include competitiveness, entrepreneurship, support for the domestic economy and communicating the available supports more effectively.  The Pathways to Work strategy, launched in February 2012, introduced a new integrated employment and support service, including the transformation of local social welfare offices into one-stop-shops called Intreo offices.  In 2013 a renewed focus was given to targeting activation places at the long-term unemployed.</p><p> The Government is also moving to implement the EU youth guarantee, on a phased basis, within the Pathways to Work framework.  Key plans will include developing the Intreo activation process to ensure earlier and more intensive engagement with young people; delivering opportunities for young people through education and training programmes; earmarking a quota of places and opportunities on employment schemes for young people; varying the eligibility conditions for access to these schemes by young people; expanding the number of opportunities availed of by young people in the form of internships, subsidised private sector recruitment and supports for the self-employed; and introducing new options for young unemployed people, in particular in the areas of youth entrepreneurship and international work experience and training.</p> <p>Expenditure on programmes providing employment, training and further education opportunities for young people will be in excess of &euro;500 million in both 2014 and 2015.</p><p> In Ireland, we have significantly increased our investment in this area over the past decade.  As a result, Ireland has built a strong science base and has joined countries such as Finland, Germany and the US among the world&rsquo;s top 20 countries for scientific output.  Approximately two thirds of Ireland&rsquo;s research and development is in the private sector, creating new product and service innovations that will drive exports, growth and jobs.  This has been supported through a range of actions, including improvements in fiscal measures to support research and development, supports for links between higher education and industry, and supports for in-company research and development and start-up companies.  As a consequence of this increased investment, the research intensity rate for Ireland in 2012 has been confirmed at 2.13% of GNP or 1.72% of GDP, affirming that Ireland is on track to achieve its research and development target by 2020. </p><p> The target for climate change and energy is to reduce emissions in the non-traded sector by 20% compared to 2005 levels; to increase the share of renewables in final energy consumption to 16%; and to move towards a 20% increase in energy efficiency.  On climate change, under the 2009 EU effort sharing decision, which applies to greenhouse gas emissions outside the scope of the EU emissions trading scheme - in other words, the non-traded sector - Ireland must limit its emissions growth to 20% below 2005 levels during the period 2013 to 2020.  This target under EU law is ambitious and challenging from an Irish perspective, particularly given the size of our agriculture sector and the scale of emissions associated with it.  Our target for the period to 2020 consists of a series of declining annual targets, and compliance must be demonstrated with each annual target in turn.  The Environmental Protection Agency publishes annual inventories of, and projections for, national greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p> We are on course to comply with the mitigation trajectory in the first half of the eight-year compliance period.  Compliance in the years 2017 to 2020 is more challenging, and this is being addressed by the development of policy and legislation.  In accordance with the commitment contained in the programme for Government to introduce primary legislation on climate change, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government published outline heads of a climate action and low carbon development Bill in February 2013.  Subject to the approval of Government, it is expected that the final heads of the Bill will be published in April 2014.</p><p> In anticipation of the planned primary legislation, a national low-carbon roadmap to 2050 is being developed.  The road-mapping process will focus in detail on closing the distance to Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions reduction target.  It is intended that the first draft 2050 national low-carbon roadmap will be released, together with a draft strategic environment assessment, for a substantial period of open consultation later this year.</p><p> With regard to energy, the overarching objective of the Government's policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers.  The 2009 EU renewable energy directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.  To meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand from renewable sources, with 10% for transport and 12% for heat.  In 2012, 7.1% of the State's overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy.  As a percentage of the targets for each of the three sectors, this equates to 19.6% of electricity demand and 2.4% and 5.2%, respectively, of transport and heat power needs, being met by renewable energy in 2012.  To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target.</p><p> The national energy efficiency action plan, NEEAP, is the State's overarching policy framework for energy efficiency and contains a commitment to a 20% energy savings target across the economy by 2020 in pursuit of our EU objectives.  Recognising that Government must lead by example, we are committed to achieving a 33% reduction in public sector energy use by 2020.  At the end of 2012 we had achieved 36% of our national target.  Nevertheless, the bulk of our target remains to be delivered over the seven years to 2020.  Oversight of our action plan commitments is provided by the NEEAP implementation group, chaired by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Under the 2012 energy efficiency directive, all member states are required to submit a revised energy efficiency action plan by 30 April 2014 and every three years thereafter.  The drafting of our next action plan is being finalised and will be published later in the year.  Moreover, in summer 2014, the Commission will assess progress achieved to date by all member states and whether the Union is likely to achieve its 2020 energy consumption targets.  Meeting the 20% national target and 33% public sector efficiency target will require sustained action across the public, industrial and commercial sectors, the deepening of retrofit activity and a significant shift in transport behaviours.  The Government will bring forward over the next 18 months new initiatives to further stimulate energy savings across the economy.</p><p> With regard to social policy, targets in the area of education aim to address early school leaving and boosting the number of those with third level qualifications. Specifically, they are to reduce the percentage of 18 to 24 year olds with at most lower secondary education who are not in further education and training to 8% and to increase the share of 30 to 34 years olds having completed tertiary or equivalent education to at least 60%.  The percentage of early school leavers in Ireland fell from 11.4% in 2010 to 9.7% in 2012.  This represents positive progress towards achievement of our 8% target and the NRP provides detail on a number of measures that have been put in place to support its achievement.  The latest EU data show that Ireland's tertiary attainment rate for 30 to 34 year olds was 51.1% in 2012.  Since 2009, Ireland has had the highest rate for this indicator of all EU member states.  In the tertiary attainment rate for 25 to 34 year olds indicator presented by the OECD, Ireland ranks first in the EU and fourth in the OECD.</p> <p> With regard to poverty, the target is to reduce the number experiencing consistent poverty to 4% by 2016 and to 2% or less by 2020, from the 2010 baseline rate of 6.2%.  This will lift at least 200,000 people out of the risk of poverty and exclusion between 2012 and 2020.</p><p> Following review in 2012, the Government agreed a revised and enhanced national social target for poverty reduction, which is to reduce consistent poverty to 4% by 2016 and to 2% or less by 2020, from the 2010 baseline of 6.3%.  This is supported by a wide range of actions across diverse policy areas in the national action plan for social inclusion.</p><p> Unfortunately, the upward trend in the Europe 2020 target population highlights the social impact of the crisis in Ireland.  We are awaiting publication of 2012 data from the CSO Survey of Income and Living Conditions, which will be published shortly and will give us a more up-to-date position on the social status of Ireland.</p><p> Recent research carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute for the Department of Social Protection shows that social transfers are very effective in reducing income poverty - lifting almost 40% of the population out of the at-risk-of-poverty category.  This performance has actually improved during the crisis, as the welfare system provided a crucial safety net for higher numbers unemployed.  The ESRI research reveals that the share of total household income from social transfers increased very rapidly after the start of the recession, from 20% in 2004 to 30% by 2011.  This was largely due to the rise in unemployment, leading to more people receiving unemployment-related payments, as well as to the fall in market incomes.  In 2011, 87% of households received some social transfer income, up slightly from 85% in 2004.  The ESRI research also finds a strong link between social transfers and poverty alleviation - reducing the gap between household market income and the poverty threshold by 88%, up from 84% in 2004.  Ireland's performance in this area is at the top of the range of EU countries, with an overall effectiveness of 90% in reducing the poverty gap through social transfers.  In recognition of the higher risks and lifelong consequences of child poverty, a new child-specific social target will be set in the forthcoming national policy framework for children and young people 2014-2020.  </p><p> The draft NRP also briefly outlines how the use of our Structural Funds supports our efforts to achieve Europe 2020 targets.  Ireland has been allocated approximately &euro;2.19 billion in respect of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and just over &euro;1.2 billion in regard to the other funds over the period 2014 to 2020.  </p><p> I have just gone through a gigantic amount of material and will conclude by emphasising a few points.  While it might not have seemed like it, I hope it was a relatively succinct summary of a huge amount of material in the National Reform Plan.  The National Reform Plan, and its role in the semester process, really demonstrates just how broad the semester process is and how many different social outcomes and social objectives are looked at in addition to the economic objectives, which, of late, we have unfortunately had to spend too much time discussing.  It also demonstrates that in order for us to rise effectively to these social challenges and opportunities, it requires a breadth of response that stretches across many Departments as opposed to just one.  </p><p> I suppose that leads on to a health warning for me in terms of my participation in this session, which is that a wealth of policy areas are covered and while I will obviously do my best to respond to any points members want to make in regard to the areas I have flagged, I should make it clear that this is part of a consultation session.  One of the main objectives I hope to fulfil at this session is that by hearing what members have to say, I will ensure it is at least passed on to the relevant Departments and Ministers and included in our national process.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.</p></speech>

As he said, it is a cross-committee issue, and we are lucky to be joined Deputy Michael Colreavy and Senator Michael Comiskey, who may take part in the proceedings and the questioning.</p><p>  I spoke at a conference yesterday in Westminster about the European semester, where all the talk was about yesterday's statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, that the UK will now pursue an agenda of full employment.  We have set employment targets for those aged between 20 and 64 of 69% to 71%, which is actually less than the EU target of 75%.  Bearing in mind the agenda across Europe in regard to employment, does the Minister of State think we are being a bit pessimistic?  Could we potentially do more with those targets?</p><p>  I mentioned earlier that when we invited the Committee of the Regions to a meeting of this committee, one of the questions its members asked also related to targets.  They were concerned that the targets were expressed at a national level and they wondered whether some sort of regional targets could be included so that we could see some sort of attempt to address the issue of balanced development across the regions.  Will the Minister of State comment on that also?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.193" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/971" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014040100008#G00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his presentation.  The entire plan is highly laudatory, as are its objectives, which we support.  Naturally, we will place individual emphasis and make individual comments on aspects of it.  I had intended to start where the Chairman left off - that is, on the question of regionalisation.  I missed the initial presentation from the Committee of the Regions.  I am concerned that we would set overall national objectives without having a regional dimension.</p><p>  Extraordinary progress has been made by Government in creating an environment in which 61,000 jobs have been created over the past 13 months in the private sector.  That is an enormous achievement and something about which we should be very proud.  The difficulty is that those jobs tend to be created in the major urban centres and in centres with large populations, and we all understand the arguments around that.   </p><p>  In the area I represent, which is represented very competently by Senators Reilly and Comiskey, we have a number of IT companies and PLCs.  Broadband is now pretty comprehensively available and we have a good road infrastructure.  There is no reason we should decide our region is not capable of creating jobs, of accepting inward investment and of having the personnel to make it work.  I put it to the Minister of State that it would be very helpful if regional targets we set or, at least, if there was a commitment to regionalisation.</p><p>  Yesterday, when I spoke at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly plenary session in Dublin Castle, I put it to Mr. Frank Ryan, chairman of the IDA, that I was very keen on getting jobs into the regions and places such as Cavan-Monaghan.</p> <p>Mr. Ryan referred to the IDA proposals for a short and medium-term plan in the next few months.  He made a commitment to look again at the question of bringing more jobs to the regions.  Unfortunately I will not be present to hear the Minister of State's response but I would be very grateful if he could indicate his personal support for bringing a spread of jobs to the regions and embodying that target in the programme.  There should be a commitment in writing to bringing jobs to the regions.  I think the people we represent deserve not to be written out of the national economic recovery.</p><p> I welcome the excellent job activation measures.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, deserves a commendation for her pioneering work on changing the concept of what was traditionally known as the dole - a paternalistic payment for bare existence - into a payment for people who are jobseekers in the real sense.  These measures give people the opportunity to find employment.  What has been done in the area of job activation is excellent.  I am very happy with the written commitment to implement the youth guarantee, albeit incrementally, and I am interested in learning the targets that have been set for the short term.  My colleague Senator Kathryn Reilly organised an excellent seminar on the youth guarantee scheme some weeks ago in Cavan.  My colleagues who attended told me about the very good discussion.  The experience in Finland would suggest that the youth guarantee is a concept that we should pursue.</p><p> Many young people cannot get an apprenticeship because of the decline in construction, a sector now experiencing a 60% rate of unemployment.  Contractors who had small businesses such as plumbing and heating are no longer functioning.  A young person who wants a trade cannot readily access an apprenticeship.  I think there should be a commitment to simulated apprenticeships in colleges and schools.  It is not beyond the imagination to create the same tasks in an artificial environment, so that young people can pursue an apprenticeship.  Of course one would prefer if these young people were out in the real world, but unless we address this issue, there will be a dearth of tradespeople and many youngsters will miss out on this opportunity.  In so far as they would need practical experience, could opportunities be created in public projects in conjunction with SOLAS?</p><p> The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, has introduced a number of financial initiatives, but we need a State system to finance small business in parallel with the banking sector and the private sector financial houses.  This would stimulate them to do better.  We need an initiative to get small business going.  I am happy with the increase in expenditure on research and development, which is vital.</p><p> The UN report, which was covered widely in the media, puts the issue of climate change and energy into perspective.  The Minister of Stater was unnecessarily humble in suggesting that he would not be able to address all the areas, but I am sure he can.  Is there a possibility that we can reduce the cost of wind energy?  It is the most natural source of energy we have, but I understand it remains too expensive.  Will the Minister of State comment on that?</p><p> Nobody wants to speak about the elephant in the room - nuclear energy.  We have a NIMBY culture and some politicians pander to every group who want to stop development in the country.  We must become more mature and, as politicians, give a lead to people.  In the context of climate change and having to maintain our agricultural economy and reach the targets in Harvest 2020, we may have to look at new nuclear technology afresh.  I ask the Minister of State to respond to that.  It is too atavistic and simplistic to immediately dismiss nuclear energy.  If I had to face a choice between nuclear energy and the dismantling of our agricultural industry, which creates jobs in my area, I would have no doubt as to what should be done.  We have to examine how we can reduce our demand on energy, and in my view nuclear energy should not be dismissed totally.  We should at least conduct a cost-benefit analysis of its use.</p></speech>

I know it sounds outside the box, but the provision of two years of preschool education will alleviate poverty and in the long run will deal with much early school leaving.  From my experience as a teacher I know that intervention at the youngest possible age is the way to deal with educational disadvantage.</p><p>  Will the Minister give some thought to the leaving certificate applied course, which has been underplayed?  It is the only outlet for the weaker academic student.  We treat it as a Cinderella and there are insufficient outlets from it.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman for inviting me to attend this meeting on the national reform programme.  As I am a member of the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, most of my questions will be in that area.  In my previous day job a programme meant more than a statement of objectives; one set out a map on how one would achieve the objectives.  Once this programme is finalised, will a detailed map be drawn up for Government on how it will reach the objectives stated in the draft national programme?</p><p>  On the question of energy generation, I would like to think in terms of the principles and practices of EU, national government and local government subsidiarity.  I understand that member states have absolute discretion in determining their own energy strategies.  I believe this has been confirmed by the EU.  I am aware of the intensive lobbying by energy companies in respect of hydraulic fracturing, fracking of shale gas and also wind energy.  I would not be surprised to learn of proposals for nuclear energy.  I found it frightening that many MEPs would support a proposition that projects involving hydraulic fracturing might be considered without an environmental impact statement.  I think that is the hallmark of successful lobbying by energy company lobbyists.  It is frightening.  While member states have absolute discretion to determine their own energy strategies, increasingly we will see discussions between member states on joint operations, just as we are seeing joint projects in communications.  That is the natural way to proceed.</p> <p>I am concerned that our independence in planning for the future will be jeopardised by increasing intercountry collaborations on energy projects.  I am very concerned that energy companies, rather than the Government, will make decisions on energy policy and projects to suit the people.</p><p> My second point is on wind farms and the use of renewables in energy generation.  While I understand Deputy Joe O'Reilly's point on NIMBYism, I would not support it.  There is no doubt that wind energy and renewable energy projects are the future for this and other European countries.  We wish to give them a fair wind and see them work.  They work when they have the support of host communities and where the host communities clearly see a benefit arising for them.  Our job and that of the Government is, first, to ensure we meet our own energy requirements before we even consider exporting energy supplies and, second, that host communities and Irish people in general see a clear benefit from renewable energy projects because only then will we have what we all want, a thriving renewable energy sector that benefits the people but one which has not been designed at the behest of well placed lobbyists.</p><p> My final point, if I can stray into the field of agriculture, is on greenhouse gas emission reductions.  While we need to do everything we can to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, this is a food producing country.  That is what we do best and probably better than anywhere else in the world.  I argue that it is easier, in the sense that there are more technical solutions, to reduce emissions from heavy industry or transport than to alter the biological functions of cattle who eat grass.  There is a need to set out realistic and achievable steps to minimise agriculture-related emissions and monitor these steps to ensure they are being taken.  However, we have to resist any attempt to penalise Ireland for what we are and what we do as a people.  We produce excellent, natural food and should not be penalised for doing so.  </p><p> I wish the Minister of State well.  He has an important portfolio and the work he does will influence the direction the country will take in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.199" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1110" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014040100010#J00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I will have to re-read the draft national reform programme for Ireland for 2014 as it is a comprehensive document.  Everyone in the country should read it as it gives a clear and concise account of what the Government is doing on a range of issues and it is a very important document.</p><p>  Considering that we have had engagement with the troika, does the Minister of State expect any surprise in the country specific recommendations or have these issues been dealt with?  The five priorities for member states to be followed in the annual growth survey include modernising public administration, tackling unemployment, promoting growth and competitiveness, pursuing growth friendly fiscal consolidation and have been encompassed in the budgets we have introduced.  Lending to the economy and SMEs continues to be a priority.  Even though the pillar banks state they are following the targets set by the Government, anecdotally, businesses and SMEs state they are not.  Does the Minister of State think there is a role for credit unions, notwithstanding some of the problems that arose in that sector in recent years?  In general, they have a strong record and it is an issue that has often been raised with me. </p><p>  A number of members referred to the need for a regional balance.  When I was a member of the county council for seven or eight years at the height of the Celtic tiger when there was inward investment, the debate was about having a regional balance, not to mention within the country.  Certainly, in terms of foreign direct investment, the phrase used was &quot;critical mass of population&quot; in the sense that large companies wanted to locate in Galway or any other city, rather than the regions.  There is a challenge in that regard, but given that 50% of the population is in Leinster, there is a concern that this figure will continue to grow.  Notwithstanding what Deputy Joe O'Reilly said about better road and public infrastructure nationally, there is ongoing concern about what is seen as a regional imbalance.  </p><p>  A number of contributors mentioned climate change and commented on yesterday's UN report which received much publicity and worrying commentary, some of which was based on estimates of the increases in global temperatures, ranging from 1.5&deg; to much higher levels, and their impact and consequences.  The issue of nuclear energy has been mentioned, while the single energy market was commented on at a meeting of the jobs committee.  That is an important issue because the cost of electricity in Europe <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>our competitors in the United States is a concern.  I am wondering about the progress made in dealing with the issue of a single energy market, bearing in mind the reliance of some countries on imported gas supplies from Russia.  Obviously, we are all aware of the concerns about developments in that part of the world.  </p><p>  On the issue of tackling unemployment, the construction sector is a source of major concern.  We have moved from an over-reliance on that sector during the Celtic tiger era to high rates of unemployment in it.  It is evident that there is an increasing need for houses, particularly in the greater Dublin area and, possibly, some urban areas also.  I hope there will be ongoing initiatives to promote housing construction within these areas.</p></speech>

One issue of concern in regard to the youth guarantee implementation plan is set out on page 20 in terms of the penalty process.  It states work experience, training and education opportunities will under the youth guarantee be prioritised for young people and that other cohorts will be displaced in accessing these opportunities.  It goes to state what young people will be expected to do.  I am concerned about the issue of displacement and would like to know whether it could feature as a cause for concern in the country specific recommendations, especially at a time when we are trying to tackle unemployment, in particular long-term unemployment.</p></speech>

As my party's spokesperson on agriculture in the Seanad, I am delighted to be here.  </p><p>  I support the call made by my colleague, Deputy Joe O'Reilly, that we look at targets set for the regions.  I come from north Leitrim.  The larger regions towards the east coast are doing quite well, whereas counties such as Cavan, Leitrim and Donegal may not be doing as well.  Perhaps the setting of targets for these areas would prove beneficial.</p> <p> In the agri-sector, we have just seen &euro;12.5 billion agreed over the next term.  That funding will go into all of the agri-sector, which, in turn, will development more jobs.  I believe approximately 26,000 of the 60,000 jobs that have been created over the past number of months are in the agri-sector, I suppose, to do with the production of food, etc., which is positive.  We must keep investing in that.  On part of the Pillar II programme, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, was with us in Leitrim on Friday last visiting projects that had been funded by Leitrim Development Company up to a total of &euro;3 million.  Some of those projects are ongoing and others have been finished and were officially opened.  This is positive.  That is the way.  We have to keep going.  We will see more funding going into that area.</p><p> Wind energy is controversial in some parts of the country.  Certainly, along the west coast, in counties such as Leitrim, I see considerable potential to develop more wind farms because we do not have that problem of them being close to dwellings.  Donegal has done quite well over the years and quite a number of wind farms have been built.  There are vast areas of mountains in Mayo-north Leitrim where one could build wind farms away from where people live.  This would be a significant benefit to the area, not only when they are up and producing energy but in the construction phase where we would see much work for quarries delivering on road-making, etc., when a wind farm is being developed.</p><p> Before I go, I was talking to somebody at the weekend who has ten to 12 employed almost on a full-time basis who would be earning &euro;450 to &euro;500 a week and whose tax and deductions would be paid.  He finds himself in a difficult position where he owes &euro;15,000 in PRSI.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, is looking at all of those areas.  We should look more at helping such smaller companies to assist them to keep on their employees.  I note there is considerable pressure.  An overdraft will have to be got to pay this and it is difficult enough to find the wages every week for his employees.  There should be a little more done for those who would have that sort of a problem.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.208" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014040100011#K00300"><p>I will be brief.  I welcome the Minister of State.</p><p>  It is an ambitious programme.  As he will be aware, some of the cynics out there would say that they would prefer if the IMF-EU were still here monitoring us and regaining our independence to them is a doubtful achievement.  There is a challenging time ahead to prove the cynics wrong, and that we can commit ourselves to a development plan that will see Ireland continue to march in a forward direction in the absence of the eye of the troika.</p><p>  When we got rid of the troika, there were comments from it to the effect that we fail in two fields.  The Minister of State should correct me if I am wrong.  One of them would be legal services and the other might have been the cost of the delivery of health services.  I note we are going to reform the legal services area.  I presume it comes under the heading of modernising public administration.</p><p>  I have a direct question to the Minister of State.  It has amazed me for years - most are probably afraid to attack the legal profession and the Minister is probably the strongest of all - that there is a system called the taxing master's regime.  It horrified me once to see that a former Attorney General had been before the taxing master who arbitrated that in excess of &euro;0.5 million was being claimed by this legal professional and the taxing master found it was exorbitant.  That is just one example.  The legal profession must constitute to some degree illegal claims on taxpayers' money to the extent that they present the State with significant bills that are overturned by the taxing master.  I would hope that the criticism levied at us by the troika will be corrected, particularly in the field of this seemingly arbitrary ability of the legal profession to lay a claim before the State for exorbitant sums to which they are not entitled, in other words, daylight robbery.  The other group the troika was criticising was the medical profession.  In the past we heard it stated, I think, by the German ambassador to Ireland, what a funny country it is where Irish doctors are paid more than their German counterparts.  It is true that it is extremely costly for an ordinary person to avail of medical services, at &euro;50 or &euro;60 a visit, in particular, when one must attend a consultant who will charge.  Will this philosophy, this capitalist norm of what the market can bear or what the consumer can bear, be reformed in the national reform programme?  It is not satisfactory that, for example, either the legal profession or the medical profession can seem to charge just what the market or the consumer can bear.  We must restrict that outrageous ability of these professionals to carry out such charging mechanisms.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014040100011#K00400"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming before us.  I am sorry that I had to duck out for parliamentary questions during his speech but I read what I could of it in the meantime.</p><p>  I concur with my colleague in the pointers he raised on costs here.  For instance, over the past number of years a great deal of criticism has been levelled at the German Chancellor as living in an unreal world and dispensing hardship on the rest of us when, in fact, the GDP<i> per capita</i> in Germany is lower than it is in this country.  Not all the criticism we level from time to time is as soundly based as it should be.</p><p>  It is an important time.  Post the bailout, it is most important we recognise that we must fly on our own, but with due deference to the guidelines already laid down, the targets already set and agreed to, and the extent to which we are prepared to do that on our own.  Bonar Law famously stated that Ireland was ungovernable and incapable of governing itself, and we will see that now because it is easy to opt out when it appears that the burden has lightened.  In fact, the burden has not lighted at all.  The struggle continues.  We must keep our eyes on those targets and try to live up to them and achieve them because every time that we deviate from the targets it will be reflected in interest rates applicable to the moneys that we borrow.  That is the way it works.  It is as simple as that.</p><p>  I do not want to fall out with my colleague on nuclear energy, but I am not the country's greatest supporter of it for obvious reasons.  I do not wish to go into them today but will say simply that alternative energy is necessary.  We have access to alternative energy.  Wind energy is a useful and worthwhile option.  No doubt the capital costs are high but the running costs are way below what would apply to anything else.  One ought not forget there is a suggestion nowadays to the effect that nuclear energy is free of emissions.  It might be free of emissions but it is not free of residue, which has to be catered for and which has not been so far catered for in any way other than that it will be kept forever in sealed containers at the bottom of the ocean, and we do not know whatever will happen.  The example I would emphasise in relation to nuclear energy is Japan, a highly developed society.  When it came there, the catastrophe came the same as it did in Chernobyl.  Albeit from a different route, the consequences were the same.  We need to be cognisant of that.</p><p>  On wind energy, pylons and wind farms generally, I agree entirely that they should not be located in sensitive locations close to houses.  It is not necessary.  There is plenty of wind blowing in areas where they will not interfere with residential development, etc.</p> <p>The Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste recently visited an installation in my constituency, to wit, Intel.  Interestingly, 10,000 people are employed there at present, between those who are directly employed in the installation and those in the construction sector.  If one looked out the window from where the presentation was being made, one could see cables and pylons all over the place.  That is how the energy got there, as there was no other way to do it.  One can talk as romantically as one wishes and it would be much nicer to have everything underground - I realise one cannot put wind turbines underground - but to achieve such a level of development, one must provide water, electricity, information technology and infrastructure at the levels that are required in modern business.  In the review that now is taking place, everything that can be done in Ireland must be done.</p><p> The submission from the Committee of the Regions earlier was well timed because it served to focus on those parts of the country that have not had access to worthwhile major development in recent years.  There is a dual benefit in that if all areas are developed in unison, it lifts the pressure from the rest of the country to an extent.  One should remember that while it is not always necessary to have a major airport, port or road within 50 m of a particular development or investment, it helps, and such infrastructure is needed.  The Shannon development region was a classic issue long ago, whereby a particular focus was placed on that region that allowed it to develop in a way it would not have developed otherwise.  I ask that this particular type of model be borne in mind in the context of any regional development taking place at present.</p><p> In respect of agriculture, Ireland is the fourth largest beef-exporting country in the world.  While it is a fundamental part of the economy, I recall that during the boom times of the Celtic tiger, the entire agrifood sector was scoffed at as being old-fashioned and not something in which it was in any way trendy to be involved.  However, when the chips were down, we were obliged to rely on agriculture, as well as the information technology, pharmaceuticals and chemicals sectors, and one should never forget that.  Consequently, we should not allow ourselves to be hustled away into believing that we can downgrade and shrink a particular sector to accommodate the rest of the global economy.  One must remember that, as the Chairman is aware, many of those countries are in a far better position than Ireland, with much greater national resources and many more options in respect of energy in particular.  To do what is suggested in some quarters is the equivalent of an economic weapon being used unnecessarily against a smaller country.  This point is made in respect of agriculture in general.</p><p> As for climate change, I believe that drainage is a major issue that must be attended to in Ireland in both urban and rural areas.  Moreover, this must be done on a systematic basis that requires the full approval of the European institutions, which must recognise this sooner rather than later.  I do not believe it is possible to do it under the use of regional or structural funds or whatever the case may be, as it is too big a job.  I believe only two major rivers have been drained in this country over the past 60 years, namely, the Boyne and the Moy.  In respect of both, all the interests, including the recreational interests, protested at the time.  They said the rivers would never be the same again, but they were wrong.  The rivers improved as a result of the drainage and there was a huge impact on flooding in the affected areas.  When I see pictures such as those appearing on television in recent days that showed vast areas of the country under water, I consider that to be totally unnecessary.  It has nothing to do with global warming or climate change but simply pertains to ensuring that watercourses are cleaned, scoured and de-silted on a regular basis to ensure the water can flow.  As for the notion promulgated in recent years that there is no need for drainage and this is part of creating a national flood plain, are we out of our minds?  To think along those lines in a country of this size is utterly ridiculous.  As a matter of urgency, we must focus on the need to carry out drainage on both a regional and a national basis and to have it co-ordinated in such a way as to be of major benefit to the economy.</p><p> My final point pertains to working capital and the credit requirements to which I meant to refer earlier.  Credit, in the form of working capital, now is recognised among the small and medium-sized enterprises as being a major issue.  I do not know how it took so long for everyone to realise this because, like all other members present, I have been working with this fact over my head for the past five years.  It has been right in front of our noses.  These matters do not simply pop up overnight, and this is a huge issue at present because credit in the form of working capital is required to stay in business.  The lending institutions that are in place are in a position to provide that working capital, but if they do not do so - that is, if they think it is possible to shrink on an annual basis - then the market and the entire economy will shrink as well.  As it does not work that way, I ask for particular special emphasis in this regard.  There are other issues to which I do not wish to refer at present.  I apologise for speaking for so long, but these are all crucial issues that must be dealt with and recognised at European level, not simply in passing but in their entirety.</p></speech>

I will kick off with an overview of the points made to me.  If one considers the range of issues that have arisen, which include everything from the post-leaving certificate courses to nuclear energy, with a bit of Bonar Law in the middle, the breadth of those issues is absolutely huge.  I do not mean that in a flippant manner; if one considers the material in the draft national reform programme that was placed before the joint committee, the reason such a breadth of questions was raised is the breadth of policy areas that have been included in the aforementioned plan.  I make this point to emphasise what an important development this is for Ireland from a governance point of view.  This is Ireland's first time participating fully in the semester programme and, although I suspect members already are aware of this point through their work within the Oireachtas and their constituencies, hopefully this will bring home to people the breadth of areas that are involved in trying to get the country back to where everyone desires it to be and the breadth of areas that therefore are involved in the semester process.  The manner in which I would position this process for members is by noting that it covers a great number of areas and items of work one would wish to do anyway and which would be of benefit to the country and the people in any event.  The semester process ensures that the Government provides the continued focus that is needed here, but it also facilitates other countries in doing the same.  One of the bitter lessons learned from the recent crisis is that difficulties and problems in other countries can cause the unravelling of one's own efforts.  This is the rationale behind the semester process and amidst all the questions of detail that I will do my best to address in a few minutes, one should not lose sight of this bigger picture and of the reason for this process being in place.</p><p>  I propose to go through each of the points of detail that have been put to me and will do my best to address each in turn.  The Chairman kicked off with two questions, the first of which pertained to the employment targets and benchmarking them towards the full employment objective.  The Government's objective is to restore the economy to full employment by 2020.  Benchmarks that are laid down within this programme and the targets that are laid down from an employment point of view will be vital prerequisites for the economy getting to that point by 2020.  If one considers the figures supplied, for example, the target is to raise the employment rate for women and men between the ages of 20 to 64 to between 69% and 71%.  In 2008, I note the equivalent rate was 71%.  Consequently, while this is a really demanding objective to reach, the Government believes it will do so.  Moreover, as that point is reached, it will ensure that the economy can get to a point at which it can help to deliver the full employment objectives the Government wishes to achieve across that time.</p><p>  As for the question the Chairman put to me regarding balanced regional development, in a point that also was raised by Deputies O'Reilly and Kyne, as well as Senator Comiskey, the Government is very much aware of the regional dimension in delivering this programme.</p> <p> We will do our best to take account of the input of the Committee of the Regions.  I am aware of the views it has articulated to the committee in response to which I would make three points.  The first is that it will very much be the job of the line Minister with responsibility for the sectoral area concerned to ensure the regional objective is delivered.  Second - this aspect was raised by Deputy Joe O'Reilly - it will very much be the role of bodies such as Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to ensure a regional dimension in our national objectives.  Third, there is an important political dimension to all of this; as clustering in our cities and urban areas continues to accelerate - Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne made reference to the fact that 50% of the population would be resident in Leinster in the medium term - we need to examine political configurations and the bodies that will act in a way that is consistent with the overall development of the country.  I have recently heard discussion about strengthened regional assemblies and the type of work they could do.  That is something we should examine and it is facilitated by the Local Government Reform Act 2014.  I am very clear, even though my constituency is an entirely urban one, located in the centre of the capital city, that we cannot deliver on our objectives for everybody in the country unless there is balanced regional development.  The roles of Ministers and semi-State bodies in this respect are important, but we examine how we organise political activity to meet this important objective, a matter about which Deputy Joe O'Reilly also asked me.</p><p> The Deputy also raised the issue of apprenticeships in the construction sector which now accounts for the equivalent of 4% to 6% of national output, whereas at the peak of the boom it was equivalent of 20%.  Most developed economies of this size would have a construction sector which would account for the equivalent of 10% to 12% of national output.  The first thing we can do to address the concerns about apprenticeships identified by the Deputy is develop a reasonable, well regulated and appropriate construction sector for an economy of this size.  I take on board the point made by the Deputy.  I am aware of cases in my constituency where young men and women cannot fulfil their apprenticeships.  What I would like to see happen is local authorities - the gateway programme in this area has been identified by the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan - continuing to do what they can to allow people to complete their apprenticeship programmes and, as the construction sector recovers, enable them to participate in its development.</p><p> The Deputy also mentioned the cost of wind energy.  This issue is covered on page 31 of the national reform programme.  To date, wind energy production has been the largest driver of growth in the area of renewable energy.  The national reform plan contains considerable material detailing how we can seek to develop its contribution further.  It recognises that further development is needed if Ireland is to meet its objective of 40% of energy consumption being met from renewable energy sources.  It contains some important strategies for how we can achieve this objective. </p><p> Regarding nuclear energy, while the semester programme includes many things, it does not include a reference to nuclear power.  I will leave that issue to the relevant Minister and Oireachtas committee.  There are many other strategies and plans, in respect of which we have the infrastructure in place, that will enable us to deliver on our objectives in meeting the energy targets set.  </p><p> I agree with Deputy Joe O'Reilly in his point on the preschool year.  I am aware of the commitment made by the Government which the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, announced recently, whereby in a number of areas across the country it is seeking to deepen the current early intervention measure.  There is no doubt that the preschool year and even interventions made prior to it can change the life chances of individuals.  I have seen this happen and want to see more of it.</p><p> On Deputy Michael Colreavy's point on including detailed plans within the national reform programme, the problem is that if we were to include detailed plans within it, we would end up with a programme which would run to thousands of pages.  In terms of what it does - I believe this assertion will be borne out if people read through it - it makes reference to detailed plans being in place in different areas.  To return to the point on energy, if members look at the work being done on the carbon free roadmap and the reference to plans to improve the energy efficiency of housing stock and public sector buildings, there are many references to detailed plans that are already either in place or to when they will be made available and delivered on by the Government.</p><p> On the point made by the Deputy on the dangers of increasing inter-country collaboration, we cannot have our cake and eat it because we have many energy targets and meeting them will require collaboration with other countries.  As we collaborate with other countries, we will end up with ways of working to deliver on targets that they need to meet and get from them things that we need.  Owing to events that have taken place within Ukraine, my colleagues in other countries are very clear that the game has now changed and that the issues of energy independence and energy security are of inordinate importance.  I saw this at the March European Council when a discussion on climate change, emissions and other vital issues that had been planned for a very long time took on a completely different context owing to the events that had taken place, the concerns about energy independence and the need to ensure energy security.  That is the context within which we will have to evaluate our plans.</p><p> On the point made by the Deputy on the tensions between food production and climate change, if we consider the commitments we have made to ourselves as a country and the global issue of food security, a matter on which Deputy Bernard J. Durkan touched, having regard to the extraordinary statistic that we are the fourth largest exporter of beef in the world - I am surprised we do not hear this mentioned more - we face a challenge that we will need to manage.  This is a point the Government has been making forcefully.  The Taoiseach has raised the issue at the European Council and I have raised it at the General Affairs Council.  I know that the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, has also raised it.  We have made the point that in terms of how in the context of climate change emissions and costs are calculated, reference needs to be made to the fact that land use is very important.  There are consequences attached to land use.  We need to have this recognised.  I emphasise the determination of the Government to deliver on the objectives set in terms of climate change and our emissions and I am confident we will be able to deliver on them.  The plans are in place to do so and further plans will be elaborated on.  The legislation the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, will be bringing to the relevant committee on climate change and on how we will track our emissions is an indication of our commitment and our confidence that we will deliver in meeting these challenging targets.</p> <p> I hope I have addressed the issue raised by Deputy S&eacute;an Kyne regarding the construction sector.  On the single market for energy, I refer to my earlier comments about the importance of energy independence.  We will see a renewed focus on the delivery of the infrastructure required to ensure energy security.  We need to be mindful of the changing landscape as we make our own policies because it will be a factor when companies, including Irish companies, decide where they should locate their operations.</p><p> I completely understand the point Senator Kathryn Reilly made on displacement under the youth guarantee.  One can apply the displacement argument to any intervention by the social welfare system in the operation of labour markets, but any intervention in the social welfare system or fiscal policy aimed at increasing employment or dealing with challenges in the labour market will have consequences elsewhere.  We need to track these consequences and be aware of them.  Even as we become aware of the nature of these displacement effects, I am certain that policies under the heading of the youth guarantee such as JobsPlus will still demonstrate their effectiveness.  I am sure the Senator will agree, however, that the potential for displacement in the economy is not a rationale to do nothing. </p><p> Senator Michael Comiskey spoke about the targets for the regions and wind energy.  He also raised the issue of low wage jobs and the tax challenges in that regard.  The Minister for Finance has pointed out that, notwithstanding the huge pressures we continue to face, when times were extraordinarily bad, we still managed to make changes to the tax system to target and incentivise job creation through, for example, changes to VAT rates and taxation of farmland as it moved through families.  We need to do the same in respect of the tax challenges that arise from low wage jobs.  As members will be aware, many are finding that if they work an additional hour of overtime, they will lose half of what they are paid through income tax and the universal social charge.</p><p> I entirely agree with Deputy Eric Byrne and look forward to proving the cynics wrong.  I am certain that the Government and the people will demonstrate an ability to govern themselves in a still challenging external environment.  The people who were most critical of the troika's presence now appear to bemoan its absence.  As a liberal democracy now celebrating the centenary of many of the events that led to its foundation as a state, it is not politically or economically feasible to expect to participate in an external aid programme for one second longer than is necessary.  The moment the Government judged it possible to exit the programme, we did so and our objective now is to ensure the economic sovereignty we have regained benefits the people.  The Deputy outlined concrete examples of how that needed to be achieved.  </p><p> In regard to the legal services Bill and the cost of legal services, the national reform programme refers to the establishment of an office of legal costs adjudicator which will assume the role of the Taxing Master, modernise the way disputed legal costs are adjudicated, issue guidelines and publish determinations.  The Deputy also spoke about the costs imposed on families and the economy by unreasonable and unsustainable legal costs.</p><p> In regard to the Deputy's comments on the cost of the medical card system and consultants, I am sure he is aware of the information recently released into the public domain which showed the degree to which consultants' wages had been cut in line with wage cuts elsewhere in the public service.  That has been put in place, but we must balance it with the fact that we need a large number of consultants and a consultant-led health service to deliver the best health outcomes for the people we represent.  The consultants who possess the level of expertise we require will be aware of the rewards and opportunities on offer in other countries.  I note, however, that the salaries available to them have changed in line with the sacrifices other members of the public services have made.</p></speech>

His comments and those of the Minister for Health suggest issues have arisen in this regard and that we have to move to address them.  I am aware from my time on the Committee of Public Accounts that it is a complicated issue, but it is receiving the attention it deserves.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne that people should read this document if they are interested in public policy.  The programme deals with the issue of medicinal products which have a major impact on medical costs, stating:<blockquote>Solid progress is being made with regard to increasing the share of generic drug usage.  Ireland is aiming for a target of 70% generic penetration of the off-patent market by volume by 2016.  In Q4 2013 generics accounted for over 58% of the total off-patent market by volume.</blockquote>One might argue such measures should already be in place - I would say the same - but that figure of 58% is an indication of the progress made in terms of the legislation on referencing drug prices between branded and non-branded products.  The programme also sets out other steps that will be taken.</p><p>  I could not agree more with Deputy Bernard J. Durkan's comment on the need to fly on our own.  I have addressed the issues he raised on nuclear energy and energy infrastructure.  I have heard him speak on the subject of credit and working capital at our parliamentary party meetings and in the D&aacute;il.  The programme describes in some detail the steps that have been taken to provide for non-bank lending while the banking system recovers to the point where it can meet the credit needs he identified.  Four funds have been set up out of the private sector to deal with supply to and investment in companies.</p> <p>For example, the microcredit fund has been set up and is beginning to do some good work with really small companies.  Even in the best of times, such companies might have struggled to obtain bank credit, but they certainly are struggling now.  This is the reason the Government has been working with the German Government to identify measures such as the German KfW bank playing a role in providing credit for Irish small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, because I have no doubt that until the difficulty of the supply and cost of credit is dealt with, the economic recovery we all seek will face too great a barrier.  While progress has been made in these areas, from the feedback they receive from businesses in their constituencies, all members are aware that there still is a lot of work that must be done in this regard.  However, it is because of its importance that it is included in the national reform programme and it will be pivotal in the Taoiseach's engagement at the European Council.</p><p> I have done my best to respond to a breadth of questions and will conclude at the point at which I began.  I really appreciate the effort and all of the questions colleagues have put.  It should be an area in which there will be future Oireachtas engagement and I will certainly play my part in making sure this happens with the committee.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

I extend a warm welcome to Ms Nessa N&iacute; Chasaide, co-ordinator, and Ms Mor&iacute;na O'Neill, policy and outreach officer.  The Debt and Development Coalition was established in 1993 in order to create and increase awareness of the issue of the debt owed by Third World countries to governments and banking and multilateral financial institutions, to promote the elimination or reduction of this debt and to further promote sustainable and equitable development in Third World countries.  The meeting is timely in view of the fact that the spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank will take place in Washington later this month.  As the committee focuses very much on Third World and development aid issues, we are delighted to have the delegates here to give us the benefit of their experience in dealing with debt and development issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.227" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nessa N&iacute; Chasaide" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014040100002#A00300"><p>We thank the Chairman and committee members for inviting us and giving us this opportunity to present on the critical question of international debt and the role of the international financial institutions.  We submitted a briefing document to committee members in advance of the hearing, to which we will speak in our presentation.  We would like to prioritise four key issues that are of serious concern to the Debt and Development Coalition.  First, we will outline the debt distress levels of global south countries, current trends in public sector lending and the role of new, unregulated actors in countries of the global south.  I will then hand over to my colleague, Ms O'Neill, who will speak about specific countries and regions of concern with high debt distress levels.  She will also speak to the question of the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank Group and about our specific human rights concerns regarding its conduct.  She will speak about the connections between international debt and tax justice which we see as deeply interconnected questions if countries of the global south are to get away from their high levels of debt dependency.</p><p>  I will give an overview of current trends in global south countries regarding sovereign debt.  The World Bank's international debt statistics which were released last month and are the most up-to-date figures we have show that the debt stock of southern countries increased by $400 billion in 2012 and stands at just under $5 trillion.  This is the most significant deterioration in southern countries' debt dynamics since the early 2000s.  As many committee members know, 39 countries in the global south have qualified for debt cancellation through the existing multilateral debt relief scheme, the so-called HIPC, heavily indebted poor countries, scheme.  We believe the scheme did not go far enough as it excluded many countries, about which Ms O'Neill will speak, that are still in need of debt cancellation.  It also caused serious damage to many participating countries through the policy conditions attached to it.  Some 36 of the 39 countries that qualified have so far received debt relief, the vast majority of which are in Africa.  The debt cancellation is worth over $100 billion in contributions from public sector lenders.  There is an additional debt cancellation committed to by the private sector.</p><p>  The World Bank's figures show that the problem of global south debt is far from over.  Most significantly, the figures show a rise in private sector lending to southern governments.  The level of sovereign bond issuance by southern governments rose by 30% above 2011 levels, with more countries of the global south issuing bonds, rather than borrowing from previously preferred private sector creditors, the foreign commercial banks.</p> <p>According to the World Bank, private lenders provided 90% of new debt to southern countries in 2012, contributing to the very changed face of creditor influence in countries of the global south, which means a move away from more traditional lenders such as the World Bank.  Debt and Development Coalition Ireland is concerned about these trends because, while private loans can be advantageous to governments as they do not come with intrusive policy conditions attached, they are more costly due to higher interest rates.  In addition, as we in Ireland have learned to our great cost, debts to private bondholders can be extremely difficult to restructure in situations of debt crisis.  Debt and Development Coalition Ireland is also concerned that this rise in indebtedness to the private sector by southern governments may be understated because there is no systematic collection of private debt data by the World Bank.  The World Bank figures therefore provide an important and serious warning to governments throughout the world to act to reduce the debt dependency of southern governments, a dependency which, as we will see in the further issues we will raise, impacts negatively on their development policy options.  The time for action in this policy area is now.  As the new version of the millennium development goals is negotiated through the UN post-2015 process, and through the UN financing for development process, Ireland has an important opportunity to ensure this issue is central to discussions on financial policies towards southern nations.</p><p> We would like to highlight to the committee that the rise in southern government debt owed to the bond markets has opened up exposure to opportunistic actors, namely so called "vulture funds", which buy up distressed debt and then sue the sovereign government in question, often for exorbitant amounts of money.  A case being heard in the New York courts, which is widely reported in the media, is causing significant international concern.  This is the case of NML Capital against the Republic of Argentina, which involves a set of vulture funds suing the state of Argentina for more than $1 billion.  A New York court of appeal found that these hedge funds should be treated on a more equal basis with other traditional creditors than would previously have been anticipated.  This decision potentially sets a very dangerous precedent regarding the treatment of such opportunistic funds because the court ruling in its favour makes it more rational for bondholders to hold out in situations of debt restructuring.  The government of Argentina is seeking to challenge this judgment in the US Supreme Court, a move which has gained support from the IMF and the US, French, Brazilian and Mexican governments.</p><p> Debt and Development Coalition Ireland believes there are broader policy concerns to be considered with regard to this case, and that in cases in which vulture funds sue a state for payment of distressed debts they must be forced to adhere to existing debt restructuring agreements and, crucially, assets must be put out of their reach.  Legislation in this area is badly needed in jurisdictions where these funds operate.  New legislation should build on laws recently put in place, for example in the UK and Belgium, which have sought to control such funds' behaviour by ensuring they cannot make financial claims beyond existing debt restructuring agreements relating to the countries being sued.</p><p> I will now hand over to my colleague, Ms O'Neill, who will speak on the next part of our presentation.</p></speech>

We wish to draw the committee's attention to a range of countries throughout the world which did not benefit from the multilateral international agreed debt cancellation, the HIPC initiative about which Ms N&iacute; Chasaide spoke.  The Irish government should act in support of these countries.  This would mean raising their cases, initially through Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the World Bank and IMF, and through relevant regional banks that lend to these countries.  We would like to direct the attention of the committee to our recent report, Life and Debt, published last year.  This outlines debt crises in ten countries, including Ireland, Tunisia and the Philippines.  We urge the committee to read the report and act in solidarity with these countries where debt burdens challenge the path to equitable and sustainable development for their citizens.</p><p>  Debt and Development Coalition Ireland would like to draw particular attention to the Caribbean region, where many small island states experience debt crises.  The region had an average debt-to-GDP ratio of 70% in 2012, increasing to 90% in the eastern Caribbean area.  This month the Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community, CARICOM, called for debt cancellation and wider economic justice measures for the region.  Debt and Development Coalition Ireland is focusing specifically on the small island state of Grenada, which has been in default on its debts for the past year because it has not been able to pay them back.  The government of Grenada has publicly called for an independent assessment of its debt sustainability and for negotiations on debt cancellation with all of its creditors.</p><p>  As committee members know, Ireland shares a constituency at the World Bank and IMF with 11 Caribbean states and Canada.  This provides Ireland with an opportunity to discuss directly with the Caribbean governments their debt situation and to support these governments in tackling their debt crises by putting their debt problems formally on the agenda of the international financial institutions.</p><p>  As Ms N&iacute; Chasaide stated, we wish to highlight the role of the International Finance Corporation, IFC, which is the arm of the World Bank Group that lends directly to the private sector to boost investment in global south countries.  The IFC has a series of complaints against it for investing in companies that are allegedly involved in human rights abuses.  A number of cases are pending, and today we wish to raise a case in Honduras.  The IFC's investments in the palm oil Dinant corporation-----</p></speech>

Along with our international civil society partners, we believe this case is so serious it demands a response from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p><p>  We also wish to raise more general concerns about the IFC's lending through financial intermediaries.  Approximately 40% of its total funding goes through financial intermediaries.  A recent audit by an independent body charged with oversight of the IFC revealed an astonishing lack of oversight of such lending.  The report stated that the IFC knows very little about the potential environmental or social impact of its lending through these financial intermediaries.</p><p>  The annual reports of the Department of Finance on Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the World Bank and IMF show that, through Irish Aid, Ireland is a supporter of IFC projects.  The briefing material provided to committee members highlights three projects which show that Ireland contributes to the IFC.  While there is no reason to believe there are any pending complaints about these specific projects, we believe Ireland cannot provide funding to a small number of projects without attending to wider IFC policy and practices.  The Irish Government should make a statement condemning any human rights abuses linked to IFC investments and indicate to the IFC that Ireland will consider suspending investments in the IFC until it corrects its behaviour and any necessary redress for communities is put in place.</p><p>  We also wish to raise the link between debt and tax justice.  We are increasingly involved in tax justice.</p> <p>The debt of many countries in the global south has been created by the lack of policy alternatives.  Let me highlight one of the reasons for the debt.  Governments around the world, including Ireland, have failed to meet their ODA spending obligations.  This contributes to the fiscal constraints of Governments in the global south.  The members of the joint committee will be well aware of the cuts to the overseas aid budget for the past six years and that no timetable is in place to meet our target.  Debt and Development Coalition Ireland supports the campaign Act Now on 2015, which calls on Ireland to meet its ODA spending obligations.  </p><p> One of the greatest financial drains to global south countries is the loss of revenue through both legal and illegal forms of tax dodging.  Debt and Development Ireland believes the implications of tax dodging really deserve to be the topic of a separate hearing of the committee.  Our partners in Ireland are working on this issue both at home and internationally.  Countries in the global south lose up to &euro;870 billion every year through illicit financial flows.  Together with Irish and European groups, we are advocating for change in a number of critical areas to support international tax justice.  We are focusing on greater tax transparency - for example, the establishment of a public register of the beneficial owners of companies in Ireland; the introduction of extended country-by-country reporting by all large companies of profits and taxes in every country in which they operate; and the establishment of an intergovernmental body on tax matters under the auspices of the United Nations.</p><p> We are concerned by the Government's stated support for the OECD as opposed to the United Nations as the leading forum for international tax decisions.  This aspect of tax is a rapidly evolving policy area.  As the current Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, BEPS, is an OECD-led project, it excludes many countries of the global south.  Although progress was made on tax transparency during the Irish Presidency in 2013, the Government appears to have taken a wait-and-see position within the current multilateral action as opposed to clearly articulating its policy or solutions.</p><p> We have been very encouraged on learning that the Tanzanian public accounts committee has decided to launch an inquiry into financial outflows relating to taxation from Tanzania.  We suggest to members of this committee that this could be a fruitful area of co-operation between the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and its counterpart in Tanzania.</p><p> My colleague Ms Nessa N&iacute; Chasaide will summarise our recommendations.</p></speech>

To summarise, we urge the joint committee to raise these important policy questions with the relevant Departments - that is, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Finance.  The Minister for Finance holds ultimate responsibility for decision-making on World Bank and IMF-related issues.  We urge the joint committee to support legislation across relevant jurisdictions against the growing power of unregulated vulture funds and to formally propose that Ireland support and engage with our Caribbean counterparts through our constituency within the World Bank and the IMF on the growing debt distress of countries in the Caribbean region.  Should members be travelling to Washington for the spring meeting this month, we would be eager and willing to set up relevant meetings on the topic under discussion in Washington.  We also ask members to raise the serious allegations of human rights abuses against Dinant in Honduras, which is funded by the IFC.  We ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, to make a statement on the serious human rights abuses in Honduras and Ireland's intentions with regard to future financial investment in the IFC.  We ask the joint committee to take action to enable a reduction of the high debt dependency of countries in the global south and to seek support from Government on the range of tax justice measures which my colleague Ms O'Neill has outlined.  We believe the joint committee could play a constructive and productive role by engaging with partner countries in the global south, such as with the members of the Parliament of Tanzania in their forthcoming investigation of capital outflows relating to taxation.</p><p>  We thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to make a presentation on these pressing matters.  We welcome questions and comments from members.</p></speech>

Around 18 months or two years ago, Ms Marie-Lucie Morin, a representative of the World Bank, came before the joint committee.  She has moved on, but I met the head of the section encompassing Canada, the Caribbean and Ireland, and he is anxious to come to Ireland.  We can raise these issue with him.</p><p>  I call on Deputy Brendan Smith to lead off on questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.239" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014040100004#C00400"><p>I apologise for coming late, but I had made commitments prior to the scheduling of this meeting.  I thank Ms O'Neill and Ms N&iacute; Chasaide for the clarity of their very targeted and comprehensive statement.</p><p>  The issue of international tax justice was raised.  During the June 2013 G8 summit held in County Fermanagh, one of the issues discussed by the groups involved in international development at meetings on the margins was international tax justice.  We hear about the issues that arise at these important meetings of the G8, the G7 and the G20 but we seldom hear about the outcomes.  Has the issue of tax justice gone higher up the agenda in the meantime?</p><p>  Debt and Development Coalition Ireland dealt with the role of the IFC in its submission and highlighted that complaints had been made against it for investing in client companies that are allegedly involved in extreme human rights abuses.  To their knowledge, has any country, or the European Union, taken direct action in that regard?  I presume the European Union participates in these discussions at the World Bank.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.240" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mor&iacute;na O'Neill" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014040100004#C00600"><p>I thank Deputy Smith for his question on tax justice.  There is a really active policy agenda on tax justice and now is quite a dynamic and exciting time in terms of the global tax system.  As a result of the G7, G8 and G20 meetings, particularly the G20 meeting in 2013, the OECD was asked to consider the issue of tax justice.  A practical project, BEPS, was started this year and will finish in September 2015, with a final document on its 15 action points issuing in October 2015.  A number of really practical policy recommendations are being made by the OECD and we will be urging the Government to actively follow these recommendations.  We are following them from the perspective of our solidarity with the countries of the global south.  The first action point was dealt with last week.  A report dealing with the first action point, taxation and the digital economy, was released on Tuesday, 25 March.  This is a very good time to become engaged in the process of tax justice, as it has just kicked off.  If members would like further information or briefings, we and our colleagues in Ireland who are looking at that area would be more than pleased to engage with members.</p><p>  The specific complaint against the IFC in respect of Honduras has been recognised by civil society organisations internationally and the World Bank as a really serious case of human rights abuse.  The board of executive directors of the World Bank, representing countries internationally, has accepted that this is a serious case.  It would be good for us in Ireland to add a clear voice to that of other Governments.  There is a process under way in which the IFC must produce an action plan on how it will deal with this issue.  We would be very grateful if the joint committee would monitor and track progress on the action plan, because things can appear to be dealt with and then slip off the agenda.</p></speech>

It was full of facts - the meat of the issue.  The figures are incredible.  I do not mean that I do not believe them, but that they are beyond imagination and very worrying.  I have no idea what &euro;4.8 trillion means.</p> <p>It is just beyond comprehension.  Underneath it there are a series of issues.  For example, the witness said, very diplomatically, "while private loans can be advantageous to governments...".  I presume that means they can do whatever they like with them and in some cases it can fund the lifestyles of dictators.  I imagine the witnesses would agree that there should be some assessment of how this is of advantage to the people, because it is the people are who are important, not the government or the individual dictators.</p><p> There is also the question of vulture funds.  I am pleased Ms N&iacute; Chasaide raised that issue.  That is extremely significant.  These really are a blister - I was going to say a cancer, but it is not appropriate for me to say that at the moment.  I sincerely hope that this NML Capital case against the Republic of Argentina is revisited by the American Supreme Court.  That is shocking and immoral and it seems to me when confronted with this that it will never resolve itself until there is a major restructuring of the global financial system and its institutions.  We are implicated in this because of our debt situation.</p><p> With regard to human rights abuses, that is one issue to which this committee is committed.  I agree that we should have a response from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, who I imagine would be open to this.  We could ask him to do that.  There is an astonishing lack of oversight in terms of where the money is going, which I have mentioned already, and there is a complete lack of assessment of the environmental impact.</p><p> The suggestion that we have a full hearing on the tax situation would probably meet with the approval of the committee.  I am aware that our colleague, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, who has had to leave, has made a significant study in this area and continues to raise the issue.  I would certainly support a full hearing.  Perhaps, the representatives could recommend the people, in addition to themselves, who would be most valuable to us.</p><p> I was making notes while the witnesses were speaking as to whether we could put together a composite resolution.  I take it that the indented part of the last paragraph of the presentation is what the witnesses would like.  Would it be satisfactory if the members agreed to pass this after discussion and, perhaps, amendment?  Is this something the committee could do that would be useful?  If so, I would be happy to propose it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.247" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nessa N&iacute; Chasaide" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014040100005#D00600"><p>Good.  With regard to Senator Norris's comments in respect of private sector debt, we believe that all forms of debt are a double-edged sword for global south countries and global north countries.  We have pointed out that the rise in private sector debt held by southern governments has the benefit of reducing the need for the ideologically focused and often very intrusive and extremely damaging policy conditions that have been the track record of the World Bank and the IMF.  However, private sector loans open up another problem of a build-up of high levels of expensive debt in global south countries.  We believe that the governance of loan contractions should have a high level of participation by the people in global south countries.  In our own country we have learned that the hard way, and that parliaments should have a much stronger role.  Many of our partner organisations in Africa, Asia and Latin America are campaigning for much greater parliamentary oversight of loan contraction decisions.  We are also supportive of a process within the UN system, led by UNCTAD, which has been to launch a set of responsible lending and financing principles.  However, these principles are somewhat narrow in their focus and are not legally binding.</p><p>  The problem with the international debt system is that there is no legislation governing any of this.  We do not have any legal solutions when countries enter debt crises, and it is then a political battle for the indebted governments in question to decide what is the most just action for their people and an action that involves a low level of risk in terms of what they will expose themselves to if they do not pay.  On that basis, we are part of a global movement which is calling for an international dialogue on innovative solutions to debt crises.  The case of Grenada is one such example, which was mentioned by my colleague Ms Morina O'Neill.  The Minister with responsibility for economic issues has called for what he terms a debtor-creditor conference, whereby Grenada would call all its creditors to that country and to negotiate a debt settlement.  This happened 60 years ago when Germany got a debt write-down of approximately 50% after World War II - both sovereign debt and debts held by people and businesses.  Such models, which do not preclude unilateral action by global south governments in not paying their debts but also include multilateral solutions such as debtor-creditor conferences or the establishment of an international debt court, are what we are interested in exploring.</p><p>  With regard to the vulture fund case, we would greatly appreciate being allowed to get back to the committee with further suggestions around legislation in this area, because this is something on we are collaborating with our UK and Belgian partners.</p></speech>

We have to remind ourselves of the position we were in, and still are in, with regard to debt.  Effectively, we are beneficiaries of whatever criteria prevail worldwide.  I recognise and fully accept the distinction drawn between public and private debt and public and private debt funders, which is the important issue.  I strongly agree with the need for international acceptance of parliamentary oversight, but it has to be done globally.  There is no sense in a situation in which one country decides to enforce this while other countries do whatever they wish.</p><p>  On the issue of international taxation justice, we need to recognise that we have been singled out unfairly by some people who could ill afford to comment internationally in regard to the effect the double Irish arrangement has had.  One international tycoon was very disparaging of our position and the benefits arising from the use of what they call the double Irish.  It goes without saying that many other European countries have the same benefits as Ireland, except under different headings.  This relates to our corporation profits tax of 12.5%.  Other countries have equally attractive concessions to foreign direct investment.</p><p>  It has to be recognised that manufacturing in this country is subject to a 12.5% corporation profit tax.  That is how it stands; there may be an 0.5% concession apart from that.  Other countries go well below that level.  The issue is with regard to profits generated in third countries that can be re-routed through other countries.  Why should the emphasis not be on the countries from where that profit is being re-routed to try to ensure they charge a decent level, for two reasons?  One is that there may or may not be a democratic process applicable in that country, and the second is that a huge amount of the profits may go to individuals in those countries and, as a result, they could be major beneficiaries of the regime that applies internationally.</p> <p>For instance, one could have a situation whereby companies could have their US profits taxed in the United States, a country that invests in this country and many other European countries.  When re-routing through another European country, they could have their profits taxed in the country from whence the profits come originally.  They could have their corporation profit taxed in a way that is similar to the system applicable in this country, in which case there would not be a problem.  It is unfair to label the Irish system as being in some way uniquely culpable in this kind of situation.  It is not.</p></speech>

It is correct that the witnesses did not mention it, but I point out that there is a point that comes up repeatedly that is associated with that conversation.  Every time it is commented on internationally, it appears as though we in some way are major contributors to what is seen as being unfair.</p><p>  By way of comparison, what has been the private sector commitment, as opposed to the commitment from the public sector, the World Bank and the IMF, to debt cancellation?</p><p>  On vulture funds, in principle, why are vulture funds so attractive to developing countries, for example, in the southern region?  Is it because funds are not available through conventional sources?  Is it a bit like the moneylenders in this country, and if so, why is that the case?</p><p>  Why do we repeatedly talk about debt write-down when we in this country and other countries may well be in a position to have to seek funding from these same sources at a later date?  For example, is it likely that the lenders will be benign and state that we have been very good and they will write off our debts and as a result one can expect that they will write it off in five years' time through the moneys they will lend to us now?  That is not a position on which we can win.</p><p>  I will proceed as quickly as I can.  We hear a lot about private bondholders in the southern countries.  By the way, I support the case that is going on in the United States.  Of course, if they get away with it, they will try to extract the maximum, but the question that arises then is this: what is the regime of the country that is in debt to private bondholders or whomever?  How did they get the funding in the first place?  How did they qualify for such loans?  Anybody applying for a loan, nationally or internationally, must justify his or her ability to pay, and a loan must be awarded on some criterion or other.  What were the criteria?  Have they changed, or are they being changed?  What is the tax regime in the country concerned?  What is the accountability in the country?  For instance, I can think of numerous countries where, certainly, if I was asked to give a loan out of my pocket I would not do so.  I can assure the Chairman there is very little in my pocket to give to anybody.  I speak in the global context.  If we are to be realistic, there must be an international understanding of the criteria that apply in all situations.  We ourselves know this.</p><p>  My last point relates to the diminution in Ireland's contribution to international aid.  We were lucky to be able to hold the line we have, and this should be recognised.  A considerable effort has been made to maintain Ireland's contribution to international aid.  We have not been able to achieve the 0.7% of GDP target - it has not been possible - and we have slipped away.  We will come back to this again.  We have given a good example to others in the field as well.  However, let us be serious about it.  We were in a situation in the past four or five years which was also that faced by many of the countries of which we speak.  The people of this country had to shoulder a burden that was excruciating, and the significant sacrifices they had to make are not generally recognised.  We must also recognise that there are considerable burdens placed on others.</p><p>  I cannot go on forever.  Suffice it to say that I agree with many of the suggestions, but I strongly disagree with others on the basis that we might find ourselves at the receiving end of some of our own thought process at a later stage, and I would be worried about that.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Durkan for his questions.  In response to the first point on the important role of parliamentary oversight, I am glad to hear Deputy Durkan feels strongly about that, as we do.  We agree on the necessity of looking at debt from an international perspective, not on a country-by-country basis, but the problem is that there is no internationally recognised mechanism for dealing with debt.  Our approach is looking at countries to see which are suffering from high levels of debt distress.  The European Unions states that a debt-to-GDP ratio any greater than 60% means countries are entering into debt distress or unsustainable debt levels that then challenge and inhibit equitable and sustainable development.  Many of the countries of which we spoke today have debt-to-GDP levels upwards of 90%, and we feel duty bound to respond to those cases through our membership of the World Bank and the IMF.</p><p>  On the tax justice question, we may need to separate out for a moment Ireland's corporate tax regime of 12.5% and the issue of global tax transparency.  There is an issue - we are a low-tax regime - but many of the corporations here are paying a much lower effective tax rate.  The figure for Apple was 2%.  We were not talking about the 12.5%, which, we acknowledge, as the Department of Finance stated in its tax strategy of October last year, is an economic cornerstone.  We realise that is current policy, but we are asking for tax transparency.  How much tax are corporations paying?  There are also the issues of country-by-country reporting, who are the beneficial owners of the profits, etc.  I refer to the OECD policy agenda of cracking open the issue of tax and closing down, I suppose, the culture of secrecy whereby one could not see who owned companies, where the profits were made and where the taxes were paid, and to align those more closely.</p></speech>

This is of clear concern to us in the case of multinational companies which have subsidiaries all around the world, including many in Ireland.  That is a matter of particular concern.  However, that is not to say we should not have this kind of country-by-country reporting for all companies in Ireland.</p><p>  To build on what Ms O'Neill stated, there is a reason Ireland is being targeted in this debate, which adds to the urgency with regard to why the Government should be much more proactive on these tax transparency measures.  It is because we often do not know what tax multinational companies are paying.  The Apple case was a shocking one, whereby one part of the Apple conglomerate was paying an extremely low rate of tax and it was not clear to the people of Ireland how that agreement had come about.</p><p>  Deputy Durkan is quite correct in pointing out it is not only Ireland's responsibility.  This is a multilateral issue.  There is a race to the bottom on tax.  Where Ireland is involved in particular schemes, such as the "double Irish" or the "Dutch sandwich", which have been discussed a lot in the media, it is the interplay between a range of jurisdictions that has come under question, and rightly so.</p></speech>

However, a starting point must for the people of those countries to know what is the tax on the royalties and what payments are being made.  Those are currently unknown, although there has been some progress in the extractive sector in the latest EU transparency directives.</p> <p>However, as for direct policy actions the Government should be but is failing to take at present, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has refused to set up a public register of companies in Ireland.  He should lead by example.  If there is nothing to hide and if there is no problem, why can one not see who are the flesh-and-blood owners of trusts, foundations and companies in Ireland?</p></speech>

There should be a period in which global south countries can be given the information on tax matters for companies and individuals in their jurisdictions but they may not have the capacity to reciprocate.</p><p>  On country-by-country reporting, Ireland should announce it will demand this much higher level of information from companies that are operating in Ireland.  Moreover, a start would be with large companies that have come under greater scrutiny in recent years, not least through parliamentary committees in the United Kingdom.</p><p>  Finally, the coalition notices the Department of Finance has noted the leading grouping on policy-making in this area is the OECD.  The coalition very much advocates that this should be within the United Nations system because global south governments do not have a voice in the rich club of OECD nations.  This also should be addressed and should be a matter of concern to this joint committee.  To move on from the tax issue, I hope there will be a different hearing on that theme, which we would greatly appreciate.  Moreover, in response to Senator Norris, we will follow up by suggesting groups and individuals who could appear before the committee in that regard.</p><p>  As for the further issues raised by Deputy Durkan regarding debt, the private sector contributions to the debt relief schemes have been much smaller.  Moreover, some of them have been in commitment form and have not been delivered upon.  The problem with the heavily indebted poor countries debt relief scheme is that it was voluntary for the private sector to participate and, consequently, has proven to be a disappointment in that regard.</p></speech>

We acknowledge this is a risk but our starting point must be that at present, there is no due diligence or holding to account of the lender.  In situations of debt crisis, it is the people of countries of the global south, as well as the people of Europe nowadays, who are left holding the can.  Until the international community comes together and establishes a fair and just debt workout system, we will continue to be left with that problem.</p></speech>

Why must the poorer countries resort to such a level of lending?  For instance, what other conventional routes were accessible or have been avoided?  Why are they going in that direction?

I refer to the loss of tax revenue through massive tax evasion and avoidance, the failure of official development assistance, ODA, flows.  In addition, poor industrial policies and other major obstacles such as unjust trade rules and coping with mitigation of and adaptation to climate change mean the debt problem is just one part of a much wider picture regarding the economic expectation of global south countries and this is what is leaving them so debt-dependent.</p><p>  Finally, in respect of Deputy Durkan's points on the ODA budget, we firmly believe the cuts to the ODA budget have been disproportionate and this means that Ireland's austerity programme has hit some of the most impoverished people in the world in a disproportionate manner.  As the ODA budget is based on a percentage of gross national income, GNI, it does not mean that when countries in the global north are going through hard times, this automatically is the soft target.  The ODA spending obligations have been a commitment of long standing since the 1970s.  In addition, from the perspective of enlightened self-interest, Ireland has punched above its weight in having a voice in international fora on global development and with these consistent cuts to the ODA budget, that has been weakened.</p></speech>

I must admit at the outset that economics is my weakest point.  However, I take particular note because I am a member of the Labour Party, which is the junior coalition partner in government, and because many challenging points have been raised that effectively are criticisms or requests for the Government to do more or to do something it is not doing.  While I have never addressed many of these issues previously, it is of interest that this joint committee is a loyal advocate of the policies of Irish Aid.  In fact, some people think this committee in the past has been more concerned about Irish Aid than any other foreign affairs issue.  The witnesses bring to members' attention the fact that they are critical of Ireland's support for the International Finance Corporation, IFC, projects.  Interestingly, it appears from the paper submitted that these projects are supported through Irish Aid.  If the coalition's paper goes on to tell members what is going on in Honduras, including everything from forced evictions to kidnappings and killings of farmers, and that somehow or other, Ireland is complicit by virtue of Irish Aid supporting this development capital, then it raises serious questions.  Unfortunately, however, the experts are not present today to answer for the joint committee but it is a matter to which I am keen to elicit a response.  It is a very serious allegation or set of statistics or facts in that heretofore, members would never have dreamed that Irish Aid could in any way be complicit in such an area of deprivation, crime and torture.  I understand the palm oil companies are evicting farmers or whatever and presumably, there is huge conflict in this regard.  Consequently, I thank the witnesses for bringing this matter to the joint committee's attention.</p><p>  I am feeling rather defensive because I do not know a huge amount about the workings of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development except that Ireland is a member and therefore, is a member of an exclusive but apparently talented organisation.  Am I correct to imply the witnesses have suggested that Ireland should not use the offices of the OECD but instead should be using the offices of the United Nations?  I do not know at what stage the United Nations is at in engaging in the question of tax justice but I am aware that Ireland is particularly concerned and clearly highly embarrassed by allegations, not least of which emanate from the United States of America.  I believe my colleague, Deputy Durkan, has personal experience of a wealthy man from somewhere in Africa I believe-----</p></speech>

While Ms O'Neill mentioned the practice in Tanzania, we discovered corruption in Uganda whereby &euro;3 million of Irish taxpayers' money, that is, Irish Aid money, was being diverted, as well as a further &euro;3 million each from two other countries.  In other words, &euro;9 million was being diverted.  We praised ourselves for having built within that governmental structure the office of Comptroller and Auditor General and for raising its level of competency to the point at which that office itself was able to notice there had been fraud.</p><p>  On the OECD, I can perceive no reason whereby Ireland would not or should not engage in a co-operative approach to what clearly is an international problem.  Stateless companies are something that are relatively new.  Until the recent past, I certainly had never heard of companies that are affiliated to no state and which are making vast profits but are not distributing them or paying taxes on them.  Tanzania was mentioned, which is one of Ireland's programme countries.  It is a pity that Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan is not present because the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA, of which I believe she is the chairperson of the Irish section, has a collaborative relationship with Tanzania.  If Tanzania is looking at financial outflows from that country relating to taxation and if we are concerned about it from a governmental or an Irish Aid position, then it is worth trying to develop this collaboration.</p> <p> Nobody can pretend to protect these companies which make vast profits and use Ireland as a base through which to flush their profits.  Coca Cola is probably one of the longest regarded companies that has flushed its profits through Ireland and repatriated them to America without paying taxes.  We, collectively, can be very supportive of abolishing countries' debts.  It is very easy for us to say that but we at this committee are very conscious of incredible abuses and corruption throughout many of these indebted countries that are indebted.  They have corrupt politicians and governments and there is an inability to collect taxes from the national base.  The moral hazard question is at what stage does one exonerate these countries for creating policies that have created misery for their people?  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

To answer his first comment about Irish Aid and the IFC, we have met Irish Aid and I had an interesting meeting about the International Finance Corporation and they are very aware of this particular case.  There is no direct Irish investment in this corporation but our point is that if we are investing in the IFC generally, we cannot ignore the wider policies and practices.  Irish Aid may even be supportive of the fact that we have not yet raised our voice as a country.  Ireland has not yet articulated clearly our concerns about this specific case.</p></speech>

We are very clear about that.  It is more in regard to our wider engagement with the World Bank, as members of the of the World Bank, and as supporters more broadly of the IFC in terms of different projects; we believe that we need to raise our voices as being very concerned about this particular case.  We would appreciate the committee following up on that.</p><p>  Regarding the OECD versus the United Nations, the reason we are concerned about the focus on the OECD is that it only represents the interests of its member countries which are the rich, wealthy, developed countries of the global north.  Therefore, it excludes the interests and voices of southern countries.  There is a UN tax forum where these issues are being discussed.  We acknowledge that at the OECD there is positive progress on the international tax agenda, but how do the countries outside of the OECD that are impacted by it engage in that?  We ask that the Government would support the UN tax committee.  That is one area that the Government could look at.  How are those southern countries, and, as the Deputy said, in particular our partner countries, supported and what is happening in our programme countries in regard to this area?  This is a matter we would like the committee to follow up on.  I will pass over to Ms Nessa N&iacute; Chasaide to respond to the rest of the questions.</p></speech>

Certainly arguing for debt cancellation for global southern countries is not seeking to let governments that have engaged in corruption off the hook in any way.  What we are pointing out is that it is a two-sided coin.  There can be a lack of due diligence and even corruption on the lending side as well.  That needs to be looked at in regard to creating international responsible financing rules in terms of lending and borrowing.</p><p>  On the smaller point relating to the fact that the Debt and Development Coalition is funded by Irish Aid, that does not impact in any shape or form on the independence of our policy position.</p></speech>

The figures on the level of debt in their presentation are staggering.  I note in 2012 the level of debt in global southern countries had increased by US$400 million.  For what level of debt cancellation or debt reduction is their organisation advocating?  I note that US$110 billion worth of debt has been cancelled.  What sort of figure would make an impact in these countries?</p><p>  Regarding the human rights abuses in Honduras, which are very disturbing and worrying when we consider the IFC involvement as an arm of the World Bank, Ms O'Neill mentioned that up to 92 people have been killed.  Have any people been brought to justice for those killings?  Are they unsolved murders, as we speak?  If they are, there is a serious human rights issue there that needs to be pursued at international level?</p><p>  On the issue of tax transparency, I will not go back over the ground that has been covered but this is a major international issue.  It is not something Ireland on its own will solve.  As a country we are not going to put ourselves at a disadvantage over our competitors by doing something in isolation.  It needs to be addressed at European level and internationally.  It is very much on the agenda at European level.  Hopefully, we will see some levelling of the playing field into the future because the figures mentioned of capital outflows of between &euro;660 billion and &euro;870 billion of revenue loss in those countries is worrying and that is unjust and unfair.</p></speech>

Senator Mullins is right about that.  That is why we are very keen that the UN is involved as an actor as well as the OECD as it excludes a number of countries in the global south.  It is an international issue.  I will pass over to Ms Nessa N&iacute; Chasaide to comment on the issue of the levels of debt.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.285" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nessa N&iacute; Chasaide" time="12:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014040100008#G01200"><p>There is no easy answer to the question on the levels of debt.  We are guided by civil society groups on the ground in the countries in question for their analysis and judgment on this because there are two levels of concerns.  There is concern around unsustainable or unpayable debts in certain countries but also concern about what we would call illegitimate debts, or unjust debts, which have been contracted on a dubious basis.  For example, in the case of Granada, which my colleague Ms M&oacute;rina O'Neill raised, it has been identified in recent research that at least between 50% to 67% of its sovereign debt is required to be written down if it is to get back on a sustainable debt footing.  We would view that as a conservative estimate.</p><p>  In terms of the IFC case and whether there has been justice in relation to the killings that have occurred, the groups on the ground who are advocating on this issue, would be say the answer to that question is "No".  Part of this is due to the fact that there seems to be an extremely opaque relationship between the government, the corporation in question, security firms that are hired by the corporation and the local police.  It is an extremely opaque situation and one which the Dinant corporation needs to clarify in respect of  its involvement with a range of actors in the region in which it is working.</p><p>  On the international tax issue, we acknowledge this is a multilateral problem, not least because of the criticism Ireland is experiencing internationally on this question, and that provides more of a basis for the need for proactive action at a national level.  That is why we do not see any reason our Minister for Finance does not more actively support greater financial transparency of multinational companies operating out of Ireland.</p></speech>

These are important issues.  I am not sure whether the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be attending next week's World Bank meeting but we will also raise issues in that regard.

I thank my colleagues in the Child and Family Agency and the representatives of Barnardos, the Children's Rights Alliance, Focus Ireland and EPIC, all of whom are present to contribute to the debate.</p><p>  The provision of an appropriate aftercare service has been highlighted as a key element in achieving positive outcomes for young people leaving care.  It is essential that all young people leaving care be provided with the type of transitional support that their individual circumstances require.  While aftercare has been in existence for many years, the agency's national aftercare policy, operational since 2011, has improved the standard and consistency of aftercare planning and service delivery.</p><p>  The vast majority of children in care live in foster care.  Many of these young people remain living with their foster carers after they reach the age of 18.  The agency advises that, at the end of December last year, 1,163 young people were in receipt of an aftercare service.  Of those aged between 18 and 20, inclusive, some 55% were in full-time education.  There were 639 young people in aftercare who were supported financially by the agency to remain living with their foster carers.  These young people did not have to face the transition associated with leaving their foster carers at 18 and they received the main support from their carers with additional input from an aftercare worker.  One hundred and ten young people were in a range of supported living arrangements, from supported lodgings and living with an assessed and vetted adult in a domestic setting to semi-independent flats with access to an aftercare key worker.  </p><p>  The most vulnerable group of children, however, comprises those living in residential care for short-term foster care placements.  Children who come late into care, in their mid- to late teens,  might not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that would help them to achieve good outcomes.  It is essential that these children have the opportunity to develop a relationship with a dedicated aftercare worker who will work with them to identify their needs and ensure services are in place to help to provide them with the stability and support they need.  These are the children who are most vulnerable to homelessness as young care leavers.</p><p>  Ideally, aftercare services should provide the range and continuum of services to assist with the varying needs of young people leaving care to enable them to achieve a successful transition from the care environment to independent adult life in the community.  A key factor in providing appropriate aftercare comprises the assessment and care planning that should take place in consultation with the young person and key individuals in the period coming up to the end of the legal care relationship between the State and the child.  The transition period presents serious challenges to young people and agency staff alike, as the young adults encounter all the usual developmental issues associated with leaving home, in many cases without the security of a stable background for support and having been affected by early failures of attachment.  Some young people, on leaving care, declare themselves independent of State services and are reluctant to engage further with such services.  This in itself presents a particular challenge to service providers.  </p><p>  Aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance and practical support.  An individual needs assessment identifies where the young person will live, his education or training requirements and the financial and social network supports that are needed.  One of the key features of an aftercare worker's role is to advocate on behalf of young people and promote their development, as fulfilled adults, in their community and, when necessary, link them to the appropriate services.</p><p>  Under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 and the Child Care Act 1991, the Child and Family Agency has a statutory duty to promote the welfare of children up to the age of 18 years who are not receiving adequate care and protection.</p> <p>The Child Care Act 1991 provides that, where necessary, the agency may take the child into care either on a voluntary basis or by applying to the court for a care order.</p><p> Section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991 provides that the agency may assist a child leaving its care if it is satisfied that the person has a need for assistance.  The provisions have been interpreted and applied on the basis that young people who have a care history with the agency are entitled to an assessment of need, from which an aftercare plan may be prepared and an aftercare service may be offered, based on assessed need.  The legislation provides that the core eligible age range for aftercare is from 18 years to 21 years.  This can be extended until the completion of a course of education and training in which a young person who has left care, or is leaving care, is engaged.</p><p> Last year, the Minister decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare to respond to past concerns that there was insufficient focus in the area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.  The approach adopted is to impose a statutory duty on the agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person.  The aim is to create an explicit, as opposed to implicit, statement of the agency&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports.  The approach also clarifies the children eligible for an aftercare plan and promotes a broader approach than was the case previously or found in practice. </p><p> The draft provisions also clarify the range of agencies providing relevant services with which the agency will co-operate in the development of the plan.  The prioritisation of services for young people receiving aftercare is considered in the context of the statutory and administrative criteria and rules relating to State provision of services and the requirement of all State bodies to provide services in accordance with resources available to them.  The agency and officials of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs intend exploring these matters further with the relevant Departments and agencies on a bilateral basis as we continue to support the improvement of aftercare for this vulnerable cohort of children and young people.</p><p> The provisions in the draft Bill provide for an explicit requirement to prepare an aftercare plan in respect of a specified cohort of children and young people as they transition from State care.  The scheme attempts to take account of the need for a degree of nuance in planning for leaving care for young people at a time that is appropriate and sensitive to their particular needs.  At the same time, the intention is to ensure that the preparations take place in good time to allow a young person to participate in the preparations, to ensure the young person can prepare him- or herself for changes that may be occurring, and to ensure that the necessary supports can be identified and, subject to availability, put in place.  The intention is to make the transition as seamless as possible at a time when young people can be particularly vulnerable.  All of these provisions are to be effected by way of amendment to section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991.</p><p> The provisions will create an absolute obligation on the agency to implement a national standardised structure for aftercare planning, assessment and provision.  While operationally the agency has been moving significantly in that direction, a point on which Mr. McBride will elaborate in respect of the progress of the agency, this provision clarifies and copperfastens the requirement for an aftercare plan.  It puts such planning on the same footing as other statutory obligations on the agency.  It guarantees the progress made to date will continue.</p><p> It is worth saying that the precursor of the agency, the HSE, developed aftercare plans and provided an aftercare service over many years.  It provided resources to support young people in education and training, with accommodation and emotional and social support.  However, reasonable criticisms were made that there were inconsistencies in how aftercare was provided and some confusion about who was eligible.  This proposed legislation will now clarify and broaden the criteria of children who become eligible for an aftercare plan.  In particular, it allows for young people who may wish to disengage with the agency at 17 or 18 years to reopen discussions in the future about the aftercare planning process.  The aftercare planning process is a natural extension of the care planning process and it is a step necessary to ensure that the challenges of the transition to independent adulthood are recognised fully by way of an assessment for aftercare and that the plan put in place is appropriate for each individual young person&rsquo;s needs.  </p><p> Finally, many young people and their foster carers assume that aftercare will be provided by the foster family with which they continue to reside.  In these instances, it is the foster carers who provide the emotional and social support of aftercare, while the agency plays a supportive role.</p></speech>

In this statement, we wish to cover three main areas - progress in the development of aftercare services to date, information on current levels of service activity, and comments on specific aspects of the heads of the aftercare Bill.  I am joined by my colleague Ms Siobhan Mugan, national policy development manager for alternative care.</p><p>  On the progress of the development of aftercare services to date, I am pleased to say they are a key priority in the Child and Family Agency's business plan for 2014.  The agency is committed to further improving and developing aftercare services and building on the commitments of the national leaving and aftercare policy, which was issued in 2011.  The aim of this programme is to standardise the delivery of leaving and aftercare services across the country so that every young person who is eligible will be provided with services to meet his or her assessed and identified needs.  In order achieve this, the work will be underpinned by inter-agency co-operation in the following areas.  There will be standardisation and equity of service in accordance with assessed need, workforce development, the development of positive outcomes and outcome measures for young care leavers, and timely and accessible information.  This will ensure resources are deployed to maximum effect and that a consistent service is provided in partnership with other statutory and non-statutory agencies.</p><p>  A number of specific areas of action have been prioritised.  These are the development of a dedicated aftercare service in each of the 17 functional areas of the Child and Family Agency; the standardisation of a range of financial packages to care leavers and care providers such as foster carers; the introduction of aftercare steering committees at local level; and the further development of the Child and Family Website, <i>www.tusla.ie</i>, to include a section dedicated to the provision of information on aftercare services in Ireland. </p><p>  With regard to service activity, the leaving and aftercare services staff complement is currently 44 dedicated whole-time equivalents, with additional services provided through service level agreements with Focus Ireland, Clarecare, Don Bosco and the Simon Community.  While there are vacancies at present, these have been approved for filling, the recruitment process has been concluded, and preferred candidates are now being employed.</p><p>  The following points set out key information relating to service provision.  There are currently 6,490 children in care as of January 2014.  Almost 1,500 young people over 18 years of age are in receipt of an aftercare service, representing 70% of care leavers eligible for a service.  Approximately 45% of these young people remained with their foster carers beyond the age of 18 years, which compares favourably with neighbouring jurisdictions.  Some 60% of care leavers, as of January this year, were in some form of education or training.  This also compares favourably with neighbouring jurisdictions, where my experience is that the figure can be as low as 30%.  The support provided through aftercare can range from advice and support by an allocated worker to a financial package, which may include financial support to foster carers, a living allowance and travel costs.  </p><p>  With regard to the view of the Child and Family Agency on the proposed heads of the aftercare Bill, we welcome the proposed enhancement to the legislation on aftercare services and the agency is committed to supporting young people on leaving care.  In respect of eligibility criteria for the service, under the agency's current national policy the following criteria are applied.  Eighteen to 21 years is the core eligible age range for aftercare services.  The second criterion is that a young person has been in the statutory care of the Child and Family Agency for a minimum period of 12 months on his or her 16th birthday.  The third is that, where a young person is in the statutory care of the Child and Family Agency after the age of 16, he or she must be in care for a minimum period of 12 consecutive months prior to his or her 18th birthday.</p> <p>Aftercare services are available to all those eligible, irrespective of which care sector they have been in - foster care, residential care or high-support.  The length of time for receiving aftercare support is dictated by an ongoing needs assessment, up to 21 years, unless the person is in education, in which case the Child and Family Agency can support until 23 years.  Until the young person reaches the age of 18 years he or she is still considered a minor under the Child Care Act 1991 and any issues pertaining to his or her welfare and risk are matters for the social work child protection and welfare teams.  On occasion, a young person may continue to be in care until his or her 18th birthday, but may reside at his or her family home as part of the aftercare plan.  These young people may remain eligible for aftercare advice and guidance up to the age of 21 years if they meet the above criteria.  We welcome discussion on any proposed changes to these criteria and the implications thereof.</p><p> This section of the Bill does not in the first instance emphasise the importance of the assessment of need and how it relates and links to the level of services required to meet the need.  Although a young person may meet the eligibility criteria, he or she may not, following assessment, require a service.  Therefore we suggest the heads of Bill reflect a logical sequence of assessing the needs of those who are eligible for a service, the development of a multi-agency plan to meet those needs and the commitment of the relevant agencies and services to deliver the plan.</p><p> The Child and Family Agency is tasked with the provision of care and protection to children in the State who are assessed as needing it.  However, to meet a child's needs in full requires a multi-agency response.  The Child and Family Agency has the lead in the area of child protection and welfare but does not have a lead in other domains of the child or young person's life, such as health, education, housing and accommodation and income support.  To meet the holistic needs of the child and young adult, all agencies must work together to ensure that those basic rights to services are met.</p><p> The provision of aftercare services is highly dependant on the co-operation of Departments, the Health Service Executive, HSE, housing authorities, educational institutions and non-statutory agencies in order that the young person's aftercare plan can be fully implemented.  The agency therefore advises that the proposed legislation which provides for the development of a leaving and aftercare plan for every young person who meets the criteria can only be delivered in a system of inter-agency cooperation through the development of robust memorandums of understanding and joint working protocols.  The duties of the heads of Bill all fall to the Child and Family Agency.  There is an opportunity to place a duty to co-operate on the other agencies and services.</p><p> The proposed enhancement of the Child and Family Agency's responsibilities within the heads of Bill is welcome.  The introduction of such legislation will play an important role in increasing the numbers of young people who receive support and assistance on leaving the care system.  The Child and Family Agency is committed to developing the highest possible standards in the provision of these services, work which has already commenced.  The focus is on ensuring young people are prepared and supported in making the transition to adult life through further educational attainment, suitable secure accommodation and the provision of timely therapeutic services by specialist services when required.</p><p> The agency recently published its initial statement of purpose, entitled Ireland's Child and Family Agency: Towards a Shared Purpose.  The aim of this document is to enable a wide-ranging consultation and debate regarding the priorities and key objectives for the agency in the preparation of its first three-year plan, which will be published in the summer of 2014.  We are inviting partners and stakeholders to critique this document to ensure the priorities outlined are the top priorities for Ireland's children.  Consultation with the service providers and, in particular, young people in care and aftercare are and will continue to be an important part of this process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.308" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms June Tinsley" time="17:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014040100005#F00200"><p>We warmly welcome the committee's invitation to discuss the heads of the aftercare Bill.  Barnardos is delighted to be here with colleagues from Action for Aftercare, a coalition made up of a range of organisations and individuals who are concerned about the needs of care leavers.  The group consists of a mix of service providers and advocates.  The main organisations include Barnardos, the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance, Empowering People in Care, EPIC, and Focus Ireland.</p><p>  Individually and collectively we have been lobbying for improvements to aftercare for all care leavers.  Through our experiences of working with care leavers we know that some are particularly vulnerable, and turning 18 can be a time of huge uncertainty and unpreparedness.  Depending on the type and duration of their care experience, they often have a less secure network of family and friends to help them with this transition into adulthood.  That is why the State, as the corporate parent, must ensure that sufficient supports, such as personal or financial supports, are available to them to ease this transition, just as any other parent would.</p><p>  Action for Aftercare has been monitoring and feeding into the policy developments and legislative debates on aftercare in recent years.  Thankfully, some positive strides have been made, including the HSE leaving and aftercare services national policy and procedures document 2011 and more recently the implementation plan to accompany the roll-out of this policy.  The ongoing commitment of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to strengthen entitlement to aftercare is much appreciated.  Despite these advances, however, the provision of services and supports remains inconsistent across the country. </p><p>  Overall, we broadly welcome this Bill and believe it is a significant step forward.  Therefore, to minimise any duplication, we have decided to concentrate on different themes in our presentations.  I will examine the different eligibility criteria being proposed, EPIC will discuss strengthening the assessment process, Children's Rights Alliance will highlight the need for a rights-based approach to the legislation and Focus Ireland will outline the challenges currently facing care leavers. </p><p>  The legislation must synchronise with the HSE leaving and aftercare services national policy and procedures.  There must be common language used in both to ensure that professionals across a range of sectors have a shared understanding.  The HSE policy emphasises the process involved in preparing for leaving care as well as aftercare.  Therefore, the Bill and the regulations flowing from it must also adopt this holistic perspective, based on the idea that preparation is not a once-off event but a process that takes time and commitment.  Allowing for sufficient preparation for leaving care is vital to ensuring an easier transition to independent living for these young people. </p><p>  With regard to head No. 1 of the Bill, Barnardos recommends that the legislation should provide a clear definition of aftercare to ensure that all professionals engaged with young people have the same understanding.  Generally, Barnardos agrees with the definition of "eligible child" and "eligible young person" as proposed in the Bill.  The categories recognise the diverse and inconsistent care patterns that exist for some children.  These definitions are broader than those that apply in the HSE leaving and aftercare services policy and we welcome that.  The policy and legislation need to be synchronised. </p><p>  We would like, however, to make some recommendations to strengthen the eligibility criteria so that it is not too blunt an instrument, thereby excluding those particularly vulnerable young people who do require an aftercare plan and further supports just because they do not fit a clear definition.  First, young people up to the age of 25 are under the remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The forthcoming national children and young people&rsquo;s policy framework will outline actions and supports for all, up to age 25 years.  Barnardos would like to see this age range translated into this legislation, rather than a ceasing of engagement with care leavers at 21.  Extending the age range would mean that young people up to the age of 25 would be entitled to an aftercare plan.  This is also in line with some international standards.</p><p>  Second, from the categories proposed, it is unclear whether those children who are in the care system under section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991 are included in the Bill.  This is particularly relevant for those aged 17 years who would not meet the 12-month criteria yet are often at high risk of continued homelessness.  Third, the Bill does not include those who choose not to engage at 18 and do not present to the agency later.  Instead, it places a duty on these care leavers to present themselves to the agency.</p> <p>Given how vulnerable and disempowered this group of young people can be, Barnardos believes there should be a legal obligation on the agency to attempt to re-engage them after they leave care.  This could include getting aftercare staff to follow up with them at three-month intervals within their first year of leaving care to encourage the young person to re-engage as proposed in the HSE policy.</p><p> Fourth, those young people who have experienced the care system but who end their childhood in detention centres should also be entitled to an aftercare plan.  Finally, it is important that the Bill allow for exceptional circumstances, so that other young people who do not fit the specified eligibility criteria but who have been in care and who in the assessment of the agency require an aftercare plan are entitled to one.  This could include, for example, young people who are adopted following a care placement where this subsequently breaks down.</p><p> Before handing over to my colleagues, I reiterate the broad support of Barnardos for this legislation.  Nevertheless, aspects of it can be improved to ensure it is driven by the desire to meet the needs of care leavers, and we are concerned that in the absence of an effective monitoring framework and increased availability of resources across a range of sectors, a young person&rsquo;s aftercare plan will become a meaningless piece of paper and the individual will fail to make a successful transition to independent living.</p></speech>

As an organisation which works directly with young people in care we are acutely aware of their particular vulnerabilities, especially as they approach 18 and begin their transition to independence.  Approximately 500 young people each year "age out" of the system and move into aftercare.  As we know, all young people need the continuing support of their parents and families to successfully move from childhood to adulthood, even those who grow up in stable, secure, loving environments and are as well equipped as possible to embark on an independent life.  Young people in care are different in this respect as they often do not have the assurance of a safety net of family to turn to when the going gets tough.  Unlike their peers, who often live at home until their mid-20s, they have an accelerated transition to adulthood at 18.  Not only have many of them had traumatic childhoods marked by neglect and instability, but they are more likely to have had multiple moves when in care and more likely to leave care without the confidence, skills and educational qualifications of their peers in the general population.  This puts them at greater risk of unemployment, dependence on social welfare, early parenthood, mental health problems and homelessness.</p><p>  The State, as corporate parent, must take on the responsibility, as any parent would, of ensuring that children and young people are well prepared to successfully make that transition and are supported in doing so in order to achieve positive outcomes after care.  This means that the State should plan for their futures, as all good parents would.  Publication of the heads of the Bill is therefore a welcome first step in the right direction of strengthening aftercare provision.  However, we must go further by including in head 2 a provision for the assessment process in order to inform the preparation of the aftercare plan.  This would ensure legislative provision for the assessment of the needs of each young person and early identification of services and supports required when young people reach the age of 18.</p><p>  Planning for aftercare is a process, as Ms Tinsley has indicated.  It should begin at 16 with an assessment that should be holistic and realistic in looking at the needs of the young person.  It should consider practical skills required to live independently but also the range of social, educational and health needs of the young person.  In doing so it should identify where the young person needs supports or additional preparation and guidance in developing other skills and abilities.  This is incorporated into the leaving care plan, which will aid the preparation of the young person for leaving care and help put in place the resources and services needed when he or she reaches 18.  It is a crucial that this begin at 16, in plenty of time to undertake this work with the young person.  It must be completed at least six months before the young person turns 18 in order to allow time for the person to feel settled and ready for this monumental stage in life.  Many young people have come to EPIC weeks or sometimes days before their 18th birthday with no aftercare plan and no idea where they will leave once they reach 18.</p><p>  The assessment process is necessary to inform the preparation for leaving care plan and ultimately arrive at the development of the aftercare plan.  The aftercare plan cannot be divorced from the context of this ongoing assessment, preparation planning and review process.  It is essential that every effort is made to engage with a young person in the assessment and planning process, and there is a much greater likelihood that when a young person is actively involved in the planning process, he or she will continue to engage with the aftercare worker and services after reaching 18.  Implementation of the aftercare plan is the next phase of the process and should be regularly reviewed and revised as necessary; it should also be monitored to ensure the best possible outcome for the young person.  However, we are concerned that there is no reference to implementation of the aftercare plan specifically in the Bill.  In the absence of any legislative provision in the Bill for implementation, we are concerned that the supports and services required to meet the needs of this vulnerable group of young people, as identified in the aftercare plan, may not be effectively delivered.</p><p>  Having an aftercare plan is no guarantee of receiving an aftercare service.  In concluding I will detail the stories of two young people we have met through our work.  They have had very different experiences of aftercare, which indicates the necessity not only of aftercare supports but also the impact of having stable aftercare accommodation on the long-term outcomes for young people.  Stephen is now aged 25 and has been involved with our service for a number of years.  He was taken into care at 15, having suffered years of emotional and physical abuse at home.  He was placed in residential care because of his age and for the first time in his life he had stability, routine and was supported in going to school on a regular basis.  He did well in school, completed his leaving certificate and expressed a desire to go to college.  He was the first person from his family to go to third level education.  He decided to study law and the HSE referred him to an aftercare service.  When he was 18 he moved into supported accommodation, was provided with financial supports and had his education paid for.  He completed his law degree and then went on to complete his professional legal training and exams.  He qualified as a solicitor last year.  During all this time he had consistent aftercare support, stable accommodation and a regular income.</p><p>  Sarah, on the other hand, was not so fortunate.  She is now 24 and was taken into care when she was eight.  She was in foster care for several years but this did not work out for her.  Subsequently, she had many moves and numerous social workers.  She was in residential care until 16, when she became pregnant.  She had few supports at this time and moved into private rented accommodation with her boyfriend.  After her baby was born her boyfriend was sent to prison and Sarah had no option but to move in with his family.  This did not work out either and she again moved into another apartment.  As she was now over 21 and had not previously engaged with any aftercare services she was not eligible for any aftercare support.  She coped reasonably well for a while but when things became really difficult she asked for her child to be taken into respite care.  She suffered isolation, loneliness and depression, and she found it more and more difficult to cope.  Her child was in and out of care and she could not maintain her home.  Finally, her child was taken into full-time care.  She became reliant on alcohol and drugs, and she is now homeless, living on the streets and struggling to overcome her addiction.  From the age of 16 Sarah had no supports and was unable to access them at a later stage when she needed them.</p><p>  We welcome the improvements and acceptance that there is a responsibility to provide aftercare services after a person reaches 18.  We are heartened that there has been much progress in this area but although we firmly believe the legislation will strengthen aftercare supports for young people, it is vital that legislation be further strengthened to include assessment, as outlined, with reference to implementation thereafter.</p></speech>

We are delighted to have the opportunity to comment on the Bill.  We commend the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and her Department for the leadership demonstrated in this area.  There are two elements of the draft Bill that we wanted to consider from a rights-based perspective.  The picture of what is happening to children and young people in aftercare has been well painted not only by the agency but also by the representatives of Barnardos and EPIC.</p> <p>Focus will highlight issues of homelessness.</p><p> The first area we are keen for the committee to examine is the duty to consult young people on the preparation of aftercare plans.  The draft legislation states the agency is required to consult with the young person where appropriate in the development of the plan.  We suggest deleting the words "where appropriate".  The agency should do everything it can to consult the young person.  The explanatory memorandum recognises that in some cases the young person will not engage with agency staff.  This happens from time to time but a plan should still be drawn up for the young person in these circumstances.  The words "where appropriate" could be misinterpreted.  This has happened in the past where language has been vague.  The best thing to do is to delete it and make it a clear obligation to consult with young people in developing a plan.</p><p> The next area relates to what happens after an assessment.  The Bill strengthens the statutory framework for the preparation of plans, which is very welcome, and there is no doubt that it moves it forward.  It also sets out that the agency will be obliged to interact with various service providers to provide support.  What happens when these other services do not engage or deliver on the plan?  This question has also been asked by EPIC and the Child and Family Agency.  We are concerned about an excellent plan being drawn up but not followed through.  Our suggestion to address this would be to extend care for a very vulnerable group of young people who need extra support.  Mr. McBride mentioned that some young people do not need aftercare services, and we agree with this, but there is another group of approximately 100 very vulnerable young people who still need aftercare support.  We recommend to the committee and the Minister that they examine the Scottish model as possibly the best way forward for this group of very vulnerable young people.  Legislation was passed in February in Scotland extending aftercare for a group of young people.  Such a measure here would potentially extend care for young people between the ages of 18 and 21 years.  It would not have a big impact on the Exchequer because there are only approximately 100 people in the group.  Foster care packages are available to children and young people up to the age of 23.  It is to ensure that a very vulnerable group of young people are not left behind.  In our view, this is the best way to build resilience and independence and ensure they are protected from homelessness, drug addiction and missing out on education.  This is one of the best ways to ensure these young people will follow through and have very good outcomes down the line.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.315" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Allen" time="18:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014040100007#H00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting us to come before it on what is an historic day.  The D&aacute;il has frequently debated the deaths of children in care and those who grew up in care and looked at our sad history in this regard.  To have committee members sitting around looking for the first time at legislation that aims to make the future better is extremely welcome.  It is not only a tribute to the Minister and committee members discussing it, but also to our colleagues in the Child and Family Agency and the Department who have brought it to this stage.</p><p>  Focus Ireland has worked on this issue for more than 15 years because our homeless services repeatedly come across young people, and older people, who are homeless largely as a result of their experience of growing up in care and inadequate follow-on.  It is important to be clear that a large number of young people who grow up in care move into independent adulthood with only the usual issues which affect young people and the difficulties we all face in becoming adults.  We must not stigmatise all those in care, but we need to focus on the substantial number of people who need care and support to proceed into adulthood.  Historically, when we have failed them we have done so extremely badly, and we need to ensure the legislation changes this once and for all.  We will continue to work with the older people who still suffer from the neglect of the past but we must ensure a new generation does not join them.</p><p>  Young people need a range of emotional and physical supports, which my colleagues have discussed.  Before these mean anything, one needs a secure place to live, to call a home, to return to at night and to build one's life around.  It is the risk of homelessness that has brought Focus Ireland to this issue, and that is what I want to address.</p><p>  One aspect of aftercare is the development of life skills.  These need to be built throughout the period of care and specifically from the age of 16.  My colleagues from EPIC have outlined this and we strongly endorse this position.  Equally important is the physical provision of bricks and mortar and a roof over one's head.  As a society we respond to these in two ways.  The first of these is to provide actual homes for people through residential aftercare.  To our knowledge, approximately 80 such housing units are available and approximately half of these are provided by Focus Ireland.  The aftercare lasts approximately six months and involves an aftercare worker who supports the person in moving into the open housing market.</p><p>  The second way, for those who do not get a place in a residential home, is that they must move straight from care into an independent home of their own.  Given the way our social housing has developed, as it was never been designed to support the needs of young people, they will find their homes in the private rented market.  There is no need to tell any constituency Deputy or Senator the difficulties in the private rented market throughout the country.  A professional who has just lost his or her job and needs to provide a home for himself or herself has a nightmare trying to get a decent home to live in.  How much more of a nightmare is it for a young person who does not have life experience?  It has been a nightmare for my children, who are the same age as the young people we are discussing.  For children who grew up in care and do not receive emotional advice or financial support from a parent, the chances of getting things wrong and of things going seriously wrong are absolutely enormous.</p><p>  Focus Ireland has been dealing with this issue for approximately 13 years.  Back then, a number of people we worked with in aftercare or quasi-aftercare positions were homeless.  Over a period of time, all of the agencies involved transformed this situation.  Three years ago - I am picking that time as an example - the organisation was confident that all the young people we were working with had a secure place to stay.  At present, our services in Dublin deal with approximately 100 people.  Of these, ten are experiencing adult life in emergency homeless hostels.  They are homeless.  A further 28 are in unsuitable accommodation and three have returned to their families of origin without any assessment of whether the risk that led to their being taken into care has been resolved.</p><p>  I have been working with Focus Ireland for more than four years.  These circumstances remind me of what I read in the history of the organisation.  I also read in that history the consequences for the young people.  This will not be solved.  I very much endorse what the witnesses from the Child and Family Agency stated.  These are problems that the agency cannot resolve.  It is not its responsibility, as it is not the responsibility of an aftercare worker to change the housing market or reform it.  To some extent it is the responsibility of committee members as elected representatives, but this responsibility was passed on to local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>  The question for us is what can be put into the legislation which triggers the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities to respond more positively to these young people than they do at present and in a way they need.  A young person who knows he or she will leave care cannot regularly or safely get a housing needs assessment from the local authority.  Without this, he or she cannot receive rent supplement on the day he or she turns 18.  That is when he or she must start the process.  An example committee members might take is how the Department of Social Protection amended its basic legislation when it cut the rate of social welfare to young people.</p> <p>That legislation was amended in order that the cut would not apply to young people who had grown up in care.  It is a case in which the primary legislation, affecting one of the key agencies on which these young people rely, was changed.  This change was made by the Department of Social Protection because the Department of Children and Youth Affairs did not exist at the time.  We are requesting the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to seek legal advice on the aspects of primary legislation that affect the key agencies which, as they have indicated, can be changed to ensure a young person who has had an assessment of needs completed can walk into the Department of Education and Skills to access a grant.  We must have the changes in place in order that when they need a home, the local authority official does not send then away because they have a form with the wrong logo and must start the process all over again.  This must not be an assessment of young people who have grown up in care but of what we need to do as a society to help them to move to adulthood.  It is not a mark against them, rather it is mark against us if we fail to deliver.  That must be borne in mind when we develop the legislation.  We must ensure we are not testing young people but ourselves in the process.  Given the number of young people who leave care, it is possible for us to arrange the system such that they are offered the same protection that we afford to our own children.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for their time and hope we will be able to continue the discussion on the legislation before its enactment.</p></speech>

I listened to Ms Gargan outline the contrasting cases of Stephen and Sarah.  One person was able to access supports and availed of marvellous benefits which worked and had significant consequences for them personally.  The other was not able to avail of these supports which had significant financial consequences for them and the State.</p><p>  I compliment the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and her officials for giving this legislation priority.  We need to get it right from day one.  For that reason, it is very beneficial to have the relevant agencies highlighting the deficiencies or areas in which we need to improve.  One of the recommendations made in the report on the independent child death review is that there be a mandatory aftercare provision.  I am slightly worried that we are discussing a plan which is at the draft stage, but there are few references to how it should be implemented.  We know - Mr.<b></b>O'Donohue alluded to the provision in section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991 - that the health board &quot;may&quot; assist, but we must amend this in order that it reads the health board &quot;shall&quot; assist.  We need to ensurechildren in care have an opportunity to feed into the process of change.  More importantly, we need to ensure there will be sufficient resources in place for the effective implementation of the plan.  That is absent from the draft we have before us.</p><p>  The restrictive nature of eligibility for services gives rise to concern.  Sometimes the most vulnerable children are those who are continually in and out of the care system and who have not had the benefit of such services.  We need to broaden the scope to ensure these children are able to avail of aftercare services.  One of the speakers alluded to the experience of those who passed through the care system.  Some come through it relatively strongly and unscathed and may not need the supports of an aftercare service, but others are in greater need of such services.  This issue is not addressed in the proposed legislation.</p><p>  Inter-agency co-operation is critical.  Various reports have identified the lack of co-operation between agencies which has led to some of the dire situations that have arisen.  We need to ensure in legislation that we will have a robust strategy and protocols to ensure other agencies, be it the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills or the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, will adhere to the requirements set out in the aftercare plan.  A plan is all very fine, but if it is not executed, it will go nowhere.  We need to take cognisance of this.  </p><p>  I would like to see the regulations being published in tandem with the legislation in order that we will know exactly what we are talking about.  In the absence of published regulations, we are talking in a vacuum.  We need clarity and information.</p><p>  The points made about the plan are valid.  The need for it to be completed six months in advance to ensure children will have a sense of security when they reach their 18th birthday.  I honestly think it is a worthwhile exercise for the various stakeholders to give their opinions based on first-hand knowledge of how they have been dealing with the issue and it will not work unless the Minister and her departmental officials take on board the suggestions that have been made.</p><p>  I apologise, but I must leave before the end of the meeting as I have another engagement, but that is no reflection on the contributions made.</p></speech>

As an Opposition Deputy who has on several occasions complimented the first Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I happily do so again.  I also compliment each and every delegate in his or her respective role and, in particular, the NGOs on their persistent pursuit of this legislative change.  I also include Members, Government or Opposition voices, who have also played a part in helping to bring us to this point.</p><p>  I refer to a point raised in Focus Ireland's presentation where it contrasts the expectations for its clients three years ago with the outcomes for its current cohort.  It is a significant worry.  We can have all the assessments and aftercare plans we like, but implementation is critical.  This is also reflected in the presentation made by EPIC.  Implementation of aftercare plans is absolutely essential.</p> <p>That in some way needs to be a clearly stated objective of this exercise.  We need not only the preparation of aftercare plans but their implementation and the pursuit of that.  The phrase &quot;the State is the acting parent&quot; is used somewhere else.  That is it exactly and it should act as any of us as parents would act for our children in the same situation at that delicate and important point, that transitional period in life from moving from being a child and young person to adulthood and all the challenges that brings.</p><p> Many of the  presentations dealt with child health, education, housing and income support, although I am referring in that respect to the Child and Family Agency presentation.  The EPIC presentation was the only one that dealt with unemployment, which is the issue of jobs.  I do not for a moment want to create a hierarchy of housing as absolutely essential but with respect to the importance of the dignity of work, what is does for an individual's fulfilment in life, filling one's day and giving one purpose, it was interesting that the representative from EPIC in her presentation put that first.  She said, &quot;This puts them at greater risk of unemployment, dependence on social welfare, early parenthood, mental health problems and homelessness&quot;.  Jobs are integral to all of this.  I emphasise that I am not suggesting for a moment that one element is more important than the other.  It is a package.  That reflects, and this comes across in the presentation by the representative from EPIC, the need to create an holistic approach, and I refer here to all agencies.  That is also referred to in the presentation by the representative form the Child and Family Agency.  He spoke about the development of a multi-agency plan.  That is essential and to the exclusion of no Department or agency.  They all have a contribution to make to this and it has to work but it can only work if there is a coming together.   </p><p> It is difficult to find specific questions and these are only points on which I wanted to reflect.  The point Ms Tanya Ward from the Children's Rights Alliance made about voluntarily continuing in-care after the period of time is interesting.  This model of extended care has been adopted in Scotland.  We need to inform ourselves more about what that can do.  I would say, as a parent, I know about that and one could call it a voluntary extension of care.  I have five children.  I was long gone from my home and working and standing on my feet when I consider the age of some of my older children.  The are in dependency today and that is the truth of it for many families across our society today.  If we as natural birth parents are doing that for our children, why would the State not do the same for children in its care, as the surrogate parent in this instance?  We have to reflect the reality that we all know in this world today.  I agree with that point.</p><p> I concur with the two points made by the representative from Barnardos regarding those who do not opt for aftercare and having an obligation to continue to engage.  It could happen that after a short period of time one could have the realisation that &quot;I've made a call here; I do need the help&quot;.  We should not have strict criteria that closes a door on a young person at that time in his or her life when he or she needs help.  Re-engagement and continuing engagement and leaving the door open is very important.  The same applies to the point regarding the period of 12 months, consequently or cumulatively, and while is very much within the legislation we need there to be flexibility.  We are dealing with young people.  I would like that we would have the same flexibility that we all have to expect at times in our own relationships and engagement with others.  I would be concerned about the very strict criteria for consideration for eligibility.  We need something much more pliant modelled on need and need as it presents.</p><p> I address my final comments to the representatives from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs regarding the Department's view as to when the consultation process and preparation should commence.  Different views have been expressed in that it should commence at age 16 or 17.  I think the representative from EPIC said it should be at age 16.  How does the Department views that matter?  When should this process begin?  The representative from the Department in his presentation stated it should begin in the period coming up to the end of the legal care relationship and he went on to say that the preparations should take place in good time.  Could the delegate quantify that to give us to give a sense of it?  The representative also stated:<blockquote>The legislation provides that the core eligible age range for aftercare is from 18 to 21 years.  This can be extended until the completion of a course of education and training in which a young person who has left care, or is leaving care, is engaged.</blockquote>I believe it must be a little more than just education and training.  That is reflected in the contributions of the NGO sector, with which I am at one.  If we do not adopt the most flexible, embracing and inclusive approach, we will lose a wonderful opportunity to do something really worthwhile.  Given my years serving as a Member of his Oireachtas I would like that this would be a part of something on which I could look back with satisfaction.</p></speech>

It is a very welcome day that we are sitting here looking at the general scheme of the aftercare Bill.  The action for aftercare groups can be assured of my support.  They presented us with very moderate proposals.  What they are asking for is fair and I would be supportive of their proposals.  We must ensure that the Bill does what we all intend it to do.  We must remember the horror and that feeling we had when we were looking at the child death report and channel that into the aftercare Bill that will come before us.</p><p>  My difficulty is, and I will ask the Department to clarify this, that the Bill reads that there is a statutory duty to provide an aftercare plan but there is no statutory entitlement to aftercare .  That is a huge difficulty because we all know that resource constrains will inevitably dictate the scope of implementation in practice, but surely there should be some minimum standards that can be expected.  As Ms June Tinsley from Barnardos said, we do not want a meaningless piece of paper.  When trying to build trust with young people where a system, a family or somebody has failed them and we are presenting them with a plan it would be a case of then saying that while there is an ideal it will not be possible to implement to that level but that we could negotiate.</p><p>  Mr. McBride from the Child and Family Agency spoke about the responsibilities outside the Child and Family Agency.  Again we saw that in the child death report with regard to number of agencies involved in a child's life.  How do we ensure their co-operation?  Is that something we should be examining in the Bill?  One of the areas I am concerned about is the reality that many children in care can commit crime and many coming out detention need care and protection.  Both cohorts of children and young people exhibit similar recurring issues.  They fall on one side of the line or another.  This cohort of young people falls into the criminal justice system or into the health system and sometimes it is down to chance in terms of where they are living.  Geographical circumstances could push them because it comes down to which professional is dealing with the young person concerned.  I wonder if, in the legislation, we can also examine empowering the professionals who work with these people in the agencies to take decisions.</p> <p>Too often, cases must go through many layers of bureaucracy.  The professionals would work within constraints, of course.  I do not expect them to get some kind of credit card that can be spent endlessly.  In a case involving a separated child, however, a professional needed to go through five layers of management to get one night's emergency accommodation.  When dealing with young people, we must rebuild trust by showing that our State cares and will deliver for them.</p><p> The young persons' probation division is only meant to deal with 12 to 18 year olds, but it has a policy of dealing with some people of up to 21 years of age.  Given the fact that some parts of the State already do this, there is scope for an extension.</p><p> The question of eligibility needs grounds must be examined.  No professional interest wants the legislation to limit it to dealing with persons who are no older than 17 years and 364 days.  That is no one's intention, but I would hate to learn that the legislation had inserted an eligibility criterion that excluded young people.  We must consider the flexibility proposed by the Children's Rights Alliance.</p><p> It is important to consult young people.  Inserting qualifiers to this would not be appropriate.</p><p> One question that will be asked is why aftercare should receive investment.  There are many demands on children's services.  Putting on my devil's advocate hat, what short and long-term benefits do we get from aftercare?  There are benefits for individuals, but why should we not invest that money elsewhere in the agency's services?  Is aftercare critical or should the Child and Family Agency focus on the youngest cohort?  I support aftercare, but we must make choices.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.325" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1093" speakername="Ciara Conway" time="18:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014040100010#L00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their excellent presentations.  Many of the questions I wanted to raise have been asked, so I will not repeat them, but I will tease out details of some of the agency's practices.  Policy development is Ms Mugan's area.  Some aftercare services are already being provided, albeit hit and miss, but what practices will change after the legislation has passed?  How can we ensure better outcomes for young people?  Many people have campaigned for this legislation for a long time.</p><p>  I am probably right in saying that the majority of children in care have successful foster placements and remain with those families until they are 21, 22 or 23 years of age.  Is there scope in the Bill to give such children a status?  I know of many cases involving 21 year olds and 23 year olds whose foster parents view them as their own children.  However, foster parents are not allowed to leave more than &euro;26,000 to their foster children in their wills.  I know of foster parents who never spent a cent of their foster care allowances.  Instead, they saved that money to buy their foster children properties, but they are not allowed to sign them over as intended.  Following the children's rights referendum, we have it within our gift to ensure that children who were not eligible for adoption previously can now be adopted.  In the eyes of the law, however, persons who are over 18 years of age and whose foster parents and foster brothers and sisters view them as their own children and siblings, respectively, are treated differently.  I would love to be able to do something about that situation.</p><p>  What supports do we provide to foster carers?  The best outcome for young people is a stable relationship.  This Bill should make a difference to the supports available to foster carers so as to ensure stable early placements for children.  Children aged between eight and 11 years begin exhibiting difficult behaviours regardless of whether they are in care.  A book on the subject - I cannot remember by whom - points out that, whereas a child in care who kicks or slams a door is interpreted as having anger or defiance issues, a parent's own seven or eight year old at home is defined as being a moody little so-and-so.  We need to support foster parents to ensure that children who are in care have good outcomes.  Aftercare would allow them to remain part of those families.</p><p>  A minority do not have good outcomes.  The children most at risk of dying are those who are difficult to engage.  If we put in place barriers such as a six-month period and a person who is six months under 21 or 23 years of age - whichever it is - knocks on a carer's door after that time has lapsed, it would be a real indictment of our services if that young person could not be helped.  We should be able to provide help.  This is what people in the service want.  People whom I worked with ten or 12 years ago still ask me for this, that or the other.</p><p>  There are examples of good practice; it is not all bad.  I have worked closely with many survivors of institutional abuse.  The local authorities in Waterford were wonderful in helping the survivors with their housing needs.  One criterion is that a person must be from the area.  While a particular survivor may have been raised in Artane or Galway, he or she may originally be from Waterford.  Survivors do not need to go through the ins and outs of it all with the staff or be humiliated or abused again through the retelling of their stories.  This type of understanding is something that local authorities must work towards when dealing with children who are exiting care.  Children who are from Waterford could be placed in Kildare or Dublin.</p></speech>

I agree with my colleagues that it is refreshing to discuss something that is positive.  The aspirations behind this legislation are worthy, which is why it is welcome, but what changes to the agency's processes and practices are envisaged, what resources will be put in place and by how much will the budget increase to meet the needs of this small cohort of 80 to 100 people?</p><p>  As Deputy Conway mentioned, the majority of people in care go on to live in their family homes.  Foster parents do not decide that children are no longer theirs or they do not love them when they reach 18 years of age.  However, the small cohort who are not in that situation - the most vulnerable and the most disengaged - need these resources.  We must put our money where our mouth is.</p><p>  Regarding the term "where appropriate", Ms Ward could not have said it any better.  It is appropriate in every single case to engage with the child or young person in respect of whom the plan is being prepared.</p> <p>There is no need for the words "where appropriate".  Inclusion of them gives the lie to there being a loophole which would mean we need not talk to them.  We need to talk to the children and young adults in each case.  I concur that these words should be removed from that head of the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.328" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/981" speakername="Sandra McLellan" time="18:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014040100011#M00200"><p>I thank the delegations for their presentations and commend them on the work they do.  I also commend the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, on her positive work in this instance.</p><p>  Reference was made in the Barnardos presentation to the people who are hard to reach.  How do the agencies interact with such people?  On the Focus Ireland presentation, what hits home is the point with regard to young people coming to the agency shortly before reaching their 18th birthday wanting to know where they will live when they leave the system.  We should be ashamed of ourselves that 18 year olds are ready to leave the system and have no homes to go to.  </p><p>  I am glad Deputy Conway's interaction with local authorities has been positive.  My experience has been the opposite.  I know of people who have gone through the care system, some of whom had been living on the streets, who found it extremely difficult to get on any housing list because they needed ties to a community, which they did not have.  In one case, the person had lived for four years in a community but that was not good enough.  While I have tabled a number of parliamentary questions on the issue the response has always been that this is a matter for each local authority.  I would like to see this change to the effect that each local authority address particular issues, in particular, people who have come through care homes, those released from prison and so on.  The thinking appears to be that these people may be problematic or suffer from mental health issues and as such local authorities do not want them in their areas.  I am being brutally honest.  That has been my experience.  I feel so sorry for those people who cannot get the help they require.  </p><p>  I am visited at my clinics by older people with mental health issues, as, I am sure, are other representatives.  While I agree with the eligibility criteria set out, there are people in their 30s who need help and assistance.  I accept that this matter may be outside of the remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  However, these people still need help, often owing to their experiences as children when in care or foster homes.  It is hard to set particular criteria in this area because people have differing needs.   </p><p>  It was stated that there are 44 aftercare staff.  Who will carry out the assessments in respect of the 16 to 18 year olds?  Will this be the responsibility of the aftercare service staff or social workers?  I hope it will not be the aftercare staff because they already have too much to cope with.  I have come across cases which social workers have tried to close because they were too busy, even though the parents involved did not agree.  I have brought this matter to the attention of the Minister.  I would welcome a response to the questions I have raised.</p></speech>

I am glad that the issue of eligibility was picked up on by committee members.  The eligibility outlined in the legislation is a more inclusive eligibility than is set out in the guidelines.  While we welcome this, we still think it should go further.  I accept the points made in regard to the need to make allowances for people in exceptional need.  The point in regard to children in detention is crucial.</p><p>  On Deputy McLellan's question in regard to who will carry out the assessments, which will probably be responded to in more detail later by representatives of the agency, it is worth mentioning that huge progress has been made in terms of the number of young people in receipt of after care.  One of the concerns of all of the organisations present today is the significantly increased caseload of after care work.  When dealing with the hard to reach people or those with intensive needs, a caseload of 25 becomes a tick box exercise.  We have already put our case on this issue.  On why resources should be put into this area, starting from a rights-based point of view young people have a right to support.  We have a deep understanding in our society about the transition from childhood to adulthood.  We understand this process well.  As stated by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, this period of transition in a modern society is longer than it has been historically.  I am loathe to make these arguments but it is necessary to say that there are financial benefits to this also, not only in terms of the people concerned being able to work and make a contribution to society but in terms of their potential cost to society if we fail them.  I do not believe this is what should motivate us but as it is what motivates some people it is important to mention it.  </p><p>  In regard to whether the agency should put its resources into a young person who is six months old versus a young person who is 19 years old that is a difficult question to answer.  Currently, there is a great deal of legislation around children.  This directs resources in this area.  To some extent the legislation levels that playing pitch in that it states that right through the period of transition there is a legal provision on which we need to focus.  We welcome this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.330" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tanya Ward" time="18:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014040100011#M00400"><p>I echo Mr Allen's remarks around preventative support and why we need it.  There is an economic argument to be made in that apart from changing the life chances of the young people involved, it costs approximately &euro;100,000 per annum to imprison a person who becomes involved in crime and the cost of providing rehabilitative care for a person who becomes addicted to drugs is very high.  There are people with high level needs who go on to become parents.  These needs impact on their ability to be parents.  The vast majority of people who have gone through the care system will go on to be outstanding parents but some of them need additional support and help.  As such, a lack of preventative support will impact on generations of children to come.  The cost in this regard to the Exchequer will not be that high.  Currently, approximately 100 people annually require this specialised support from the agency and other services.</p><p>  Deputy Conway referred to young people in foster care and issues around succession.  These issues can best be dealt with in the children and family relationships Bill which is currently being drafted.  There are some good proposals in that Bill that will radically transform family law in Ireland.  For example, one third of children currently in foster care are in voluntary care.  There is a provision in that Bill which states that foster parents may be granted custody of children who have been in a voluntary arrangement for more than 12 months.  This is incredibly important for the children and young people involved.  There is no reason the succession issue cannot be dealt with in that legislation.</p><p>  The situation in regard to the referendum result is unfortunate.  The number of people contacting the Children's Right Alliance asking what impact the referendum result will have on their child and so on is remarkable.  We have had to inform these people that  the referendum result has been held up by a challenge to it in the Supreme Court.</p> <p>If the Supreme Court allows the referendum result to be certified, there will be a chance for those foster children.  There are hundreds of foster children waiting to be adopted and it is sad for many of these because the clock is ticking and they are close to reaching 18.  They are missing out on being adopted because the referendum result is being challenged in the Supreme Court.</p><p> I thank the members for their comments and echo the contribution of Deputy Regina Doherty regarding the importance of the voice of the child.  We should remind ourselves that a key finding of the Shannon and Gibbons child deaths report was the absence of the voice of children and young people in cases.  Records maintenance was patchy for a range of reasons and the voice of the young person was often absent.  We must remember to include a duty to consult with a young person in every possible way.</p></speech>

There was the question of who will do the assessments, and the agency will probably provide an answer.  The aftercare worker will do the assessment but the young person cannot be referred to an aftercare worker if he or she does not have a social worker.  In some instances we are aware that is the case.  It is the responsibility of the social worker to develop the aftercare plan and ensure it is put in place.  There is sometimes a catch-22 as one cannot get an aftercare worker without a social worker.  There are waiting lists in some areas for aftercare workers, which can also be an issue.  Young people have spoken to us about how they feel rushed, ill-prepared and stressed out in some cases.</p><p>  A member commented that young people may be almost 18 but not know where they are to go.  We deal with young people who have problems but fortunately there are many young people who do not have problems.  We are only seeing people with difficulties, and that means any crisis arising must be addressed, perhaps up to the week before a youth turns 18.  I could tell members about those cases all day and it is a problem.  There are a few aspects of the process which must be realised, which is why we would like a clearer outline in the Bill.</p><p>  Why do we want aftercare?  It is part of a continuum of care and as parents, we start to prepare our children for leaving home and becoming adults from the day we teach them how to walk, dress themselves, etc.  That is what every parent does.  Aftercare is not an "either-or" process, as it is not a case of having good care or aftercare and we must have both.  One of the critical elements of our research, outlined in the longer document submitted to the committee, is the finding that young people who have stability in care placement for the years prior to leaving care are more likely to have stability in aftercare and are more likely to do well.  A person cannot go to further education, get a job or settle into anything if there is no place to live or sleep for the night.  It is a crucial point.  As Mr. Allen indicated, accommodation is a critical issue, particularly in Dublin, and it is really difficult for anybody to access, never mind young people without help and support.  Resources must be seen within a continuum of care.  Many young people may not need aftercare support but they need to be assessed because circumstances can change.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to employment.  I do not know why I listed it first but young people coming to us aspire to being like everybody else and having a job, a home, a marriage and a family.  If they do not have education they cannot get a job, and if they have disrupted placements when in care, it is more difficult for them to get the education and qualifications they need.  I have had this job for nine years and I have noted a major improvement, particularly in the past few years, with the number of young people going to education and training.  Unfortunately, there are still difficulties, and it may come as an unintended consequence of the available aftercare supports, as young people get more supports if they are in education.  Sometimes they may be likely to choose a course that is not right and opt for any kind of a course in some cases because they need supports.  They may see such action as a way to make the transition with more support.  That is not a criticism but it is a fact.  Employment is a key issue but education is a major factor in getting that employment.</p><p>  The question was asked of why we would invest in aftercare, and others have already outlined the individual benefits.  There are major benefits to our society and if we invest now, we will save later.  That would be wise.  There is an obligation and responsibility as a state, and it is not limited to the Child and Family Agency.  Although that body has a responsibility as a corporate parent but no more than we, as parents, can provide children with education, employment and other support, it is imperative that protocols are set up as an aid.  This Bill should address the process to ensure other agencies can come together in the work.  Mr. McBride spoke about the aftercare committees which will have a vital role and which are already doing this very successfully.  Deputy Conway gave the examples in Waterford, so not everything that is happening is bad.</p><p>  There should be no qualifications regarding consultation with youths, and all young people should be engaged.  If and when the children's rights amendment goes through, there will be a responsibility on the State to ensure it consults with young people in all matters affecting them.</p></speech>

There are benefits for the individuals and also the wider society, with proven savings to the Exchequer in return for the support.  I concur with Deputy Troy in that now is the time to ensure we get the legislation right.  Significant progress has been made and we must ensure it is kept on track.  Aligned to this is the matter I raised earlier and which other Deputies referred to, which is eligibility.  We do not want this process to be restrictive, with the possibility that very vulnerable young people could slip through the net and make an unsuccessful transition to adulthood.  That is already happening and we want to close the loophole so that individuals can be captured; those who are hard to reach must be engaged.</p><p>  The other component to the success of this Bill will be the need for interagency co-operation to guarantee the plan's implementation.  The Bill must be strengthened in this regard as there is not enough emphasis on the successful implementation of a plan.  Our key concern is that in 20 years we could be faced with another child death review report because other individuals would have been failed.  Now is our chance to ensure that does not happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.334" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fred McBride" time="18:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014040100012#N00400"><p>Deputies Conway and Regina Doherty very sensibly asked what will change, and it is a very important question.  I hope there will be three changes.  The first is we will have more dedicated aftercare services, and we are attempting to have dedicated aftercare services in each of the 17 areas.  Currently, some of those services are split across different groups of staff, and some social workers, for example, will hold aftercare cases in their busy workloads.  Creating a dedicated service will help to bring a difference.  In providing such a dedicated service we would train people who have the right skills and experience to engage with young people.  The issue of young people who are hard to reach was mentioned and the skill of keeping young people engaged will be very important.  There will be a difference in that respect.</p> <p>We have also said that in each area we will have a multi-agency aftercare committee where there will be multi-agency planning for aftercare services.  Hopefully, people will begin to see the benefits of that.</p><p> The third area is better information and-or advice on access to services.  The committee will perhaps be aware that as part of the creation of the new agency we have taken under our wing what was the Family Support Agency, which has in excess of 100 family resource centres across the country.  We are carefully examining whether these family resource centres could be a good access point for young people seeking information and advice about aftercare services, even after a period when they have opted out and, perhaps, social work departments and aftercare workers have lost track of them because they do not know where they have gone.  Those family resource centres are community based and located in many of the areas where those young people are from and live, so they are very accessible and can be used as a type of drop-in point for young people, including young people who wish to return to a service after a period of disengagement.  It is an opportunity for our new agency to have that resource at our disposal.</p><p> There was also a question about hard-to-reach young people.  Our partners in the non-governmental sector are also very good at engaging and tracking young people who are hard to reach.  Sometimes these young people see the community and voluntary sector as not being part of the system and therefore they are more willing to engage, so there is greater partnership in that regard.  In addition, over &euro;50 million is spent on youth services.  Those services must be harnessed as well for engaging with some of these young people.</p><p> In terms of the resource issue, I have a responsibility to manage within the resources I am given.  Whether there will be any additional resources associated with this legislation is not for me to say, but I can say that if we are successful at this multi-agency approach, that will bring many more resources to the table than is currently the case.</p></speech>

We are rolling them out nationally into all 17 areas.  Their main function is to case-manage the very complex needs of young people between the age of 16 and 18 years to ensure there is a comprehensive interagency plan for these young people.  The other part is to build up networks in each local area - each area is quite different given the urban-rural divide - to ensure these areas work together closely in partnership to deliver services for these young people and to build up networks and a directory of services for young people in the local area.  It is about highlighting gaps in service provision and these groups will report to the national steering committee, which is an interagency committee, within the agency.</p><p>  The purpose also of those steering groups is to ensure that when young people do not engage or disengage at 18 years of age, it is a way for them to be re-linked back in.  If they turn up in the homeless services at 19 or 20 years of age, they can signposted back into the aftercare group.  That is a way of trying to re-engage young people.  I emphasise that our current policy is about the process of tracking and trying to re-engage those young people who are not interested in linking with us when they are 18 but often find it is difficult and return to us when they are 19 or 20.</p><p>  With regard to foster care, one of our focuses this year is the development of a foster care strategy.  It is about supporting foster carers in managing young people with particularly challenging needs so it does not break down and things end up going awry for them.</p></speech>

Consultation with young people as part of their aftercare will be done and will be underpinned by the legislation.</p></speech>

We really appreciate the thought and time that people have given to the subject.  We are quite taken with the recognition, across the committee, of the need for a cross-departmental and cross-agency contribution to the working of good aftercare which is something that we shall take back to the Department.  I shall address two points and my colleague, Mr. O'Donoghue, will address the other points.</p><p>  With regard to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's comment on consultation, it is important to understand - and I think that the agency will take this on - that it must be from 16 years of age, at a minimum.  Obviously if a child is in residential care and is unclear or anxious in any way then the care should start earlier.  Sensitivity must also extend to a child who, perhaps, is in a very stable foster care situation and assumes he or she will live there.  The approach of beginning the discussion of aftercare with that child must be done in such a way as to not undermine his or her stability.</p><p>  When we talk about consultation beginning, one must realise that it is part of care planning.  Part of care planning is assessing when one needs to start this engagement with the child.  Depending on his or her circumstances, it could be earlier but, at a minimum, by 16 years of age and it should be noted on his or her formal care plan what the decision is and what is happening at that time.  It starts with the social worker and then moves on to the aftercare worker, depending on the circumstances of the child.</p><p>  The second question was about the vulnerability of some young people leaving care and how the agency can support them through that period.  We would like to recognise that there is a higher proportion of children with disability in care than there is in the general population.  Some of the children have very severe disabilities and some have severe mental health difficulties.  They are children and young people who will probably carry a lot of these challenges or difficulties with them throughout their adult life.  The core issue for the agency, in terms of developing an aftercare plan, is to help that young person transition over time from the agency service to the appropriate adult service, rather than remain with the agency forever.  That transition must be done in a way that ensures that the child or young adult is securely placed into the responsibility and care of the agency dealing with the adult difficultly, particularly individuals with very severe difficulties.  Those are the two points that I had wished to address and I leave the remainder to Mr. O'Donoghue. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-01a.343" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Albert O'Donoghue" time="19:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014040100014#Q00500"><p>I thank the members of the committee and the representatives of the NGOs, Mr. McBride and Ms Mugan, for attending.  When an issue like this is debated and the views of all parties are sought and received, it makes our job of trying to craft something at the centre a lot easier.</p><p>  The legislation gives visibility to the cohort of children that we are trying to support in aftercare which did not happen in the past.  We hope, and are reasonably confident, that it will address the consistency issues that were touched on by Deputy McLellan regarding living on one side of the river and what a person may or may not get in assessment and the various plans that would ensue.  As a corollary, we hope that it removes the ambiguity around who is eligible for the aftercare process and the assessment of need that would preclude that from happening.</p><p>  Senators and Deputies raised a number of themes, which is the best way of describing them, during the course of the discussion and I shall try to touch on all of them briefly.  In terms of eligibility, and I return to the point made by Deputy McLellan, it is quite hard to define eligibility but we have tried to keep it as broad as possible.  It took quite a while to figure out how we could incorporate the various cohorts of children into these definitions.  There has been some talk here that it is restrictive but I can provide an example of the structure.  For example, what happens when a child, in the previous five years prior to presentation to the agency, has had 12 months consecutive care.  That means a child, upon reaching the age of 16, presenting to the agency.  Therefore, we would have to go back to the time when the child was 11 or 12 years old and look at his or her care record.  I am of the view that in terms of what is in play at the moment, and what we are suggesting here, there has been quite a shift in terms of the cohort of children that would become eligible for the aftercare planning process.  </p><p>  A lot of talk centred around inter-agency co-operation.  Mr. Allen and some of the members drew attention to the fact that this is not all within the gift of our colleagues in the Child and Family Agency to deliver.  I drew reference, albeit passing, in my opening remarks to a series of bilaterals which we hope to kick off with our colleagues in other Departments in order to examine how we might move these issues along and have proper cognisance, from their perspective, of the cohort of children that we seek to support.  That would be the opening salvo in moving towards something which Mr. McBride alluded to, in terms of memos of understanding and service level agreements, but I see it as something further down the road.  We need to get their radar attuned to the fact that there is a small but vulnerable cohort of children who need to avail of the services that are distinctly within their bailiwick to deliver.  </p><p>  The voice of the child was raised regarding use of the phrase "as appropriate" in the draft heads before the committee today.  Everything that the agency does is governed by section 9 which says that the voice of the child must be considered, due weight and regard having to be had of the maturity of that particular child.  The phrase "as appropriate" was used in the legislative provision so that an absolute obligation is not placed on the agency in relation to children or young people that it cannot track down.  Where it engages with children it is bound by section 9 - and I believe this is something Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in was passionate about during the debate on the Child and Family Agency Bill prior to Christmas - but it still stands.  This is a technicality to deal with cases where a child disengages from the system, cannot be tracked down or does not wish to engage.  The phraseology used does not place an obligation on the agency to deal with a child who does not want to engage.  It does not in any way, shape or form detract from the agency's obligation to have due regard to the voice of the child. </p><p>  There was a brief mention of detention and aftercare.  One third of children who enter detention do so under court order, a further 25% to 30% are well known to the Child and Family Agency and, if memory serves me correctly regarding a passing discussion with one of my colleagues, a social worker has been allocated.  Approximately 60% or so would, in the main, qualify under the provisions, as we have crafted them here, for aftercare planning.</p><p>  With regard to the inter-agency issue, the residual cohort in detention are catered for by an agreement between the probation service and the Children and Family Agency to look after those children.  A process and protocol are already in play.  That means that if they do not fall within the remit of this provision they will be picked up on the other side.</p><p>  There was another question but I may have misheard Ms Ward.  As far as I am aware, a child can be adopted up to the age of 18.  Is that what Ms Ward said?  Did she say "not up to the age of 18"?  I ask both questions in order to seek clarification.  </p></speech>
