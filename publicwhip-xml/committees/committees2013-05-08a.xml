I apologise to the guests that we are somewhat delayed but there were important matters of correspondence and EU scrutiny proposals to address at the beginning of the meeting.  We have with us Barnardos, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the National Parents Council Primary and the National Parents Council Post-Primary.</p><p>  I draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and witnesses are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  We will publish their opening statements on our website after today's meeting.  Members are similarly reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to which I have just referred.</p><p>  I will take speakers in the order in which I listed the groups and invite Mr. Fergus Finlay to make his opening remarks on behalf of Barnardos.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergus Finlay" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013050800003#E00400"><p>I thank the Chair.  I will not take very much time.  We made a written submission to the committee and are very grateful for the opportunity to address the committee on a subject that has preoccupied us for a number of years.  During that time we have been measuring the costs of going back to school and have published our survey year after year.  Every year we say the same thing - this is a very frightening cost.  In recent years it has been very clear to us from our direct experience that parents are going into unmanageable levels of debt over what ought to be a constitutional right for their children.  Our most recent survey indicated that it costs in the region of &euro;355 to start a child in senior infants; &euro;390 for a child in fourth class and &euro;770 for children going into first year of secondary school.  That is the cost of books, uniforms and some absolute basics.  It is not the cost of designer labels and all the other things parents are under pressure to provide.</p><p>  Earlier this year when the budget was published, we said, as I believe all of us would agree, we thought it was shameful that the support available had been cut as drastically as it has been, namely, cut by a third in one budget for both primary and secondary school students, while it has effectively been halved for primary school students in the most recent budgets.  Coming here today, we would love to ask for more money to be put into supporting families with these massive costs.  We know that is not going to happen.  What we would like is for this committee to do what can be done without increasing costs in order to make some things more affordable than they are at present.</p><p>  In our view, there is a fundamental deficit of leadership in this area.  One of the committee members said to me earlier that the problem with the education system in Ireland is that we fund the system but do not control it.  Perhaps he did not see it as a problem but I do.  There are some things that need to be controlled.  For example, a school book rental scheme should be mandatory.  If money is given to school principals they must be under absolute injunction and direction that the school book grant cannot be used for any other purpose.  The voluntary code that currently exists among school book publishers should be made mandatory.  There should be much stronger leadership than there is to direct boards of management to review their uniform policies.  In Northern Ireland, for example, very detailed guidance is sent to every single school.  Although I understand this is not mandatory it is far more persuasive than anything that goes out from the system here.  There must be public policy in these areas.  With a little bit of imagination and a little bit of, for want of a better word, lateral thinking, some of the heavier burdens can be removed from parents.  Those things are simple to do and do not cost any money.</p><p>  We know of schools where parents are leading by designing and running the school book rental scheme and where principals support them they are making real progress.  In my view the policy should be that parents should be encouraged and allowed to lead and principals should be encouraged and, if necessary, obliged to support this work.  Concerning school books and uniforms it is absolutely possible to make the kind of changes that would save families a lot of money.  I would love to see and would argue for more financial support but I know it is a waste of everybody's breath to do that in the current climate.</p> <p>I urge the committee to draw attention to, what I regard as, the inequitable income thresholds that discriminate against single-parent families.  The children of single-parent families are already at greater risk of poverty and educational disadvantage without that discrimination.  I urge the committee to address that.</p><p> When publishing its findings, I ask the committee to outlaw forever workbooks, which are an invention of the devil in my view.  They are designed for the sole purpose of making money.  They have no educational value whatsoever and cost an arm and a leg that does not need to be spent.</p></speech>

I will start with some terribly stark statistics.  It will come as no surprise to anyone in this room to discover that a quarter of all children in the country come from a household that does not have a job.  Half of families rely either on a social welfare payment or low-paid work with consequences for children growing up with that degree of deprivation, exclusion and needs - as opposed to wants.  Unfortunately we have the old reliable statistic of one in ten children living in severe poverty, which is basic deprivation.  That is tough on the children and when they go to school it becomes compounded.</p><p>  I am pleased to appear before this joint committee because as we said to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, since 2009 some &euro;450 million has been taken out of child income-support payments and we in the Society of St. Vincent de Paul through our 10,500 members are very concerned.  We witness on a daily basis what that does to a family with the erosion of hope, the degree of insecurity, stress, anxiety, hardship and the constant "No".  We are talking about little ongoing costs of participation in school.  For us this is not just a back-to-school issue, this is an all-year-round issue, involving things like the cheque for the swimming or the football boots.  While participation on the GAA field can be the cheapest of all hobbies to get them out and about, a child cannot get near it without the kit, mouth-guard etc. - a child might end up looking like the Michelin man at the end of it all in order to get out there and play and be like everybody else.  This applies to curricular activities.  Swimming is on the national primary curriculum, but must be paid for.  Children whose parents cannot pay end up stuck in another class while their mates go off and have a bit of craic on those days.</p><p>  We are talking about exclusion and a deeply divisive commoditised education system in this country.  I am sure members have read the survey from two days ago, which informed us - we did not need to hear it, but it is good to have evidence - that those from private schools do better because their parents can afford to buy commoditised privilege of educational resources.</p><p>  Members may read our submissions which are all very similar and will drive home the same message that for many parents and households the cumulative reductions in social welfare supports and schemes and the continued cost of education are just too much for people to bear.  I will not read out my submission which contains nice colourful pie charts indicating what our members shell out to people for schoolbooks and uniforms.  This is keeping families afloat and we are very concerned about it.  Our organisations have been at the forefront of trying to create solutions to this problem.  We are looking to our elected Members to find ways of doing the job better - doing the right job the right way.  As Mr. Finlay has said, we want parents to be partners.  I have many copies in my bag if members want them.  I would be quite happy to distribute them.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Audrey Deane" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013050800004#F00500"><p>We want parents to be partners in education.  We agree with Mr. Finlay of Barnardos and are quite appalled at the level of autonomy schools have.  Up to &euro;60 million of taxpayers' money goes towards schoolbooks to be dealt with in any discretionary way that a principal may see fit.  There is good practice and bad practice.  In some cases children are parading their poverty and in others there are very innovative, comfortable, confidential, discreet ways of doing things.  There is a spectrum of ways of doing things, but it should not be like this.  This is a small country with a limited number of schools.  Let us just get on with this and find some solutions to this problem.  As far as we are concerned, parents need to be a partner and do not need to continue to be at the receiving end of notes in schoolbags stating it will cost &euro;450 for this iPad, &euro;600 for this, &euro;200 for that or whatever.  This is not the way to have an adult partnership relationship when it comes to providing education for our cherished children.</p><p>  All our organisations proposed solutions to the Minister on the issue of schoolbooks.  We accept and we are party to the implementation of the guidelines, but we do not believe they go far enough.  School principals cannot continue to have autonomy over whether to establish a schoolbook rental scheme because too much money is at stake.  We are quite unhappy at the continuing frequency of additions and changes.  We accept the publishers were forced into a new protocol but we know they continue to do deals with schools.  Prior to the introduction of the protocol they had already different discounts for different schools.  We do not believe that represents the way forward.</p><p>  The schoolbook market is worth &euro;60 million and we are not trying to reduce jobs or be anti-growth.  However, we believe we need ministerial leadership to show there is a way that will be parent focused and not profit focused or publisher focused.  We need to see some real solutions there and we want to be part of that.  Until very recently there was a hands-off approach on the part of the Department of Education and Skills and it is not enough to throw our hands collectively in the air, ask what we can do and say that schools can decide what they want to do.  That is not a viable option.</p><p>  We are also very concerned that in the parent body there is a low awareness that taxpayers' money is going into schoolbooks.  To date they have not had much understanding that they really should be asking school principals why they do not have a schoolbook solution.  We understand that there are - particularly from our Labour Party colleagues - some ideas around this.  We will stand beside them and work with them</p><p>  Uniforms represent another large expenditure which does not need to be the case.  It is good that all of our organisations got together with all the other leader organisations in education - some 13 organisations in all.  We put our heads together and came up with a very simple two-page document to request school boards of management to review the school policy.  This is solution focused and represents partnership working in action.  I was lucky enough to meet the Minister for Education and Skills on his way up the stairs so he has a copy in his briefcase as we speak.  This is the way to work in future - find solutions, work collaboratively and get to the outcome we want, which is less expense for parents.  It is over to the members of the committee and we look forward to working with them in the future on these most important issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013050800004#F00600"><p>In our preparation for this submission we surveyed parents to establish the issues they had.  In a three-week period from 22 February and 15 March we had 900 responses from parents on the issues.  We focused the questions on the areas on which the committee has asked us for feedback.  Some 60% of parents who responded said their schools had a schoolbook rental scheme available for all parents.  Of those 60%, some 90% said they were utilising it.  Where the schoolbook rental scheme exists in schools, parents see it as a major benefit.  Some 40% said they did not have a schoolbook rental scheme available for all parents.  As Mr. Finlay mentioned, workbooks was highlighted as a major issue.</p> <p>It was the issue that many parents raised in the additional comments section.  They referred to the cost of workbooks, the fact that they can only be used once and the under usage of them after they had been purchased.  Often they are only half-filled at the end of the year.  They were not even being fully utilised after purchase.  I am not sure they are the Devil's invention but we would prefer that workbooks be taken out of the system.  </p><p> We do not specifically ask for book rental schemes to be put on a mandatory basis because we believe every school should develop a strategy on making school books affordable for families.  As the ways in which schools manage such strategies differ, making rental schemes mandatory may interfere with effective systems that are already in operation.</p><p> Approximately 90% of respondents reported that their schools operate school uniform policies, which indicates that school uniforms are issues for most parents.  Of these 90% of parents, 64% had to purchase uniforms from specialist shops.  We were disappointed by that in light of the amount of publicity we produce every year in our efforts to divert schools away from such policies.  A number of parents noted that, in addition to the cost of school uniforms, they are also required to pay for no school uniform days, which they see as a contradiction in terms.  In line with the document that the organisations jointly produced, we believe that schools should consult parents on the development of workable uniform policies and that such consultation should address all demographics in the school so that all parents' voices are heard.  </p><p> Voluntary contributions are a further significant element of the cost of going back to school.  Parents generally believe there is no voluntary aspect to voluntary contributions and if they do not pay them they sometimes receive letters written in red which are handed to their children.  There is considerable pressure to pay these voluntary contributions.  Some 65% of parents reported that they were not requested anonymously and 40% of those who were asked to pay contributions reported either that they found them difficult to pay or that they could not afford them.  In respect of the 35% of parents who were not asked for a voluntary contribution, it would be interesting to find out what is happening in those schools.  In regard to recommendations on voluntary contributions, we think a statement should be issued to the effect that they should not be requested.  They are sometimes linked to enrolment in that parents are asked for a voluntary contribution as part of enrolling their children.  Often they are told the money will be used for their first year's voluntary contribution, thereby setting the scene for it to become involuntary.  Voluntary contributions should be banned and funding issues should be dealt with in the school community.</p><p> This gets to the heart of our views on back-to-school costs and the general cost of schooling.  Parents are often seen as either funding the education system or expected to finance their children's ability to go to school.  Parents' associations are used as fund-raising committees or else parents are asked to pay voluntary contributions or for the cost of books.  The relationship is being placed within a financial framework and we believe it should be refocused on an educational framework.  That cannot happen while all of these discussions are taking place, however.  Research shows that when parents are engaged in learning, the children will do better.  However, if communication between home and school starts with financial demands it is difficult for a struggling family to engage with the school around a child's learning.  This affects not only families' abilities to carry financial burdens but also their ability to engage with their children's learning in school.</p><p> Parents were also given an opportunity to raise other issues.  One issue was the fact that schools seek to raise money to cover other costs throughout the school year.  A parent reported paying &euro;61 for swimming lessons, &euro;33 for school tours, &euro;5 for a field trip in one month alone and was also expected to purchase tickets at Christmas for a draw, pay &euro;10 admission to the school concert, buy Christmas cards at a cost of &euro;8 per child and calendars at &euro;6 each.  There were two no-school uniform days at Hallowe'en, when parents were under pressure to purchase costumes, and on St. Patrick's Day, when parents had to buy something green.  That is one of many responses we received on that subject.  The other issue raised was the funding of curriculum areas within the school day.  The pressure in this regard is more severe because the activities concerned take place during the school day.  One parent reported that extra lessons, such as drama and swimming, cost approximately &euro;150 per child per year and that children could not opt out because they were provided during school hours.  These costs are piling up for parents throughout the year but they are not always revealed in our surveys because they are not loaded onto the beginning of the year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Don Myers" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013050800005#G00200"><p>On behalf of the National Parents' Council Post Primary, I welcome this opportunity to address the committee.  The National Parents' Council Post Primary is a voluntary organisation with 20 directors, who give of their time freely, and one full-time staff member.  While I may be at somewhat of a disadvantage compared to other witnesses, I represent an organisation whose members are at the forefront as parents.  The major issues we deal with are similar to those mentioned by other speakers.</p><p>  The first issue is the cost of uniforms.  We have been involved in a campaign aimed at reducing the cost of uniforms because, while we appreciate that uniforms distinguish schools and have to be worn, we need to consider more generic and less costly alternatives.  We have heard crazy figures, such as skirts costing up to &euro;90.  That day is long gone.  This issue needs to be driven from the top down.  As a parent body we are powerless unless we have support from the top.</p><p>  The cost of schools books has long been a major issue.  We began to campaign on it in 2011 with our partners and managed to get publishers to introduce a code of conduct.  However, we feel the code is very porous and as parents we are simply dictated to and required to take what we are offered.  If a school requires books costing &euro;200 parents must buy them if they want their children to be taught there.  I am not being disrespectful to teachers when I say teachers pick the books and parents pay for them.  In what other part of Irish society is that the practice?  I respect teachers as educators, however.  </p><p>  A relatively new publisher claims to have saved parents &euro;15 million in the last three years and estimates that it will save them a further &euro;100 million over the next seven years.  It must be applauded for that because it is good to see an Irish company using Irish resources.</p> <p>We are experiencing hard times and it is good to see what can be achieved.  We are also making strides in respect of e-books.  However, we are being hampered by the 23% VAT rate.  That is a matter to which consideration must be given.  As parents, we can all voice our opinions but we do not have the power to get anything done.  That is why we will be asking members to put pressure on the powers that be to see that this issue is addressed.</p><p> I examined the costs relating to transition year.  We are of the view that transition year is important.  The mission of transition year is "To promote the personal, social, educational and vocational development of pupils and to prepare them for their role as autonomous, participative, and responsible members of society."  We are all aware, however, that with the cut in capitation grants and resources and the imposition of the moratorium, schools are being squeezed and are finding it difficult to make transition year feasible.  Those schools which can offer transition year will, therefore, be those which can carry the cost.  Increasing numbers of schools are leaning on parents.  The latter are being asked to support everything.  Reference was made earlier to non-uniform days.  I discussed a particular matter with a principal recently and he asked me not to mention another non-uniform day.  He stated that if there were any further such days, there would be no need for the pupils to wear their uniforms.  The message is clear, namely, funding for initiatives such as transition year is a major imposition, and responsibility for shouldering the cost is continually being placed on parents.</p><p> We were all aware that something had to be done in respect of school transport, particularly from the point of view of cost in order to make it efficient.  As a result, a value for money review was carried out in respect of school transport.  We understand the need to obtain value for money but is it necessary to separate families?  It is wrong that one family member can obtain transport to his or her school but that his or her sibling might not be able to attend the same school.  Families are being split up at school level.  The position in this regard should be reconsidered in order to discover how best this matter might be targeted.  The maximum fee charged in respect of school transport is &euro;650.  That is nothing when one has it but it is a great deal when one does not.  There are families who, unfortunately, fall just outside the qualifying criteria.  In the context of issues of this nature, individual circumstances should be taken into account.</p><p> I should have referred earlier to the clothing and footwear allowance.  This has been reduced significantly in the past couple of budgets.  Again, there are families who are missing out on this allowance because they do not meet the criteria and are over the threshold involved.  Let us face it, there are sole traders who are in business, who are struggling and who are not entitled to social welfare payments.  They are as badly off as some of those who are in receipt of social welfare.  Everything must be taken on its merits and on an open basis.</p><p> As parents, we want our children to receive the best education possible.  We want them to live happy and productive educational lives.  At present, however, the position for parents is not good and this is going to reflect back on our children.  I ask that anything which can be done for schools or parents, should be done.  We all understand that we are living in difficult economic times.  However, with a little cohesive effort from everyone we can get things moving.  Parents need to be involved at a higher level.  As a parent, I am of the view that this is necessary.  I ask the committee to bear in mind that, as parents, we need help.</p></speech>

I also thank them for offering suggestions as to how the Government might take some action to assist in alleviating the problem that exists.  There is an onus on the committee to take this matter up with the Minister directly and to ask that the Department take more decisive action to adopt some of the practical proposals put forward by our guests.  What they are seeking has been sought in the past but, unfortunately, action has never been taken.</p><p>  The presentations contained a number of common themes.  The issue of schoolbooks was particularly prominent and was referred to by all our guests, especially in the context of cost.  Two or three suggestions were put forward in the context of the banning of workbooks, a requirement for compulsory book rental schemes in all schools and more input on the part of parents.  Reference was also made to the 23% rate of VAT which applies to e-books - this are being used on an increasing basis - but which does not apply in respect of printed versions.  When commenting on the survey carried out by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Ms Deane stated that 64% of school uniforms must be purchased at specialist stores.  That figure is remarkably high and it is not acceptable.  This is a matter which the committee needs to pursue.</p><p>  The key difficulty which arises relates to the fact that one quarter of students come from homes were no one is in employment and that half have parents who are either on low incomes or in receipt of social welfare payments.  The main issue is that we have been reducing the supports provided to the families who are experiencing the greatest degree of financial pressure at present while increasing the demands on them at school level.  Although we are focusing at this meeting on the reduced level of supports available, we must also consider the reason schools are placing more demands on parents.  A study was carried by Am&aacute;rach Research on behalf of the Catholic Primary Schools Management Association, CPSMA, in respect of the funding crisis being experienced by schools.  It emerged that as this crisis becomes more pronounced at school level, the onus is increasingly being placed on parents.</p><p>  The back to education allowance has been cut significantly in the past two years, from &euro;200 to &euro;100 at primary level and from &euro;305 to &euro;200 at secondary level.  This has placed real pressure on families who cannot find the money from elsewhere.  In addition, the summer works scheme which was used by schools to carry out certain refurbishment projects has been discontinued.  Last autumn, the minor works grant was also discontinued.  Some schools managed to absorb this particular cut in funding, which was worth a minimum of &euro;5,000 to each school.  The grant in question would have fallen due for payment in the latter half of this year and a real funding crisis is going to emerge at primary level, in particular.  As stated, the grant was worth &euro;5,000 to each school.  In a school with 50 students, families are going to be obliged to find an additional &euro;100 each in order to make up the shortfall.  In a school with 100 students, the shortfall per head will be &euro;50.  Who is going to pay this money?  Again, the onus will be placed on families.  That which I describe does not often garner the same type of prominence and coverage as direct cuts to the supports provided to families.  There have been calls for voluntary contributions, etc., to be banned.  However, they reason such contributions are requested is because the funding for schools is continually being squeezed.  One way or another, the responsibility in this regard is always placed back on the shoulders of parents.</p><p>  There is a need to ask the Department to reconsider the position regarding the supports it provides to schools and in respect of the impact cuts to funding are going to have on parents.</p> <p>The suggestions made by the delegations today are worthwhile and we need to push them with the Department and the Minister.</p></speech>

On the one hand we have a Minister, Department and Government which are cutting resources, including the back-to-school allowances and capitation grants, while on the other hand the Government is washing its hands of some of the possible solutions to try to offset the costs of schools for parents, and that is unacceptable.</p><p>  Reference was made to the cost of school books.  I have spoken to several principals and patron bodies about this issue.  I believe patron bodies have a responsibility in all of this as well.  Often the patron body gets lost in the debate on back-to-school costs and it is left to the Department and the school board of management, but the patron bodies have a major responsibility to take the lead on this issue and I do not believe they are doing so.  We need to say that much loud and clear.</p><p>  Schools that do not have book rental schemes maintain that they would prefer to have such schemes but that the problem is the significant start-up costs involved.  Do the delegations have any comment on that or any experience of it?  I imagine the National Parents Council Primary is dealing with schools which may not have official book rental schemes in place but may have alternative arrangements, or perhaps its representatives have spoken to parents from schools that do not have these schemes in place.  Will the delegation outline the reasons behind this?  One point we frequently hear is that a significant start-up cost is involved.  Once a scheme is up and running, those involved can manage it, but the difficulty is to get a scheme up and running.  Do the delegations have any solutions to or opinions on that?</p><p>  Reference was made to voluntary contributions.  Let us face it: they are not really voluntary contributions.  We all get the letters.  I have children in primary, post-primary and higher education.  We get letters from my daughter's post-primary school.  After reading them one is under the impression that if one did not pay, she would not get a place next year.  There are letters seeking to process the child's enrolment for the next academic year and there a request for a voluntary fee of &euro;120 needed by 1 May.  It is not needed by the following September but now.  This must be addressed.  Ms Lynch put the case rather well about the ongoing costs, which are astronomical.  These are the costs associated with drama, swimming and no-uniform days.  Every week there is something costing either &euro;10, &euro;15 or &euro;20, especially in post-primary education.  In primary education these costs may not arise on a weekly or monthly basis, but in secondary schools there are continuing requests for money, whether for Christmas tickets or Easter draws or whatever, and parents are struggling to budget for these costs.  Many parents will know that there are uniforms to be got before going back to school and they will try to budget as best they can.  However, once the child starts back in school, the ongoing costs are sometimes not budgeted for.  They can come out of the blue and these costs are causing parents to struggle.</p><p>  One submission - I cannot recall which - reported on how parents come up with the money to fund back-to-school costs.  The figure for those going to moneylenders was given as 1%.  This seems a remarkably low figure.  From my experience of dealing with people in my constituency offices and from speaking to parents, it seems a decidedly low figure and I am unsure how accurate it is.  My own experience is that the number of parents who go to moneylenders to make up the shortfall involved in sending their children back to school is considerably higher than 1%.  That is a frightening development, the likes of which we are seeing more of now, especially cases in which parents are being forced into the hands of illegal moneylenders with all the attendant dangers.  I question that particular statistic in the report.</p><p>  Mr. Finlay put it well when he said there is a fundamental deficit in leadership in this area.  There is no doubt there is a fundamental deficit in leadership but it cannot be put solely at the foot of the Minister.  All of us, as legislators, must take responsibility for that.  I believe there is a need to make the voluntary code of practice mandatory.  More can be done on the issue of uniforms but the patron bodies must buy into that process as well and more pressure must be put on them.</p><p>  I am unsure whether making the school book rental scheme mandatory would work now because of the initial start-up costs.  I call on the delegations to respond to that question.  I would be keen to hear the ideas of the delegations.  Is the initial upfront start-up cost a genuine reason for schools not having a school book rental scheme?</p></speech>

It takes a little collective problem solving.  The issues are there to be solved.  Let us suppose there are six first year classes and 25 biology books for each class.  If one bought all of them, even at a discount rate, it would take a good deal of money, but one need not do it like that.  There is scope for leveraging parental involvement.  At the moment there is a huge polarity in autonomy.  People need to be brought into the equation.  Perhaps my colleagues may wish to comment on this.</p></speech>

When we discuss school uniforms, everyone presumes we are referring to a jumper and pants or a skirt and a top, but it goes beyond that.  There are uniforms, school tracksuits and school jackets.  It is no longer a geansa&iacute; and trousers or a pinafore.  Students of 12 or 13 years of age who are growing continually do not even get the second year out of a track suit.  They may only be worn once a week in schools, but parents may have spent &euro;90 on them only to be worn 40 times during the year.  It is criminal.</p></speech>

I have been working on this report for some time and we have heard presentations from the patron bodies, which were interesting as well.  Submissions have been received from various bodies and they have been well received.</p><p>  There are two issues.  The first is the costs themselves but the second is the capacity of a parent to pay them.  We need to consider both issues.  Naturally, we need to consider the capacity of the parent to pay, but fundamentally we should ask why these costs are there in the first place.</p><p>  We have always had the problem of the cost of sending a child to school being unnecessarily high.  When we had money, we did not focus on this issue properly.  During the boom times we made other political priorities.  There is a cultural question at issue.  As Mr. Finlay rightly noted, we should go back to the Constitution and the value of having a free education.  We have lost the sense of that ideal.  Perhaps we need to have a discussion among ourselves as a society about that cultural shift.  The idea of holding a fund-raiser for a Garda station sounds ridiculous but we have no difficulty holding a fund-raiser for a school or a hospital.  People in Scandinavian countries would find that rather bizarre.</p><p>  Part of the problem is the nature of competition between schools.  The value system that underpins our education system is one of choice, and that is fair enough.  However, it leads to a level of competition between schools.  My school must offer something the neighbouring school does not have, because I need a certain enrolment in my school to keep my staff complement as it is.  I would not be keen to lose numbers to the neighbouring school and, therefore, I may prioritise a nicer jumper and the ability to offer X, Y and Z.</p><p>  I do not understand why we stand over a system that puts pressures on parents to fund outings such as ski trips.  When did the idea of a ski trip become an integral part of the educational journey that a person needs to travel during secondary school?  These questions have to be asked but there are more fundamental things we need to discuss.  I was quite taken by what Ms Lynch said about the fundamental relationship between the parent and the school being undermined, because it is increasingly becoming a financial relationship rather than one based on education and learning.</p> <p>That is an incredibly powerful statement.</p><p> We have a problem of authority.  As Mr. Finlay said, we do not have a State education system, rather we have a State funded education system.  All the patron bodies came before the committee and were asked what they believed was their responsibility in terms of book and uniform policies.  Each and every one said it was a localised issue and each independent board of management made an independent decision on uniform policy, and they had no overarching responsibility for it.  That has to be challenged.  One patron body, Educate Together, said its philosophy was to have no uniform and was able to ensure all its schools have that policy.  I do not know whether that is a cost for parents, but if it can have a policy for its schools, I do not see why other patron bodies cannot do the same.</p><p> We have to be more inventive with school books.  I agree with Ms Deane that this does not need to be something that happens next September.  We could have a vision of something happening over ten years and gradually come to a situation where a book rental scheme is introduced in every school in the country.  We could deal with core textbooks first and then move on to other areas of the curriculum.  There has to be buy-in from all the different agencies involved in education.</p><p> I ask the delegates to give me a sense of the responsibility patron bodies have for individual boards of management and principals who play ball.  It was suggested there are schools where principals and parents work together quite strongly to find solutions while others are not playing ball and are happy to communicate the exclusive nature of a school in a community, that the school is difficult to get into and has high standards, and therefore that there are costs to getting into such a school, such as a payment of &euro;70 to enrol a child, which I have heard from parents, or the requirement to pay a voluntary contribution.</p><p> There may be a role for local authorities in terms of what the local library service can do about books.  The policy regarding uniforms needs to be challenged.  I ask the National Parents Council Post-Primary to refer to the digital revolution that is occurring at second level.  If a principal decides every first year pupil has to have an iPad, what strain does that place on the parents with whom it deals?  Is enough direction coming from the Department on what is happening independently of any strategy it has implemented?  Does it ask for the educational evidence that an iPad is needed?  I am led to believe that if one reads something in print, it stays with one longer than if one reads it on screen.  These things are happening without any management, policy-wise, from the Department.  How can we work with schools to ensure it is not just fashionable for every secondary school student to have an iPad?</p><p> Those are my basic thoughts.  I look forward to trying to put as much of what the delegations said into the report as possible, and to having some fundamental demands in it which will achieve something.  I do not want the report simply to say the situation is terrible and has to change without having a strategy for how it can be changed.  We should not expect change to occur in September but rather over a period of time.  Everybody, including the Department, patron bodies and the boards of management of primary and secondary schools, needs to take their responsibilities seriously.</p></speech>

I worked in retail for 24 years before I was elected to the D&aacute;il.  I had a shoe shop.  I have seen all perspectives on uniforms and school shoes.  It is a closed shop when it comes to school uniforms and shoes.  One hears from people in the retail trade that they have a school on their books which they facilitate with school uniforms and they have the whole market to themselves.  On a few occasions I tried to get some information on clothing to determine whether I could mix clothes and shoes, but found I could not enter the market because it is a closed shop.  The school supports a shop and they work in tandem.</p><p>  In Northern Ireland one can purchase a crest or badge and multinationals co-ordinate with schools.  Uniforms are chosen which everyone, including multinationals and local shops, can get.  Whoever has the best prices gets the business.  Multinationals do not carry huge stock, and therefore individual shops also get trade.  In the Republic, there are different colours, shapes and makes, and it is a closed shop.  People in the trade are making vast sums of money.  One trader told me he earns enough in the six to eight weeks of back-to-school trade to keep him going for the whole year.</p><p>  As a Deputy O'Brien said, uniforms no longer comprise trousers and a geansa&iacute;, rather there are sports elements.  People with three or four children could spend a couple of thousand euro in a shop.  That could be multiplied many times.  I wish the best of luck to such shops but we need open trading in this sector.</p><p>  One issue raised by Mr. Myers was the 23% VAT rate.  There was a Revenue crackdown on the shoe industry.  Children's shoes are zero-rated and adult shoes have a VAT rate of 23%.  Most shoes come in carton lots of 12 and 14 because they are made in the Far East.  Deck shoes with white soles have become very popular - they are called "Dubes" - and cost &euro;100 a pair.  Such shoes start at size 36 and go up to size 42.  A 36 is a size 3.  Most shop owners thought that shoes up to size 5.5 were zero-rated, but the Revenue Commissioners said once a range goes from 36 to 48, all sizes are ratable at 23%.  Children's feet grow, and eight, nine or ten year olds wear size 7, 8, 9 or 10 shoes, which are all rated at 23%.</p><p>  If we do anything as a result of today's meeting, we should examine whether the Government can do anything about having an exemption from the 23% for school-going children.  It would be a huge saving.  If one has to buy runners, shoes and football boots for four or five children, the extra 23% VAT is significant.  Mr. Myers brought memories of the VAT rate flooding back.  Revenue did audits and then left shoe shops because it was worried about the negative publicity it would get.  However, we were told that once shoes came in cartons with sizes from 36 to 42, we had to charge 21%, and then 23% when the rate increased.  It is a major issue for people buying shoes for children going back to school.</p><p>  In one school with which I am dealing, if one does not pay the voluntary contribution, one does not get a key for a locker.  Children who see others without keys know they have not paid, which is an horrendous situation.</p><p>  There are a lot of sole traders and self-employed people.  I was self-employed and came before this committee, as other members can confirm, to push for an effort to look after the self-employed.  The comments on the grant system for back-to-school requirements are correct.  Many sole traders are not surviving and we need to consider helping them in terms of back-to-school grants.  The laws on social protection have been loosened a little and sole traders are receiving payments, but it is still an issue.</p> <p> Going back to school uniforms, many of the shops which have a monopoly on their sale are supplying acrylic and synthetic garments.  The profits on these items are huge.  It boils down to the decisions made by boards of management and principals.  When one becomes a member of a board of management, whether one is voted in or appointed by a local authority, there is no education given on how the boards actually function.  Instead, members are expected to go with the flow, which often means falling in line with what the principal says.  This system is not good enough and must be changed.  I raised this issue with the departmental delegates at a meeting of the committee some weeks ago.  They assured us that money has been set aside this year to publish information booklets for school board members.</p></speech>

Several members referred to the status of book rental schemes and how that cost can be allayed.  My personal view is that if the school book publishers all closed down tomorrow and no new primary school books were published, I am not sure the education system would change at all.  This is because, in the first instance, the curriculum was written to facilitate a lesser degree of reliance on school books.  The bottom line, however, is that there are already enough books in the system.  When one considers the number of children who finish primary school every year, the question arises as to where their books are going.  Schools must have some means of retaining those books within the system.</p><p>  The fundamental difficulty in this regard is the regularity with which the assigned reading list changes for individual classes.  I am referring here not only to what the book publishers are doing but also the tendency of some teachers to change the reading list for their class, sometimes year on year.  That has to stop if schools are to be in a position to offer a workable book rental system.  Any such scheme requires consistency in the books that are used each year.  As I said, there are probably enough books in the primary system to implement any model of school book rental scheme.  I am not even sure why there is rental element to it; if the books are there in the schools, they can be given to children.  Year on year, however, parents are purchasing yet more books and one is left wondering where this huge pile of books is accumulating.  It does not seem to add up.</p><p>  It does not take too much thought or innovation to work out how to keep the books we already have and recycle them within the system.  Any such scheme should not be too difficult to initiate because of the massive numbers of books already in circulation.  Coming from the English system, I am constantly amazed at this phenomenon of new books being purchased every year.  We often hear about a revised edition of a particular textbook replacing the older version on the assigned book list.  Again, coming from the English system, it was my experience that in such cases the teacher would instruct pupils with the older edition to open on page 42 and those with the newer version to turn to page 44.  That was all the variation in teaching that was required to accommodate a class where pupils had different editions of the same text.  There are lots of issues blocking the changes we are discussing but, in my view, there are enough books in the system to facilitate any scheme that might be introduced in the future.</p></speech>

I endorse everything Ms Lynch has said regarding school books.  Parents are already under enormous financial pressure.  A survey we conducted found that 48% of parent associations are raising between &euro;2,500 and &euro;10,000 per year in contributions to the running costs of schools, with an additional 14% raising between &euro;10,000 and &euro;30,000.  That is a huge amount of money for parents to contribute to the operation of schools even before one takes account of the cost of books and uniforms.</p></speech>

In some schools parents have a say in those types of decisions, but in more schools they do not.  It is perhaps going too far to say they are dictated to, but in many cases parents have little say on these matters.  I spoke last night with a person whose child will go into first year in September.  This parent has received a request from the school for &euro;100, comprising &euro;50 for the book rental scheme and a &euro;50 contribution to running costs.  The letter states: "The additional &euro;50 annual contribution is to cover costs such as student journals, personal accident insurance, locker rental, photocopying, newsletters, school reports and telephone and postage communication with parents".  Any parent receiving such a letter will be given pause for thought.  It could certainly be argued that it is ultimately down to the patron to step up to the mark on such issues as school uniform costs.  After all, the board of management is acting on behalf of the patron.  As such, it is not really feasible for any patron to claim it has no control over what the board does.</p><p>  In regard to iPads and other communications devices, we have fought vigorously in regard to costing.  The bottom line is that iPad devices are working out at approximately &euro;500 apiece.  We are arguing over school books costing &euro;450, yet at the same time we are talking about a device that costs &euro;500 before one purchases a single book.  A sense of perspective is vital in this discussion.  We have gone down the road of Android devices, which are half the price, and one publisher has even got into QR codes.  There is certainly a momentum in this regard.</p><p>  Ms Lynch made a vital point regarding the number of books in the system.  At post-primary level, publishers are telling us that only a tiny percentage of books are updated every year.  Yet parents tell us the costs arising from the incidence of new editions is crippling.  All of the costs are falling back to parents.  I endorse everything that was said by my colleagues in this regard - we are getting hammered.  Parent associations were not set up to engage in fund-raising for schools.  That was never their intended purpose and that is the message we must drive home.  The function of parent associations is to allow parents a role in seeking to address difficulties that arise in the running of their children's school and to offer suggestions for improvements.  We are willing to play our part in whatever way we can, but there is little we can do without support.</p></speech>

At the moment that market is being run by publishers for profit, which is fine.  It is a business model.  However, this is about education and it should not be in that domain.  We have spoken to the Minister about the degree of practice within the publishing sector.  We cannot go into it too much on the record, but there really is a lot of reform needed there.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul is seeking a clear message from the Minister in regard to the leadership he will offer on this issue and his strategic intent to regulate the industry.  We would go further in seeking the establishment of a task force incorporating expertise from a range of domains, to report within a short timeframe.  Its members would include economists, software developers, education bodies, organisations such as our own and, vitally, parents.</p> <p>Parents are the missing group in this room.  They are being dictated to.  They receive another little letter home in a school bag.  How many more can we take?</p><p> That brings me to my final point.  This matter needs to be re-calibrated and reformed.  It cannot continue to be the ludicrous condition that a local school principal can decide what is going on at that school.  They are in receipt of public funding.  That must change.  We need parents as partners with the patron bodies and it needs to happen fast.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Brien mentioned the start-up costs associated with school book rental schemes.  My answer to him would be that there is a need for investment of the school book grant as the start-up fund.  In my experience, because we set one up in my school, the principal was proactive in it and gave us the pot of money that he received as the school book grant to enable us to start it up.  As Ms Lynch correctly states, between setting up those grants and getting the books back within the system, if that grant is reinvested over time it shifts the paradigm, from the parents funding the cost to the school providing the books.  It is a system that operates in many countries and it should be operated here.  The school book grant scheme is the vehicle to get us to that destination and we need that vision to get us there.  There needs to be buy-in from all communities, including principals, patron bodies and parents, towards school book rental schemes so that there is no stigma attached to a school book rental scheme and it is available in all schools.</p><p>  Correspondingly, in the case of school uniforms, there is a role for the Department of Education and Skills and patron bodies.  It is not acceptable that such a hands-off approach of the school uniform being dictated by local boards of management.  The Department and patron bodies have a role to play and we need to challenge that.  At the end of the day, they could mandate that all schools pick one uniform item on which to have a crest.</p></speech>

Even parent representatives on boards of management can feel quite inadequate or not represented strongly enough.  It takes a school community to push this.  It could be as simple as choosing that there would be one item of clothing that would have the school crest which would ensure that they would still have the school identity and the school ethos would be represented, but that it does not need to go on a blazer, gaberdine or tracksuit top.  It would be a conscious decision to scrap all of the other items of school uniform that require that crest on it.  It should be floated as an idea.</p><p>  On the other issues, digital books or e-books certainly came up in the Barnardos survey last year.  Increasing numbers of schools, on their own initiative, are pursuing this.  It requires the Department of Education and Skills to take leadership on this because there is an absence of a policy approach to it.</p><p>  Lastly, in connection with the voluntary contribution, parents relayed to us tactics that schools are using to put pressure on them to pay the voluntary contribution, effectively, stigmatising their child because they had not or cannot pay it.  That is a totally unacceptable tactic.  Children go to school to be educated, not to be victimised because their parents cannot pay the voluntary contribution.</p></speech>

Basically, it is a range of options.  It is a no-brainer.  The bodies with which we worked committed to ensuring that it got to the boards of management, which are the accountable ones which make the decisions.</p></speech>

In response to the question raised by Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, and particular having listened to what Deputy Butler had to say, if it were the view of this committee that a body such as the Competition Authority, among others, should be asked to look at the issue of school books and school uniforms, I suspect one would start seeing action quickly.  There are cartels in operation in these areas that are keeping prices artificially high.</p></speech>

It was interesting what Deputy Butler stated about the shoes.  My daughter is eight.  She has her first communion on Saturday and I am still trying to buy shoes for it.  I went into a shop of one of the named brands and it stops its children's range at size 3, and she takes a size 3.  I wonder is she into adult shoes at eight years of age.  I suppose there is an issue that children are now much bigger.  It is not only my daughter.  It seems to be a phenomenon.  They are growing very fast, probably, more so than in the past.</p><p>  There is a couple of issues.  One matter a member of the public raised with me was that the book rental scheme does not cover matters such as art materials and that discriminates against those who might be interested in art.  There may be comments on that.</p><p>  I note that in some schools it does not seem to be a voluntary contribution when they send out notes looking for payment, for example, for art materials, computer material or whatever.  Some schools are bending the rules considerably.  In that regard, the committee visited Finland where schools are not allowed charge fees.  They are also not allowed bend the rules for voluntary contributions or by holding fund raisers.  The other point is that everything is paid for in Finland.  Ms Tinsley spoke of a cultural shift.  There is a more egalitarian society in Finland.  One can see it across the board.  All of the members were really impressed that it seems to infiltrate.  Even when one speaks to politicians on the left and right, they all talk about equality.</p><p>  Parents are represented here because most of us are parents or have family with children, and the parents council is represented here as well.  Parents play a role.  Recently, I was at a talk where a principal of a disadvantaged second-level school spoke of how he wanted to attract middle-class parents to try to achieve a better mix in the school - I suppose the idea was to bring everybody up in the school - and he succeeded.  One of his approaches was to bring in a school blazer.  That was one of the ways he attracted middle-class parents.  Parents play a role in this.  It is not as though they are innocent actors.  There are parents affected by this but there are also parents playing a role in driving the need for expensive-looking uniforms, etc.  Are there any other questions or comments?</p></speech>

Although the central issues here are voluntary contributions, books and uniforms, there is a legislative way we could go down in terms of changing the relationship we have with patron bodies.  Patron bodies guard their independence as sacred and the responsibility of the Department is merely to fund them, pay for their teachers, fix their buildings and leave everything else to them.  We must change the nature of that relationship.</p><p>  The Finnish position is completely different because there is no competition between Finnish schools.  In the school district, there is one school.  They do not have a tapestry of 3,500 primary schools which they must fund, light, heat, insure, etc., which is what we spend much of our funding on.</p><p>  While the Department must do what it has to do, there is a responsibility of leadership on patron bodies and individual boards of management that could drive down these costs.  There must be a cultural shift.  We should be reverting to the ideal of free education and it should not be culturally acceptable for some of these practices to be allowable within the school system.</p></speech>

In our case, the parents' association is taking the lead on it and on what we want to cover.  We would like at least all text books to be covered.  In the school in which I am involved, we are covering the text books, the copy books and the stationary but not the arts and crafts materials.  There needs to be a model set out to ensure that it covers as many options as possible for parents so that they are not burdened with additional extra-curricular matters such as arts and crafts materials.</p></speech>

In many cases, parents are not very empowered because they are at the school gate if they are there at all.  They wonder who is on the board of management, how does one get there, and whether its members are hand-picked by the principal.  It can be quite a closed arena and this needs to change.  We are looking to our legislators and representatives.  We would like an accountability framework, whereby schools need to show they have considered ability to pay and can evidence they have a variety of practical options available to reduce costs.  This means walking the walk and not just talking the talk, which means being accountable to parents.</p></speech>

Today parents look for a school which sets out the child's career.  The difference in funding of various types of secondary schools is crazy.  Voluntary secondary schools are funded &euro;90 per pupil less each year then a comparative community or comprehensive school and &euro;212 less than a VEC school.  This is a tiered system which should be examined.  A better funded school can offer better resources.  I commented on a particular school seeking &euro;50 for a book rental scheme and &euro;50 for a school contribution.  I spoke to a single mother who sends her child to a different school in the same town who must pay &euro;200 for a uniform and &euro;250 for books for first year.  This is the difference between two schools in the one town.  We need to examine this at the top level also to see where we can equalise it.  The single mother I spoke to is quite entitled to get the same for her child as the child who pays &euro;50 for books and &euro;50 for a school contribution.</p></speech>

We have a lot of legislation, some of which is not being enforced.  At present it is not permissible for schools to request enrolment fees but we know schools do it.  One can say we must introduce legislation, or the legislators must fix this, but the major issue is the cultural shift required.  We must examine how to change the relationship between schools and parents to one about the education of children and school communities.  If we accept schools are not funded sufficiently then school communities, and not parents, should examine the funding issues.  At present, the shortfall is met through parents' associations, individual parents, voluntary contributions and other means, but parents' associations and parents should be taken out of the picture.  They could become part of a funding committee in a school to examine shortfalls, but the relationship between parents and schools must change from being a dialogue of finance to one of education.</p></speech>

I would like to open by giving an overview of the European and international dimension to the work of the council.  As we are now in the fifth month of our Presidency, I would like to take the opportunity to brief members on some of our key dossiers and achievements, while discussing the agenda for next Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting, after which I will be happy to take questions and observations from committee members.</p><p>  In terms of the process, I am sure members are aware that the focus of ECOFIN is heavily influenced by the economic and fiscal backdrop, the work of the European Commission and the guidance of Heads of State or Government, who meet regularly in European Council Summits in Brussels.  Into the mix, it is the job of the six-month rotating Presidency to guide and steer the debate.  Our priorities are clear and have been shaped by the need to bring stability to a fragile and somewhat volatile economic and financial situation, as well as to pursue policies that will underpin growth and jobs. </p><p>  As President of ECOFIN I have chaired three council meetings so far in Brussels, as well as representing the council at various bilateral and multilateral meetings with the EU Commission, European Parliament, G-20 Finance Ministers and social partners.  We have made significant progress at these meetings and I will say a little more about that later.  In addition, in April 2013, I hosted a very successful informal meeting of ECOFIN in Dublin, where political agreement by EU Finance Ministers was reached on extending the average maturities of EFSF and EFSM loans by seven years for Portugal and Ireland.  In addition, we had a good discussion on enhancing long-term growth prospects as well as how we might enhance long-term financing, including in the context of SME funding.  We also had a good discussion about some taxation matters.  As I am in the Chair representing the Presidency, the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Brian Hayes, takes the Irish seat at these meetings for the six months. </p><p>  Turning now to the ECOFIN meeting next Tuesday, I understood that this committee has already received the draft agenda.  Members will see that it is a very full agenda.  I now propose to outline the key issues that are likely to arise, while taking into account that some of these may change on foot of ongoing work at official level in the meantime.  Indeed, the draft agenda members have in front of them has already changed since the one circulated late last week.</p><p>  The ECOFIN meeting will begin on Tuesday with an informal breakfast meeting during which Mr. Herman Van Rompuy will meet with the Finance Ministers to tell us more about what he is planning for the next European Council meeting.  The formal ECOFIN meeting will start with a discussion on current legislative proposals including the draft banking resolution and recovery directive. </p><p>  The Irish Presidency set out an ambitious programme in financial services.  The priorities on the financial services files for the first half of the Irish Presidency were based on the priorities set out in the December European Council conclusions, including agreement on a single supervisory mechanism, the capital requirements directive and on banking recovery and resolution.  We also undertook to progress work on the markets in financial instruments directive.  Our strategy has been to pursue a strict prioritisation agenda and to focus resources on the most significant dossiers. <b></b>This has been a successful strategy and we have made considerable progress to date with agreement on two of the key banking union files, namely the single supervisory mechanism and capital requirements directive.  On the consumer side, the mortgage credit directive has also been concluded.  We plan to continue our efforts to advance discussions on the banking resolution and markets in financial instruments directive files.  We are making progress on these and hope that we can advance matters on banking resolution during this month.  </p><p>  The discussions on Tuesday will then move to tax issues, including the savings tax directive and savings tax agreements.  We undertook to progress all of the above tax dossiers in our Presidency programme and there have been a number of significant developments to date on them.   The January ECOFIN meeting saw agreement that the financial transaction tax could be introduced in the 11 member states which have signalled they wish to enact the measure.  A formal Commission proposal for a directive implementing enhanced co-operation in the area of financial transaction tax was published in February 2013.  Ireland, as members know, is not one of the participating countries but we are committed, in our role as President, to act as an honest and impartial broker in the discussions.  Council working party meetings on this issue are ongoing. </p><p>  At the informal ECOFIN meeting in April, there was a useful discussion on recent developments in the international tax area on tax fraud and tax evasion, including the pilot initiative announced by a number of member states under which they will work more closely together and automatically exchange tax information.  I expect that this issue will be also addressed by President Van Rompuy at the breakfast session before the formal meeting begins and I expect that there may be a short discussion around that.  Work has been ongoing at council working party level by officials on measures to prevent VAT fraud and these are due to be discussed further at the next ECOFIN meeting.  My expectation for the May ECOFIN meeting is that there will be agreement on the negotiating mandate to allow the Commission to initiate discussions with third countries on the savings tax directive.  It is intended that tax anti-fraud issues will be discussed at European Council level at its next meeting later this month.  </p><p>  Our Presidency programme also sought to ensure the effective implementation of the European Semester process which included agreement on the &ldquo;two pack&rdquo; of economic surveillance measures and to work towards a more effective Economic Monetary Union through supporting the development of a time-bound road map for further economic and fiscal governance measures and some of these items feature on Tuesday&rsquo;s agenda.  </p> <p>Some of these items feature on Tuesday's agenda.</p><p> This European semester began during the Cyprus Presidency, with the publication of the annual growth survey in November 2012.  The bulk of the work, however, fell to Ireland to take forward and complete by the June 2013 European Council.  Our key objective is to ensure all relevant Council formations continue to work in a co-ordinated and consistent manner towards a thorough preparation for the May and June European Council meetings.  The publication by the Commission of its in-depth reviews into the existence of macroeconomic imbalances in some member states marks the beginning of the second, more country-specific phase.  At the ECOFIN meeting next Tuesday, the Commission will present the results of its analysis into the macroeconomic imbalances procedure to identify countries where economic risks may exist and the Council is expected to agree conclusions on that process.</p><p> On deeper integration of economic and monetary union, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy was mandated by the Heads of State and Government at the European Council in December 2012 to present a time-bound roadmap to the June European Council addressing a number of issues on deeper integration of the EMU, including <i>ex ante</i>policy co-ordination of major economic reforms, proposed contractual arrangements for competitiveness and growth and a solidarity mechanism to fund the reforms undertaken pursuant to those contracts.  Further to his request that the Council provide input into the debate on EMU, the Irish Presidency is working closely with President Van Rompuy in co-ordinating discussion on EMU at the various Council formations and providing feedback to him after each discussion.</p><p> A discussion on the issues to be considered in the roadmap took place at the ECOFIN Council on 5 March.  Views appeared to converge more on the issue of <i>ex ante</i>co-ordination, while more uncertainty and diverging views were evident on the issue of mutually agreed contracts and even more so on solidarity mechanisms.  The Commission is currently engaging with the Council formations on its latest contribution to the discourse.  It has recently published communications focusing on its short-term objectives of <i>ex ante</i>co-ordination of major reforms and a convergence and competitiveness instrument.  The ECOFIN Council at its meeting on 14 May will discuss the latest Commission communications.  The Irish Presidency will continue to work closely with President Van Rompuy and I look forward to his report to the June European Council.</p><p> The ECOFIN Council on 14 May will also have a short report and discussion on the ongoing work of the G20 and the IMF and World Bank, including the recent meetings last month in Washington.  Finally, we will have a short discussion and adopt conclusions on climate finance.</p><p> The final item on the agenda is an issue that relates to the annual EU budgets.  The draft amending budget will be before the Council to seek political agreement on a supplementary budget for 2013.  This is not an easy process and is linked to the wider seven-year budget negotiations taking place with the European Parliament which the T&aacute;naiste is leading.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste had a good meeting on Monday with the Presidents of the Commission and the European Parliament, which will hopefully help to advance that process further during our Presidency.  At that meeting it was agreed that the negotiations on the MFF and the draft amending budget will proceed in parallel and that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.</p><p> On the budget for 2013, the Commission has brought forward a proposal for an increase in this year's budget of &euro;11.2 billion in payment appropriations.  The Commission's reasons for the amending budget are twofold.  First, there is a need for additional appropriations to finance payment claims carried over from 2012 which must be honoured in 2013 and, second, there is a need to cover all expected legal obligations in 2013 and so avoid an abnormal carry-over of payment needs into 2014.  Negotiations within Council on the amending budget have taken place under the Irish Presidency.  The initial Commission proposal was considered unacceptable and the Irish Presidency has put forward a compromise that would see a two-stage process to commit to an amount and then agree to return to the matter later in the year for payment of outstanding amounts.  The issue is due to be further discussed at ECOFIN next Tuesday.</p><p> My objective at ECOFIN will be to obtain political agreement on this matter, notwithstanding the budgetary difficulties facing member states, in a way that ensures the continued smooth functioning of the EU budgetary system.  This will be challenging on this occasion.</p><p> The theme of the Irish Presidency is stability, jobs and growth, and in that context we set ambitious targets for the ECOFIN Council on financial services, the EU budget and economic governance and taxation.  There are still two months remaining in our Presidency and we will continue to work on the various dossiers before we hand over to the Lithuanian Presidency.  In the last two months of the Presidency, in respect of the financial services agenda, we will continue to work towards a Council general approach on MiFID and bank resolution and recovery, as well as related work on the deposit guarantee scheme.  We will also seek to finalise agreement with Parliament on the market abuse regulations.  We also intend to engage on regulations related to central securities depositories and packaged retail investment products and the transparency directive, as well as commencing work on the anti-money-laundering directive and the bank accounts package.</p><p> There has been agreement at Council on a mandate for the Presidency to negotiate the multi-annual financial framework budget for the next seven years and we are working towards an agreement with the European Parliament during our Presidency.  In agreement with the European Parliament, this work is being taken forward in parallel with the negotiations on a draft amending budget for 2013 in the ECOFIN Council formation.  We have achieved agreement on the two-pack of economic surveillance measures and are successfully progressing the European semester process to the European Council in June of 2013.</p><p> With regard to taxation, we achieved agreement at the January ECOFIN to allow those member states who so desired to go ahead with the financial transaction tax.  There is a significant anti-fraud and anti-evasion tax agenda for the May ECOFIN.  We have been building towards this in our negotiations in the Council working party at official level.  This agenda will feed into the May European Council discussions on tax evasion and tax fraud.</p><p> In our Presidency, we must be realistic about how quickly we can advance the European agenda.  That said, both at ECOFIN and in the various official groups that meet under the level of Ministers, we have been very active in ensuring the debate and policy activities move beyond the crisis.  While I believe we have been successful, we must acknowledge that the issues are complex and will not be settled in our six months.</p><p> I thank the committee for its attention and for this opportunity to set out the policy work at European level, particularly what is planned for the next ECOFIN meeting.  At this point I will be happy to respond to any questions or observations members may have.</p></speech>

I will focus on the Irish dimension of some of the issues the Minister outlined.</p><p>  Following on from the informal ECOFIN meeting in April in Dublin, where the Minister secured political agreement on the extension of the loan maturities under the EFSF and EFSM, what are the mechanics of having that decision formally implemented for Ireland?</p></speech>

If we think of a graph of the debt, some years there are peaks and some years there are troughs.  The idea is to have an even profile of debt repayments by taking the tops off the peaks and increasing the troughs.</p> <p>That is, in general terms, what will happen.  The agreements have been made and the National Treasury Management Agency will engage with the funds and try to reorganise our debt profile to our best advantage.  My objective from a policy point of view is to ensure NTMA sales of Irish paper in the market become a matter of routine, as they were before the crisis, rather than being a news event.  We should have a steady profile and be able to fulfil our borrowing requirements with a couple of options each year without any of the drama that has been attendant on visits to the market in recent times. </p></speech>

One item under consideration is to apply a bail-in mechanism to those with more than &euro;100,000 on deposit who are currently outside the deposit guarantee scheme.  This type of bail-in was applied in Cyprus following the failure of the initial proposal to impose a levy on those holding less than &euro;100,000 on deposit.  At this stage, is it likely that a bail-in of deposits of more than &euro;100,000 will form part of the resolution regime?  What is the Government's attitude to this proposal?</p></speech>

This group will then take the process further.  There are differences of opinion among member states on this matter and for this reason nothing has been fixed yet.  We took possession of a Commission paper on the issue and produced a Presidency paper.  The resolution framework is designed to deal with all types of bank problems, including insolvency.  The directive simply sets out the order of creditor preference.  It represents an improvement on the current position in this country for depositors where they currently rank on a par with senior bondholders.  If we had another case of a bank going bust, as occurred with Anglo Irish Bank, the first people at risk would be the shareholders whose money would be burned.  Subordinated or junior debt would be next in line to be burned in accordance with the requirement on banks to either pay their creditors or return to solvency.  The next in line would be senior debt, of which there are several categories and, as such, a hierarchy.</p><p>  As the Deputy will recall from his party's time in government, all the advice to my predecessor, the late Brian Lenihan, was that senior debt and deposits rank <i>pari passu</i> under the law.  That remains the advice to me.  This means that senior debt and deposits are on the same line if one is organising the hierarchy of credit in the bank.  The Irish Presidency's proposal, which may or may not be agreed as there are different views on it, is to give deposits preference and thereby place senior debt above depositors in the hierarchy.  If accepted, the proposal will improve the position of depositors in the banking system.</p><p>  The Deputy will recall that there is a bank guarantee in place across the European Union which guarantees deposits of up to &euro;100,000.  Given that no such guarantee applies to deposits above this figure, this means in theory that deposits of more than &euro;100,000 are at risk in every European country.  To return to the old debate, one of the reasons the European Central Bank would not allow the Irish authorities to move against senior bondholders was that, according to the advice available at that time, to do so would have required them, by law, to move against depositors outside the guarantee because senior bondholders and depositors were on the same line.  It was a policy matter with the European Central Bank not to touch senior bondholders on the understanding that such a course of action protected all depositors.  If there were to be a bail-in, we will seek to provide additional protection to deposits, even those in excess of &euro;100,000.  This means depositors would be ranked below senior bondholders in the hierarchy.  The Deputy should note, however, that we are discussing an extreme scenario, one where we have a repeat of the Anglo Irish Bank case.  Separating the sovereign from the banks removes the risk to the taxpayer but means some risk would accrue to depositors, albeit at the end of a long line.  </p></speech>

Ireland is one of the countries that has resolution legislation in place.  Deputies Michael McGrath and Pearse Doherty participated in the debate on the bank resolution Bill and will recall that it establishes a fund by means of a levy on the financial institutions.  The first step on the European policy of resolution is to have resolution mechanisms in place in all eurozone countries, some of which still do not have the relevant legislation in place.  Once this is done, each eurozone member will have a fund.  The next step will be to establish a fund at European level.  Whether this fund could be used to recapitalise banks as well as resolving them or such a function would be one for the European Stability Mechanism or both funds could be used as a source of recapitalisation, has not yet been decided.</p><p>  What has happened on banking union is that commitments have been made in principle.  Furthermore, the Irish Presidency has succeeded in securing agreement with the European Parliament on a single supervisory mechanism.  Having got that bit across the line, we are working on the resolution issue.  While most of the detail has been agreed, agreement has not yet been reached on the hierarchy for the bail-in mechanism I have described, starting with the shareholders.  Another area on which agreement has not yet been reached is the source of moneys other than those that are internal to a bank, in other words, whether these would come from the resolution fund, if such a fund is established in Europe, or the European Stability Mechanism.</p></speech>

The Minister stated agreement has been reached on the single supervisory mechanism and the focus has shifted to the common resolution regime and some other issues which need to be resolved.  When will we reach the point where, irrespective of legacy issues, the ESM will be in a position to recapitalise banks?  Once we reach that point, Ireland's case on the legacy issue of the pillar banks and Permanent TSB could be discussed.</p></speech>

The timeframe is more or less in line with what was planned last summer and we are moving along.  It will be next year before the single supervisory mechanism is implemented.  Regulations, protocols and a handbook must be drawn up and an institution must be established in Frankfurt to supervise the banking system.  Thereafter, this institution will have to delegate to some of the domestic banks the power to regulate, albeit on the same mandate as that under which Frankfurt will regulate.  A great deal of logistical work remains to be done once the legal work has been completed.  It will be well into next year before we reach that point.</p></speech>

I raise the issue with the Minister in light of the cut in interest rates announced by the European Central Bank last week and the continuing upward drift of variable rates.  The gap between variable and tracker rates for mortgage holders is growing.</p> <p>There was a suggestion earlier in the process that as part of the overall negotiation, we would seek to warehouse tracker mortgages underpinned by funding from the ESM or possibly the ECB.  The theory was that such a move might improve the funding position of the banks and take some of the pressure off the variable rate customers whom the banks are looking to squeeze time and time again.  Is that a live part of the negotiations that are taking place?  Perhaps it is in the background.  Is the tracker issue still being considered as part of the overall attempt to put the banking system on a sustainable footing?  It seems to me that the issue will have to be dealt with.  The banks are haemorrhaging losses on such mortgages.  They have to impose additional fees and charges on variable rate mortgages and SMEs in order to increase their margins.  I know it is not as simple as offsetting one against the other.  There is no doubt that the tracker situation has put the banks under enormous pressure.  Is that still being actively worked on?</p></speech>

I will pick up on a couple of aspects of it.  I will begin by focusing on the banking recovery and resolution process.  One of the proposals ECOFIN will be dealing with is the bail-in proposal mentioned by the Minister.  It is to be welcomed that depositors will not be given the same ranking as senior bondholders.  I would like to focus on the role of the ESM in recapitalising banks.  Is it not the case that if the bail-in proposal is adopted by the EU, the ESM will hardly ever be used?  The shareholders will be the first to take the hit, followed by the junior bondholders, the senior bondholders and the depositors.  The ESM will not step in until the end of that process, when those options have been exhausted.  Is that the Minister's reading of the bail-in proposal?</p></speech>

A number of policy papers are being discussed almost in parallel.  Work is being done on what the functions of the ESM would be, in respect of the banks, and how the detail of that would be worked out.  There has been a series of political discussions at a series of Eurogroup meetings.  Those discussions are giving guidance to what is, in effect, a drafting committee.  The committee is preparing a paper on the ESM and will bring it back in due course.  It does not want to be totally out of kilter with the political views of Ministers.  It has happened in the past that drafting committees have been set up, only to fail to get political support for the drafts they produced.  A kind of political guidance is being provided in parallel with the ongoing discussions.  That is one aspect of the matter.</p><p>  Deputy Michael McGrath mentioned the BBR depositor preference, which is running as well.  The logistics of setting up a single supervisory mechanism are being considered at the same time.  There is also some talk of having a resolution fund as a European fund, rather than being the sum of the sovereign funds.  That is purely at the concept stage.  Very little work has been done on it so far.  I cannot help the Deputy other than by giving him a description of what is going on.  It is difficult to say where it will land.</p></speech>

We agreed to a banking union, to the separation of the sovereign from the banks, to the taxpayers' risk being taken out of the equation and to the ESM being the primary source of capital for banks that require capital.  We agreed that it would apply retrospectively.  That is our policy position.  As there are so many pieces in the formation of the policy, it is difficult to predict with any degree of accuracy where they will land.  I do not want to cause any confusion by describing the Irish policy position while also describing the process as we move towards a final policy on these matters.</p></speech>

The Minister has set out the Government's overarching policy position.  The bail-in is one of the outstanding issues that will have to be agreed at the ECOFIN meeting on banking recovery and resolution.  The Minister outlined how the working group will take that process forward.  As a member of this committee, I would like to know what the Irish position on this is.  It is a very clear question.  Is it the Irish position that the bail-in of depositors would happen prior to the ESM contributing to the recapitalisation of a bank?</p></speech>

There are two different situations.  The first of them involves an insolvent bank that has gone bust.  Creditors have to be paid.  There is a sequence of bail-ins.  It happened in the Netherlands recently.  It happened here with Anglo Irish Bank, only the wrong decisions were taken.  In the second situation, the banks are stress tested and it is decided that they require some capital.  I do not think the ESM would be the first option in such circumstances.  I will mention Bank of Ireland as an example.  I should say it does not require additional capital.  It has 14.4% core tier 1 capital, as against a requirement of approximately 9% across the Union.  I do not want to raise a hare in this regard.</p></speech>

That would be the first move.  They might decide to go to the market to raise capital.  I would like, somewhere on the high priority side, to see the ESM being a source of capital for banks that require capital.  I would not see the ESM as a provider of capital to banks like Anglo Irish Bank that went bust and were no longer trading as banks.  I would see that being resolved through the resolution legislation we have put through the House.</p></speech>

I would like to focus on another aspect of this issue before I ask some other questions.  We have seen the situation in Cyprus.  I know we are dealing with the here and now in terms of the banking situation.  At a later stage, the stress tests may or may not show that additional capital is required.  When the ratios increase as a result of future directives, the banks may need capital.  What we agree now will be implemented in the future.  We do not know where the banks will be.  We do not know what the position will be in such cases.  We have seen the situation in Cyprus.  When the ESM did not recapitalise the banks, there was a bail-in of bondholders and depositors over a certain limit.  Is it Ireland's position that the ESM should recapitalise banks before depositors are asked to contribute to the recapitalisation of banks?</p></speech>

It differed from any other banking situation in Europe.  I do not think it should be used as a template for action in Europe.  I do not want to use Cyprus as the starting point for this.  I am saying that if banks have to be resolved because they are bust and they are not going to trade again, that is a different situation from the situation of a bank that requires additional capital.</p> <p>I have described where the sources of capital would be.  In the case I have outlined, I would like to have circumstances where a bank could draw on the European Stability Mechanism before going next or near depositors.  Our discussion on Tuesday will improve the position of depositors because those holding more than &euro;100,000 on deposit currently do not have any legal right to protection.  By changing the order of priority and giving depositor preference, we will improve the position of depositors.  There is disagreement about this and for this reason I am not sure where it will end up. </p></speech>

However, I agree with the commentators who argue for greater concentration on growing the economy and creating additional jobs.  The Taoiseach made this the theme of the Irish Presidency and introduced the issue for discussion at the European Council more than 12 months ago.  The theme of the Irish Presidency is jobs and growth.  The Government's position is that implementing the programme is only part of what we need to do and we must take additional measures to contribute to growth and job creation.  This is not, however, a substitute for the programme but a supplementary aspect of it.  The view I am expressing does not diverge from that expressed by anyone else who has spoken.</p></speech>

The moral crisis arises from citizens being pushed to the brink to rescue financiers and large banks and from the transfer of wealth from some of the poorest in society to financial institutions in order that they can be bailed out for behaving recklessly.  The European Union has advanced arguments for this course of action and the Minister, as president of ECOFIN, is not arguing for a change in direction.</p></speech>

Whatever else we do, we must deal with the deficit and our debt must be sustainable - that is the starting point.  After that, we can build on jobs and growth strategies, as we have been doing with reasonable success.  According to the European growth projections published by the European Commission earlier this week, Ireland will have the third highest growth rate in the European Union this year.  We never said we would turn around the frightful mess we inherited within two years.  The measures we are taking are successful and we have made significant progress.  Nevertheless, I agree with all of those who argue that simply taking fiscal and monetary measures along the lines we are doing needs additional policy work and we are doing that. </p></speech>

His assessment that we are making progress and the process is working, whether in this country or more generally in Europe, is not one that would be shared by the vast majority of people in this country, the rest of Europe and, increasingly, mainstream, middle of the road economists and analysts.  The Bruegel Institute submitted a report either to the European Council or ECOFIN in which it stated current policy was not working.  Moreover, the President of the Commission, Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso, recently stated that austerity had reached its limits, while the European Commission downgraded its growth forecasts for Europe.  A clear pattern has emerged in the downgrading of growth forecasts and upgrading of the projected increase in unemployment.  It is that the austerity experiment, which was first tried here and subsequently extended to Greece and Spain with disastrous consequences for all three economies, is now being applied across Europe where it is having a similar effect.  Evidence that these effects are beginning to impact on Ireland in a manner that was entirely predictable is provided by the most recent figures from the purchasing managers index, which show that manufacturing employment and output in Ireland have recorded their largest declines in four years.  Is it not the case that this is a direct result of the European economy beginning to contract?</p></speech>

Patents held by the pharmaceutical industry in Ireland are running out and generic medicines around the world are replacing high value patented medicines.  This is hitting Ireland disproportionately.  However, the other side of the export indices shows that growth in service exports is in double digit figures and continues unabated.  The export of services across the service sector is one of the main drivers of the economy.</p></speech>

Is the Minister seriously suggesting that the contraction that is taking place in the rest of the European economy will not impact on Ireland or choke off exports, the sector the Government repeatedly states will save the economy?</p> <p>I have said it here several times, and to Deputy Boyd Barrett, that our model is export-led growth.  Because our model is export-led growth, if our customer countries are in decline, we will sell less.  I gave the Deputy the statistics.  We export about 20% to the United States, 20% to the UK, 40% to the rest of Europe outside the UK and 20% to the rest of the world.  What is happening at present is that the United States is back on a very strong growth pattern.  The emerging markets are growing very strongly and world growth will come in around 3.4% or 3.5% in 2013, but the UK and Europe are showing very low growth rates and, of course, that is affecting us.  The main difficulty with the statistics to which the Deputy referred has to do with key pharmaceuticals running out of patent.  I said a year ago that this would happen, because the IDA has been predicting it, and it is an open secret.  We have a couple of advantages.  One is that we export many food products and many medical devices.  Both of them are inelastic in demand.  I am sure the Deputy is familiar with the term.</p></speech>

The Minister is right.  There is some growth in the American economy, in Asia and so on, although there are worrying signs of what could happen in Asia.  The difference between the United States and Asia is that stimulus is taking place in the United States and investment is taking place in Asia.  In contrast, in Europe the austerity policy is being applied.  We are cutting back on investment and spending, the European market is contracting, unemployment is rising and Britain and Europe are our biggest trading partners.  Looking at the macro situation, it is evident that the policy being pursued by European governments, including this Government, is failing Europe, driving it further into recession and guaranteeing at best that we do nothing to make a dent on the enormous unemployment crisis and at worst that we are making the unemployment crisis even deeper.  Is not that what is happening in Europe?</p></speech>

The medicine is being applied to control debt and get deficits down.  The Deputy can argue about the pace of that.  Now they are loosening up a little in Europe and giving certain countries more time to deal with excessive deficits.  That is fair enough.  There are many other things that could be done in Europe.  I am very vocal in Europe.  I am not saying that the set of policies being pursued is perfect.  All I am saying is that one cannot get away from reducing deficits and controlling debt as an opening position.</p></speech>

The Minister is so specific on the processes for achieving what he calls stability and utterly non-specific in terms of giving targets and timescales for addressing the unemployment crisis.  How can he say the Government is taking growth and jobs seriously when he does not have anything like the projections for reducing unemployment that he has for reducing the deficit?  We know exactly what his plan is to reduce the deficit and debt.  He has forecasts extending three or four years, but the targets will drop by a certain amount and, of course, the targets are never met, but none the less he has very specific targets.  Where are the specific targets for reducing unemployment either in this country or in Europe?  Where are the specific targets for increasing growth?</p></speech>

This is the third consecutive year of growth in the economy, and growth generates jobs.  The unemployment rate was at 15% when we came into office.  It is now at the rate of 14% and it is going down progressively.  However, there are some intractable problems in the jobs and labour market, in Ireland, one of which is the fact that the skills of the people who became unemployed quickly, the 200,000 who lost their jobs between 2008 and 2010, were related to the building industry and we are not going to regrow the building industry to the point where it was more than 20% of GDP.

I shall refer briefly to some of the discussion that has taken place in the past 40 minutes.  In these committees, an element of groundhog day has started to develop where the leading spokesperson for the Opposition starts with some reasonable questions and it disintegrates into terminology such as waffle, drug addicts in denial and Nero fiddling.</p> <p>We have seen this previously, before the promissory note deal and before the maturities were extended by seven years.  I believe that when the Minister leaves his current job, he has a good future ahead of him in fiddling, because the results to date have been very positive for Ireland.  In fairness to some Opposition Deputies, they have been consistent in the hope that the Government and the Minister would fail, but that has not been the case.  It is disappointing that they introduced the sort of language they did.  I compliment the Minister on his restraint and on how he handles the Opposition's comments, particularly those of Deputy Boyd Barrett, who has never had anything positive or constructive to say since I became a Member of the House.</p><p> The agenda deals with-----</p></speech>

When I studied economics in UCC, one of the first things we were taught was that income must equal expenditure.  The most misunderstood quote in Europe currently is that Europe is moving away from austerity.  This does not mean that countries that have excessive deficits are moving away from having balanced budgets, but perhaps it is about encouraging European countries that have a large surplus, which have been very restrained about how they put money into the economy, to start spending.</p><p>  On a different issue, it now seems certain we are not to be part of the financial transactions tax that is to be implemented in 11 member states, many of which are in the eurozone.  Does the Minister see that as the end of the matter?  Is there a potential benefit for Ireland due to the fact that many of our competitors or friends within the eurozone will now have a tax on financial transactions while we will not?  With regard to tax unity within Europe and the taxes being discussed, can I take it that these do not concern issues such as corporation tax and that such issues are not on the agenda currently?</p><p>  There is one other issue I wish to raise, but I will come back to it later if we have time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.178" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013050800009#H00600"><p>We had a discussion on the financial transaction tax at the first meeting I chaired in January in Brussels.  There is a legal power within the treaties whereby if a group of countries wants to advance a particular policy, it can move ahead under what is called enhanced co-operation.  Some 11 countries signed up to follow that route.  That is only the start of the matter, not the end of it, because they must now come together, engage with the Commission and bring forward a policy document which reflects the consensus view.</p><p>  The discussion on the financial transaction tax is not just among the 11 who have signed up for it.  Everybody participates in the discussion, even those of us who did not sign up to it.  In the treaties, it is made very clear that any measure taken by way of enhanced co-operation cannot interfere with the Single Market.   I note the UK Government has already signalled that in respect of the financial transaction tax it may take legal action, because it thinks it may interfere with the Single Market.  Therefore, there is many a hurdle to be cleared before there is a financial transaction tax.</p><p>  As far as we know from proposals made in France, Germany and Austria, which were made separately from the united front they are now showing, they are talking about something akin to a stamp duty on transactions.  We have that already.  We have a 1% stamp duty on transactions on shares.  The UK, although the biggest objector to a financial transaction tax, has a 0.5% duty.  If the tax is something along those lines, it will not really matter.  However, I presume the tax will be extended beyond the buying and selling of shares into other financial instruments.  Our position is that if a financial transaction tax was introduced by the G8 at its meeting in Enniskillen and it applied everywhere in the world, we would have no problem with that.  However, our difficulty is that if we had a financial transaction tax and the UK did not, activity would move from Dublin to London.  With regard to whether it would be an advantage to us if the other European countries went ahead with it, any advantage would be marginal.  If something was done in the United Kingdom, that would be an advantage, but while we are in the same space as London a financial transaction tax would make very little difference.</p><p>  On the other tax issues, on Tuesday we will discuss &ndash; and I think we have agreement on it &ndash; a mandate to provide information on non-national deposits in banking systems.  We want to negotiate with five non-European countries on the provision of information - Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco and one other.  We will make progress on that.  Those who were holding out on that were Luxembourg and Austria, but during the week I had conversations with the finance Ministers of both countries and we have moved them along, so they will now move on that.</p><p>  With regard to corporation tax, a Commission paper remains extant with regard to a common base for corporation tax, but there is a wide disparity of views across the Union on that policy paper.  I do not see significant progress towards a decision.  There will probably be discussions on the issue, but none have been planned for the Irish Presidency.  The issue may arise towards the end of the year.</p></speech>

However, these mortgages are a contract between borrower and lender and are not much different from other contracts such as those between landlord and tenant.  When the Minister talks about warehousing of tracker mortgages, does he see any change in the contractual agreement that exists between borrower and lender?  In other words, would it be possible to increase the cost of a tracker mortgage in some way in contravention of the contract that already exists?</p></speech>

The idea that is being discussed is that the trackers would be removed from whatever institution is involved and put into a separate institution.  Rather than crystallising the debt from mortgages that are not washing their faces, we would let them run out.  They would be warehoused in a separate entity so that the debts are not crystallised.  Over time, tracker mortgages will pay their way.  That is the general notion.</p></speech>

The change being made is to give a preference to depositors of amounts over &euro;100,000 so that they will rank below senior bondholders.  There was concern among some member states that because senior bonds were being treated as higher on the hierarchy, that might affect the price of bonds and would increase interest rates.</p> <p>A policy paper has been done on this by the Commission which suggests that it is only marginal.  The Commission is briefing members before the discussion next week.  The message is that their concerns are not well founded and that any affect would be marginal.</p></speech>

He asked for observations and questions.  I will make one observation and then put some quick questions.  I strongly support the Minister&rsquo;s position on the primacy of deposits.  It seems like an odd thing.  It does not pass any common sense test that people who put a few quid in the bank should be on a par with professional investors.  I fully support anything the Minister is doing there.  It would be great to see some detail on how that algorithm might work.  Will shareholders go first and, if so, then what?  Will it be a 50% cut for junior creditors or a 20% haircut to senior creditors or a 5% cut?  It would be interesting to know whether the plan is for senior bondholders to take a full hit and only when they are exhausted would there be a move on to depositors.  Will there be a sharing but less of a haircut for depositors because of their primacy?  I full support what the Minister is doing in this regard.</p><p>  We were at the conference in Brussels yesterday on the blueprint for the EMU.  It was very interesting and one thing that struck me was that there were people there from the Commission, the Parliament and the ECB.  There was great confidence in the new tools of which there are many, including the six-pack the two-pack, the competitiveness instrument and many other new tools.  It struck me that there was some group-think going on.  There was almost an over-exuberant confidence in these tools.</p><p>  One of my macroeconomics professors was a man called Jeff Frankel.  He said to us on our last day at our last lecture that everything he was teaching us was wrong.  This man used to advise Clinton and he was on the economic management council.  He was a smart cookie.  His point was that macroeconomics is in its infancy.  He said that five years previously the material he was teaching to his students was different from what he taught us and that five years on it would be different again.  The point was that if one wishes to stay on top of macroeconomics one must keep upgrading one&rsquo;s knowledge and changing the modelling and so forth.</p><p>  Given the amount of detail and scorecards and so on, the way Europe seems to work is that once we get these things agreed, it is rather difficult to secure change because there are 17 or 27 members.  It is simply an observation for the Minister to consider for ECOFIN.  He may wish to emphasise that these things must be flexible because the banks will always find ways of getting around the metrics.  While I broadly support some of these tools - there are some good ideas contained in them - I do not see any provision for flexibility, such as, for example, annual reviews or reviews every two or three years to determine whether the banks are managing to circumvent what we are trying to measure them on.  They will put a vast amount of resources into doing exactly that.  That is simply an observation for the Minister.  Some flexibility in how that is supervised in the coming years would be very useful.</p><p>  The issue of pensioners being wiped out in IBRC is a conversation for a separate day.  I realise it is nothing to do with ECOFIN, but part of it is relevant.  I gather a decision has been taken by the liquidator that the pension funds, which were deposits in, for example, a six-year deposit account, are not covered by the deposit guarantee schemes.  That is something to bear in mind.  Does the Minister agree with that position?  Will the Minister be representing the view at ECOFIN that pension funds, even if they are not strictly deposits, should be covered by the European deposit guarantee scheme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.189" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013050800010#J00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for his observation and comments in support of the changes which the Irish Presidency is advocating on where in the hierarchy of deposits over &euro;100,000 should fall.  That is important.  The second observation related to economic and monetary union, how it has developed and the over-enthusiastic confidence of some of its supporters.  What we really have is a series of elements that Deputy Donnelly has described and which in their totality come close to a full fiscal union, because they are all rules about budgets.  Rather than looking at the parts, if we look at them together they represent fiscal union.  The difficulty I see is that we want to ensure that they are implemented as drafted.  We had the Stability and Growth Pact previously.  Then, when France and Germany exceeded the limits it was not applied.  It seemed to amount to rules for small countries.  If we want to go back to the start of the problems in Europe one could base them on the non-implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact in 2002 or 2003.  This is one of the reasons that people like Wolfgang Schaeuble is so set on having things done by treaty.  He wants to be able to have these matters enforceable in the European courts.  He always says that he prefers a treaty, that is his position.  That is why we had to go through the stability and growth treaty we put through in May 2011.</p><p>  I agree with the observations of Deputy Donnelly.  The Deputy referred to the need for flexibility.  The way the conservation is developing at official level and at COREPER in advance of Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting is that a group of countries are looking for more flexibility.  They do not want the rules to be too tight.  I am unsure what way that will fall on Tuesday.</p></speech>

I was talking less about flexibility on the 3% structure or whatever but more about flexibility on changing the metrics, if needed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.191" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013050800010#J00700"><p>I understand what the Deputy means.  There is certainly a discussion strictly on the bank recovery and resolution proposal to the effect that there should be flexibility and national discretion such that the Sovereigns would not be tied into every detail of the wider European policy and that they would have local discretion.  Anders Borg, the Swedish Minister, telephoned me yesterday.  Sweden had a banking crisis in the early 1990s.  They found that the most effective approach was to take banks temporarily into state ownership.  Then they were able to work it through and sell them profitably subsequently.  He asked for time on Tuesday to make that point and whether we could give national discretion to provide for taking banks into state ownership on a temporary basis as a method of resolution, as well as what is on the sheet.</p></speech>

I am suggesting that if the concept of flexibility is built in, it is possible to have supplementary national measures which would add to the toolbox available to all euro member states or European Union member states in the banking union.</p><p>  Deputy Donnelly asked a question about pensions.  I replied to a written parliamentary question from Deputy Donnelly about a particular constituent.  I am relying on the liquidator's view of the law and his obligations in the way he treats various customers or former customers of IBRC.  His definition, based on the help of the Central Bank, of what is and is not a deposit is the key issue.  Only deposits up to &euro;100,000 have the guarantee.  If they are not deposits according to the definition of the Central Bank then he cannot honour the guarantee on them.  There is a difficulty with that.</p></speech>

Let us put that case aside because this is not the forum for an individual case.</p> <p>A very serious issue arises if the Minister, going in as President, sees that a ruling has just been made here about pension funds.  I am not talking about a basket of equities but money that a guy has deposited in the bank which is deemed outside the remit of the scheme and he will not even get &euro;100,000.  What would be the Minister's position in that situation?  Does he agree that would be the right situation for the Europe-wide deposit guarantee scheme?  I do not.  I think this is a dangerous decision because it tells anyone who has money in recognised pension funds that they are not covered by the &euro;100,000 guarantee.</p></speech>

Every country has it and it is standardised at &euro;100,000.  There is a possible difference of opinion on the definitions of a deposit and a pension.  I do not want to give the Deputy a quick answer without getting advice and checking it out, particularly with the Central Bank.  I can respond to the Deputy later.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the individual, about which, I have very strong feelings, if that decision is allowed stand it is, economically speaking, very serious because this guy put &euro;450,000 into a six-year savings account.  He was able to get out his 25%.  It was taxed as the pension funds were taxed at 0.6% a year so it is cash recognised as a pension.  Will the Minister examine that decision closely because it sends out a very chilling message to people who have pension cash in their banks?</p></speech>

I too would like to make a few observations and then ask one or two questions.  The observations follow from the blueprint for a deep and genuine EMU conference yesterday to which Deputy Donnelly referred.  One thing came across forcibly to me, especially from the first session which was introduced by Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso, followed by Olli Rehn, Jeroen Dijsselbloem and Victor Gaspar both finance Ministers whom the Minister will meet next week.  The point was developed in Sharon Bowles's presentation.  She is always first class because she is robust, has clear thoughts and clear expression, using language we can understand.  That is in contrast to Mr. Barroso's presentation which was very turgid, very foggy, aspirational, full of hypothetical language, abstract ideas and disconnected from the world and the Europe in which we live.  In the Europe in which we live there are 20 million people unemployed which is a very serious situation and derives, as is now admitted, from banking messes across the eurozone.</p><p>  The Cypriot and Irish banking messes are actually quite similar.  They both arose from the collapse of asset values on their balance sheets.  In the case of Cyprus these were Greek bonds which were unrealisable and therefore there were losses.  In the Irish banks it was loans to the property, housing and construction sectors and other businesses which collapsed causing losses.  Mr. Yves Mersch, who is an executive member of the board of the ECB, also gave a presentation.  By a slip of the tongue he said that the cases of Ireland and Cyprus were different because in Ireland's case it was a bailout and in Cyprus it was a bail in.  In fact the ECB must have been conscious when our system was collapsing that it needed to do something to avoid the domino effect of the contagion that would assuredly have happened.  The mess was left in Ireland and with the people of Ireland.  That is wrong.  I made that point in the break-out discussion that followed and it can be seen in the recording of the conference.</p><p>  I said it was wrong that &euro;31 billion of losses in the case of one bank should have been converted into loans to that bank to redeem bondholders and the residual financial damage was inflicted on the Irish people.  This was done circuitously, through a promissory note which re-inflated a busted bank.  After that explanation to the 500 people present there was a strong round of applause, not for the fact that I had said it but because the knowledge had come into the debate in clear and understandable English.  That is what we thirst for in Europe.</p><p>  There will be an opportunity when we have the stage next week to explain these things.  The banking system is still buckling at the joints across the eurozone and in the developed countries of the financial world.  Sharon Bowles, who is on the finance and monetary committee, agreed that they are only beginning to understand the amounts and scale of balance sheet and off-balance sheet contingency liabilities in the shadow banking world and in the exposures that the traditional banks have off-balance sheet.  These are very big, through re-hypothecation of financial securities and assets, which are being re-mortgaged four and five times, especially in London where some of the people who understand this and take the trouble to try to measure and assess it are quite scared by the scale of what is going on there.</p><p>  Let us go from those general principles and observations to where we are at in our own case.  It looks like there will be further bank recapitalisation.  That is not a strange suggestion to anybody who is honest in their thoughts.  The reason is that the mortgage loan losses are only now being acknowledged and recognised.  Fiona Muldoon told us about the SME difficulties, of &euro;50 billion of loans half are under stress and impaired.  The figure for losses in the banking system started off at &euro;23 billion.  Had that been adhered to the banks would have just about been kept out of State control.  I got my date wrong.  It was on 17 September 2009 that I presented the previous Minister for Finance with a grouped balance sheet of the six banks and an eight page document describing what had gone wrong in the loan to deposit ratio.  That is the ratio across the eurozone that showed all the banks that failed and continue to fail and just about survive how it went wrong.  That is the doom loop between banking and sovereigns because banks take on the bonds that sovereigns issue and when they are not collected or their yields go high and their values fall their balance sheets start buckling.  It will take people with a bit of mental stature to stand up and explain these things in easily understood English and not using all the hypothetical, abstract words, long sentences and polysyllabic words that have obfuscated and caused fog.  We want clear home-grown language such as Sharon Bowles uses.</p><p>  I have two questions, first, how much capital do our banks need?  Provision has been made against the transfer of &euro;16 billion in loans from IBRC to NAMA.  What are the existing provisions and what more will be needed because I do not believe they will be collectable at the net book values of the loans?  Today there is an interesting article by Martin Wolf, which <i>The</i><i>Irish Times</i> has reprinted from the <i>Financial Times</i>, in which he examines what has been happening, led by the biggest economy in the eurozone, Germany, and why its rigid adherence to the chosen path of deficit control and insistence that there be a pan-European solution is inherently contradictory, cannot work and ought to be stopped.  It is a very readable article and I commend it to the Minister.</p><p>  The Minister mentioned on our own patent-----</p></speech>

The position at the end of 2012 was that the core tier 1 capital of AIB was 15.1%, that of Bank of Ireland was 14.4% and that of PTSB was 18%.  When the stress testing was done in Spain and, more recently, in Cyprus, it was not done for 10.5% core tier 1 capital as was done in Ireland when we did stress tests.  Stress testing for 9% was done.  PTSB is double the capital requirement.  As the banks look more closely at the impaired debt of SMEs and on the mortgage side, one will find they are well provisioned.  AIB, for example, has &euro;12 billion for impaired debts, which is a lot of capital.</p></speech>

They are very well capitalised, in fact they are the best capitalised banks in Europe and were capitalised at 10.5% core tier 1 capital when the norm in Europe is 9%.  If we do further stress tests we have been assured by the troika that we will be stress tested at 9%.  There is a reasonable cushion.</p></speech>

Regarding the financial transactions tax, the former head of the NTMA, Michael Somers, is worried about the fact three or four banks in the IFSC have handed back their licences.  Is that connected to the tax?  We say we are against it, yet we are presiding over the committee which is thinking of introducing it.  What feedback does the Minister have from the banks who want to leave, given that, I understand, about 22,000 people work in the IFSC?  I am interested in the observations of the Minister on the departing banks.</p><p>  There are about five references on page 5 to fraud, evasion and so on.  As the Minister knows, increasing concern is being expressed in the literature that they are minor issues, but the damage done by the tax avoidance industry, with massive accountancy firm and tax lawyers, may exceed that.  Will Ministers address the tax avoidance industry, which is huge throughout the OECD?  Would the emphasis be better placed on tax avoidance rather than fraud?  </p><p>  I refer to the EU budget.  It is not clear what our position is.  Are we in favour of the &euro;11.2 billion mentioned by the Minister?  He mentioned a compromise but it is not quantified.</p></speech>

The references to fraud arise from the agenda we had earlier in the week.  There has been huge VAT fraud across the EU.  We were scheduled to discuss an initiative on its elimination on Tuesday but it has been deferred, probably until the June meeting.</p><p>  The European authorities are focusing on tax evasion because of the savings directive I mentioned and countries like Lichtenstein, Switzerland and so on.  As a result of their rules on confidentiality and secrecy, they prefer to pay a withholding tax rather than reveal information about deposits from non-nationals and their banking systems.  They are now moving towards transparency.  Those holding out were, as I said, were Austria and Luxembourg.  I spoke to both Ministers during the week, and they have now agreed to move and change the mandate.  The mandate is for the Union to negotiate transparency rules with the five non-EU states which are used for tax management purposes.  We are making significant progress on that.  </p><p>  On the EU budget, there are two budgets, one which stretches to 2020, which the Taoiseach discussed with the T&aacute;naiste on Monday in Brussels, and a supplementary budget to pay the bills for 2013.  The Parliament has tied the two together.  What is up for discussion on Tuesday is the budget for 2013.  The agreement between ourselves and the Commission is to aim for a figure of &euro;11.2 billion.  It is like a Supplementary Estimate.  Some other countries - the creditor countries - think the amount is too high.  </p><p>  We want to establish the principle in order that we can engage with the Parliament on the wider issue as well as the supplementary budget.  We want them to agree the principle of splitting the &euro;11.2 billion and suggested a figure they could agree to, for example, &euro;7 billion, and revisit it later in the year and agree the remaining figure.  We think by splitting it that way, they will have agreed to the principle of a supplementary budget and the drawdown of a significant amount of it.  Otherwise, there will be a hangover that will run into 2014 and there will be increasing difficulties.  The Parliament is willing to engage again with a full discussion, not only on this but on the full multi-annual financial framework.  </p></speech>

After the financial crisis in America, banks pulled back from various parts of the world.  One set of advice will tell one that it was part of the shake-out of the banking system.  People pulled back from Dublin, as they did from other financial centres.  Others will say that when the pendulum of regulation swung from soft touch regulation, it swung too far, too fast, and that there is now over-regulation in the Irish financial system.  I am not sure whether that is true but it is something that is repeated by people in the industry.  It is something we have brought to the attention of the Central Bank.  I do not think anyone would criticise anybody after what happened in Ireland for being extra diligent with regard to regulation.  It is not a great space in which to make an argument.  There is obviously a mean point where regulation is the best to be found anywhere, without affecting business.  The discussion takes place in that space, but it is nothing to do with the financial transaction tax.</p></speech>

The last ECOFIN meeting agreed an extension of the maturities relating to the EFSM and the EFSF.  There will be additional surveillance of Ireland until 75% of these loans are repaid.  The draft regulation states that the Commission shall conduct, in liaison with the ECB, regular review missions in the member state under post-programme surveillance to access its economic, fiscal and financial situation.  I ask the Minister to translate what this will mean.  The extension of maturities means it will take longer before Ireland reaches that 75%.  What does this mean in practice?</p><p>  RTE reported today that a European official said there would be a principal statement about whether direct recapitalisation of Irish banks would be permitted at the June meeting. Can the Minister clarify the situation one year on from the principal statement agreed last June?</p></speech>

Is that &euro;110 million already included in the 2013 Estimates or will it be an additional item?  My second question is to pick up on the financial transactions tax, FTT.  Has an impact analysis - a cost-benefit analysis - been carried out?  If so, is the Minister in a position to release that information to the committee?  As part of the single resolution mechanism, the Commission will undertake a Europe-wide asset valuation of all the banks, essentially another stress test.  Will we do one first?  If so, when will we know if the banks need any extra money?  We have the &euro;100,000 deposit guarantee scheme in place.  Is the plan for Ireland that this will be a funded or an unfunded scheme?</p></speech>

However, as a result of a popular intervention, that policy was changed and bondholders, rightly, came into the firing line.  That policy is now being applied generally as a result of events in Cyprus.  If that is the case, is there not a case for us to say that if we have accepted that senior bondholders should take a hit and if that is to be the new resolution regime which will be applied across Europe, we have a case?  People may take the view about the European Stability Mechanism, ESM.  I am less interested in the ESM than us having a moral case on the back of what has happened in Cyprus and this new proposed regime to say that we want some write-down.  Can we not ask for some write-down, given that senior bondholders did not take the hit in the Irish situation but Europe has now rectified that mistake?</p></speech>

Given what happened the last time, is this a group of people one would trust with running the economy for the next while?  I read in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday that some German people are doubting whether it is a worthwhile proposition.  It certainly has resulted in 25 million people being unemployed.  There is a lot of uncertainty in the United Kingdom as seen in the recent election results and something similar in Italy.  Is there any recognition that we took a few wrong turns and that pursuing the same policies is a case of a kick and hope exercise?</p></speech>

It was an act of financial cowardice that the scale of the problem was not dealt with.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is correct.  The retrospective understanding or admission that Irish people have been put into the breach for the saving of the euro system means that the euro system - rather than the ESM or any of the other funds - on a singularly unique case, could take a hit-----</p></speech>

The Minister stated that the EMU may not be discussed.  I refer to the introduction of convergence and the competitiveness instrument.

However, there are so many other things.  Deputy Donnelly referred to the two pack, six pack and various oversights.  There is a lot of oversight coming from Europe now in any case.  It has been overtaken by events.  I do not think it will add any burden to us in addition to all the other fiscal rules that have applied to Ireland and every other European country as we move forward.  I did not know about the statement on direct recap.  I will look at it later.  Deputy Donnelly asked about the &euro;11.2 billion.</p></speech>

There is already about &euro;23 million in the Central Fund for this purpose because we knew that some additional costs would arise.

It will depend on from when this will be effective.  The figure of seven will be on the table as a proposal.  We are looking for something extra but there are always numbers like that over and back.  Only ten days ago, the Central Bank notified us that it had extra excess profits and that instead of giving us something over &euro;1 billion, there is about another &euro;120 million or &euro;125 million.  There are pluses and minuses in the budget over the year.  We keep a general eye on it but it is not that precise that one would be too concerned about it because of the pluses and minuses in it.</p> <p> On the question of stress testing, Government policy is to align our obligations in this regard as closely as possible with the general stress testing of the European banking system.  Two stress-testing exercises will be undertaken in Europe next year.  In January the European Central Bank will commence an assessment of the values or asset quality of Europe banks, while later in the year the European Banking Authority will also carry out a stress-testing exercise.  The date of the latter undertaking is not yet fixed.</p></speech>

However, much of the Deputy's analysis is correct in that the root cause of the Irish crisis was a banking crisis.  Whatever add-ons one assigns to it, that was the root cause.  As such, the troika will not sign off on Ireland's exit from the bailout programme without a re-evaluation of the banks which shows they are adequately capitalised.  That is part of the exit programme but the timing is an issue.  We may be asked to do our stress testing somewhat ahead of the European banking system but not before 2014.  We have agreed with the troika that the exact same ground rules for stress testing will apply in our case.  In other words, we will not have to do a more onerous stress test than other member states, as was the case in the first months of 2011.  We will be stress tested under the same rules applying top other countries but perhaps a month or two ahead of them.</p></speech>

I do not want the banks in Ireland to be treated once again as an exceptional case, with all that such entails.</p></speech>

Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I ask the Minister to make her contribution before the committee this afternoon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.286" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1036" speakername="Lucinda Creighton" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013050800003#B00200"><p>It is a pleasure to have this opportunity to address the joint committee, given that it is Europe Week.  I am very honoured to have been invited to discuss enlargement policy and the European neighbourhood policy.  As members are aware, this is vast when one considers all the countries involved and the very heavy EU workload.  I will try to be concise, while touching on all of the main issues.</p><p>  The 27 countries soon to be 28, countries of the European Union have led the way in creating a framework for close cooperation between nations, in establishing a basis for friendly relations in our neighbourhood.  As you will know, Ireland currently holds the Presidency of that Union, an opportunity the Irish Government and the people have always valued.</p><p>  The Presidency has allowed Ireland to demonstrate that we are a constructive and committed member state that belongs at the very heart of the European decision-making process.  We are now over halfway through our term and we remain firmly committed to ensuring that our seventh Presidency leaves a positive, strong and lasting legacy both for the EU and for Ireland.</p><p>  The Presidency, as expected, is turning out to be eventful for the EU's enlargement policy.  Croatia is due to join the Union on 1 July.  We have been working to reinvigorate the accession negotiations with Turkey.  The pace is picking up with Montenegro.  Last month we received the Commission and EEAS reports on Serbia, Kosovo, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  At this point in the Irish Presidency, I am hopeful of the prospects for the EU enlargement policy in the months and years ahead.  The last monitoring report on Croatia issued by the Commission on 26 March was very positive, confirming that Croatia is generally meeting the commitments and requirements arising from the accession negotiations.  The General Affairs Council on 22 April adopted conclusion commending Croatia for the results it achieved and l look forward to welcoming her as the 28 member state of the European Union on 1 July.  Croatia held its first European Parliament elections on 14 April to elect 12 MEPs who will represent its citizens in the Parliament for the 12 months leading up to the European elections of 2014.  The process of ratifying the accession treaty for Croatia is advancing well and I am very confident that it will be completed on time.  This will allow us very soon to conclude what has been a long journey - one that began ten years ago.</p><p>  The agreement reached last month between Serbia and Kosovo allowed the Commission and the High Representative, Catherine Ashton, to issue positive reports, which were considered by the General Affairs Council on 22 April.  Discussions are only just beginning among the EU members states but I hope that by the end of June we may be in a position to agree to proceed to the next step in the accession process for each country.  For Serbia it would be opening accession negotiations and for Kosovo opening negotiations on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which are two of our key enlargement priorities in the Irish Presidency programme.  Implementation of the agreement will be key to ensuring a positive decision by the Council.  I hope that will materialise in June.  I welcome the fact that High Representative Ashton will continue to facilitate discussions on implementation over the coming weeks.</p><p>  The General Affairs Council also gave consideration to the Commission's report on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.<b></b> The report was relatively positive, though recognising that more work is required.  Again we plan to return to this in June.  As well as the name issue, the political situation will be a consideration.  Following the events of 24 December, I welcomed the agreement the political parties eventually came to which allowed the municipal elections to proceed.  Further engagement with and respect for the political and democratic process is required.  It is important that all leaders of the country demonstrate the political courage required to put the country's strategic priorities ahead of narrow party political interests.</p><p>  For the countries in negotiations, we are hopeful of being able to open a negotiation Chapter with Turkey<b></b>during our Presidency, which would inject new momentum into that country's accession process.  While the EU-Turkey relationship goes back a long way, it has not yet achieved its full potential.  We are therefore working hard to encourage further progress, although this will also require significant effort from the Turkish side.</p><p>  Negotiations with Montenegro are at an early stage but we were pleased to open a negotiating chapter last month and we hope to be in a position to open another one in June.  Attention is also being paid to the rule of law chapters that the negotiating framework for Montenegro puts into effect the new approach, which sees progress achieved on the rule of law chapters linked to overall progress in the accession negotiations.</p><p>  Iceland is already well advanced in the accession negotiations.  In advance of the elections, which took place last month, the Icelandic Government took a decision to slow down the accession negotiations.  All EU candidates have of course the right to pursue the negotiations at a pace which they deem appropriate to their particular situation.  The Icelandic Government has throughout this process has acted with the utmost transparency on all its dealings on the accession process.  I hope to see the new Icelandic Government decide to continue with the negotiations, however it will be for the new government to decide on how it wishes to proceed.</p><p>  Turning to the prospective candidates, there are three countries that have an European perspective but are not yet official candidates.  I have already mentioned Kosovo, for Albania the Council stands ready to consider granting candidate status when the Commission reports that necessary progress has been achieved.  Progress has been patchy in recent months and it is unlikely the Commission will be in a position to deliver a report during our Presidency.  The elections are due on 23 June and of course they are a factor in this process.  It is of crucial importance that they are free, fair and transparent and needless to say the Council will be looking closely at that.</p><p>  Bosnia and Herzegovina<b></b>is now lagging behind its neighbours, and this is an issue of concern.  The Bosnian Government and political leaders must make real and substantial progress in order to realise the country's EU perspective.  What is required is clearly laid out in the December Council Conclusions, and in the June 2012 roadmap agreed by the Commission and Bosnia Herzegovina's leaders.  Unfortunately, the timetable for implementing the roadmap has already slipped.</p><p>  This lack of progress is frustrating.  While we do everything in our power to encourage movement on the path to EU integration, this is ultimately a matter for the political leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p><p>  The European Neighbourhood Policy, ENP, was developed in 2004 with the objective of avoiding the emergence of new dividing lines between the enlarged EU and 16 neighbouring countries to the south and the east.  The aims of the policy are to strengthen prosperity, stability and security in the EU's neighbourhood.  The policy covers 22 of the EU's closest neighbours.  These include six to the east, the so-called Eastern Partnership - Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine; and the 16 countries of the Mediterranean and North Africa, which form the Union for the Mediterranean, Algeria, Bosnia, Croatia, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, <font color="#222222">Mauritania</font>, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Palestine, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and the Arab League.  Libya, which has observer status, has recently been asked to join also.  The Union for the Mediterranean is the only forum which brings together both Israel and the Arab states.</p> <p>The ENP is based on individual partnerships between the EU and each individual neighbour through a single policy based on mutual accountability and a shared commitment to the universal values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.</p><p> The Eastern Partnership covers the EU's relationship with the six countries which lie beyond its eastern periphery.  They are all former constituent republics of the Soviet Union, whose hopes and futures will affect all EU member states.  While this is true of both the eastern and southern neighbourhood, the economic potential of the eastern neighbourhood countries give them a particular importance to us in Ireland, looking for new markets to fuel export-led growth.</p><p> The EU has an interest in offering Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine a form of integration with Europe which will transform the lives of its citizens.  The Lisbon treaty specifically recognised this by committing the EU to the development of a special relationship with neighbouring countries aimed at establishing an area of prosperity and good neighbourliness.  This resulted in the launching of the Eastern Partnership in May 2009 at the Prague summit meeting of the EU and its eastern European partners.</p><p> Since the Prague Summit, the Eastern Partnership has established itself as a long-term EU policy for bringing the six eastern European partners closer to the European Union.  In practice this has involved the negotiation of association agreements with all the eastern partner counties.  Association agreements lay out for each country a road-map of reforms, tailored to the situation in each country, in such areas as democratic values, good governance and the rule of law. </p><p> EU financial support is available for the reform efforts of each country according to the principle of more for more.  The more progress they make in reform, the more support they get.  In addition to the association agreements, each eastern partner country is in the process of negotiating a deep and comprehensive free trade area, or DCFTA, which will give them access to the EU and provide opportunities for EU, including Irish, businesses, to export goods and services, and invest in a safe legal environment.</p><p> Negotiations on the association agreements with Armenia, Georgia and Moldova are nearing completion.  Much of the more recent work has been done during our EU Presidency.  It is intended that the final draft of the association agreements with these three countries will be initialled at the next eastern partnership summit, which will take place in Vilnius in November under the Lithuanian EU Presidency.  Negotiations for the association agreement with Azerbaijan began later and are moving at a somewhat slower pace.  However, if the association agreement is ready by November it, too, will be initialled in Vilnius.</p><p> Negotiations for the association agreement for Ukraine are complete and it will hopefully be signed in Vilnius.  This is a critically important year for EU-Ukraine relations, however.  In its conclusions, the December Foreign Affairs Council set out the three issues that Ukraine would need to address convincingly to enable signature of the association agreement in Vilnius.  These issues include the ending of selective justice; legal and judicial reform; and the holding of free and fair parliamentary elections.</p><p> There have been some positive developments recently, including the pardon of former Interior Minister, Yuri Lutsenko, and the former Environmental Protection Minister, Heorhiy Filipchuk, by President Yanukovych.  Mr. Lutsenko's release represents an important step by the Ukrainian authorities towards addressing the EU's concerns about selective justice.  However, members of the joint committee may be aware last week's judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, which found that former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko's pre-trial detention was arbitrary and unlawful.  In light of this judgment, I would call on Ukraine to reconsider carefully Ms Tymoshenko's ongoing imprisonment.</p><p> I would also like to commend the important contribution made by the European Parliament's monitoring mission to Ukraine headed by Mr. Pat Cox, who is well known to all of us, and the former Polish President, Alexander Kwasniewski, in this context.  Last month, the European Parliament extended the mandate of the monitoring mission and President Schulz praised its important work, which has steered EU-Ukraine relations in a positive direction.</p><p> The one eastern partner that is not part of the Eastern Partnership process is Belarus.  As the joint committee will be aware, relations between the EU and Belarus are problematic due to the country's human rights record.  A particular concern relates to political prisoners and continued use of the death penalty, after a brief moratorium.  A list of Belarusian officials who have been active in implementing harassment of opposition or civil society groups, or business figures who are profiting from their closeness to the regime of President Lukashenka, are subject to EU sanctions.  These include a visa ban on visits to EU member states and a freeze on assets held in the EU.  Other countries, including the US, have implemented similar sanctions.  Release and rehabilitation of political prisoners must take place for sanctions to be relaxed.</p><p> All EU member states regard it as important to support civil society in the country.  EU member states represented in Minsk, and our own resident ambassador in Vilnius, have good contact with opposition and civil society groups.  In spite of our differences with Belarus, we believe that we need to maintain a critical dialogue with the authorities also.  We therefore continue to regard it as an eastern partner.  Foreign Minister Makei, although subject to the visa ban, will continue to be invited to eastern partner meetings on a case-by-case basis.  We hope that, in time, the Belarus authorities will come to see the advantages of closer relations with the EU.</p><p> I will now turn to the Southern Neighbourhood.  The dramatic events of 2011 led to a major review of the European Union's relations with the region and forced a reappraisal of the policies and programmes it had pursued up to then.  Over the past couple of years, the issue which has undoubtedly received the closest and most sustained attention from Ireland and the rest of the EU has been the political transformations in the Middle East and North Africa linked to the Arab Spring.  While the crisis in Syria has understandably - and rightly - taken up much of our time, we have also addressed other issues in the region.</p><p> A little over two years on from the popular uprisings which first took hold in Tunisia and Egypt in early 2011, any reasonable assessment must conclude that the process of change we are witnessing has been largely positive in its consequences for the region.  Of course, there have been many challenges and setbacks, with the conflict in Syria clearly presenting a major threat to peace and stability in the region.  However, this should not be allowed to overshadow the very real and positive changes we have seen, such as the holding of democratic elections in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen - effectively, for the first time in most cases.  For its part, the EU is committed to upholding key values, such as respect for human rights and the rule of law, in the efforts it is making to provide support and partnership to the countries undergoing transition.</p><p> The scale of the humanitarian crisis now raging in Syria and across the neighbouring region was brought home vividly to the T&aacute;naiste when he visited a Syrian refugee camp on the Turkish-Syrian border during his visit to Turkey on the 7th and 8th of April.  Well over 70,000 have died, although according to some estimates the total is up to 100,000.  There are more than 1.4 million refugees and over 4 million people within Syria who are in need of humanitarian assistance. </p><p> Ireland and the EU have been to the fore in responding to this major humanitarian crisis.  The T&aacute;naiste was able to announce a further &euro;1 million in assistance from Ireland for ICRC and UNHCR operations within Turkey during his recent visit.  This brings our total aid over the past year to &euro;8.15 million.</p><p> The generous and humane manner in which Syria's neighbours - in particular Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq - have dealt with the huge outflow of refugees from Syria has to be repeatedly acknowledged.  The crisis is imposing a major strain on hard-pressed resources and on the ability of these countries to cope.  It underlines the urgent need for progress in ending the violence and putting in place some form of political process which can set Syria on the path to political transition.</p><p> Discussions are continuing within the Foreign Affairs Council on how the EU can most effectively promote a political solution and use its not inconsiderable influence in that direction.  In February, we renewed the full range of EU sanctions in place against the Assad regime in Syria for a period of three months.  A further decision on their renewal will be taken at the Council on 27 May.</p><p> We have already made clear on a number of occasions that Ireland does not favour any actions which could contribute to greater militarisation of the conflict.</p> <p>This will continue to be our position.</p><p> There can be little doubt about the growing influence of extremist groups on the ground in Syria.  It is in all of our interests that the capacity that already exists in Syria for armed violence should not be augmented.  Rather, we should work to promote the earliest possible end to the conflict and the initiation of a political transition.  The UN Security Council can still play a decisive role in supporting Special Representative Brahimi's efforts to promote a political settlement.  I urge all Security Council members accordingly to exercise responsibility and leadership by adopting a strong, new resolution addressing issues such as a comprehensive arms embargo and the need for accountability.</p><p> Ireland firmly supports Secretary General Ban in his efforts to comprehensively investigate any possible use of chemical weapons in Syria.  The threat which the conflict in Syria poses to the overall regional stability and security is abundantly clear.  Lebanon has already been hugely affected through the influx of 400,000 Syrian refugees and outbreaks of related violence in northern Lebanon.  The April Foreign Affairs Council meeting reviewed developments in that country following the resignation of former Prime Minister Mikati and the appointment of a new Prime Minister, Tammam Salam.  We must ensure Lebanon, a country that has suffered too long from being in Syria's shadow, can avoid being drawn directly into the conflict.</p><p> Our continent's history leaves the EU uniquely positioned to fully understand what drove the citizens of Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria and elsewhere to challenge the continued denial of their basic rights and to demand a say in the decisions that shape their future.  A key feature of the European neighbourhood strategy is the adoption of an incentive-based approach.  This promises closer political association, increased economic integration, improved mobility and additional financial support to those partner countries genuinely committed to political and democratic reforms.</p><p> New funding streams of almost &euro;700 million have been made available to southern Mediterranean countries for this purpose.  During 2011 and 2012, task forces involving all EU institutions and the private sector were set up for Tunisia, Jordan and Egypt to act as a focal point for assistance to these countries.  In 2011, an EU Special Representative for the Southern Mediterranean, Bernardino Le&oacute;n, who was in Dublin this week, was tasked with enhancing the EU's political dialogue with those countries in the region engaged in transition.  There is ample evidence that the ENP works best when a political willingness to reform exists and when civil society, including the media, is allowed to play an active role in the national reform process.  We all appreciate the key role civil society plans in social and economic policy reform, in promoting women's rights, in supporting freedom of expression, pressing for media freedom and striving for greater social justice and in holding governments to account.</p><p> We have also intensified trade relations with countries in the south.  Negotiations with Morocco on a deep and comprehensive free trade agreement have recently commenced, while similar talks with Tunisia and Jordan are expected to start shortly.  Politically the situation remains positive, with clear democratic progress in Libya, Tunisia and Egypt, while basic freedoms have been advanced in many other countries.  Ireland and its EU partners have had a clear and consistent message of support for these democratic changes while respecting that the countries concerned are best placed to determine their own pace of reform.  The Arab transformation will remain a major priority for the European Union and Ireland at all levels of our international engagement.  We will use whatever influence we have in our current EU Presidency role to support and promote European and UN efforts and initiatives to promote democratic progress and economic development among the countries in transition in the region and a peaceful resolution of the Syrian conflict.</p><p> My remarks were long but there were many countries involved and topics to cover so I thank the committee for its indulgence.</p></speech>

We will now take questions and I ask members to confine their remarks to questions and not to make speeches because we have a long agenda this afternoon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.290" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013050800005#D00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for her detailed contribution.  I presume we can take for granted that Croatia will accede to the European Union on 1 July.  With regard to the other countries that have candidate status, is there any hoped for timeline in the European Commission for possible accession dates for each of the countries?  Apart from Croatia, is it expected any other country will accede to the EU during the time of the next multi-annual financial framework, which lasts until 2020?  Has provision been made for additional funding if other countries join the EU?  Has it been decided how many seats there will be for the European elections?  The Minister of State mentioned that elections have already been held in Croatia.</p><p>  The Minister of State also mentioned the Lisbon treaty providing for better neighbourhood working relationships.  That is welcome because we all need stability, the rule of law and additional trade opportunities with neighbouring areas. </p><p>  This is the third week in a row the Syrian conflict has arisen at the committee.  The Minister of State mentioned casualty figures of 100,000 dead, with 6.8 million in need of aid, more than 50% of whom are children, 4.25 million internally displaced and 1.3 million seeking refuge.  Barry Andrews, the CEO of GOAL was here two weeks ago and said this is the humanitarian crisis of this generation.  Has there been any reaction at EU or UN level to the outcome of the negotiations between Secretary of State Kerry and the Russian authorities last night, where they both spoke about the need for international negotiations?  Hopefully following the deadlock that has pertained at EU level and the Security Council's failure to achieve a resolution, this is a positive step forward.  Has there been any international reaction or support for the outcome of those discussion last night?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.291" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013050800005#D00400"><p>I accept what the Minister of State said about the generally positive progress following the Arab spring but there is no doubt in some countries it has been one step forward and two steps back for women.  The situation in some of the countries is worse for women and they are being deprived of certain rights and freedoms they had under the previous regimes.  I hope that will form part of any EU discussion with the governments in these countries.</p><p>  There have been positive steps on Kurdish issues in Turkey.  Does the Minister of State have any more information on that?  We have had representations before us on Bosnia Herzegovina.  There is concern that democracy is not moving in the way everyone would like.  The Minister of State said in her speech that it is down to the political leaders but Europe could play a stronger role.</p><p>  We had a meeting with the Clean Clothes group on what happened in Bangladesh, and asked also about the judge from Colombia.  The question arose of very strong labour rights and laws to be included in any of the agreements, and not just lip service to human rights.  There must be specific sections in the agreements on the rights of workers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.292" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013050800005#D00500"><p>How is the EU assisting Lebanon during this difficult time?  The security situation in the country is fragile and the conflict in Syria is having an impact.</p> <p>There are 300,000 Palestinian refugees in the region, but according to the UNHCR, there are now 453,000 Syrian refugees in Lebanon, which would equate to 500,000 people arriving in Ireland over a two-year period.  How is the EU addressing the humanitarian situation not only in Syria but in the neighbouring countries such as Lebanon?</p><p> When the Minister of State referred to EU enlargement, she mentioned that Bosnia-Herzegovina was lagging far behind in its reforms.  Is this due to a lack of political and public support for EU membership?  Are the neighbouring countries helping to push the necessary reforms?  Is the EU giving adequate support and assistance to the implementation of the necessary reforms in that region?</p><p> When the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, appeared before the joint committee, he expressed the hope that some of the blockages in the accession negotiations with Turkey would be removed during the Irish Presidency.  Will the Minister of State update us on the progress in that area?</p><p> Following the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, the denial of freedom to travel and work in member states caused difficulties.  Have we learned anything from the difficulties that many Bulgarian and Romanian people experienced?  I understand that a high percentage of the people trafficked to Britain and Ireland and other parts of Europe come from that region?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.294" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1036" speakername="Lucinda Creighton" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013050800006#E00200"><p>Deputy Smith asked about countries' candidate status and the likely period before accession.  At this stage it is pretty certain that Croatia will join the EU on 1 July.  There were some legacy issues that had to be resolved before the ratification could take place in the Slovenian Parliament.  That has happened.  I am pleased to say we were able to play a constructive role as Presidency in ensuring that.  There are no likely difficulties with ratification.</p><p>  One cannot put a time limit on accession.  A country will only receive a date for accession after it has gone through the entire negotiating process.  Quite frankly, the accession process is more complicated and demanding of potential member states than it was in the past.  That is no bad thing.  We can look on it as a positive in terms of the credibility of the process.  Of course, the candidate countries can find it frustrating but I think they recognise and understand that we must get it right.  I cannot put a timeframe on the accession of Turkey, Iceland, Serbia and other potential candidate countries.  The negotiations will go at their own pace.  Often it is up to the candidate countries in terms of how quickly they wish to embrace the reform process.  As I noted in my introductory remarks, the Croatian process took ten years.  It is not a quick process.  With the additional burdens associated with the negotiation process, it will take some time for any of the countries I have mentioned.</p><p>  I mentioned that Croatia has already held the elections for the 12 seats in the EU Parliament.  In light of the cap on the number of seats in the EU Parliament, which is set at 751 seats, it means that some countries will lose a seat.  At present the proposal from the European Parliament - and this was overwhelmingly endorsed by the Parliament both in plenary and committee - is that Ireland, along with a number of other countries would have their number of seats reduced by one.  It is likely to be finally decided upon by the European Council, but that is the likely outcome.  It is our expectation.  It is highly unlikely that the Council would overturn a very strongly endorsed recommendation of the Parliament as this is ultimately a question of the composition of and future of the Parliament in light of the various restrictions that apply on foot of the Lisbon treaty.</p><p>  On the question of the scale of the humanitarian crisis in Syria, a point also raised by Deputy Crowe in the context of the neighbouring countries, the humanitarian effort is not simply focused on Syria and is focused instead on all of the neighbouring regions.  When the T&aacute;naiste was in Turkey, he visited some of the camps in the bordering region and, unfortunately, those camps are in a number of neighbouring countries.  The situation is quiet dire.  The EU is playing a significant role in providing education, shelter and food for all of the affected refuges, particularly children.  There have been challenges in terms of accessibility, in particular within the borders of Syria, but those are being overcome.  There is a major effort being led by the European Union, supported by all of the member states and other international actors.  That is a major priority at present.</p><p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised the Arab spring and the question of women's rights.  When we talk about human rights and fundamental freedoms and the sort of democratic changes that we are seeing in the Arab spring countries, the very heart of the issue is equality and women's rights and all the rights and freedoms that we expect and enjoy in the democratic free world.  It is at the core of our discussions, negotiations and all our bilateral contacts with all of the Arab spring countries.  It is a very firm focus.  I suppose the fact that the High Representative for the European Union and Vice President of the Commission, Catherine Ashton, is a woman is an important matter and it sends a very strong signal in terms of who is representing us.  I think it is very positive.</p><p>  In terms of Turkey, there have been significant improvements in terms of relations with the Kurdish minority and the PKK.  The ceasefire has been widely welcomed across the European Union and beyond.  This helps to strengthen and improve relations with Turkey.  There is a long way to go but it is very brave and courageous step on both sides and it is very important.</p><p>  There are other reforms that are happening and need to continue.  We need to see momentum, whether it is freedom of press, freedom of expression and association or whatever.  There are major challenges but we have seen positive developments and I expect that will continue.</p><p>  The issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina is frequently raised in this committee.  I know that a range of interesting and expert speakers from the region and people who have expertise in the region have come to speak at this committee.  I visited there last summer, and at that time, we had reasonably high hopes because the high level dialogue was under way and was beginning to show some concrete results.  There was a clear timeline in place.  Unfortunately, the nature of the political situation and the local elections interfered with some of the progress we expected to see.  As I said in my opening remarks, Bosnia-Herzegovina has fallen behind in the implementation of the roadmap that has been agreed.</p> <p>That is a result of differences among the various political parties, etc.  We must keep pushing in this regard.</p><p> I am a firm believer in the transformative and positive impact of the enlargement process on countries such as Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The latter is some way from being granted candidate status but it can and will be positively impacted upon by the transformation that is happening in the region.  I refer here to Croatia joining the Union this year and to the fact that there will be positive signals in respect of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, in the very near future.  We hope that Serbia is going to enter into negotiations and that matters will move forward in the context of the association and stabilisation agreement relating to Kosovo.  All of this contributes.  The western Balkans is a fragile region but it has a great future in front of it and there is much hope for it.  The emphasis of moving towards EU accession in the context of reform, improvements to democracy, building institutions and enforcing the rule of law will have a positive effect on Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There is no question of removing the focus from that country.  Rather, it is a case of engaging even more intensively and of ensuring that the roadmap is followed and that further progress is made.</p><p> On the point relating to free trade agreements, I participated - on behalf of the Presidency - in some debates on the situation in this regard prior to the very tragic events in Bangladesh.  As everyone is aware, there have been other such occurrences in recent months.  These are often caused by poor physical and environmental working conditions in what are often substandard buildings.  This is a matter which the European Commission takes very seriously and of which it is taking cognisance in the context of the free trade arrangements that are being agreed with many of the countries involved.  Account must also be taken of the existence of corporate social responsibility.  This is an extremely difficult challenge, particularly as western countries and consumers are benefiting from the extremely cheap goods being produced in many of the countries in question.  The companies responsible for producing such goods must apply certain standards and we, as consumers, must demand that they are applied.  In addition, the International Labour Organization, ILO, has a very important role to play in the context of making demands, monitoring and inspecting operations and ensuring that commitments are fulfilled.  A number of elements are at play here, one of which relates to the conditions built into free trade arrangements by the EU.  However, other major players in the western hemisphere must also demand better and higher standards.  A multi-pronged approach is required but I am certainly of the view that the EU must take the lead.  We are leading on it but perhaps we need to do more.  I am sure this matter will be the subject of further discussion at future meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council and in the European Parliament.  This matter is currently in sharp focus and it is my opinion that the Irish Government is in a position to demonstrate leadership.  We will certainly continue with our efforts in this regard.</p><p> A number of blockages exist in the context of Turkish accession to the EU.  I referred earlier to some of the human rights concerns.  Obviously, a number of bilateral issues in respect of certain member states also arise.  Those issues are extremely important.  On a number of occasions I have voiced my disappointment with regard to the stance adopted by the Government of Turkey during the Cyprus Presidency and the fact that a decision was taken not to recognise certain statements, etc., from the EU.  We are moving beyond that now and we want relations with Cyprus to improve.  A window of opportunity has been created by the French Government's removal of its reservations in respect of certain chapters.  We hope, therefore, that we will be able to open a negotiating chapter by the end of the Irish Presidency.  All going well in the coming weeks, we are on track to achieve this.  The working group relating to this matter, which is chaired by the Irish Presidency, is involved in intensive deliberations in respect of it.  I am confident that we are on course to break the deadlock which has obtained for a number of years.</p><p> The final matter raised relates to the challenges which exist for some of the new member states.  There is no doubt that challenges exist within the European Union, and not just bordering regions, in the context of organised crime.  Organised crime is a problem in Ireland, Bulgaria and every member state in between.  Concerns with regard to the rule of law, organised crime, corruption and so on inform our new approach to enlargement.  This approach involves dealing with these difficult negotiating chapters from the very beginning of the process rather than leaving them until the end.  They are pursued from the outset and they are linked to the development of other chapters.  This is a positive development and it means that we will be in a position to deal with the significant challenges that exist in terms of the rule of law, the freedom of judiciaries, stamping out corruption and so forth at an early stage in the accession process.  The candidate countries, as well as existing member states, are embracing what is being done in this regard.</p><p> I will not comment on one or two particular member states.  We all face challenges.  In the context of the member states which acceded most recently, namely, Romania and Bulgaria, the co-operation and verification mechanism, CVM - a post-accession monitoring process - applies.  I am of the view that this is a bad mechanism and that it does not represent the optimum way in which to proceed.  When candidate countries become EU member states, then they should be treated like all other member states.  Monitoring and implementation should be carried out before accession.  It is not really credible to carry them out afterwards.  I am very much in favour of the so-called new approach because it allows us to tackle the concerns and challenges which exist and ensure that the relevant reforms are introduced prior to accession.  This means that every member state will be treated equally and fairly.  I am of the view that this is preferable to trying to deal with matters after the fact.</p></speech>

I congratulate her, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach on the excellent way in which they have guided the European Union during Ireland's Presidency to date.  There is no doubt that Ireland, a small nation with a population of 4.5 million, is doing an exquisite job in the context of its Presidency.</p><p>  I listened with great interest to the Minister of State's presentation.  Of all the countries and regions to which she referred, there are three with which I am disappointed.  Sadly, I am most disappointed with Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Consider, for example, how the people there suffered in the past and the fact that Croatia will become a full member state of the European Union in July.  In addition, Serbia has made concessions, acknowledged the role it played in Srebrenica and softened the tenor of its relationships with Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.  Both Croatia and Serbia are moving forward and Kosovo has taken a number of phenomenally progressive steps, particularly in light of the Serbs there being informed by Serbia that Kosovo is now their country and that it will not be intervening on their behalf.  Bosnia-Herzegovina is the bad news story here.  I am of the view that we should renew our efforts to assist it.  Belarus is just Belarus and I will say nothing further about it.</p><p>  What is happening in Syria is horrendous.  I am extremely disturbed by the US position on Syria and its suggestion that the opposition there should be armed.  This is particularly alarming in light of the fact that there has been a preliminary finding to the effect that the latter has been using chemical weapons.</p> <p>I do not see the Americans' logic in believing that they can resolve a situation by arming the opposition when the Chinese or Russians will reinforce Assad's armaments.  The EU's position is correct and worthy of support.</p><p> I am enthusiastic about the Eastern Partnership and the southern neighbourhood process.  We just met the speaker of the Macedonian Assembly and his colleagues.  I spoke at length with the Albanian minority MP, who is happy with progress and the Albanian Government's attitude to the role of minorities in Macedonia.  Surely the country's name can no longer be a major stumbling block.  There must be a concession.  It is a ridiculously long and stupid name.  We call it "Macedonia" in our bilateral talks with it, but we must otherwise use its long title.  If we can overcome the naming issue, great progress can be made quickly.</p><p> I congratulate the Ukrainian Government, notwithstanding the criticisms.  Ms Yulia Tymoshenko is mentioned left, right and centre.  I understand that the European Court of Human Rights has made an important statement.  Just as Croatia and Serbia have taken incremental steps, I can see the incremental steps being taken by Ukraine's President, Mr. Viktor Yanukovych.  We should send words of support to encourage his release of additional prisoners, including Ms Tymoshenko.</p><p> The Minister of State mentioned another country in which I am interested, one that I also discussed with the Macedonians, namely, Albania.  The country and its diaspora comprise a delicate issue.  Albania is holding elections in June, as is Mongolia, which one of our Ministers visited on a trade mission.  Mongolia's growth is phenomenal.  Is the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, or Ireland monitoring its elections?  We view them as an incremental stage in a country's progress along the democratic path.</p><p> There are negatives, including the tragedy of Bosnia-Herzegovina, BiH, and the even worse tragedies of Belarus and Syria, but progress is being made by many of the other countries to which the Minister of State referred.  I welcome the debate with the Turkish on developing their relationship with Europe.</p></speech>

I wish her well for the coming months.  It has been a busy, but successful, period for her.</p><p>  Regarding Libyan refugees, I am a member of the Council of Europe, as are one or two other committee members.  Last week, I attended a meeting of the Council's migration committee.  A representative of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, made a presentation on the issue.  The 1.3 million Libyan refugees are primarily located in Jordan, Turkey and Greece, countries that are themselves in development.  Greece is facing its own difficulties.  We should recognise the fact that, since the refugees' homes are gone, there is no basis for them to return.  The Minister of State mentioned that the UN was to the fore in providing humanitarian assistance, but the Libyan refugees need to be supported.  Is Europe discussing how to integrate them?  The US has done some work in this regard.  The nettle needs to be grasped.</p></speech>

Every member will welcome the EU's enlargement on 1 July, but is the Minister of State satisfied that due diligence has been carried out on Croatia?  Does it meet all of the criteria?  Another Greece-type situation cannot arise among the joining countries.</p><p>  Many members have addressed the issue of BiH, but which of the roadmap's key targets is it failing to meet?  Among some elements of the Bosnian community in Ireland, there is a feeling that we are not doing enough to support BiH's membership.  I do not necessarily agree.  Are there plans to push BiH's case strongly during the Irish Presidency of the EU?</p><p>  The Syrian situation is appalling.  The death toll is rising and the number of refugees is increasing.  Is there any chink of light on the horizon?  The situation appears to be worsening, given the allegations about the use of chemical weapons.  Would any significant move on the part of our EU Presidency make a difference?</p></speech>

Disputed areas are the source of conflict in the region and can affect the Eastern Partnership, particularly given the fact that Lithuania will take the Presidency over from us.  The partnership theme comprises a part of Lithuania's upcoming six-month programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.305" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1036" speakername="Lucinda Creighton" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013050800008#G00900"><p>Let me start with Deputy Byrne.  Some of the points were touched on by Senator Mullins.  There is no simple solution to the BiH situation.  While I take on board the viewpoint that the EU has not done enough to support it, one could equally argue that BiH has not done enough to help itself down the path.  Even among its community in Ireland, there is a sense of grievance about other countries moving on while BiH is not.</p><p>  I am an enthusiastic supporter of EU enlargement.  I believe firmly in its benefits for the EU as a whole and for the countries seeking to join.  However, we must also see a willingness and desire to join.  We can provide funding, expertise and other supports for the necessary reforms, but if national governments and structures do not possess the will to undertake these reforms, what can EU member states do?  One can bring a horse to water, etc.</p><p>  There is merit in the first viewpoint.  I spent time in BiH last summer and met people of all backgrounds and political persuasions.  There is a strand of thinking to the effect that, as the constitutional and governance arrangements are outdated, BiH now has an opportunity to revamp, move on and do something different internally to prepare it for the path towards European integration.</p> <p>Perhaps that needs to happen first.  I am unsure and I do not have all the answers.  Certainly, we need to consider it in a new way.  Perhaps the accession of Croatia and probably a new direction or new momentum for other countries in the region will present the opportunity to do it.  It is not working as it should at the moment and we are all deeply concerned about that.</p><p> It is a magnificent country.  It is geographically spectacular to drive through but it is also fascinating.  We owe a great deal to the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The whole of Europe and the entire Balkans region owe them a great deal.  We need to consider it in a new light but I do not underestimate how difficult that will be.  It has had a difficult recent political history that must be overcome, but these problems are being overcome in other places.  We need only reflect on the breakthrough in Serbia and Kosovo in recent weeks, a historic solution to the issues that exist over northern Kosovo.  I am a great optimist and if that can be achieved then I believe it must give hope for the rest of the region, especially for Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p><p> I agree with Deputy Byrne on the question of Syria and the idea of arming the opposition.  In certain circumstances it could be a necessary step.  I would never rule it out, but in the case of Syria there are so many unknowns and uncertainties about the opposition and about who we are dealing with.  Of course we have recognised the opposition in Syria.  I have spoken to some people in the United States Administration who are close to the decision-making on this issue.  There is no doubt in my mind that it would fuel further bloodshed and further carnage in that country and we cannot support that.</p><p> I realise the EU position is frustrating.  However, we have been discussing the western Balkans.  Given everything we witnessed there 20 years ago, the idea of standing by and watching similar carnage on a grander scale in Syria and doing nothing is not an option.  At the same time, fuelling even further carnage is a worse option.  Therefore, we are presented with a dreadful situation and we must use all our political clout to bring the members of the UN Security Council who have refused to co-operate to the table and oblige them to co-operate.  That will not be easy but I believe there is progress and that there is a chink of light, to use the words of Senator Clune.  However, it is complex and certainly Mr. al-Assad is not in a place where he is willing to simply walk out the door.  Whatever must take place to help him to make that decision should take place and we should be supportive of it.  I do not believe that arming the opposition is the solution.  I do not believe it would achieve anything positive.</p><p> The question of Macedonia and the treatment of minorities there was raised.  Much progress has been made, there is no doubt about that.  When I was there I met one of the Ministers responsible for minority rights.  There has been demonstrable progress and that is to be welcomed.  Macedonia is the country in the region that had made the most progress aside from Croatia, but it has been frustrated in recent years.  Our national position has been to support Macedonia's path to EU integration.  It is the right thing to do and it is right for the region.  We must find a solution.  Both sides must be willing to find a solution to the main issue.  As far as I am concerned it can be temporary, medium-term or long-term.  I have no preference, but we must show the people of Macedonia that their future is in Europe.  We must honour our commitment of ten years ago, which will be marked by our conference on enlargement at the end of this month in Farmleigh Castle, Dublin; the EU must face up to its side of the bargain.  I hope the difficulties can be overcome but it will be difficult and I share the frustration.</p><p> I agree with the point in respect of the Ukraine.  Progress must be commended, recognised and rewarded but at same time we cannot turn a blind eye to the points raised by the European Convention on Human Rights, points which have been a matter of concern to the European Union for some time.  There is absolute consistency in the ECHR findings <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council.  Undoubtedly, progress has been made.  I hope that we will see the association agreement signed in Vilnius in November but that is up to the Ukraine and we need to see action.  I reiterate the call for the release of Yulia Tymoshenko.  That would represent a significant and important step and it is something that would be welcomed by everyone in the EU.  We will see.</p><p> There was a question about election monitoring in Albania and Mongolia.  Mongolia joined the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe during our chairmanship.  The monitoring of elections will take place under the auspices of the parliamentary assembly and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights.</p><p> I chaired the EU-Albania summit which took place in Luxembourg two weeks ago.  We had an extensive and wide-ranging assessment of progress in Albania with Commissioner Fuele and the European integration Minister, my counterpart.  It was a good, constructive meeting.  There will be election monitoring in Albania.  There is a clear understanding by the Government there that there needs to be free and fair elections.  It is an absolute prerequisite and it is essential from the point of view of the European Union.  It is essential for the integration process and for the credibility of Albania.  We have received assurances but we will watch and see.  We will be following the election monitoring reports closely.</p><p> The question about refugees followed from the earlier discussion on Syria.  I accept the point that many of those currently fleeing Syria will not be going back any time soon but we must aspire to the return of the refugees in due course.  That must be the goal.  People who have been driven out of their homes should be able to go back.  That is an important priority.  There are member states of the European Union which have offered and which are willing to receive refugees.  Part of the difficulty is the economic crisis in Europe which makes it more difficult and makes countries and Governments more reluctant.  However, there are member states - I am sure we will be one of them - for the medium-term relocating of refugees.  The goal must be to see as many of them as possible return as quickly as possible.</p><p> Senator Mullins asked a question about whether due diligence has been carried out on Croatia.  If he asked any of my Croatian counterparts, they would say due diligence has been done to within an inch of their lives.  It has been a rigorous process.  The professionalism of the Commission in terms of the reporting at every stage has been robust.  Croatia will be a great addition to the European Union.  It is a country that has great potential to grow, contribute economically and culturally and in every other way.  I have no concerns about that and I believe Croatia will be a welcome addition.  Senator Mullins referred to Bosnia as well and I have covered that.</p></speech>

In terms of Nagorno-Karabakh and the ongoing so-called frozen conflict, from the point of view of the OSCE Ireland was very involved.  It is a very delicate and difficult situation, and one to which the OSCE probably has the greatest contribution to make.  There is a rich energy supply from many countries in the  region.  It is in the interests of the EU to foster strong relations with all of them and try to encourage good neighbourly relations, which is part of the purpose of the Eastern Partnership.  It is not always easy but it is contributing positively.  It is an ongoing process; there is no simple solution to some of the disputes which exist.  Undoubtedly, there are draws, such as deeper integration with Europe, closer economic ties and opportunities for the consumer market in Europe, and <i>vice versa</i>.  There is a carrot rather than a stick approach.  It has great potential to deliver, for the EU and the countries involved.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.313" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/974" speakername="Pat Breen" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013050800010#J00800"><p>We will continue the meeting with a discussion on two very important topics, the second Global Irish Economic Forum and the undocumented Irish in the US.  It is an appropriate time to discuss this with external action unit.  </p><p>  To assist in the consideration of these matters, we are joined by Mr. Niall Burgess, director general of the Anglo-Irish division in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr. Joe  Hackett, director, Irish abroad unit, and Mr. Karl Gardner, deputy director, Irish abroad unit.  They are all very welcome.  </p><p>  The second Global Irish Economic Forum was held in October 2011.  It provided an opportunity for members of the Government, along with Ministers of State, representatives of the Opposition, senior officials from Government Departments and State agencies and leading members of the Irish business and cultural sectors to meet directly with many of the most influential members of the Irish diaspora and discuss Ireland's priorities for economic renewal, job creation and the restoration of Ireland's reputation abroad.  </p><p>  When this committee met the T&aacute;naiste after St. Patrick's Day 2012 to review the progress of the forum, he told us that to be successful the forum must be able to demonstrate its contribution towards Ireland's economic regeneration.  We look forward to hearing today what progress has be made on the key outcomes and what remains to be done.  </p><p>  The more than 300 members of the global Irish network who are valuable partners in the Global Irish Economic Forum are just one part of the story of the Irish diaspora.  It is very important that we continue to prioritise the plight of the many undocumented Irish in the US.  Their status leaves them in a legal limbo which affects their lives in many ways, whether it is their ability to get secure employment or travel home for family funerals.  Addressing this issue and reforming our migration arrangements with the US are important priorities for the Government, and I am sure members of the committee will be interested to know what work is progressing, that is, what is being done by the Irish abroad unit and our embassies and what is happening in Washington, in particular the immigration reform Bill in the US Senate.</p><p>  Before I invite the witnesses to make their presentation, I advise them that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  They are directed that only comments or evidence in regard to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official in such a way as to identify him or her.</p><p>  I call on Mr. Burgess to make his presentation.  I apologise; there is a vote in the Seanad, but I am sure members will return.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.314" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Burgess" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013050800010#J00900"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I am pleased to appear before the committee this afternoon to discuss the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and embassies and consulates abroad in support of Irish emigrants, and more broadly, in engaging with the Irish diaspora.  I will focus my initial comments on current issues facing the Irish abroad, in particular the undocumented in the US and on the follow up to the last Global Irish Economic Forum.  Much of this work is co-ordinated by our Irish abroad unit and I am joined today by my colleagues Mr. Joe Hackett, director of the unit, and Mr. Karl Gardner, the deputy director.</p><p>  It is fair to say that for as long as Ireland has had a diplomatic network, the Department and its network of missions have always worked closely with Irish communities abroad.  This work took on an even closer and more practical character following the report of the task force on policy regarding emigrants in 2002.  This report led to the establishment in 2004 of a dedicated unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Irish abroad unit, whose task was to help address the needs of our most vulnerable emigrants and to provide policy support to the Government's engagement with the diaspora.  Since then, the unit has been fortunate in the strong bipartisan support and assistance it has received from the Oireachtas and this committee.</p><p>  Members will be aware that globalisation and communications technology has changed, in a significant way, the nature of the debate surrounding diaspora engagement.  From a position whereby our people abroad were considered as distant and separated, international discussion now revolves around building mutually beneficial partnerships with these communities, which help to support a strong connection by addressing the needs of those communities in their new homes, and also by drawing more actively on their knowledge, experience and goodwill.</p><p>  Ireland is not alone in this objective.  Other countries, such China, India and Singapore, devote increasing thought and resources to harnessing the potential of their diasporas.  I am pleased to say, however, that Ireland has remained to the forefront of this work.  Whether in delivering peace in Northern Ireland, spurring economic development, raising awareness of our culture or creating a positive brand in their adopted homes, we are fortunate to possess a global Irish presence which makes an ever more valuable contribution to Ireland.</p><p>  Today, our diaspora engagement policy has two key strands.  First, through the emigrant support programme, we work with almost 200 Irish community organisations in over 20 countries to provide support to Irish emigrants.  Since 2004, Irish groups ranging from those providing front-line services to those most at need, including the elderly, isolated, vulnerable and new arrivals to those working in the culture and heritage space have received grants of over &euro;100 million.</p><p>  In line with recommendations made by this committee, we are engaging with communities which are receiving larger numbers of new emigrants such as those in Australia and Canada.  In Canada, we support the new Irish Canadian Immigration Centre in Toronto, while in Australia, the main welfare bureaux in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane all secured additional funding in 2012. </p> <p>Our embassies in Canberra and Ottawa are also working to provide support to new communities in more distant centres in Western Australia and western Canada.  Indeed, projects aimed at supporting the needs of new emigrants are a very specific focus of the 2013 programme, which has just closed.</p><p> Immigration reform is an issue affecting the welfare of many Irish people living in the United States.  We are keenly aware of the strong interest of this committee in the situation facing the undocumented Irish in that country and are appreciative of efforts by the Chairman and members in support of these people's plight, particularly during their visits to the United States.  A resolution of this matter has long been a priority for the Government in its ongoing contacts with the United States Administration and Congress.  The Government has also attached great importance to providing for future flows of migration between Ireland and the United States through the extension of the so-called E3 visa scheme to include Irish citizens.</p><p> In this context, we very much welcome the recent publication of the United States Senate Bill 744, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Bill , which provides for reform of the immigration system.  This legislation, which was drafted over several months by a bipartisan group of eight Senators, includes provisions that would help to resolve the plight of thousands of undocumented Irish people who are living illegally in the United States.  It also provides for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the United States.  Its provisions, if adopted, would help to end the great hardship and uncertainty faced by undocumented Irish in the United States and their families here in Ireland.  The inclusion of a new provision to allow several thousand Irish citizens to avail of legal employment opportunities every year is particularly welcome.</p><p> Both of these issues were a key focus of the ongoing contacts undertaken by the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste with political leaders in the United States, particularly during their visit to Washington DC in the week of St. Patrick's Day when they discussed the prospects for progress with Ireland's key friends on Capitol Hill and in the Administration.  The Government has maintained close contact with the key players through our Embassy in Washington since the publication of the Bill.  The issues involved are complex and sensitive ones within the United States political system and much further debate is likely to be required before the final shape of any agreed legislation becomes clear.  The T&aacute;naiste and Ambassador Collins and his team in Washington will continue to work towards securing a solution for the undocumented.  We are again fortunate to be supported in this work by several Irish community organisations, including the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, Chicago Celts for Immigration Reform and the Ancient Order of Hibernians.</p><p> The second element of our policy is focused around the work of the Global Irish Network, a group of more than 300 of the most influential Irish-connected business figures drawn from almost 40 countries.  Established after the first Farmleigh forum, the network provides invaluable advice, facilitation and practical assistance to the Government and Irish companies.  As I said, we are very fortunate that we can call upon the reservoir of goodwill, expertise and support that exists among our diaspora.  In October 2011 we saw a powerful demonstration of this commitment when 270 members of the Global Irish Network travelled, at their own expense, to the Global Irish Economic Forum in Dublin Castle.  This ambitious event built upon the initial forum convened at Farmleigh in 2009.  As the Chairman will be aware, having participated in the forum at Dublin Castle, the members of the Global Irish Network are deeply committed to making a practical contribution to this country's recovery and further development.</p><p> The outcomes of the forum provide tangible evidence of the benefits to be gained by engaging with our overseas communities.  At this stage all the key outcomes have been completed or significantly progressed.  For example, as a direct result of the forum more than 320,000 additional tourists are expected to visit Ireland this year through The Gathering.  Network members have acted as ambassadors for The Gathering initiative and several have organised significant events in Ireland as part of that initiative.  In the area of job creation we have worked through investment events in New York and Dublin to target new sources of foreign direct investment.  Since its launch in March 2012, more than 6,280 people have registered with ConnectIreland and 800 companies have been suggested to it by people from across the world.  Fifty of those companies are now in advanced discussions regarding locating in Ireland.</p><p> In the area of education and training, the Farmleigh Fellowship will provide 100 Irish graduates with Asian experience over the 2010-2015 period.  There has also been support for Irish small and medium-sized enterprises, with more than 100 participants signing up to the Global Irish Contacts programme, which directly links the diaspora with Irish companies looking to achieve international growth.  The programme now has expertise in 32 markets across 14 sectors and facilitated 70 engagements in 2012, including in Korea, Singapore and the United States.  Engagements have continued this year in areas such as one-to-one mentoring and advice, market and sector briefings, trade missions, sectoral events and investments.  Our SME sector policy has also been positively shaped by advice provided at the forum.  Members welcomed the introduction of the temporary partial credit guarantee scheme and micro-finance fund and the appointment of successful entrepreneurs as international start-up ambassadors.</p><p> The development of the Global Irish Network is helping to shape a forward-looking, strategic relationship between Ireland and our diaspora and has facilitated individuals taking on specific projects.  For instance, my colleague at the Anglo-Irish division, Mr. Sean O'Driscoll, is working closely with our Embassy and State agencies to enhance our relationship with Japan.  Last year Mr. Irial Finan of Coca-Cola organised an Invest in Ireland round-table conference in Dublin to coincide with the Navy versus Notre Dame football match.</p><p> The T&aacute;naiste has decided to convene a third Global Irish Economic Forum in Dublin Castle on 4 and 5 October.  The overall focus of the forum will be job creation and, in line with the views of the membership, the emphasis will be on four specific issues, namely, overcoming the challenges facing the domestic economy, with particular emphasis on tackling youth unemployment; financial services and public financing; technology; and education, with particular emphasis on higher education.  While the format and programme remain to be finalised, the forum will include several new elements including direct engagement between the forum and the Irish SME sector, greater involvement of the third level sector and greater participation by network members in developing and facilitating discussions during the forum.</p><p> I hope I have provided a useful overview of some of the work undertaken with and in support of the Irish abroad by the Department.  I and my colleagues will be happy to answer any questions members have.</p></speech>

Mr. Burgess may be aware that an all-party Oireachtas group has been set up to co-ordinate efforts on this issue.</p> <p>It was established previously and fell by the wayside.  Reference was made to the importance of a bipartisan approach to this issue.  How important is that when trying to sell the Bill in the US?</p><p> I refer to undocumented migrants in Ireland.  Does the Department have numbers in this regard?  How many undocumented Americans live in Ireland?  Would it be helpful if we adopted legislation to address these people?</p><p> One of the criticisms is that we have not used positive events such as St. Patrick's Day to open up to many of the people who are key to immigration reform.  Some of them would not necessarily be friends of Ireland.  How can we use events such as that in the future to bring them closer to the Irish position or to even create an opportunity to explain our position on immigration reform?</p></speech>

Where do Ireland's illegals rank in the debate on the upcoming legislation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> Hispanic illegals, for example?  I am trying to get a handle on this.  From the American perspective, is it an Irish issue or is it a much wider international issue?  The Chechens were legally resident.  Will there much of a backlash in the debate because of that terrorist attack?</p></speech>

I had to attend the House where one of my parliamentary questions was being taken and attend another committee.</p><p>  I have strong views on the vulnerability of undocumented immigrants.  I have dealt with a number of people, as we all have, from other jurisdictions who were undocumented in this State but who thought they were documented.  They came here on foot of work permits, for example, from non-EU locations and their status should have been updated or upgraded but was not.  Eight to ten years later, they found that they did not have legal status and they were in the country illegally.  There are serious questions about their welfare, the way they were treated and the tendency for them to be exploited.</p><p>  This is also a difficulty in the US.  I visited the country in a former capacity and met the immigrants associations to hear their concerns and worries.  Like my colleagues, I believe there cannot be an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  This is not how this works.  We must have an immigration policy and an understanding of each other's position on immigration.  I acknowledge the US is in a difficult position with its next door neighbour having a huge population and there being a huge antipathy among its own population towards Mexicans, legal and illegal, which I have read about and studied for a long time.  I hope it might be possible to work out a general arrangement through which, first, a staggered amnesty might be offered to those who have been there for a long time because the issue will not get better as time goes by and, second, to regularise what has been happening.  There are many social reasons people want to move to a better economy but human rights issue also arise from time to time that we are not always aware of but should be.</p></speech>

The undocumented Irish issue has been in the mix for a long time since the Kennedy-McCain initiative.  Like the peace process, all the stars and elements need to be aligned for it to work.  Everything must be in the right place at the right time with the right people involved.  Now is the time for this to happen but that does not necessarily mean it will be successful.</p><p>   I refer the issue of those who were deported since the proposed cut-off date of 30 December 2011.  Anyone who entered the US illegally after that date will not be eligible to participate in the new application process and a pathway to legal status.  Is the Government seeking to ensure that those resident illegally in the US prior to that date  can apply for their pathway even if they were deported?  Unlike the other 12 million people who did not happen to get caught in the intervening period, will there be a process whereby those who were unfortunate enough to be caught and deported can apply for a pathway to citizenship?</p><p>  The US Government has offered a future flow of visas on a number of occasions.  For Ireland to secure a future flow of US visas, we need to offer a reciprocal arrangement for US citizens who want to live in Ireland who, as members will be aware, find it difficult to obtain right to residency here.  What are the officials' views on that?  They are dealing with the issue day in, day out.  What is their sense of how this will play out?  What timeline do they envisage?  Could a deal be in place by Christmas?</p></speech>

He asked about the degree of hope and optimism felt by embassy staff in Washington that the process will lead to a successful conclusion both for the undocumented and for the future flow of visas.  Everyone acknowledges that there are very good grounds for optimism this time around.  That rests on a number of factors.  The first is that this Bill has been carefully crafted on a bipartisan basis in the US Senate and is sponsored by four Democrats - Chuck Shumer, Dick Durbin, Bob Menendez and Michael Bennet - and four Republicans - John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio and Jeff Flake.  We also know that there is broad support among figures in the Republican Party for immigration reform.  There is a debate going on in the party about the need for it to embrace the immigrant community and to be seen to be supportive of that community.  That is a good sign.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.325" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013050800012#L00700"><p>That is called political survival.</p></speech>

Is this about Irish immigrants, Mexican immigrants or something else?  This is being carefully crafted as a Bill which deals with the United States own interests and it is also carefully balanced to deal with those who are concerned that immigration and border controls have been too lax for too long.  For example, the Bill provides for 3,500 additional customs and border patrol agents and allows for a significant tightening up of border security.</p> <p>There is something in the Bill for sceptics of immigration reform, and it responds to a very significant demand from US business for new labour flows into the US, and that is in the agricultural sector and also the high-tech sector, where there is a demand to bring in new talent from overseas.  There is a carefully crafted balance in the Bill.</p><p> The implementation of the Bill is staggered, and Deputy Durkan referred to this.  The route to legal status for those who are undocumented in the US is a long one.  They would be entitled to apply for provisional status, initially.  That would allow them to leave the US and come back.  After a five or six year period they would be entitled to apply again, and after ten years they would be entitled to apply for a green card.  After three years that green card would provide a route to citizenship.  That is the path that would face undocumented Irish in the US.  They would have to satisfy certain background checks and pay any taxes that would be owed.  It is staggered over a period of time and that addresses some of the concerns that will be raised in both the Senate and the House of Representatives around not rewarding those who have broken the law.  The fact that there is a significant business lobby in support of this is a good sign.</p><p> Once the Bill is in the public domain all sorts of issues will arise.  There is considerable reticence in the House of Representatives and Senate around immigration reform.  Significant voices are calling for a piecemeal approach rather than one major approach to immigration reform.  There are those, particularly on the Republican side, who would like to see border controls tightened up before a route to citizenship was provided for those who were undocumented in the US.  There are those in the business lobby who feel that their needs are insufficiently met.  There are those who have raised child protection issues for undocumented parents facing deportation and the fact that this is not included in the Bill.  There are those, US Senator Rand Paul for example, who have raised the Boston bombings issue and the fact that the two people involved in that were illegal immigrants.  He has called for a delay so that any possible implications for the new Bill arising from the Boston bombing experience are taken account of.  All of these issues will undoubtedly surface in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p><p> On the actual process that we anticipate, the Bill has had preliminary hearings.  It will have its first mark-up examination by the Senate judiciary committee tomorrow.  The Senate majority leader Senator Harry Reid has signalled his intention to bring it to the floor of the Senate in June.  We expect that there will also be House of Representatives proposals.  They will certainly be different from the proposals in the Senate and if all proceeds in a relatively smooth way we expect a Senate-House conference committee in late summer or early autumn.  If that were approved it would probably still be close to the middle of next year by the time the regulations are in place and the new immigration schemes can be implemented.</p><p> The provision for up to 10,500 E3 visas for immigrants from Ireland is tucked away.  It is not very prominent in the Bill.  There are a number of additional elements and that is only one of very many.  It is not highlighted or underlined in the Bill, but there is considerable support for it.  Much of the work the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste have been doing has been to try to ensure quiet support for this so that if and when it is raised on the floor of the House of Representatives or Senate, there will be those who stand by it and we will retain it in the Bill.</p><p> I do not have figures for the numbers of undocumented or of US citizens in Ireland, but the E3 visa scheme is designed as a reciprocal one in the same way as the Australian scheme is reciprocal.  A similar path to work experience in Ireland for US citizens would be opened up in return.  That is a very important part of the presentation of this when the time comes.</p><p> St. Patrick's Day was mentioned.  In a way this moves forward to the discussion we are about to have.  The planning of the St. Patrick's Day programmes is undertaken months ahead of the St. Patrick's Day visits and they are planned to maximise the opportunities for lobbying and political support, for example, when the T&aacute;naiste was in Atlanta he had a number of meetings that he probably could not have had in Washington around the immigration Bill to secure support for it and that was the same for Ministers and Government representatives across the US.</p></speech>

Have we any hard and fast figures we could go by in terms of how many are in each state or city?  Various figures are thrown out from 10,000 to 50,000.</p></speech>

That is a firm cut-off date.  One needs to have been in the US continuously from 31 December 2011 or earlier.  That has always been envisaged in a Bill such as this.  The idea is to prevent a surge of illegal immigrants in the period immediately beforehand.  As Senator Daly was speaking I had a look through our analysis of the Bill and I do not see that point specifically addressed but I expect the cut-off date will be maintained and enforced once the Bill is passed into law and once that law is embodied in regulations.</p><p>  We have a variety of figures for the numbers of undocumented Irish in the US but none of them are reliable.  There have been estimates made in different parts of the US.  There have been some estimates for New York.  A number of factors make it difficult to get a firm fix, one being the mobility of undocumented around the US.  Another is the seasonal dimension of flows to and from the US.  We have always taken the figure of 50,000 or lower as the approximate figure but we do not have a finer sense of that.  This is something we may come to but we work with a number of Irish centres in the US and those centres have a clear sense of the numbers in their immediate communities but one of the features of recent immigration to the US has been that many recent immigrants are far more diffused across the US.  We have been working to support Irish networks, a network of Irish networks for recent immigrants across the US.  That went very quickly, over the space of the last two or three years, from three or four networks in the major cities to 14 networks across the US.  It is indicative of the spread of recent immigrants around the US.</p></speech>

How many people are emigrating to those two countries?  Emphasis was placed on the welcome growth in exports and the trade surplus.  Contrary to perceived wisdom, the increase in exports has not been matched by a rise in employment.  Given that the third Global Irish Economic Forum will specifically address the issue of employment, how can we maximise the value of exports to the economy?  How can we better integrate foreign direct investment with Irish suppliers to assist the domestic economy?  What do we need to do differently in this area?</p><p>  We heard that The Gathering has the potential to increase tourist numbers by 320,000.  The cost of travelling to Ireland is a cause for concern.  Has any engagement taken place with airlines, ferry companies and so forth on prices?  This appears to be one of the gaps in the strategy of The Gathering.  While I am aware that some hoteliers have taken action in this regard, have specific discussions taken place with the companies that bring tourists to Ireland?</p></speech>

My only similar experience is coming out of Croke Park on the day of an all-Ireland final.  The tourists in Prague were moving in waves.  For some years, I have been raising the issue of tourism promotion through parliamentary questions.  Ireland has a great and rich history and culture, which is of international interest, especially in the United States whose citizens visit this country in numbers.  To what extent can we use the Global Irish Economic Forum as a means of advertising our rich history and culture and encouraging people to visit?  Some of our archaeological sites date back 5,000 and 6,000 years.  People flock to sites throughout Europe that are 2,000 or 3,000 years old.  In my constituency, we have an example of a built structure - a round tower - that is more than 1,000 years old and has stood the test of time.  It is a great example of what Irish people were able to do with little technology all those years ago, especially was we were not subject to the Gothic and Romanesque influences to which the countries of central Europe were subject, although we subsequently copied them.  We should show these great examples of our culture, heritage and architecture to students, young people and visitors.  The Gathering and Global Irish Economic Forum are major opportunities to present Ireland in a positive light.</p></speech>

I am interested in the scheme involving 100 Irish graduates with experience in Asia.  While we are deriving great benefits from our relationship with the United States in terms of foreign direct investment, there are clearly other markets in the world.  Irish people are travelling further afield, notably to China, Japan and other Asian countries.  I am interested in ascertaining what is the intent behind the programme.</p><p>  Is it fair to suggest that the third level education sector was neglected in the past, approaches made by third level institutions were not responded to and somebody has recently decided it would be appropriate to discuss the issue of education, students and third level exchanges?  If this is an example of fresh thinking, it is to be welcomed.  Figures are available which show the value to the economy of every overseas student.  Not only are foreign governments funding the accommodation of students who come here to study, but they are also providing them with pocket money during their stay, which lasts for one or two years.  Clearly, if one increases the number of overseas students studying here, one will add value.  I ask the witnesses to comment. </p></speech>

We are currently recruiting abroad to meet some of the skills shortages in the technology sector, which appears to indicate a lack of foresight in our educational system.  While I accept it is not easy to predict exactly where jobs will arise, a gap appears to have emerged in this regard.  I hear much discussion and hype about The Gathering.  While I admit it is a good initiative, it is also a transient one in that its benefits will be felt this year only, with perhaps a small spillover into next year arising from the advertising campaign.  With one quarter of young people between the ages of 18 and 35 years unemployed, we clearly need a much more productive approach to the area of employment.</p><p>  I note that a number of private equity companies are focusing on Ireland.  These are primarily funds that wish to invest in property because they believe the sector will deliver significant profits in future arising from the property crash.  While it is easy for the media to criticise many of the entrepreneurs who were involved in the construction industry, they provided a large number of jobs.  Unfortunately, much of the profit that will be made from the depressed property market will be repatriated to other countries through the involvement of private equity companies.  Some minor efforts appear to be under way to persuade private equity companies to put together enterprise funds to invest in small and medium-sized enterprises with a view to generating jobs and growth.  Efforts to provide good mentoring and management can be as beneficial as financial supports.  Donald Keough, the former chief executive of Coca Cola, was instrumental in the company's decision to invest in Ireland.  He thought all the investment should be focused on Wexford, from where his ancestors came, and we now have a Coca Cola plant in the county.  </p> <p>I concede he is a good actor but recently we saw Tom Cruise coming across as genuinely chuffed by the fact of his Irish ancestry and genealogy.  What are we doing within the Department to identify in different countries, in particular in the United States which is entrepreneurial, good executives whose career paths we can see as they get to the top of major corporations and whose Irish background we can identify for them?  By the time they get here they will then have a certain gr&aacute; and empathy for Ireland.  In that way the commitment we have seen in the past will continue well into the future in the face of the considerable opposition we face from other countries for such mobile investment, in particular from the US and China.</p></speech>

I will not go into all the questions involved but implementation is a concern I have always raised.  Resources were not given to the Department of Foreign Affairs to do all that was laid down by the first and second global economic forums.  I refer to interdepartmental committees.  If the witnesses do not have the answers they might send them to the Chairman.  There was an interdepartmental group and an advisory and implementation group for the Global Irish Network, for which the T&aacute;naiste was responsible.  How many times did it meet?  It is very difficult to get different Departments together to move issues forward.  The Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach was to examine the form of the outcome and make progress reports.  How many times did that happen?  Seed funding was one of the suggested outcomes, a good idea that was based on the experience of other countries such as Israel, which had microfinancing.  How much money was given out in this area?</p><p>  The Global Irish Economic Forum was a wonderful initiative.  Many people from around the world were willing to come to Dublin and give their time and effort.  In addition, the Department of Foreign Affairs, which has much to do already, was asked to do a monumental task, one for which Israel has its very own department.  Our diaspora is larger than the Israeli one yet the Department of Foreign Affairs is obliged to do not only what a completely separate department in Israel does but also all the work of the Department must do on top of that.  Given the situation in the North, a separate department is almost required to handle that as well.</p><p>  It might be an idea if somebody was to benchmark what was promised two years ago and point out how many meetings there had been, even down to the updates.  That was one of the suggestions that came from the Global Irish Economic Forum.  Were those who came kept informed and told that in the past month such and such has happened?  I do not believe anybody wants to get an e-mail every month but there should be one every two or three months outlining what progress there has been.  My fear is that an excellent concept, one which the Department does very well in trying to administer, is simply under-resourced in terms of the manpower required to be able to meet all the requests made of it after the first two forums.  If the Government does not properly resource the Department, if people do not see the outcomes they were hoping to achieve and are not kept informed, they may not come to the third or fourth forum.  What was a great idea might then peter out.</p></speech>

Looking through the material, I see there are some significant figures and I very much welcome that there will be a third economic global forum on 4 and 5 October.  I would like to comment on the remarks of Senator Daly on resourcing.  Some 320,000 extra tourists are expected to visit Ireland this year.  Are there early indications this will happen?  I would like to see The Gathering initiative continued throughout the coming decade.  We have set a rate for the next decade, featuring a good number of significant milestones in our history, and there will be considerable opportunities to attract people to Ireland on the basis of these significant anniversaries and centenaries.  The forum will help to initiate job creation projects, but it will take time for some of them to come on stream.  Tourism can have a much more significant and quick impact and it has a positive impact on economic activity.</p><p>  I very much welcome that the third forum in October will focus on the challenges facing the domestic economy.  Many of us around this table come from rural Ireland and we see the devastation in every small town throughout the country, with business closures and difficulties that have arisen for many small operators.   The concept is positive.  The more connections we can make with the Irish diaspora throughout the world, the better for the country.  We have many very successful business people scattered throughout Ireland who are prepared to give willingly of their time, energy and resources to help the country.  This was never more needed than it is now.</p></speech>

Deputy Crowe raised the question of numbers of emigrants to Canada and Australia.  We have more detailed figures for these two countries than for the United States.   For Australia, 25,827 working holiday visas were granted last year, with 645 Irish nationals granted a student visa.  Some 4,500 Irish-born people became permanent residents of Australia through that country's skills programme.  Canadian figures show 6,680 Irish people entering Canada as temporary foreign workers, with 5,350 entering under the working holiday programme.  As members may know, there is a new extension and an expanded working visa scheme in Canada which, from granting 6,000 visas this year will increase to 10,000 visas next year.  This year, all 6,000 visas were taken up quickly and we expect a full uptake next year as well.  That gives a sense of the numbers for Canada and Australia.</p><p>  A few points were made about The Gathering and I will take them together.  Critical to the success of both The Gathering and the expansion our tourism take every year is access.  That infrastructural point of access comes up repeatedly.  For example, there are no direct flights to the west coast of the United States.  Embassies are constantly active on this point but for the airlines the considerations are commercial and this sets a limit to what can be achieved.  The Gathering seems to be delivering a significant increase in visitors but it is too soon to give any detail.  Tourism Ireland figures show an increase in the region of 23% for the first quarter this year, but we must factor into that the fact that Easter fell in the first quarter.  It is too soon to speak with any precision.  The trend of visitors coming from Britain has been generally downward in recent years which is a big issue for Tourism Ireland to address.  The legacy of The Gathering is under active consideration.  Skills are being learned and developed as we go out and do something that has not been done before.  These need to be deployed continually, however that may be done.  I believe it will happen as we get closer to the end of the year.</p><p>  Deputy Durkan spoke about the riches that exist at local level.</p> <p>One of the significant things about The Gathering in terms of diaspora engagement is that it has brought that engagement down to a very strong local level.  The Global Irish Network operates at a blue skies level, but local communities are now promoting what they have to offer and are also learning skills that need to be deployed into the future.  The question of job creation came up, and I believe The Gathering is a very good example of an initiative that can deliver jobs right across the country, not all of them high skilled and not necessarily in the high-tech sector.</p><p> We were asked how we could maximise our exports in terms of job creation.  That is something we want to discuss at the forum this year.  The Global Irish Economic Forum and the Global Irish Network do not represent the answer to many of our most difficult economic problems, but they represent a willingness to listen, an openness to fresh ideas and a willingness to enter into a real dialogue with members of our diaspora.  They bring a perspective and ideas that may not necessarily occur to us at home.</p><p> On our approach to the network, since the first network meeting in 2009, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been trying to do something in a structured way that we had not done in a very structured way previously.  We are learning as we go.  Each time there is a meeting of the Global Irish Economic Forum, we do it slightly differently.  We acknowledge that upfront.  I can identify some trends in how this has developed since the last forum.  There has been a much more determined approach to reporting the specific outcomes.  We had a six-month progress report and a 12-month progress report which set out clearly the undertakings of the forum and how close we had come to achieving those.  They have been met in very large part at this stage.  There has been a commitment to reporting and a commitment to co-ordination across Government.  The high level interdepartmental group chaired by Mr. Martin Fraser, which meets regularly, has made a big difference to the way different expertise is brought to bear on the forum this year.  It has become a very important factor in preparing for the forum.</p><p> Another trend has been gradually passing some ownership on to members of the network themselves.  That is where the advisory group of the Global Irish Network, chaired by the T&aacute;naiste, is important.  The most recent meeting of that group took place in February and was very much a preparatory meeting to consider the themes for this year's forum.  That is a way to bring in ideas from forum members themselves.  I do not doubt that the follow-up after October this year will be somewhat different.  However, we are learning as we go and are very frank about that.  I believe it has improved steadily over time.</p><p> I was asked how we identify the next generation of people such as Don Keough.  That operates on several levels.  I believe the network itself is a way of identifying the next generation of such people.  Many of the most active members of the network are not the CEOs of companies but are at the next level.  Surprisingly, many of them are Irish born and having left here 20 or 30 years ago, are arriving at the top of their professions in the United States, Australia, Canada and elsewhere.  They are the people who have least time but are devoting most time to the forum.  Culture is a very important way of connecting with that generation.</p><p> Don Keough is fifth generation Irish-American, and the fourth generation was not particularly connected with Ireland.  It was something that Mr. Keough rediscovered himself.  People might say that Governor O'Malley in Maryland, who is also fifth generation, is unique in that his siblings and parents have relatively little interest in Ireland.  That shows the importance of culture and the importance of initiatives such as the certificate of Irish heritage, which is a way of reaching out to and engaging people in Ireland.</p><p> I ask Mr. Hackett to speak about the Farmleigh Fellowship and also about private equity funding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.343" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Hackett" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013050800016#P00200"><p>The Farmleigh Fellowship is a good example of network members taking it upon themselves to go away from the forum and take forward ideas.  The people from Asia and, in particular, Singapore, who were at Farmleigh in 2009 went back to Singapore and identified a gap in expertise at a business level in Asia.  They established a one-year Asian graduate business studies programme between Nanyang Technological University, Singapore and UCC.  Up to 25 graduates a year now carry out a period of study in UCC and complete their study in Singapore.  During that time, they are placed with companies in Asia, predominantly around Singapore.  In most cases, but not exclusively, they are Irish companies doing business out there.  It is working effectively and is a good example of network members bringing an idea through to completion with emigrant support programme funding.  We have given them funding over the past three years.</p><p>  The point about private equity is very well made.  One of the topics for priority discussion this year is financial services and supporting the SME sector, and something along the lines that Senator Walsh described would certainly be discussed.  After the last forum, there were various private sector initiatives to increase credit guarantees or access to credit for SMEs.  They have not come to fruition yet.  The Government is supportive of them.  The Senator's idea of taking private equity investment in property and direct it more towards SMEs is one that will get considerable traction in October.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.344" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Burgess" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013050800016#P00300"><p>Deputy Eric Byrne asked about the inclusion of the third level sector and whether this was an omission in the previous forum.  A few factors prompted its inclusion this year.  First, the third level education sector has become very outward focused and organised collectively in promoting itself overseas.  To some extent we were responding to that.  To some extent we were also responding to a message that was coming across loud and clear from members of the Global Irish Network that the future success of our economy would be dependent on the capabilities of our third level education sector and its ability to succeed internationally.  That is why it has been marked as a particular area for focus this year and perhaps should have been included more prominently in the previous network.  There are a number of circumstances that mark it as being timely now.</p><p>  On how we might identify the future generation, the Global Irish Network is one part of the overall networking work of embassies and consulates overseas.  It is a modest enough part in the scale of things.  For example, the consulate in New York has been working very closely with the Ireland-US Council, with the Ireland Funds, the American Ireland fund in particular, with the Irish business organisation, Irish International Business Network, and with a range of other smaller business networks as well.  The Global Irish Network is part of a much bigger picture.  The embassy in London is working with 20 business related networks.  Some of them are sectoral.  There is a financial services network and a lawyers' network.  Some of them are alumni networks and so on.  Every week they either host an event or attend an event by another Irish network.</p> <p>Many of the future generation of Irish business leaders and members of the Global Irish Network are in those other networks.  In London alone, there are up to 10,000 Irish immigrants who are members of these other networks.  It is part of a much denser web of involvement and activity and all of that gives value and supports the work that the Global Irish Network has been doing.  The Gathering initiative has benefited hugely from the ability of those networks to get the message out and to help organise events themselves and to plug into their own home towns.</p></speech>

We have had a most interesting and wide-ranging discussion on the issues that are very important to the joint committee.  We hope that action to address the issue of the undocumented Irish in the United States will be taken before the end of the year.  Again, I wish to echo the comments of other members on the third global economic forum this year.  That is important.  I think the themes that have been chosen for that are important, in particular the challenges in tackling youth unemployment.</p><p>  I thank Mr. Niall Burgess, Mr. Joe Hackett and Mr. Karl Gardner for engaging in this discussion.  I am aware that a previous arrangement had to be cancelled.  I hope the joint committee will be kept updated on what is happening in Washington.  We send good wishes to the staff of the embassy in Washington, and hope that in their work with Congressmen and Senator they will highlight the Irish diaspora.</p></speech>

This is the first time we have appeared before the committee, so I have approximately ten minutes of material to get through.  We are genuinely delighted to be here and have the opportunity to brief the committee.  I thank members for the invitation to address them today on the Department of Defence&rsquo;s six monthly reports on developments in the EU during 2012, covering both the Danish and the Cypriot Presidencies.</p><p>  Since the coming into force of the Lisbon treaty, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, conducts the Union&rsquo;s common foreign and security policy, assisted by the European external action service, EEAS.  The role of the EEAS is to support the High Representative in fulfilling her mandate and to manage the EU's response to crises.  The role of the rotating Presidency is to provide additional support in fulfilling the mandates laid down while at the same time progressing its own priorities in consultation with other member states.</p><p>  The EU&rsquo;s<b></b>common security and defence policy, CSDP, forms an integral part of the Union&rsquo;s common foreign and security policy, CFSP.  CSDP&rsquo;s primary function is to provide the Union with an operational capacity to undertake peacekeeping and crisis management missions outside the territory of the member states.  In addition to military tasks, there is a significant civilian and humanitarian dimension.  The EU is now a major player on the world stage with an increasing capacity to influence the international security agenda through a &ldquo;comprehensive approach&rdquo; using the instruments at its disposal, including economic, diplomatic, political and military instruments.  Further progress was made during 2012 in the areas of EU crisis management operations, EU civilian and military capabilities development, battle groups, partnerships with other organisations and the European Defence Agency.</p><p>  The most visible example of the impact of CSDP is EU peacekeeping and crisis management operations.  A key priority of the High Representative, of the EU and also of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union<b></b>is to ensure the continued success of these missions and preparing for new missions.  As an example, recently during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency, the EU Council agreed to the establishment of the EU training mission in Mali.  Sixteen missions and operations were undertaken during 2012, of which three were military operations and 13 were civilian missions.  These took place across three continents, with seven in Africa, four in the western Balkans, one in Asia, three in the Middle East and one in the south Caucasus.</p><p>  The three military operations in 2012 were Operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina; Operation Atalanta, the anti-piracy mission off the coast of Somalia; and the EU training mission, EUTM, in Somalia, which is involved in training Somali security forces in Uganda.  Ireland is currently participating in two of these operations &ndash; Operation ALTHEA and EUTM Somalia &ndash; and we deployed to EUTM Mali in March 2013.  EU member states have continually praised the success of the EUTM Somalia mission and, in particular, the work carried out by the mission commander, Colonel Michael Beary.  Brigadier General Gerald Aherne, another Irish officer, has recently replaced Colonel Beary as the mission begins its third mandate and is charged with moving training from Uganda to Mogadishu.  This mission is now being used as a blueprint for other training missions, particularly in Mali, due to its outstanding success.</p><p>  As I have mentioned, EUTM Mali has been established during our Presidency.  This is intended to improve the military capacity of the Malian armed forces to allow, under civilian authority, the restoration of the country's territorial integrity.  It is an integral part of the EU's comprehensive approach to the situation in Mali and the Sahel.  It is providing military training as well as training and advice on specific areas such as command and control, human resources, international humanitarian law, the protection of civilians and human rights.  It is not involved in combat operations and Ireland is contributing eight personnel as part of a joint training contingent with the UK armed forces.  Although Ireland and UK forces have worked together in different theatres and operations over many years, this is the first time a joint UK-Irish military contingent has been deployed on any such operation.  The provision of the joint UK-Ireland contingent underlines the very positive relationship that now exists between Ireland and the UK.</p><p>  One of Ireland&rsquo;s priorities during our current Presidency of the Council of the European Union is the continued development of the EU&rsquo;s CSDP and the comprehensive approach to crisis management.  The Horn of Africa is an excellent example of the EU&rsquo;s comprehensive approach.  The fight against piracy in the region consists of three CSDP missions that are making a major contribution to support the efforts to bring peace, prosperity and stability to the Somali people.  These missions are complementary and form a coherent, integrated package that supports the EU's strategic framework for the Horn of Africa.  In the Sahel a similar approach has been taken, with the missions forming crucial elements of the EU strategy for security and development in the region.  This strategy focuses on Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Algeria and covers political, humanitarian and development dimensions with a strong security component.</p><p>  I will address the area of civilian and military capability developments.  The priority in this area is to provide the Union with an operational capacity, drawing on civilian and military assets, which can be used on missions outside the Union.  During 2012 and under the auspices of the European Defence Agency, EDA, work continued on the development of military capabilities, including identifying projects where member states can work together as part of the EDA&rsquo;s pooling and sharing initiative.</p> <p>Some of these initiatives are addressing the development of capabilities in the areas of maritime surveillance, network enabled capability and cyber security, just to name a few.  In addition, work continued on identifying synergies between civilian and military capability development planning.</p><p> In regard to battle groups, the EU has developed the capability to deploy forces at high readiness in the event of a crisis.  To date no battle group has been deployed.  The reason as to why a battle group has not been deployed since the concept was established in 2007 was the subject of an in-depth analysis carried out by the Crisis Management and Planning Directorate of the European External Action Service during 2012.  Battle groups have also been discussed in detail in all defence fora during our Presidency.  In consultation with the EEAS and member states we are looking at ways of improving the flexibility, usability and deplorability of battle groups.  This is an issue that will remain on the agenda up to and including the European Council on Defence in December 2013.</p><p> Let me emphasise that Ireland has always been a strong supporter of the UN and of UN peacekeeping.  In 2012, Ireland promoted and championed a new impetus in UN co-operation at EU level which resulted in the EU publishing an action plan to enhance EU support to UN peacekeeping.  This action plan has reinvigorated co-operation between the UN and the EU, including the role of the UN-EU steering committee on crisis management, originally established to advance the goals of the 2003 Joint Declaration on EU-UN co-operation in crisis management, which celebrates its tenth anniversary this year.  Ireland has placed great emphasis on the issue, both in the recent past and during our Presidency.</p><p> Since Ireland currently holds the EU Presidency, I though it might be helpful if I updated the committee on current developments.  During our Presidency we have actively engaged with UN representatives and they have welcomed our efforts to promote UN peacekeeping among EU member states.  The Under Secretary General for UN peace keeping operations, Mr. Herv&eacute; Ladsous, making his first visit to Ireland, attended the informal meeting of EU Ministers of Defence in Dublin Castle in February.  Also as part of the Presidency programme, we hosted a seminar in February, which examined how we can foster more effective co-operation and build partnerships both across regional organisations, including the EU, NATO and the African Union and between these organisations and the UN, in order to enhance the effectiveness of UN mandated peacekeeping operations.  Representatives from the United Nations, European Union, NATO and the African Union attended and since it took place, the Minister and the Department have received positive feedback from the participants and those who attended.</p><p> Efforts have continued between the EU and NATO to improve co-operation between both organisations.  The EU and NATO have co-operated closely in regard to the development of capabilities in the areas of Counter-Improvised Explosive Devices, C-IED, medical support and also protection against chemical, biological radiological and nuclear threats, CBRN.  Ireland is particularly interested in the C-IED and CBRN elements.  We have also engaged with NATO representatives in regard to events during our Presidency.  The NATO Secretary General, Mr. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, making his first visit to Ireland, attended the informal meeting of EU Ministers of Defence in Dublin Castle in February.  Other NATO representatives have also attended the UN seminar and our seminar on Maritime Security in March.</p><p> Looking ahead, much of the focus of work in 2013 has concentrated on preparing for the European Council meeting in December 2013 which will include a thematic discussion on common security and defence policy and defence issues.  The last such discussion by Heads of State and Government took place five years ago.  As such this presents a significant and relatively unique opportunity to place EU defence issues centre stage and to consider the role of CSDP.  Since December 2012, member states have been actively addressing this topic through a range of fora.  Throughout our Presidency this subject has been a significant priority and will continue to be after our Presidency is completed.</p><p> The Irish Presidency is committed to supporting and facilitating preparations for the European Council and we will hold a seminar on the subject in Dublin Castle next week.  The Department of Defence will proactively continue to support the Union in its efforts to advance the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy in order to achieve the objective of ensuring a safer and more secure Europe and a safer and more secure world.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for their attention.  I would be pleased to answer questions.</p></speech>

Will Mr. Howard address how the EU and Ireland, in particular, have helped influence the international security agenda during the time of the Presidency and beyond, because we are supposed to be looking at the Cypriot and Danish Presidencies in the course of this discussion?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.359" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Howard" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013050800003#B00600"><p>By way of background I should say that Denmark hosted the Presidency in the first half of 2012 and has an opt out of the military aspects of CSDP, so that naturally would have influenced its disposition towards the management of it.  It is important to know that.</p><p>  Some years ago we produced a Food for Thought paper promoting the idea of a much more integrated EU approach to supporting the UN in peacekeeping.  At the risk of using some slightly unparliamentary language, we kept pushing it and pushing it to get people to pay attention.  We have canvassed among EU member states an awareness of the fact that the EU has something it can contribute and an awareness of our understanding of the challenges the UN faces in trying to mount peacekeeping operations. We have had a thought and reflection process as to what the European Union and member states can bring to support the UN.  As I am sure members are aware, the UN has so much peacekeeping business on hands it is looking to outsource the provision of forces where it can to regional organisations, be it the European Union, NATO or the African Union.  There is a very serious issue, not a willingness issue but a capacity issue, in Africa among the countries that might contribute troops to peace support operations.  The technical sophistication of EU assets in addition to the financial resources of member states, even in a recession, are so deep that we can obviously bring something to the situation.</p><p>  In the course of the Irish Presidency, we did two things that are unique one of which was to hold a seminar.  We control to a degree the agenda by hosting seminars, as one brings people together and exposes people who would not normally meet each other to an exchange of views in the hope that one will create a momentum for change and a better understanding.  Our seminar in February brought together the African Union, the UN, NATO and the European Union.  These people do not normally meet.  It was a very good seminar.  In particular, the representative of the African Union was able to give a very forthright and direct account of the deficiencies and the problems they face.</p><p>  By way of background, I could mention that the European Union mounted an operation in Chad, which we had the opportunity to visit as part of our troops.  Chad is two and a half times the size of France and has 300 km of paved road.</p> <p>For any force to be mobile in that environment, it requires the depth of technology and air support the European Union can bring.  There has been reluctance on the part of European Union countries to put troops into missions.  One of the facts which is very stark and with which people who attended the seminar were confronted by the UN was that European states provide 40% of the cash but they only provide 5% of the troops.  The hope is that simply putting facts such as that in front of people and keeping on doing so will encourage people to factor it into planning for 2013 and 2014.  Some member states will have troops available with the wind-down in Afghanistan that they could make available for peacekeeping.  They have been alerted to the need and the requirement has been presented to them.  That is something on which we will continue to follow through.</p></speech>

There is a sense in the country at large that we look to the UN above and beyond every other international agency as the first port of call in terms of solving international conflicts.  I seek reassurance in the context of an improvement in EU-UN relations that other agencies are not beginning to challenge the UN on the basis that it has in some way failed to fulfil its responsibilities.  Are we getting close to NATO in a way that might not have been the case previously?  There is a view that this is the case.  It would be helpful to hear the view of the witnesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.362" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Howard" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013050800004#C00300"><p>I will take those two issues separately if I may.  The UN is no more and no less than the member states.  If the member states agree to do something, it gets done.  One of the factors that constrains the UN in operation is the Security Council because permanent members have a veto.  That is outside of our control but that is the situation.</p><p>  The second big constraint on the UN is resources.  If the United Nations mounts a blue hat operation, the financial cost of it falls on the UN, and its capacity to fund and resource the operations is limited.  Therefore, it asks organisations such as the EU and NATO to come in, but always under a UN mandate so the political legitimacy of the missions derives from the United Nations.  The difference is that regional organisations such as the EU or NATO pay for the operation and relieve the UN of the financial burden, plus they might bring a depth of capacity and technical ability that the UN would not perhaps get voluntarily.</p><p>  I welcome the opportunity to bring clarity to the position with NATO.  Basically, the relationship we have with NATO is stable.  It has not changed.  We are a member of NATO&rsquo;s Partnership for Peace.  Since the late 1990s, when the change in peacekeeping took place, and since the UN asked organisations such as NATO to go peacekeeping, we have participated in NATO-led peacekeeping operations, as do all of the other neutral countries.  It is a general policy on peacekeeping that even when an organisation such as NATO or the European Union mounts an operation, it is open to third countries if they wish to join in because it is basically a UN operation.  However, if one is operating at such a high technical level, one cannot simply show up in the mission area and hope one will be able to operate with other high-tech forces in a seamless way.  For that reason, NATO has developed a plethora of standards and when one goes with NATO &ndash; to use what might be a frivolous illustration, one cannot show up with two-pin plugs if everyone else has three-pin sockets.  There are NATO standards for every type of equipment, for communications and procedures of every kind so that one can operate seamlessly together.  The way in which countries such as Ireland that are not members of NATO get access to the standards is through Partnership for Peace.  That is its purpose.  We have a partnership programme and its focus is to ensure we are interoperable with NATO on peacekeeping missions.  That is its purpose and goal.</p><p>  NATO welcomes the participation of this country because we have such a strong reputation in peacekeeping.  Our presence on missions underlines the fact that it is basically a UN peacekeeping operation being performed by NATO and not a NATO mission.  Our dialogue with NATO takes place on the basis that we are a partner but not a member.  We have no agenda to change the nature of our participation with it.  I acknowledge that we have got tremendous technical support and assistance from NATO in achieving full interoperability for peacekeeping missions.  I am anxious to correct any belief people have that our relationship with NATO is one that is in some sort of fundamental transit.  Both sides fully understand and respect the fact that we are not a member and we are not an applicant but we co-operate with peacekeeping, and in between missions, we do the training and follow the standards that are necessary to go on peace support operations when they arise.</p></speech>

I was enormously struck by the comments made on the ALTHEA mission in Bosnia by Lord Paddy Ashdown.  He described international participation in Bosnia as absolutely disastrous.  Does Mr. Howard have a comment in that regard?</p><p>  We all echo the comments about Colonel Beary and the good wishes to Colonel Aherne.  I do not know whether the latter is already in place or if he has still to travel.  When will training begin in Mogadishu?</p><p>  I understand the Danes have an opt-out and are sensitive about the common security policy.  In a paper published during the Danish Presidency, there was much talk about the constraints being placed on the establishment of battle groups.  We have never seen a battle group called into action.  That can be a good thing or it might be a bad thing when one looks at the peace enforcement role we might have in this particular area.  Will Mr. Howard comment on the issue?</p><p>  It struck me that the Department is doing good work and that a partnership approach is taken to the work in hand.  To what extent is there engagement between the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Irish Aid, not least having regard to the work the Department is doing in the Sahel and the Horn of Africa?</p></speech>

The appropriate level of continuing participation in ALTHEA has been the source of discussion at EU fora.  The mission has gone through a number of transformations and downsizing.  That has been the collective view of European Union members.  When the discussions take place, some feel more of an abundance of caution than others.  Perhaps Lord Ashdown sits on that side of the fence.  It is perhaps a policy question that goes a little bit beyond my role.  This country did participate, when it was a much larger mission, with a number of other countries on the downsizing.  We were anxious to see the mission as part of a normalisation process transit into more of a support operation for Bosnia Herzegovina rather than a large mission on the ground.</p><p>  On Somalia, the headquarters of the mission will move to Mogadishu.  An indication has been given by the Ugandan authorities that they would like to see an end to training in Uganda and to have it moved back to Somalia.  The Somali authorities would also like that to happen.  What we are told is that the decision on training is one that will be made based on conditions on the ground.  There has been talk of doing it in the relatively near future but we have been told that the decision to move is conditions-based, not timeline-based.  A decision is expected.  Training in Somalia has not commenced yet, therefore, but it is envisaged in the near future.</p></speech>

The Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, is an integral part of the common foreign and security policy.  We work hand in glove in this country and we are closely co-ordinated in European fora.  By the standards of countries generally, there are advantages in being small.  This country is seen to run a better joined-up operation in this area than some others between defence, military and civil and foreign affairs.</p> <p> On the question of tying in with Irish Aid in mission areas, we do talk at a policy level here in Ireland.  However, we also have to be mindful that when our troops are part of a multinational force, they are operating under a multinational command system.  In some cases, that commander would be an Irish officer and we would be careful to ensure that people operate as part of the multinational team and not to go too far into bilateral co-operation with other agencies from their own country that might create the impression that they are not there as part of a UN mission but as part of a bilateral team.  It is something of a constraint in terms of how we operate.  Ireland has a very good reputation for being a team player in peacekeeping and peace support.  We play on the European team and while we would engage in a certain amount of co-operation with local agencies on a goodwill basis, we are always mindful of preserving the unity of the European team.</p></speech>

I warmly welcome the first part of that report, particularly the reference to the fact that Ireland is a strong supporter of the United Nations, of UN peace keeping operations and is supporting the UN at a European level.  However, I must put on my old hat now and I am sure the Chairman is tired listening to me in this regard but I have concerns when I hear terms like battle groups and statements about the European Union and NATO improving co-operation.  I am also concerned by the recent appearance of the Secretary General of NATO in Dublin.  I hope that does not herald an undermining of our position on the United Nations.  I believe Mr. Howard said that Ireland is not an advocate for NATO and I ask him to clarify that point.</p><p>  Many of us have serious concerns about maintaining Ireland's traditional peacekeeping role and we do not want a situation to develop whereby we build a relationship with NATO.  The report to the committee made NATO sound like a nice, friendly organisation but three weeks ago in Afghanistan NATO planes slaughtered ten Afghan children in a drone attack on a village.  Is there any question of an undermining of the United Nations and a promotion of the NATO agenda at an Irish or European level?  Is it correct that Ireland will not be an advocate for NATO?</p></speech>

Has that term been changed to "peace support" in recent times?  I ask Mr. Howard to clarify that issue.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.372" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Howard" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013050800005#D00600"><p>Peace support operations are much broader than peacekeeping operations.  The latter implies that there is a "peace in place" and the aim of a peacekeeping operation is to maintain that peace.  There can be a mandate for a more robust action, where the conditions of a "peace in place" do not exist and that can become a peace enforcement operation.  There is also the much broader concept of security sector reform.  The Chad mission, for example, had a peace enforcement mandate, which is one end of the spectrum.  On the other hand, the training mission in Uganda, involving the training of Somali troops, is a peace support operation.  That operation is about capacity building.  We are simply training people outside of the site of the operation.  The full range of operations can be encompassed by the term "peace support" operations.</p><p> I am not sure what I said exactly what I said about NATO because I was not reading from a prepared script but I believe I said that our relationship with NATO is stable and is not changing.  We are not going to become a member of NATO.  That is not on NATO's agenda or on ours.  On the issue of NATO and the UN, it is important to remember that they have a good relationship and do not see themselves as competitors.  The UN is asking NATO to do more in terms of fielding peace support operations generally.  </p><p>  I would like to comprehensively reassure the Deputy that while we have a very good and very friendly relationship with  NATO, Ireland, along with other EU member states, would be a very strong advocate for ensuring that at all times the European Union and NATO have completely separate decision making structures.  We would be very careful to monitor that.  We also are extremely careful to monitor what are sovereign decisions for Ireland.  How much money we spend on defence, what we spend it on and when and where we deploy our troops are exclusively sovereign decisions for Ireland at all times.  At times, perhaps inadvertently, other countries may raise issues that we feel could be seen to cross those boundaries and we will always make our position very clear in those circumstances.  I believe that our position is understood by NATO and the European Union.  Indeed, within the European Union, our position is respected.  I also think that because we participate in missions, we actually have an opportunity to influence the direction of the collective.  Certainly, Ireland's contribution in this policy space has been to encourage people to find ways to support the UN.  </p><p>  Deputies and Senators should understand that the European Union is a very big collective of 27 member states and influencing the collective will of the union takes time.  It is something one must be willing to plug away at but we have been pushing this for some time and we are getting traction on it.  Certainly, in our Presidency and in the aftermath of the work we have done, we have a sense that we have been getting traction on that issue.</p></speech>

That is very important.  Does Mr. Howard have any data on the cost to the taxpayer of some of the missions in which we are involved?  Does Mr. Howard have any figures relating to the cost of the European Defence Agency annually, across the 27 EU member states?  I am only looking for ball park figures.</p></speech>

In terms of our co-operation with the European Defence Agency, one would be talking about hundreds of thousands of euro.  The total for the European Union is &euro;30 million.  Our gross national income, GNI, contribution to that would be a fraction of one per cent.  The cost is in six figures and I will supply the precise figure to the Deputy at a later date.  That covers our contribution to the agency.  In addition, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has mandated our participation in a number of the agency's projects and again, our contributions would be in the hundreds of thousands of euro region.  I would prefer to write to the Deputy with the precise figures rather than discuss the matter now.</p></speech>

Concern has been expressed in recent years about a perceived erosion of Irish neutrality, with our participation in the Partnership for Peace, PfP, operations and the EU battle groups.  This was not helped by the comments of the Secretary General of NATO who, on a recent visit here, said that he would like to see Ireland join NATO in the future.  The question that many international and Irish peace campaigners are asking is why NATO is still in existence.  It is seen as a relic of the Cold War.  Why is there not just one United Nations umbrella, unchallenged and with the authority of the international community?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.379" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Howard" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013050800005#D01300"><p>I am very anxious to address all of the Deputy's concerns relating to this issue.  It is important to point out that the United Nations does not keep standing military forces of its own.  It is completely dependent on countries and organisations to supply forces for its peacekeeping missions.  Representatives of the UN would be very open about the fact that it is overstretched because of the number of peacekeepers it has to field in places like Africa.  Therefore, the NATO/UN relationship is very much based on the UN asking NATO to field peace support operations.   I do not have any brief to speak on behalf of NATO or to make any case for its continued existence but it is a fact that it exists and has become a significant player in supplying assets for peace support operations.  The UN wants this and is mandating NATO's operations and is happy for Ireland to contribute to those operations.  Those points are a given and are the starting point for our relationship with NATO.</p> <p>Therefore, when we engage with NATO - this may come as a surprise to the committee - the UN is quite pleased and would be anxious not to discourage us from participating in NATO-UN mandated peace operations.</p><p> Whether there is an argument for continuing with these - perhaps there is - is a debate for NATO.  Ireland is not a member of NATO, therefore we are not there to make a case for its continuing membership.  Given that exists, it may be worth emphasising that in addition to being a military alliance on a <i>de facto</i>basis NATO is, effectively, the International Standards Organisation, ISO, of the military world.  The International Standards Organisation produces ISO standards for all kinds of things.  In the military world, it is NATO that produces these standards.  If one is going to engage at the top end of military operations, NATO standards are used.  Neutral Ireland bought our MOWAP armoured personnel carriers from neutral Switzerland but the contract specs are all NATO standards, even though neither Ireland nor Switzerland are members of NATO.  As they are the only standards there are, that requires us to be in Partnership for Peace.  For example, in the battle group led by Sweden, which is not a member of NATO, Ireland, Finland, Norway and Estonia participate.  The great majority of the troops are not NATO but it uses NATO standards because that is all there is.  That is our view of NATO, not the Military Alliance view but what I would call the ISO of the military world.  Perhaps it is worth keeping that in mind. </p></speech>

I will move on to the next question.  As Mr. Howard is aware, the operation in Mali has a wider context.  Many of the European countries have a colonial history, particularly in north Africa but also throughout Africa - we are talking about north Africa for the purposes of this conversation - which is not something to be proud of.  There are always concerns about the natural resources and the interests of corporations based in Europe.  The most recent conflicts include the uprising in Tunisia where France was seen to have been on the wrong side and continued to support Ben Ali, the dictator, up to the end.  In Libya, the African Union strongly criticised the NATO response to the UN Security Council Resolution which was not about regime change but protection of civilians.  Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l and I had the opportunity to meet the chairman of the African Union, Jean Ping, who actually put those detailed criticisms to us regarding its concerns about what would happen.  Those concerns have been vindicated.  This has been the recent context for NATO-led operations in Africa, in Libya against the advice and interests of the African Union itself and in Mali where we have deployed eight members of our Defence Forces - we have had a debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas on the Defence Forces because the number has to reach 12.</p><p>  We know there is considerable criticism of the Malian government and army in terms of human rights abuses from the UN and Human Rights Watch and other human rights NGOs.  The question for people who are proud of our neutrality and the potential that neutrality offers in conflict resolution across the world is what are we doing there with a NATO-led operation, under a UN banner, which I accept.  It is a NATO state-led operation, and NATO is involved in training an army that is guilty of gross human rights abuses and taking sides. Meanwhile, on the other side we are very proud of our Defence Forces in Lebanon who are in blue helmet operations that are peacekeeping operations.  That has been our legacy.</p><p>  Today we were at church honouring our 1916 heroes and on our right hand side there were those who gave their life for the State, proudly serving our Defence Forces in peacekeeping operations.  There are UN Security Council resolutions about Palestine, the settlements in Palestine and the illegal settlements that are ongoing to this day.  Ireland has never militarily given support to the Palestinian people or intervened to enforce those UN Security Council resolutions, yet we have chosen to go under a banner and operate in Mali.  Why?</p></speech>

I cannot speculate on the motives of other participants in peace support operations.  I understand the Deputy's point of view but perhaps it is somewhat outside of the remit of the Department of Defence in Ireland.  The EU training mission in Somalia is a training mission.  When we were on the evaluation process in relation to the mission in Somalia, a lot of questions were asked about the people we were going to train, what might happen with the training and there were risks involved.  The only way to have no risks is to have no mission.  I am not saying this to be tendentious but to understand from our point of view if we wait until conditions are perfect we will never go into a mission.</p><p>  The Deputy has rightly brought to attention the fact that some people may question the motives of some of the people involved.  Whether that is right or wrong I cannot say but what I can say is that there is no question over the motives of countries such as Ireland.  It is better that we participate.  When we participate we get our flag over the mission headquarters and we get a say in what is done.  Whatever other people may think, if Irish troops go on an EU training mission it will train Malian forces to the best way that they can be trained and we have no hidden agenda.</p><p>  Questions have been raised about the conduct of the forces in the past.  While it would not be appropriate for me to get into a debate about that, I acknowledge the fact that questions have been raised.  The question for us then is what should we do about it.  I would like to think that if a training team with an Irish component gets involved it is far more likely to improve the situation than disimprove it but I have to acknowledge the fact that it is not a perfect situation.  What I am saying to the Deputy is that if we wait until it is perfect then they will not need the training.</p><p>  There is a humanitarian law component in the training that our trainers will give.  Irish soldiers, because it is part of their own training as they all have peace support and peacekeeping experience, will be very good mentors and role models for the troops involved in training.  They are also having an input with the other trainers.  Our relationship with our British colleagues in regard to this training mission is very good.  Our personnel, when they went to Britain for the joint training before deployment, found that the UK side was waiting to be given guidance as to what to do, waiting to learn from our experience in Somalia.  It is very much the right thing to do to participate, accepting that it will not bring about a perfect world, but I think we definitely have an impact.</p><p>  In the other areas where we are trying to have an influence, perhaps trying to have a political influence over the policy of the European Union regarding the UN, the fact that we participate in missions gives us a voice that will be heard.  People listen if one shows up at the airport when the mission starts.  That is another reason we should be positively disposed to participate in missions, accepting the fact that the missions may not be perfect.  Whenever one goes into a multinational peace support operation, some of the other countries participating may or may not be the people we would choose.  Let us remember we might not be the people they would choose.  As long as everybody goes on the mission and fulfils the mandate we are improving the situation.  I believe the presence of countries such as Ireland and other like-minded neutral countries is positive in that context, which is why we are supporters of it.</p></speech>

This proposal for a regulation is significant as it will have an impact on both airlines and consumers.  The draft regulation seeks to update current legislation by clarifying existing grey areas in the law, introducing new consumer rights, strengthening enforcement of the rules and balancing the financial impact on all stakeholders.</p><p>  As this proposed regulation is significant, impacting on both the airline industry and consumers, it is proposed that this proposal warrants further scrutiny.  I propose that, initially, officials for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport be asked to appear before the joint committee to assist members in scrutinising it, in particular, to explain the detail and consequences of the draft regulation and also the outcome of its consultations with stakeholders.  Thereafter, the joint committee can decide on further action.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  COM (2013) 147 is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on measures to reduce the cost of deploying high-speed electronic communications networks.  The objective of the draft regulation is to reduce the cost of rolling out high-speed broadband throughout the EU for the benefit of EU citizens and the Single Market.  This proposed regulation is significant as new or additional directly applicable obligations would be imposed.  The issue of subsidiarity must also be considered in the context of this proposal.</p><p>  As this is a significant proposal, it is proposed that it warrants further scrutiny.  It is proposed to invite officials from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to a meeting of the joint committee as soon as possible to assist it in scrutinising this draft regulation.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

We have made progress on a number of our priorities for sport during the Irish Presidency of the Council of the EU.  I am looking forward to chairing the Council of Sport Ministers and to an engaging debate with my EU colleagues.</p><p>  There are huge economic, social and health benefits to be gained from sport.  In the current economic climate, it is important to recognise the importance of sport for economic and social development both at national and European level.  Sport plays a vital role in improving the health and well-being of our citizens and instils a sense of place and belonging among those who play and those who follow sport.  From a health perspective alone, there are clearly significant benefits in maintaining and increasing participation levels in sport and physical activity.</p><p>  While recognising that sport policy remains a matter for member states, the new EU competence for sport allows the EU and member states the opportunity to work more closely together to address issues of common interest and share best practice.  It also gives us the opportunity to speak with one voice at international level, particularly in areas such as the fight against doping, which is a particular concern of mine, and the fight against corruption in sport.</p> <p>Working together at EU level we can strive to better protect the integrity of sport through the targeting of cheating at all levels and promoting healthy, fair and enjoyable sport.</p><p> We have focused on three main sport priorities during the Irish Presidency in the areas of dual careers, the sustainable financing of sport and issues around protecting the integrity of sport.  Next week&rsquo;s Council meeting will focus on dual careers for elite sports people and protecting the integrity of sport in the area of anti-doping.  Before I expand on these agenda issues, I would like to briefly outline to the committee the work that the Irish Presidency has done around the sustainable financing of sport. </p><p> There is growing evidence that sport makes a significant contribution to Europe&rsquo;s economy and is an important driver of driver of growth and employment.  It also ensures social cohesion and well-being.  This contributes to achieving the goals of the Europe 2020 growth strategy.  However, the current economic and financial crisis is having a major impact on public spending across the EU, including the financing of sport.  Sustainable financing of sport was the theme of a sports conference and a meeting of EU sport directors which took place in Dublin Castle on 7 and 8 March.  The conference was attended by representatives of the key sports organisations across Europe.  The two events addressed issues such as how sport is currently financed; the redistribution of income within sport; the financial challenges facing the sport sector; and best practice examples of how international organisations finance sport.  </p><p> The promotion of dual careers for elite sports people has been another focus of the Irish Presidency.  Sports people often face challenges combining their sporting career with education or work.  Success at the highest level of a sport demands intensive training and competitions at home and abroad.  It can be difficult to combine this with education and work commitments.  Retiring sports people can also face difficulties moving from a sports career to a new career.  We need to avoid the situation where talented and elite sports people are forced to choose between education and sport or work and sport.  Last November, an EU expert group on education and training in sport produced a set of guidelines on dual careers of sports people.  These included recommended policy actions in support of dual careers in high performance sport.  Given the growing importance of this matter, the Irish Presidency has prepared a set of Council conclusions on dual careers which will be adopted at next week&rsquo;s Council meeting.</p><p> While enormous strides have been made internationally in the fight against doping in sport through the work of the World Anti-Doping Agency, WADA, recent high profile cases have shown that doping remains one of the major challenges facing the sport sector.  The Lance Armstrong case, the Operation Puerto trial in Spain and the Australian Crime Commission investigation into organised crime and drugs highlight the continuing global threat of doping to the integrity of sport.  Cheating and corruption have no place in sport and undermine the fundamental principles of honesty and fair play.  Elite athletes are role models, particularly for young people, and their success in honest and fair competition can encourage participation and boost morale.  While elite athletes who are found guilty of doping receive sanctions, they may have won significant sums of prize money during their careers and can continue to live off proceeds which have been won dishonestly.  Doping not only compromises the principle of open and equal competition, but also poses a serious threat to individual and public health and can have damaging long-term effects on people&rsquo;s health.</p><p> While there have been significant advancements in the testing tools to fight against doping, methods of cheating have also become more sophisticated and there is a need to be vigilant to new ways of doping emerging.  There is also evidence of a growing influence of criminality in sport, for example, through the trafficking of performance enhancing drugs.  Protecting the integrity of sport against doping is an ongoing global challenge which requires international and cross-sectoral co-operation and action.  Governments, sports bodies and national anti-doping agencies need to continue to work together to fight this problem and ensure a level playing field globally.  I am pleased that Ireland, through my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, is one of three EU representatives on the WADA foundation board from January until July 2014.  The Minister is attending a meeting of the WADA foundation board in Montreal this weekend.</p><p> The policy debate at next week&rsquo;s Council of EU Sport Ministers will focus on the role of governments in combating the increased sophistication of doping in sport.  EU sports Ministers will discuss if there are ways in which governments can be more effective in the fight against doping.  I will also meet high level representatives of the sports movement to discuss this important issue when I host the EU high level structured dialogue in Brussels prior to the Council of Ministers meeting.  This established process brings together leading representatives of EU public authorities and the sports movement to exchange views on topical sporting issues in the EU.  The discussion at next week&rsquo;s structured dialogue will focus on how governments and the sports movement can work in partnership to combat the increased sophistication of doping in sport. </p><p> Since January, a slightly different format has been used for the Council meetings, with the Presidency inviting external speakers to encourage free flowing and interactive discussion among Ministers.  Although external guest speakers have been invited to previous Council meetings, what is new is the idea of encouraging Ministers to intervene more spontaneously in response to what the speakers or other Ministers have said without scripted interventions and allowing the external speakers to respond to the debate as it unfolds.  The Irish Presidency has invited the chief executive officer of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, Mr Travis Tygart, to address the Council of EU sports Ministers.  I am delighted that someone as high-profile as Mr Tygart has agreed to address EU sport Ministers and provide his unique insights and perspective on anti-doping.  I hope Ministers will leave the discussion with some practical ideas they can take back to their capitals for discussion.  </p><p> I am very pleased with the progress made on sport issues during the Irish Presidency, particularly in respect of strengthening integrity measures.  Ireland has a long and distinguished tradition as a sporting nation and in this, our seventh EU Presidency, I believe that this tradition, together with our experience, has contributed to a successful Presidency in the field of sport.  </p><p> I also wish to take this opportunity to outline what the Government has been doing at national over the past two years.  In our first year of Government, we introduced a local authority swimming pool initiative, whereby we spent &euro;14 million throughout the country to enhanced disabled access and reduce energy costs.  Last year, we allocated &euro;1.25 million to the Irish Amateur Boxing Association to improve its facilities, particularly for female boxers.  Last month, I allocated a further &euro;1 million for boxing clubs to upgrade training facilities for young boxers, particularly women.  Some &euro;4.5 million was allocated to local authorities in 2011 under a special shovel-ready initiative to provide facilities aimed at participation.  That worked out very well.  In 2012, some &euro;1.66 million was allocated under a special tracks initiative to develop four athletic tracks around the country.  More than &euro;2.6 million was allocated in 2012 through the national governing bodies in equipment grants.  We also allocated &euro;424,000 to Connaught Rugby so that it could host the Heineken Cup and RaboDirect Pro12 matches in Galway.  The Irish Sports Council received &euro;44.5 million in 2012 and over &euro;43 million in 2013.  We won 64 medals in events at the Olympics, Paralympics and other world and European level sporting events.  Participation levels in sport have increased and we are protecting funding as best we can in these difficult economic times.  The total sports budget this year is more than &euro;72 million, including capital investments worth &euro;27 million across the sports capital programme, the local authority swimming pools programme and the development of the national sports campus.</p><p> I am more than happy to answer any questions that members may wish to raise. </p></speech>

I was one of those who was faced with a choice in the context of dual careers.  The question which arose was whether I should go to work or whether I should run.  I chose to run, for economic reasons.  The Institute of Sport has done fantastic work in terms of preparing our sports people and educating them in respect of their careers after sport.  The Minister of State referred to dual careers and the guidelines that have been prepared and said that a number of conclusions, which will be presented next week, have been reached.  What form do the guidelines, which were not mentioned in the Minister of State's presentation, take?</p><p>  We are aware that doping in sport is a scourge.  There are examples of doping taking place at many Olympiads.  For example, the 1,500 m champion at the Beijing Olympics was found to have doped and was stripped of his gold medal.  The women's 1,500 m champion from the London Olympics was recently found guilty of doping.  Only last week the winner of the women's 60 m hurdles at the European indoor championships was proven to be guilty of doping.  I hope Derval O'Rourke, who finished fourth in that event, will be promoted to the bronze medal position.  We refer to the fundamental principles of honesty and fair play in sport and we try to instil these into the young people we coach and try to encourage to participate in sport.  In the context of the Government's relationships with the various sports councils throughout the world, is it time to replace the current three-strikes-and-you-are-out system with a one-strike model?  Should sports people sign up to a code of conduct which stipulates that if they take drugs and are caught, they are out?</p></speech>

Last year was the first time since 2008 that there has been a sports capital programme.  We received a record 2,170 applications.  We grant-aided 648 separate facilities throughout the country.  I would have liked to have had more money to distribute.  The breakdown in respect of the programme is that &euro;26 million was invested in local schemes and &euro;5 million in regional or major schemes.  We took this approach to try to get the money to the grass roots.  That is why we limited the funding for regional and major schemes to &euro;5 million.  If we had left matters open, major schemes would have sought &euro;7 million, &euro;8 million or &euro;12 million in respect of various projects.  We just could not allow that to happen.  I would love to put another scheme in place and I am currently negotiating with the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputies Noonan and Howlin, in that regard.  I would like to obtain the support of the committee in respect of this matter.  Perhaps the Chairman might issue correspondence to the Ministers involved informing them of the economic value of the sports capital programme.  For every &euro;1 spent on sport, the return is &euro;1.26.  Therefore, this money creates employment and encourages participation in sport.  A stimulus budget is again due to be introduced this year and I hope it will contain funding for a further sports capital programme.</p><p>  As already stated, we received 2,170 applications last year, the largest number received since the scheme was originally established, simply because there had not been a programme in place since 2008.  I thank my officials for the way in which they dealt with those applications.  Members will understand that the number of applications received relates to the economic problems we are experiencing.  Many sports clubs require funding in respect of their facilities and I am delighted that matters worked out so well.  I wish we had more money and I hope we will be able to secure another round of funding.  I would appreciate it if the Chairman and members would write to the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform in support of the concept of another sports-----</p></speech>

We are also hoping to encourage them to enter dialogue with their educational institutions.  The Senator was one of our top athletes for many years.  He is quite correct in that he was obliged to strike a balance between his running and his education, particularly as he was not going to remain an elite athlete forever.  The time for him to retire from athletics was always going to arrive and he needed to have another career.  We are asking member states to enter discussions with their universities and encourage them to put in place courses which would provide athletes with an opportunity to train and compete and, simultaneously, allow them to pursue educational goals.  What we are seeking is flexibility.  We are hoping this will be forthcoming, particularly in the context of the universities.  We will also be asking the sporting organisations to support athletes and assist them in obtaining an education.</p><p>  Let us consider the position of the young people who leave these shores each year to pursue careers in professional soccer in Britain.  How many of them actually make it?  They leave believing they will be the next Roy Keane and many of them return disillusioned.  It used to be the case that they would leave at 16, 17 or 18 years of age.  They would spend a few years at a club and if they did not make it, they would return.  Many of them were not educated and found it difficult to get into the workplace.  We are asking educational institutions to make these types of courses available to athletes and other sports people to assist them in pursuing their goals.  There is life after sport and it is not everyone who makes it.  Senator Eamonn Coghlan did not do too badly during his sporting career and fair play to him.  I am joking, of course, when I say that.  However, I reiterate that not everyone makes it and there is a problem in the context of those who have no place to go when their sporting careers end.  Those who make it do fine, but those who do not encounter problems.</p><p>  The Senator also referred to drugs in sport.  I have been very strong on this matter in Europe.  I reiterate my belief that anyone, regardless of his or her sport, who uses performance-enhancing drugs is a cheat.  We are trying to get governments involved at European level.  I understand that the organisers of some of the major marathons insist on athletes signing a document whereby if they are caught doping at a later stage, they will be obliged to return whatever prize money they may make in those marathons.  Lance Armstrong admitted that he had cheated, but he acquired vast sums of money which he still retains.  That is wrong because it means that cheaters are being supported.  Some of these individuals, through cheating, have enough money to maintain their lifestyles for the remainder of their years.  Stronger sanctions must be introduced.</p><p>  As the Senator is aware, each country in Europe deals with its own sporting organisations.  We must work together, however, because those involved in doping are adopting ever more sophisticated methods, their drug use is not capable of being detected.  We must do more than test for drugs.  The new passport whereby athletes can be monitored for many years must be introduced across Europe.  Some parts of Europe are extremely well regulated but that is not the position in other countries where there is no regulation at all.  As a former international runner, Senator Eamonn Coghlan knows he was competing against individuals who were not subject to the same rigorous testing as him.  That is a matter which must be dealt with at European level.</p></speech>

The governing bodies in sport, which are responsible for handing down sanctions, must come to grips with this matter.  In my opinion, a person caught using performance-enhancing drugs should never be allowed to be involved in sport again.</p> <p>All sporting organisations, nationally and internationally, are too soft.  They should take a stronger line because what we have with the taking of drugs in sport is also happening in gambling, betting and cheating and all of that has to stop.</p><p> With regard to a comment made by Senator Coghlan, one thing that has lifted the souls, minds and spirits of this country in the past four or five years is sport.  We have a serious economic crisis not only in Ireland but throughout the world but sport has lifted people's spirits and minds.  One thing that is devastating for people is when they see a sporting hero win a gold medal, world cup medal or whatever and then three of four months later we find he or she is caught taking drugs.  They should not be allowed to participate in sport again.  Sport is about equality, fairness and everyone being equal starting off, and then the best man or woman wins.  If someone is using an enhancing drug then there is a problem and it should be dealt with.  We need to take a stronger line.  That is why we are bringing Mr. Taggart to the meeting next week.  He is the man who followed Lance Armstrong when other people pulled back and did not do what they should have been doing, but he kept at it.  He is coming to our meeting next week as are some people who have defended Mr. Armstrong in the past.  It will be a good debate.</p><p> The structure is changing too.  What used to happen was that 27 Ministers would read prepared scripts.  That will not happen at my meeting next week.  They will not be using scripts.  I will tell everyone to speak from their mind and soul and say what they have to say and then we will come to conclusions at the end of the meeting.  We will also allow guest speakers.  In the past we had guest speakers.  They used to come and make a presentation.  Then other people spoke and the guest speakers did not have an opportunity to respond, but there will be a different format next week and there will be a good debate.</p><p> The greatest scourge in sport at the moment is doping and people who take enhancing drugs.  It is big business as well.  There are drug barons bringing in drugs from throughout the world and Governments working together must do something to deal with that.</p></speech>

Like Senator Brennan and others I welcome the way the sports capital programme operates, whereby modest amounts are given to a greater number of clubs and organisations throughout the country.  This has been of great benefit.  Often such clubs only need modest support and it is a great lift for them.</p><p>  The Minister of State referred to dual careers in sports.  This is a significant issue.  In many ways sports define countries.  When we think of Brazil, we think of soccer; when we think of long distance running, we think of other countries in Africa; and with middle distance running we think of north Africa.  The idea of world-class sports people and athletes having to train or participate at the weekend but having to go to work on Monday essentially will not work.  We need to get from a position where there is a good prospect or young athlete or sports person to a position where he is beginning to define himself in that sport.  One must have some way of incentivising or dealing with employers.  I know of one person in the past 12 months in west Cork who has had success as a long distance swimmer, Steve Redmond.  He works a day job.  Only for the generosity of his employer he simply would not have been able to achieve a fraction of what he has achieved.  How do we unlock the potential of these people but not hammer the employers who look after them in their day jobs?  I presume this is one of the difficulties and if the Minister of State had a steer on the issue I would be glad to hear it.</p><p>  My second point relates to doping.  I fully agree with the sentiments of Senator Coghlan and the Minister of State.  He is passionate against doping.  In the past 12 months I have heard from various commentators in the media.  There seems to be a move to allow a dirty game or sport whereby everyone is free to take whatever they like and the fastest, strongest or best will win, whereby everyone is allowed to dope.  I listened to some of these comments with horror.  Many of the comments came from commentators who should know better.  I presume the Minister of State has a view on the matter.  I hear these comments more and more and the matter should be nailed on the head.  It would not solve a problem but it would be a start.  I do not understand that warped mentality.  I am unsure what can be achieved but I would appreciate the comments of the Minister of State in this regard.</p></speech>

Do you want to take them and then I will move on to Deputy Fleming?</p></speech>

That is why we have the Irish Sports Council.  We provide funding for them.  The Irish Sports Council targets and funds elite athletes.  Sometimes people forget that we fund them well.  There is a mechanism in place and the council is changing that mechanism.  We are also giving funding to the national governing bodies and they make decisions.  Deputy Harrington referred to a promising swimmer.  The council can provide the financial back-up and support that such athletes need to enhance their position and ensure they get the opportunities they deserve.  The Irish Sports Council has worked well.</p><p>  People talk about the Olympic and Paralympic Games that took place recently.  The reason those involved in the Paralympic Game did so well was because they had the funding from the Irish Sports Council, especially in the case of the elite athletes, and they acknowledge as much.  They were well-prepared, well-trained and they were given the necessary back-up and support from the Irish Sports Council.  It worked well.  That is why we had such success in the Olympic Games with boxing.  It is some years ago since funding for boxing was put in place.  These boxers were supported financially and were given the professional team lead by Mr. Walsh.  People come from throughout the world to examine how we have done so well in boxing and that speaks for itself.  The Irish Sports Council provides the funding for elite athletes.  It helps and supports them and gives them the opportunity, especially in the case of athletes at their peak who are getting good funding from the council.</p><p>  This year the council has given some funding to the national governing bodies.  This means the governing bodies must make decisions as well.  One cannot have someone in receipt of this funding who is making no progress.  At times the bodies must make decisions and decide on the people who are going well, going places and who should be supported.</p><p>  Deputy Harrington referred to dual careers.  Employers in this country have been very good.  Deputy O'Mahony has managed football teams and is aware of this.  Employers have been very helpful and supportive of sport and rightly so.  However, there is only so far their generosity can go, especially in these economic times.  That is why we have the position on dual careers and flexibility.  We are trying to ensure flexibility between the employers and education institutes to try to give athletes the opportunity to develop themselves and make a career out of sports.  That is what we are at.  When we go before the meeting next week in Brussels we will bring in the conclusions.  Representatives will go back to their counties and the conclusions will be finalised at a later stage to establish whether we can bring in support mechanisms to try to deal with this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.414" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1050" speakername="Tom Fleming" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013050800006#F00500"><p>I compliment the Minister of State on his positive report today.  There was a recent example at international level concerning one of our athletes, Derval O'Rourke, who was deprived in the European championships of the third medal.  She came in narrowly behind and was only a fraction of a second from winning the event.  As it turned out we learned last week that the winning athlete was on high-performance drugs.  It was a great let-down for the athlete concerned that she did not get up on the winners podium.  It is a great honour for athletes, their families and the countries they represent to reach that level.  Then, due to someone involved in a highly illegal process, they escape under the radar for so long.</p> <p>It happened, it appeared, to Sonia O'Sullivan in the past, and to some other people, such as the wonderful athlete Senator Eamonn Coghlan.  They are role models for everybody, in particular the youth of the country.  It is shameful for it to happen, especially to athletes from a smaller country who may not be able to hit the higher echelons very often.  </p><p> I agree with the Minister of State that our boxers are the model, in international terms, for what can be achieved from a small pool.  They are high achievers and every compliment needs to be paid to Billy Walsh and his compatriot, whose name escapes me.  They are wonderful ambassadors, together with their team of outstanding boxers.  It demonstrates what we in this country can do.  </p><p> I also commend the Minister of State on the moneys expended on various facilities and initiatives in these constrained times.  He is achieving a lot.  I hope the funding will be maintained.  Money has been dispersed to small sports clubs around the country which were perhaps unsuccessful in the past.  He is giving them an even break.  What are his intentions for the next tranches of funding?  Will they come on stream?  We are all aware of the many good organisations and clubs which are still in need of vital facilities and backup.</p><p> Are we proactive in trying to get the rugby union world championship to locate in Ireland?  I understand we will compete for future world rugby championships.  We have the facilities and I am sure we have the goodwill of the GAA in co-operating with that.  </p><p> I wish the Minister of State well in his endeavours.</p></speech>

The Irish Sports Council spends &euro;18,000 a week on testing.  We are playing our part, but we need to examine ways and means of targeting illegal drugs coming into the country.  </p><p>  The issue of dual careers was raised.  We support GAA players, through the Irish Sports Council, and the players fund we put in place.  An average of about &euro;500 per year per player is paid.  There is a &euro;6 million Irish Sports Council programme in place for elite athletes.  We are playing our part.</p><p>  I hope we can get another round of sports capital funding.  My priority is to target it at grassroots level.  As we did the last time, shared facilities will be prioritised.  The day when we could have facilities in universities, colleges or schools which were not open to the general public are gone.  If taxpayers' money is being provided for such facilities, we should open them up to make sure they are shared.  GAA or soccer clubs should make their facilities available for schools.  If colleges and universities are not closed at weekends and for three months during the summer, their facilities should be made freely available if they are in receipt of taxpayers' money.  </p><p>  If we receive another round of sports capital funding I will re-examine grassroots organisations.  What was said was quite correct, namely, that small amounts of money are required and small facilities need basic things like dressing rooms and playing facilities of a fairly good standard.  In the last round of funding I eliminated the building of stands; those days are gone and we no longer have the resources and money.  It is about participation and making facilities available for young boys and girls to give them the opportunity to play sport.</p></speech>

I hope we see more sports capital grants in the future.</p><p>  In times of economic stress there is a risk that sport is the first sector to be hit.  Is the Minister of State happy he can protect existing funding for sports?  With regard to dual careers, he said the Irish presidency had prepared a set of Council conclusions on dual careers which will be adopted at next week's meeting.  Can he elaborate on the options that might be available to retiring sports people?  </p><p>  Doping has been prevalent in sport for years.  Are we catching up with it?  I note the Minister of State said we spend &euro;18,000 per week on testing.  How much does it cost to test one person?  How many tests are done in a week?  Cheating also involves corruption and gambling.  How are we progressing in trying to combat those aspects of cheating?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.418" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1073" speakername="John O'Mahony" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013050800007#G00400"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I agree with many of his targets on increasing participation among the general public.  I have heard him speak of it many times and it is commendable.  Sports capital funding allows this to happen.  I agree with sharing facilities; it is important they are used to their maximum capacity and that advantage is given to applications for sports capital funding for communities and clubs that do that.</p><p>  I have some questions on the information provided on the meeting next week, and doping and corruption in sport.  What can be done at European or national level to stop corruption?  It was demonstrated in the Lance Armstrong case, for example, that there was a combination of doping and corruption.  The Armstrong foundation provided funding to the cycling federations which were policing Lance Armstrong, and as a result the policing failed.  </p><p>  Things are similar in Ireland.  Is the Minister of State happy with the various governing bodies of sport in Ireland?  The success of the boxers in the recent Olympic Games has been articulated well.  What is the Minister of State's view on money being targeted at sports with competitors who have better chance of winning at Olympic level?  </p><p>  In some of the governing bodies, such as Swim Ireland, 50% of the funding released by the Sports Council goes into administration.  I understand there are fewer than 25 high performance swimmers, three centres and 100 staff throughout the country.  Maybe all the funding is used wisely.  </p><p>  The director of Irish swimming lives and works in Florida and is, I presume, in receipt of a substantial salary.  Swimming in Ireland seems to be governed by remote control.  I could articulate a number of examples.  I would like to say I raise the issue for the benefit of swimming in Ireland, not to criticise it.</p> <p>I merely wish to hear the Minister of State's views on these matters.  As he said, funding is scarce at this time and what is available must be used as effectively as possible.  Unfortunately, the figures I have cited suggest this is not happening in all governing bodies.</p></speech>

Deputy Tom Fleming raised the possibility of Ireland hosting a future rugby world cup.  We are engaged in negotiations with the Irish Rugby Football Union on this issue and they are going well.  I am very hopeful that we will be able to host a world cup in due course.  A great deal of research is being done in this regard, including a feasibility study, and we have had several meetings to discuss the potential that is there.  This country is well capable of hosting international events, as we have proved in the past.  I would be delighted to see Ireland hosting the tournament in the not too distant future.</p><p>  Deputy Sandra McLellan asked about the prospects for an increase in capital funding.  We all want to see that happening and I am hopeful it will be achieved.  The Deputy referred to some of the difficulties encountered by retired athletes.  We are seeking to alleviate those difficulties through efforts to encourage dual careers, retraining and further education.  In particular, we are in discussions with the third level institutions with a view to assisting retired athletes in finding a new career after sports.</p><p>  I agree with the Deputy that doping and match fixing are a major problem for all sports.  I recently participated, with the Commissioner, in a panel discussion in Brussels, where we heard very strong representations, including one from Interpol, on the issue of match fixing.  Interpol appealed to Governments throughout the European Union to co-operate and support each other in seeking to tackle this form of corruption.  There is a data protection issue there which cannot be ignored, but there is no denying the requirement for action.  If should be possible for the authorities in one jurisdiction to convey information they have received to the authorities in other jurisdictions.  There is a major debate taking place in Europe on this issue and an international convention recently discussed it.  If we do not take action against doping, match fixing and other types of corruption, they will destroy the entire edifice of sport.  It is in everybody's interest that we seek to address them.</p><p>  Deputy John O'Mahony spoke about what can be done at international level in regard to doping.  It is all about co-operation and sharing information.  Testing is only one tool in our potential arsenal.  There is also a role for Governments and customs authorities, for example, in monitoring the types of drugs that are coming into their jurisdictions.  Many of the substances we are talking about are being purchased over the Internet.  That must stop and it will require everybody working together, across different jurisdictions, to eradicate the scourge.  As I said, there is a question mark over efforts in this regard in the context of data protection considerations, but that difficulty is under discussion.  We are fortunate in this country to have a person of Dr. Una May's calibre in our midst.  The Chairman might consider inviting her to a meeting so that members can avail of her expertise.  She is in demand throughout Europe as one of the foremost experts in these matters.  She could explain, for instance, how the testing is done and what is required.  Members should be assured that a substantial investment is being made by the Government in this area.</p><p>  In regard to Swim Ireland, the Irish Sports Council does monitor and audit that body.  I do not have the specific information the Deputy requested to hand, but I will ask the chief executive officer of the council, Mr. John Treacy, to respond in writing to the Deputy.  It is the council's responsibility to monitor the bodies under its aegis and ensure the funding it dispenses is spent wisely.  Every sporting organisation must set aside a certain amount of funding for administrative functions, but I agree that the figures the Deputy gave to do not seem to add up.  I will ask Mr. Treacy to respond directly to him.</p></speech>

I agree that we are fortunate to have such good structures in place in terms of the interplay between the sports council and the various national governing bodies.  It is vital that those standards are retained.  The funding to the council last year was &euro;43 million.  There are ongoing and regular discussions between the council and the various sports governing bodies and procedures in this regard are kept up to date.  The national governing bodies are obliged to come on board and to meet certain standards if they are to avail of council funding.</p><p>  I take this opportunity to advise members of my intention later this year to bring forward for their consideration proposals to amalgamate the sports council and the National Sports Campus Development Authority.  We are currently devising the heads of that Bill.</p></speech>

The hosting of the American football team Notre Dame in Croke Park last year attracted large numbers of visitors.  Is the Government lobbying other international sports organisations to encourage more of that type of engagement?  I met some of the visitors who came to Dublin for the Notre Dame game, many of whom travelled to other parts of the country to meet relatives.  They were greatly enthused by the reception they received here, it being their first trip to Ireland in many cases.  Is any work going on in the background in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.426" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1074" speakername="Michael Ring" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013050800008#H00800"><p>Yes, we are working on that issue.  The Chairman is correct that last year's Notre Dame game brought thousands of visitors not only to Dublin, but to locations throughout the country.  It was the first time I ever saw taxi drivers, hoteliers, restaurateurs and publicans so united in their efforts to put on a good show.  The message those visitors brought back to the United States was a very strong and positive one, namely, that there is value to be had from holidaying in Ireland and people here are friendly and welcoming.  The event itself was a tremendous success, as was the Volvo ocean race.  We are always working with F&aacute;ilte Ireland to target those types of major international events.  There is a significant cost factor with some of them which would often require a feasibility study.  Many local authorities are involved in encouraging college teams to come over to Ireland from the United States.  I launched South Dublin County Council's initiative in this regard as part of The Gathering.  American football is somewhat different from soccer, Gaelic football and hurling or rugby in that its games are an occasion for extended families, with grandparents, parents, aunts, uncles and children all attending together.  We saw that in the numbers who came to Dublin for the Notre Dame game and we are targeting more events like it.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland would agree that in terms of return to the economy, it was the best value event for the money we spent on it. Above all, however, it allowed us to send a strong message abroad that this country is alive and well.</p></speech>

I have observed an increase in tourists throughout the country, particularly last weekend.  Will he give a brief overview in this regard?</p><p>  The reduction in the VAT rate last year seems to have had a major impact for the entire tourism and catering industry.</p> <p>Its reduction was welcome.  Does the Minister of State intend to maintain the reduced rate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-08a.429" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1074" speakername="Michael Ring" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013050800009#J00200"><p>I was not expecting the question on The Gathering, but I will answer off the top of my head.  I will supply the figures.  I am glad that the Chairman asked the question, as it gives me an opportunity to discuss the matter.  The Gathering is going brilliantly.  Our first quarter figures increased by more than 7.2%.  Our North American, Italian, French, German and other markets are doing well, but the British market has been weak in recent years.  The good news is that, for the first time in many years, there has been an increase in our British figures.  It is not that the British traveller had been going elsewhere.  With Britain's economy, people were simply not travelling at all.</p><p>  The Gathering is not working because of my Department, F&aacute;ilte Ireland or Tourism Ireland, but because 15,000 to 16,000 Irish people attended public meetings in September, October, November and December and did something that I have not seen done for a long time, that being, they mobilised.  As the Chairman and every elected representative knows, events are being held every weekend in every corner of this country.  When my old school in Westport held its reunion last weekend, people came from England, America and across Europe.  That experience is being replicated across the country.  We were expecting the first quarter to be weak.  The New Year's Eve and St. Patrick's Day celebrations had a good effect and April to July looks to be a promising period.  I am confident that The Gathering will work because it is community led.</p><p>  I compliment the country's communities and volunteers who are doing something instead of just talking.  I thank the local authorities and public bodies for their funding.  I also want to thank everyone who has played a part.  I am confident that The Gathering will be a major success.  We need to build a legacy out of it.  People who visit our country this year will be our ambassadors for the coming years.  They will take with them a good or a bad message about Ireland.  I want it to be a good one, as tourism is important to us.  We expect 325,000 extra visitors this year, providing revenue that is badly wanted.  For every 35 visitors, a job is created.  It is important that we make The Gathering a success.</p><p>  The Chairman asked about VAT.  When we entered into government, we targeted tourism as a priority for job creation.  The Government reduced the VAT rate from 13% to 9%.  It also changed PRSI rates for low-paid workers.  We changed the visa rules so that people who had visas to visit Britain could continue into Ireland.  This was a major problem, as a person from outside Europe could have waited as long as three months for an Irish visa.  The new system is working well.</p><p>  The VAT rate will continue this year.  I have discussed the matter with the Minister for Finance, who knows my opinions on this issue.  The current rate should be retained, although this is a matter for the Government.  In 99.9% of cases, the reduction was passed on.  For the first time, the general public saw a reduction in the cost of eating in restaurants.  It helped the tourism trade.  The recent budget introduced tax initiatives to help hoteliers to redevelop their properties.  Their main problem relates to their borrowings.  I recently attended a dinner in Limerick of 470 hoteliers.  They were upbeat and believed they had turned a corner.  This is an important year for them and I hope that we can support them.  I also hope that the Government will see fit to leave VAT at its current rate for another two years at least.</p></speech>

I support his comments and do not doubt that members will agree with him.  We might request that the clerk write a letter containing the facts about the sports capital grant as outlined by the Minister of State and the need for same.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

Everyone believes that our Department has 100 staff, but it does not.  The numbers are small.  Ms O'Reilly and Mr. Scully have done a great deal of work for the EU Presidency.  The country has held two major conferences.  I do not mind saying this publicly, but I am disappointed by the national media, particularly RTE, which did not give those events more prominence.  People came from across Europe, as did the world's top speakers.  They enjoyed the conferences and their visits to Ireland.  They were delighted by the hosting.  Ms Olivia O'Leary chaired one conference and Mr. John Murray chaired the other.  I thank Ms O'Reilly and Mr. Scully for their efforts and commitment in this regard.  I also thank my small number of staff in Killarney.  Much is happening under the sports capital grant and other schemes and there is a great deal of pressure, but those staff members are delivering.</p></speech>

This meeting has been informative.  We should do this more often.  The Minister of State's Department covers a large area of interest.  We will support his request on opening up the sports capital grant.</p><p>  As there is no other business, the committee will adjourn until 9.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 22 May when we will meet RTE.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>
