Apologies have been received from Deputy Alan Kelly, the Vice Chairman.  We are rearranging the sequence of our agenda for today's meeting and are starting with matters relating to the strategic communications unit.  It follows on from the appropriation accounts 2016, both relating to the Department of An Taoiseach's strategic communications unit.  We are joined from the Department of An Taoiseach by Mr. Martin Fraser, Secretary General, Ms Mary Keenan, head of corporate affairs and Ms Geraldine Butler, finance officer.  We are also joined from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform by Mr. Brian O'Malley, Government accounting unit.  You are all very welcome to today's meeting.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to switch off their mobile phones entirely.  That means putting them on airplane mode, and not just on silent.</p><p>I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee members clearly and with candour, witnesses will be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in line with the Oireachtas witness protocol.</p><p>I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Gross expenditure in 2016 was &euro;23.3 million, with pay and non-pay administration costs totalling &euro;15 million and accounting for almost 65% of the total spend.  The Vote records expenditure of &euro;3.6 million on various statutory inquiries.  These include: the Fennelly commission of investigation into the recording by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of telephone conversations; the Cregan commission of investigation into the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation; and the Moriarty tribunal of inquiry into payments to Mr. Haughey and Mr. Lowry.</p> <p>  The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, is the only agency under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach.  The council received &euro;1.8 million in grants in 2016.  For the Vote as a whole, there was a net underspend of just over &euro;6.7 million which was liable for surrender.  This underspend represented 23% of the Estimate provision for 2016.  Explanations for the variances are given in note six to the account.</p></speech>

As the Chairman said, I am accompanied by my colleagues Ms Mary Keenan, who is the head of corporate affairs, and Ms Geraldine Butler, who is the finance officer.  The committee will have received in advance of this meeting a briefing document detailing the 2016 expenditure and outturn as per the appropriation account.  I want to briefly outline the role and structure of the Department in 2016 and give an overview of the 2016 appropriation account and our administrative and programme expenditure.</p> <p>  The year 2016 saw significant changes in structure arising from the formation of a new Government, the changed relationship between the Government and the Oireachtas and a response to the new challenges posed by Brexit.  The Department continued to engage in national priority issues, as directed by the Taoiseach, such as jobs, unemployment, housing and homelessness, health, justice reform, social inclusion, rural development and Brexit.  In addition to its existing responsibilities, the Department was assigned new responsibilities in areas as diverse as the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, the Creative Ireland programme, data protection, the renewal of Dublin&rsquo;s north east inner city and the establishment of several independent commissions of investigation.  The Department continued to be involved in the reform and renewal of the Civil Service through the work of the Civil Service management board.</p> <p>  The year 2016 was a particularly important year for the Department of the Taoiseach as it saw the successful culmination of several years of careful planning for the centenary commemoration of the 1916 Rising.</p> <p>  The core functions of the Department in 2016 are set out as follows: delivering the executive functions of the Taoiseach and the Government; providing the Government secretariat; supporting the Taoiseach in carrying out his duties as head of Government, including in relation to the Oireachtas, constitutional issues, protocol, the European Council, the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council; working with the Office of the President and with the Oireachtas; engaging with the formulation and implementation of Government policy, mainly through the system of Cabinet committees, senior officials&rsquo; groups, the programme for Government office and the parliamentary liaison unit; support for the Office of the Taoiseach, as well as support for the T&aacute;naiste, although that changed during the year because the Government changed; support for Independent Ministers in Government which also changed during that year; support for the Office of the Government Chief Whip, who also has responsibility for the Central Statistics Office, CSO; and support for the Ministers of State assigned to the Department, which includes the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, the Minister of State with responsibility for data protection and at least for part of that year, if my memory serves me, the Minister of State with responsibility for diaspora affairs.  We also support the Government press office; provide briefing and advice to the Taoiseach on the full range of domestic policy issues and international affairs, including through the work of the NESC, which as the Comptroller and Auditor General said, is one of the bodies under our aegis; and support the Taoiseach and Government in the formulation of Ireland&rsquo;s EU, Northern Ireland and international policies, including co-ordination across the whole of Government.  We also deliver support services through the corporate affairs division, including HR, finance, IT and other services as any other Government Department would deliver.</p> <p>  Across all areas of the Department we spend a lot of time on parliamentary questions, preparing material for use in the Oireachtas, freedom of information requests, answering letters and queries from the public, organising major events, preparing speeches for the Taoiseach and Ministers and responding to media queries.</p> <p>  The outturn for 2016 was &euro;22.58 million against an Estimate provision of &euro;29.35 million.  The lower than anticipated expenditure resulted in &euro;6.76 million liable to surrender to the Exchequer at the end of the year.  Significant variations relate mainly to the programme subheads.  The tribunal subhead was &euro;3.4 million less than Estimates due to the number of legal cost claims settled in the year being lower than expected.  We have no control over third party legal costs incurred by tribunals.  It is impossible to predict the timing of settlement of third party costs or the level of costs.  This moves around year on year as Deputies will be aware.</p><p>The commissions of investigation subhead was &euro;911,000 less than the Estimate.  Two commissions were active in the year and both are independent.  Their expenditure levels depend on their needs and are not a matter for our control.</p><p> Subhead A1 was also less than the Estimate due to delays in filling some vacancies and the transfer of functions relating to the diaspora and EU engagement to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the fourth quarter of the year.  Just over &euro;15 million was expended on pay and administration.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General stated, this accounts for our main spending, with the balance expended on programme expenditure as listed in the Appropriation Account.  The 2016 account was audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, in whose report he noted that the account properly presented the receipts and expenditure of the Department for the year.  He further stated that he had obtained all of the information and explanations he had required for the purposes of his audit.  In his opinion, adequate accounting records had been kept by the Department and the account was in agreement with those.</p><p> I will briefly outline the Department's administrative and programme expenditure in the year.  The lion's share is spent on salaries, with a total expenditure of &euro;11.9 million.  At the end of 2016, the total staff numbers were just over 200.  That this was much less than we had estimated was mainly due to the changes relating to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the EU division.</p><p> In line with other Departments, we have non-pay administrative subheads.  These are small and are as follows - travel and subsistence; training and development; postal and telecommunications; office equipment and external IT; premises expenses; consultancy services; and value for money policy reviews.  The non-pay spend was &euro;3.2 million against an Estimate of &euro;3.8 million.  The briefing document provides a breakdown of this expenditure across.  Some &euro;433,000 was allocated in 2016 to cover the exceptional costs relating to the centenary commemoration programme, which was mainly organised by the Department of the Taoiseach.</p><p> The Department's 2016 programme expenditure was broken down across the following subheads: the National Economic and Social Council figure was &euro;1.8 million; the tribunals of inquiry figure was just over &euro;1 million; the EU engagement figure was &euro;276,000; the figure for Irish personnel in EU and international institutions was &euro;1.553 million; the commissions of investigation figure was &euro;2.489 million; the data protection figure was &euro;248,000; and the figure for diaspora affairs was &euro;825,000.  The document provides further briefing on these elements.</p><p> I thank members for their attention and am happy to respond to whatever questions they may have about the account.</p></speech>

Obviously, members will only have a small amount of time each, so I will try to keep my questions brief.  I would appreciate succinct responses so that we might cross the territory I wish to cover.</p> <p>  Of the two matters I wish to focus on, the first is the strategic communications unit.  Mr. Fraser might correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that it was set up at the request of the Taoiseach and Mr. Fraser was charged with setting it up, but the latter gave some warning about the separation of the administrative side from the political side.  Am I correct in that?</p></speech>

However, I had expected to be asked these questions anyway.  The Taoiseach asked us to set up the strategic communications unit, SCU.  We tried to do so in such a way that it respected the Civil Service rules as a Civil Service unit.</p></speech>

Every week when we examine Department's 2016 accounts, we receive an update.  Our discussions are not purely historical, as we want to make them relevant.  Mr. Fraser is not obliged to discuss any policy matter or answer any question for the Taoiseach, but his advice as Accounting Officer is relevant for us.  We are not asking Mr. Fraser to relay the view the Taoiseach expressed in those conversations.  That is my understanding of the situation.  It is not for Mr. Fraser to speak for the Taoiseach, only to speak for himself as Accounting Officer.</p></speech>

The reply reads:</p><blockquote>By way of background, Government decided on 6<sup>th</sup>September 2017, to establish the Strategic Communications Unit (SCU).  Subsequently, a meeting was held at official level in my Department ... The business case fully reflected Government policy ...</blockquote> <p>According to this, an amount of &euro;5 million was sought.  Given that the Government wanted to establish this unit, was it ever in doubt that it would be established once the request was made?  It looks like the decision had been made.  What supported it?  Was there a SWOT analysis?  In terms of communications, there was a spend of &euro;178 million per annum across Departments and agencies as well as 700 people working in-house, 388 external contracts, 452 websites and 220 paid communication campaigns.  There was a lot happening.  According to the business case, savings would be made, but nothing before us demonstrates how that money would be saved by setting up this unit.  That was one of the stated objectives.  Perhaps Mr. Fraser will talk us through it.</p></speech>

A memorandum was prepared for the Government.  The substance of that memorandum is contained in my report, the audit report and the business case.  Essentially, the Taoiseach wanted to set this up and reform how Government communications were handled.  The business case is probably a good summary.</p> <p>  Over time, &euro;5 million was to be saved.  It can and still should be saved.  As I wrote in my report, given the number of contracts, staff, websites, campaigns and PR companies, a large amount is being spent.</p><p>It has not been nationalised or consolidated so I think we can definitely save that money over time.</p></speech>

When the extent of what it is is seen, there is a huge fragmentation as well.  I do not believe I have seen anything that is convincing that would show how this unit would do that.

There might be a list, if not here it is in one of these reports.  It is about improving how it is all done, rationalising it, consolidating, buying, getting better value for money.</p></speech>

I get all of that but a lot of that is what is done behind the scenes.  There was a perception that there was a change in how communications happened with this unit but it was not about how the change in communications happened from the point of view of rationalising.  It was how things were politically communicated.  That is the change that was obvious from when that communications unit came into being.</p></speech>

That was what the political debate was but that was not the entire purpose of the unit and is not what we will be doing in the future.  All the work that the Deputy talks about going on behind the scenes, was going on behind the scenes.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that there is a case to be made on that.  That function is a separate thing.  I do not disagree that that is needed.  I said that during some of the debate that occurred.  For example, we saw a high profile campaign on the national development plan and the national planning framework.  The thing about it is that a sizeable amount of the money for the unit was spent on that campaign alone.  It is not that both of those plans are not important but they would merit coverage in local media anyway by virtue of the fact that a plan would be something that would be happening over such a long period of time and there was going to be capital spending over 20 years.  There was something for everyone in the audience.  Local media would be very happy to cover that yet public money was spent on that campaign.  </p> <p>  Reading some of the claims made on the project 2040 content in the print media, the advertorials essentially looked like they were normal coverage.  In a lot of cases they had a little banner across the top and fitted in as though they were normal news items.  Even the perception that they are normal news items is a problem.  That was a very well planned campaign that was done across the country.  I am not saying there is not merit in communicating a new approach to the national planning framework or how the capital spending should happen in parallel with that, but is Mr. Fraser, as the Accounting Officer, comfortable with the way it was communicated and the amount of money that was spent?  In terms of how it might blend the political with the administrative, does Mr. Fraser think there was an appropriate separation there?</p></speech>

I addressed all those issues.  As the Accounting Officer I am comfortable because the money was allocated by the Government for a stated purpose.  It is not unprecedented, it has happened before.  It was done in a more modern way because we are in a more modern era, but I was uncomfortable with the outcome and that is why I recommended that the unit be wound down.</p></speech>

Following this, Mr. Fraser says that some of that work will continue to go on across the Civil Service on the rationalisation of the very considerable spend and the 452 websites.  One would have to spend the whole day trying to find the 452 websites and it may not be a good means of communicating, in such a fragmented way.  What are the plans on how that should function, what change has happened or what learnings have there been from the most recent debacle?</p></speech>

If the recommendations are looked at, we are changing how we do our own business but as regards the things that should be done, it is in my report and I list the ways this can be improved.  It is Government policy but I think it is sensible to have cross-Government collaboration on big campaigns, more efficient use of technology platforms, consolidated media buying, efficient third party contract management, which means not having hundreds of different companies doing work for the Government in a fragmented way, rationalising design-----</p></speech>

The fact of the matter is that for &euro;178 million, with all of this staff, websites and contracts, we are not getting value for money for the State.  I know people do not like the term, but there is no whole of Government perspective.  We do not necessarily communicate the things that are most important to people so we will keep going on the streamlining work and the capacity building which is training people.  Politicians often say that people working on communications have no training as they might have been working somewhere completely different so training, professional development and the single identity project will keep going.  I think the Deputy knows what that is, everything will have a consistent look and feel.  The single web portal is an approach to eliminating these 452 different websites.  That will obviously take time, the gov.ie-----</p></speech>

The reason the Department of the Taoiseach has a more prominent role is it has the Government press office.  For as long as there has probably been a Government, the Government Information Service, GIS, has been in the Taoiseach's Department; obviously, therefore, it has a very important role.  We have an important role across government, the same as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I work very closely with my colleagues in it.  We did make this communications reform project part of the Civil Service renewal plan and are going to keep going.  We have a group of assistant secretaries working on it and, as I said in the report, will keep working on the things that are still going ahead.</p></speech>

Does it work more on the administrative side in the work it does.  I mean the administrative side as opposed to the political side.  Is it fair to say the Department of the Taoiseach has a different focus?</p></speech>

It is partly true, of course, because, obviously, try as it might, the Taoiseach's Department cannot avoid politics.<br/><br/>The Deputy asked me about websites.  As the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Office of the Chief Government Information Officer developed <i>gov.ie,</i>they have developed the technology platform.  Obviously, they would be very involved in the development of technology platforms.  That is a certain function they have.  They also have a function in shared services.  If one likes, they have lots of central functions.</p></speech>

The strategic communications unit became involved in <i>gov.ie</i>as part of the overall reform of communications.  Therefore, <i>gov.ie</i>will still continue, but, obviously, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has a wider role in the management of the Civil Service in terms of renewal and reform.  It will certainly work with us on the changes we still want to make.  It is a two-hander.  As I said, I find myself dealing with communications matters out of necessity and it has been like that under every Government.  The GIS is in the Taoiseach's Department and cannot actually be located anywhere else.  The people who want to deal with us want to deal with the Taoiseach's Department and the Government.  That is the way it has always been done.</p></speech>

Have lessons been learned such that we can catch issues in realtime?  Have initiatives been introduced in that regard?  My own party has advocated the establishment of an anti-corruption agency that would catch issues at an earlier point or be large enough and less fragmented in how we deal with things in the future, thus avoiding spending the amounts that are being expended.  Sometimes an investment in the system that provides for checks and balances can avoid some of these spends.  Will the Secretary General tell us whether lessons have been learned?

What the Deputy has talked about is the most important aspect, but if the figure for the Moriarty tribunal is going to top &euro;65 million plus and the Fennelly commission costs &euro;3.5 million - some of the other inquiries are a lot cheaper - we first need to be very careful about setting up tribunals.

I do think the Deputy has a point in that we should have more robust processes in the State -it is not really the Taoiseach's Department but in the State - for stopping these things in advance.  Some of these things are just illegal, underhand activity that is being investigated, and there is not much one can do about that.  I agree with the principle of what Deputy Murphy said.</p></speech>

Mr. Fraser said that some of the things are illegal.  Sometimes when there is some discussion about that and it is said something done was clearly wrong but it was not illegal.  Why was it not illegal?  I refer to the learnings from such situations.  For example, legislation was put in place following on from the Moriarty tribunal, and the same happened after the Mahon tribunal.  Are the findings examined from a Government perspective and are the failures then considered in the context of how it can be avoided in future?</p></speech>

When I wrote in to ask the committee to consider the matter relating to the strategic communications unit, I understood that we would have been inviting people specific to that unit not just the Secretary General.

Why is that?  It is done now, but I do not remember us as a committee making such a decision, in particular about witnesses at assistant secretary and principal officer level.

With respect to the Secretary General, I am not on the Committee of Public Accounts exclusively to look at issues from a couple of years ago when accounts are available.  If an issue arises today, I will ask a question about it because I see that as part of my role and responsibility.  I seek the Chair's guidance that it is perfectly legitimate and valid.  If I have a question that relates to expenditure in the here and now, it should be perfectly legitimate for me to put that question.</p></speech>

As I said in my report, I do not think there is much of a distinction between the GIS and the press office, but they have got much bigger in recent years.  Years ago we had one Government Press Secretary.  We have had a number of additions and a number of name changes.  Essentially, there is a group of people dealing with communications and press matters in the Taoiseach's Department.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Fraser to take a look at it.  Whether it is Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party, Independents or whoever else in government, it very specifically gives a sense of false political ownership of what are ultimately people's entitlements.  I recall one for the invalidity pension some time back.  It does do that.  That is the thing that started me off on this particular issue.</p> <p>  In terms of the various advertising campaigns, Mr. Fraser said in his report there is no evidence to suggest there was instruction or advice or whatever to include certain politicians or certain quotes.  How did Mr. Fraser assure himself there was no evidence?</p></speech>

Here we have many Senators and a councillor running for the D&aacute;il, including their pictures in some instances, although I only found three, so it is not credible that there is no evidence that somebody - I am not saying it was a civil servant - did not ask for Senator X, Councillor Y or Deputy Z to be included in it and told &quot;this is the quote&quot;.  One does not go to Senator X from county whatever to tell us what proportion of the development plan will be workable.  There is not a Minister on the planet who would let a Senator out to say that if there was something to say.  Mr. Fraser knows that.  He has been around long enough.  I was a Senator long enough.

It is fair to put questions about the SCU to him as the Accounting Officer.</p> <p>  Government policy is Government policy.  If it decided to set up the SCU that is fair enough, but his job is to implement that policy.  Is that his job as an Accounting Officer and civil servant?

My question is very straightforward.  I ask Mr. Fraser to answer the question and to be a little bit less defensive if he can.

It set out all of the things the unit was supposed to do.  We then had to recruit people to carry out that work.  We had to engage various people to fulfil various contracts which were set up.  That took a while.  In December the Government agreed the roll-out of the unit's identity, the migration of websites and priority campaigns, as well as some of the things I talked about earlier such as consolidation and continuous professional development.  Some surveys, research and insight were supposed to be done but that never really got going.  Some work was done and some was not.  It was not fully active for more than a few months.</p></speech>

I am not asking him to talk about individual Deputies or the views of any political parties.  When he did his report, he came to a view that there were concerns within the body politic.  He said some of those concerns were genuine and some he did not agree with.

This would not account for the majority of the &euro;750,000 figure.  How much of this money was spent after Project Ireland 2040 was published, which was when we saw advertisements on bus stops, Luas stops and so forth?  Is the response to the parliamentary question wrong or am I misinterpreting the statement that costs at the pre-draft consultation stage amounted to &euro;60,000 and a further &euro;70,000 was incurred at the draft stage?

As far as I know, the advertising on public transport was free because it is the National Transport Authority and that would have happened before, as the Deputy knows.  I have a breakdown here.  There have been many parliamentary questions.  If they asked about expenditure to date, the number was quite low but we were always very clear that the budget was &euro;1.5 million.

There have been two formal phases of public consultation, including the publication of an Issues and Choices paper over February/March 2017 and the publication of a consultation draft of the National Planning Framework over October/November 2017, as well as a range of other regional and stakeholder events.  Some 700 submissions were generated by the publication of the Issues and Choices paper and over 1,000 submissions were received during the 6-week public consultation on the draft NPF.  Finalisation of the NPF benefited substantially from these submissions.  Public awareness was key to ensuring a broad range of citizen and stakeholder engagement and in this regard, an effective awareness and advertising campaign was crucial and the costs incurred were modest in comparison to the breadth and duration of the Framework.  At pre-draft consultation stage, costs of &euro;60,000 were incurred on advertising-related activities and a further &euro;70,000 was incurred at the draft stage.</blockquote></speech>

The money I am talking about was all spent, broadly speaking, in or around the launch in the first half of this year.  It is a campaign.  I thought the Deputy was asking about my report on the strategic communications unit, but he was asking about the actual Project Ireland 2040 report.</p></speech>

The whole point of having a consultation period is to hear from individuals and get the message out there that this is actually being done.  If a small fraction of the money is spent on that element of it and the lion's share of the money is spent on publicising it, it suggests that this was more about spin than about spending the money to make sure people knew in the first instance that this was happening.</p></speech>

A small fraction of the money was spent on saying to Joe and Josephine Soap that they could actually make an input into this.  The lion's share of the money was spent on going out to promote the report and all the bells and whistles that go with it as a document.  That is fine as well.  There might be logic in that.  The point is that the vast majority of the money was spent when it was done rather than on letting citizens know what was being done in the first place and engaging with them.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Fraser not to be flippant in his response.  I was not intending to be funny.  The issues are not funny.  I contend that we are setting up all of these commissions and tribunals because the system itself is not able to give information to the public and to Members of the Oireachtas.  We have a very current live crisis in relation to cervical screening.  Nobody is able to give us a global picture of what is happening.  As a result, there are fact-finding missions going on.  Now there is more talk about whether we should have a tribunal or a commission.  Why are all of these being set up?  Does Mr. Fraser share my frustration that many of these issues arise because the system does not give us the information we need?  The information is there, obviously, but we are not getting it.  For that reason, we are scrambling to figure out what to do.  We are deciding whether to set up a commission or a tribunal, but we would not need to have all these commissions and tribunals if the Civil Service did its job in the first instance and subsequently, when mistakes are found to have been made, if the Civil Service was upfront about them and gave us the information.  Would Mr. Fraser agree with that in the first instance?</p></speech>

The Deputy asked why these things were established.  I have to account for them to this committee because the Oireachtas established them.  Our Department is not explicitly involved.  It is not a flippant reply, it is the truth.  Of the four concerned, one relates to one current and one former Member of the House.  That is the Tribunal of Inquiry into Payments to Politicians and Related Matters, or the Moriarty tribunal.  One relates to the activities of the Garda in Cork many years ago and another to allegations about a private sector business transaction - that is the Commission of Investigation into Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, or the Siteserv inquiry.  Another relates to Project Eagle, which the Chair has mentioned.  I do not think any of those arise from the Civil Service not giving out information.  I do not agree with that.</p></speech>

I return to something Mr. Fraser said earlier.  It was an interesting point and very topical.  He spoke about the difference between tribunals and commissions of investigation.  I do not want to put words into his mouth.  I want to clarify that he said the commission of investigation would be stronger from a spending perspective.  It would be less costly than a tribunal.  Is that what Mr. Fraser was saying?</p></speech>

The first was that, clearly, a commission of investigation is quicker and much cheaper.  I also said to Deputy Catherine Murphy that I shared her view that we do not have sufficiently robust frameworks for dealing with some of these things.  I share her view and she shares mine that I would not like to be spending this amount of money on tribunals, lawyers and consultants.  That is where the money goes.  I would rather have money spent on preventing these things-----</p></speech>

That is the first point.  It includes all oral and written evidence and it even extends to documents that are merely listed as being in use.  That is my point.  We set up these commissions.  It will examine the issue.  If it is a commission, I think it is behind closed doors.  Then much of the information complied and used is put in some vault and cannot be looked at for a long time.  I think there is some time limit on when we can even look at many of the documents-----</p></speech>

They are free, based on that, to investigate and prosecute if they see fit.  However, they have to establish their own evidence trail if they are going to court.  The documents are not locked up.  The Garda and Revenue Commissioners have followed through on some.</p></speech>

In terms of his Department, however, there was spending of &euro;54.7 million on a combination of tribunals and commissions of investigation.  Unfortunately, we may have to establish more.  I am not sure if they will come under the remit of the Department of the Taoiseach's.  The witness listed one that is not listed here.  It will incur further cost.  Those already listed may incur further costs again.  In some of the cases, certainly the live one - and I do not want Mr. Fraser to comment on the issues - a lot of it could have been avoided if we just got the Civil Service to give us answers to questions.  There is an interesting angle for the Committee of Public Accounts to look at.  Surely, there are better mechanisms in place to ensure that we get full disclosure-----</p></speech>

I have to move on to Deputy Catherine Connolly.

The important point is that when one decides to use a particular system, one must look at it on a whole-of-life basis.  When one is originally selecting somebody to build a system or to customise it, one must take into account that it will be used for ten years.  One should be factoring into the evaluation and the business case for it the fact that it is going to be used for ten years, that one will be paying maintenance costs, an annual licence fee and so on.  One can approach the value for money issue at the beginning but what very often happens is that at the end of ten years, one continues to use the system and so every year one needs to be thinking about whether now is the time to look again and move to a new system.  Technologies move on and so on.  It is certainly something that is worth thinking about.  A serious mistake could be made where, for example, one looks at a three-year contract for something, the maintenance costs then become exorbitant but one is locked into the system and one has to incur a fairly major capital expense to change it.  Taking a long-term perspective on something like a technology system is certainly necessary.</p></speech>

It was Mr. Justice Hamilton who a long time ago said that if questions put in the D&aacute;il had been answered, we would not have needed the beef tribunal at the time.  Certainly, in my limited experience of two years, if questions were put and answered properly, we would not need tribunals or commissions of investigation.  I now want to focus on the State Claims Agency, the role of which Mr. Fraser kindly outlined.  I asked in the D&aacute;il on Tuesday how many cases other than that of Ms Vicky Phelan were with that agency but I got no answer.  That is one very practical example from Tuesday last.  Mr. Fraser might say that he is not here to answer those questions but he is, in fact.  It is all about governance structures - either they are in place and are not operating properly or they are not in place at all.  I specifically asked about the State Claims Agency and the reporting mechanism therein.  Subject to checking the record, I think I was told it was an independent body.  There has to be a learning mechanism.  It is fine to give an organisation independence in terms of cases but there has to be a report-back mechanism in place.  What reporting mechanism is in place for reporting back to the Department?  Mr. Fraser made reference to quarterly reports.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We do not have the facts because there is a complete lack of accountability in the various organisations.  We have no report before us, nine days after the initial report.  At the very least Deputies should have a written report outlining what happened and so on but we have nothing.  Nothing has been outlined as yet.</p> <p>  To return to the State Claims Agency, where is the mechanism in the Department of the Taoiseach for learning in order to avoid tribunals?

On the face of it and based on what we have seen so far, if there is to be a tribunal, it will be under the Department of the Taoiseach.  The Department of Health will be a subject of the inquiry, as will the Department of Finance because of its handling of the State Claims Agency, as well as the agency itself.  The Department of the Taoiseach is the only one that has had no involvement in this.  The Departments of Health and Finance are involved, as is the State Claims Agency.  I would argue that neither the Minister for Health nor the Minister for Finance are the appropriate people to head up an inquiry or a tribunal.  It will probably fall back to Mr. Fraser, as Accounting Officer of the Department, to account for this when it comes down the road.  Does Mr. Fraser see the logic in what I am saying?  I cannot see that any other Department could take on a tribunal or commission of investigation or whatever transpires.  The Department has been through a tribunal process previously and it is most disappointing that it cannot put a final estimate on the outstanding costs of the first tribunal of inquiry.  Mr. Fraser has said that the Department must wait until all claims have been submitted but someone in the Department must be handling it and must know how many cases are still outstanding and have at least an estimate of what is out there.  I would hope that if Mr. Fraser and his Department are going to be responsible for a future tribunal or commission of investigation, they will put a good system in place to deal with costings, financing and so forth, before it is up and running in order that Mr. Fraser's successor and my successor will not be saying in ten year's time that they still do not know how much the tribunal or inquiry has cost.  That is not good enough for public confidence in the financial side of things.  Does Mr. Fraser take my point?  He has an opportunity, before the next tribunal comes across his desk, to put a more robust system in place than that which pertained during the previous tribunals.</p></speech>

I know only what I read in the newspapers.  I did not read too many newspapers this morning because I was preparing to come in here at 9 a.m. but as I understand it, the Minister for Health met Opposition spokespersons last night and they have agreed on a process-----</p></speech>

These things often go wrong when people do not think very carefully about the terms of reference, about who does the investigation and how it is done.  As I said earlier to Deputy Cullinane, speed is important and a focus on costs is helpful.</p><p>The quicker it is done, the cheaper it is.  There are also different methods.  On the one we are discussing, which is entirely unconnected with the purposes of this meeting, it is good to think carefully about it to ensure we get the right combination of speed, transparency and that the victims are at the centre of it.</p></speech>

I am looking at processes because that is our role.  We sat here examining the Project Eagle case.  There would have been no need for the Cooke inquiry if answers had been given.  A good and moderate report was done by the Comptroller and Auditor General simply highlighting the issues but the system did not deal with it.</p> <p>  We sat here examining the Grace case and three reports by a health board.  Processes were not up to scratch and, even when they were in place, they were not implemented.</p> <p>  When I hear officials talk about speed, I agree it is necessary.

We have a plan that has significant implications for the country that was never discussed in the D&aacute;il but which then it is sold by way of spin.  In my own city, the Taoiseach was going to the university to spin it.  It is interesting that it was not to use the university to question.  None of this was used for the newspapers to question the document, to say what was good and bad.  It was to spin the document.  If there is not a crisis there for democracy, I do not know where there is a crisis.  There was Government money to spin a story.  It is very serious not to use our third level institutions to question but to use the media to spin.</p> <p>  My last question, because the Chair is looking at me, is on housing and Mr. Fraser's opening statement.  What role has the Department of the Taoiseach in housing?  Mr. Fraser's opening statement refers to it.</p></speech>

The Department is involved in most things that are a priority of the Taoiseach.  On housing, I suppose it was mainly in support of the Cabinet committee, which is now on infrastructure, which probably at the time was dealing with housing.</p></speech>

He states that the SCU has made rapid progress across the three main workstreams approved by the Government, and lists them.  He states, "As well as streamlining and improving communications capacity, there has been huge public interest in the campaigns run by the SCU in conjunction with other Departments and agencies."  Mr. Fraser then goes on to state "Metrics are available to demonstrate the level of public interest".  Where we can find those metrics?</p></speech>

On the level of interest of the public, there has been quite a lot of interest in the material it produced.  I may even have data here.  I just cannot put my hand on them but I do have data here.

I fully accept that in the review that was carried out, Mr. Fraser stated there was no evidence that any direction was given to editors to place Senators and councillors into those advertorials.  I note that the report he was dealing states with there was no Civil Service direction.  There was no direction from the SCU.

The quote is there, on page 11, on the editors:</p><blockquote>All were adamant that decisions regarding the choice of photos and commentators were made locally by themselves and were not the subject of any outside influence.The editor of the National title [which I take to be the <i>Sunday World</i>] also confirmed that their choice of photos and commentators was entirely an editorial choice within the newspaper.</blockquote> <p>I have to believe them when they say that.

We worked on those things and we can see in our engagement survey our results are better in those areas, not in every area.

If the Chairman does not mind I have an important point.  It is an example.  Of course I understand all the concerns people have and that is why I have made the recommendation I have.  It is also important that if we cannot communicate in the modern world, we have a real problem.  The skills that the SCU - I think all members know there is one person in particular who is very skilful at all this stuff and it is not a politician - brought to that were really important because we had to ring all the editors of all the national newspapers and in RT&Eacute; and TV3.  If we could not have done that there would have been implications.  From my point of view, that is quite important.  I do not want to lose that capacity.  The GIS used to do that.  In the days of three newspapers and one TV station, that was one or two people doing it.  Now we have the online world and everything else.  I will not go on about it, but it is quite important.</p></speech>

It is a very obvious matter to think about.  Obviously, I did not see this email until I got the report, but there are a couple of angles to this.  I also said in my report that we have to be careful not to have a chilling factor because the media are increasingly moving to sponsored content.  That is how the world works.  This is a profound public policy issue.  If we do not think about the financial health of our media, there will be all sorts of negative consequences.</p></speech>

Attention was drawn to childcare, in respect of which there is a Minister with responsibility.  Would the unit, the Taoiseach's political adviser or the Civil Service inform the Taoiseach's opinions?  Mr. Fraser talked about housing and homelessness as being one of the priorities.  One of the things the Taoiseach did was to compare our rate of homelessness with those of other countries, minimising in some of our eyes the extent of the problem of homelessness here.  Who gives such advice?  What role does Mr. Fraser have, from a civil servant's perspective, what role does the strategic communications unit have and what role do political advisers have in this?  Who helps to form this particular strategy?</p></speech>

By the way, those of us who have concerns about the operation of the unit are not against streamlining or professionalising communications.  That is a good thing and one of the issues that has been lost in all of this is that this needs to be done to address the silo mentality we have.  I return to my earlier comment regarding the lack of a metric for measuring the performance of the unit and setting out the logic for such a unit, the reasons for its establishment, what it was trying to achieve and what would be the benchmarks and performance indicators.  Teachta Connolly noted there was something in a memorandum that was submitted to government.  We have not seen anything of that significance.  The valuable lesson that should be learned is the need to set out the logic, processes and benchmarks and measure these against the logic for setting up the unit in the first place.  That did not happen in the case of the strategic communications unit, which is the reason it was opened and shut down in a period of approximately five months.  Mr. Fraser has to take responsibility for that.</p></speech>

Are they agreed to?  Agreed.  Having had a cursory look at them, I have one observation to make.  We had much correspondence to deal with last week and met people about the Probation Service and the building.  There were many unanswered questions and we had to issue requests for 27 items of information as a result.  Rather than providing full answers, every one of the items of correspondence generated further questions.  When officials from the Department of Justice and Equality were here, we had to seek further details on ten matters that were not available on the day.  Getting a letter from a Department does not mean that we should accept it at face value, rather we should interrogate it.  We will go back until we get the information we require.</p></speech>

It is doing a brilliant job.  When we receive correspondence and there may be a need for follow-up correspondence, would it be practical to be given a reminder of the question, especially if the correspondence arrives on the day?  I will try not to come back in, but I know that we had an issue with the Secretary General we were questioning.  We dealt with it at a couple of meetings, dropped notes and all the rest, but was the record of the meeting, at which there was intense and robust questioning and so on, adjusted?  Was there stuff taken out of the record online?</p></speech>

With regard to correspondence, at my first meeting at the Committee of Public Accounts, there were a number of issues about which we had asked the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the housing assistance payment properties and the inspection rates.

This is noted and will be published.</p> <p>  The next correspondence is from Accounting Officers or Ministers and follow-up to Committee of Public Accounts meetings, as well as other items for publishing.</p> <p>  No. 1239 B was held over from the last meeting.  It is from Mark Griffin, Secretary General, Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, dated 19 April 2018 and is in response to further information requested by the committee regarding landfill sites, costs and a note on moneys recouped from privately run sites.  This is noted.  Deputies now have this information to use and deal with as they see fit.</p> <p>  No. 1250 from John McCarthy, Secretary General, Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, is dated 26 April 2018.  It provides a follow-up on public private partnerships, PPPs, and post-project reviews carried out by Irish Water.  This is noted and will be published.  We also will come back to the issue of PPPs.  We will not get into a debate on this issue now.  We have a lot of work to do and this will be part of our work when we come back to it.</p></speech>

A circular went out immediately, within days, to Departments to do that.  Realistically it will take a number of months for them to do that.  I said that the committee would hold over on our views on PPPs until we get these documents.  Realistically, I believe this will be after the summer.  I can see it as a significant item of work for the committee after the summer.  We will not have any information with which to draw conclusions before the summer.  Is this okay?</p></speech>

With regard to unclaimed prizes, the contract was signed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They are the people who gave this contract.  I believe then Minister, Deputy Howlin was heavily involved in that legislation in the last D&aacute;il.  Regulation is in place since.  During the debate on that legislation all of these questions were addressed.  The committee will request the secretariat to check the debate on this exact issue and see what assurance the Oireachtas was given on this aspect during the passage of the legislation.   The committee will also ask the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss the actual contract it ultimately signed.</p></speech>

The difficulty is the clause in the licence.  The Chairman is right that these issues were flagged well in advance of any licence agreement being put in place.  We will do a periodic report.  This is one issue that should be flagged as a potential flaw in the agreement made.  I do not know how long the licence runs for but when a new licence is being put in place a recommendation could be made on this issue.</p></speech>

I just wanted to correct my interpretation there.  The regulator said that the information is the licensee's confidential information and therefore, under clause 20.6.1 cannot be disclosed by the regulator.  The regulator would have to have it in order to be in a situation to disclose it.  Obviously the regulator cannot disclose what she does not know.

We requested this information following correspondence on Clonkeen College's school playing fields.  I propose we note and forward a copy to the individual who raised the matter with the committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1254, from John McDaid, the chief executive of the Legal Aid Board, provides a response on the procurement of goods and services by the Legal Aid Board outside of a competitive process.  He gives a detailed explanation on each item and the effort being made to improve the situation.  We will note and publish it and people can take it into account.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1258, from Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, is a note on the progress of the Haulbowline remediation project in Cork.  People can note that and we will publish it.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1259, from Derek Moran, Secretary General of the Department of Finance, provides a note on a sunset clause for the duration of the carry forward of losses relief, including international examples.  We will note this and consider it as part of our corporation tax report, on which we might have a very quick discussion shortly.  We will note this and publish it.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1263, from Professor Patrick O'Shea, president of University College Cork, provides an unabridged version of Cork University Foundation's financial statements for 2016.  We note and publish them.  There we go.  Last week we were presented with an abridged version and we said it was not good enough and that we wanted the full version.. If one does not ask one does not get.  Heretofore it was not made public, but because we asked we have it now and it is good to have it for the public record.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1267, from the Comptroller and Auditor General, Seamus McCarthy, dated 1 May 2018, provides a draft note on the submission of the 2017 financial statements of public bodies to his office.  We will discuss this now as part of the work programme.  The key item the Committee of Public Accounts must ensure is that proper systems are in place in all of the organisations subject to public audit and that proper corporate governance arrangements are in place for all these organisations.  The board of directors, or whoever the most senior people are, have a duty to ensure that proper procedures and systems are in place to account for public money.  One of the first basic elements of accounting for public money is to provide accounts that can be audited and discussed in public at this committee.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has done various reports on a number of organisations that were slow in producing their annual accounts.  Unless we receive financial statements from these organisations we are not even in a position to discuss what is going on in them.  Last December, at the request of the committee, I issued a letter to the approximately 250 organisations audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General stating we wanted them to comply with their statutory requirement to have their accounts with the Comptroller and Auditor General by the end of March.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has given us a list, which I will summarise but I will not read it all out.  We have been dealing with this every week for the past couple of weeks.  Out of the almost 300 accounts audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, only 37 accounts have not been received by his office.</p></speech>

Only 13% have not done so.  The sector of public bodies in Ireland that was most in arrears last year and all previous years was the education sector and the education and training boards.  Last year, only one submitted its accounts on time.  This year every single one of them had its accounts in on time.  This is as a result of our public hearings with the education and training boards.  There has been a dramatic improvement in the third level education sector.</p> <p>  To emphasise the point, we stated that when we came to this point, we would write to each one of the 37 bodies asking for an immediate explanation as to why their accounts have not been submitted for audit.  We also stated we would bring in a number of the organisations, be it the chairman of the board or the chief executive, for a brief meeting to explain why they are not meeting their statutory obligations.  There is a list in front of members and to speed it up, I suggest we invite in five or six.  We will have a separate-----</p></speech>

I propose we invite it to come before the committee.</p> <p>  I propose to turn over the page with the list on it, because we have to be very selective.  I suggest we pass on the third level institutions because we had quite a grilling with them last year.  Dundalk Institute of Technology is the biggest institution that has not come before us yet.  It came before us last year, when it was in the position of not being able to appoint a chief executive.  It knows precisely the issue it had and it also had bigger issues.  Rather than bringing it back a second time, I suggest we pass on it.  We will write to them all.</p> <p>  The issue of the patients' private property accounts is an obvious one on which to invite in the Accounting Officer.  Perhaps Mr. McCarthy will give some information on this.  There may be a reason that its accounts are not in yet, as there are two sets of audits.</p></speech>

Obviously the accounts are decentralised.  There are many care homes where patients' private property is held.  A firm of accountants is used to carry out work on a cyclical basis in the care homes, and it is involved in the preparation of the accounts.  It is a complex process.  It is something the committee has examined in the past 12 months anyway.</p><p>It takes longer to get them into shape.</p></speech>

They might at that stage.  I suggest we invite the Abbey Theatre.  It does not have its accounts in and its turnover in the previous year was &euro;12.5 million.  I refer also to the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  It has &euro;12 million.  Does anyone want to add or object to that list?  We have the Local Government Fund, the National Training Fund, the Abbey Theatre and the ESRI.  The ESRI is meant to be the expert.  That is four so far.  Are we happy to go with them?

Our job is to examine systems, practices and procedures and costs to the State.  I am conscious that the most important issue is the cost to the women involved, of which we are all aware and conscious.  We have a specific role in that regard.  It might seem cold to people listening, but we can and have to examine where there might have been systems failures, process failures and procedural failures and how they could have cost the State money.   The first obvious one is that the system was outsourced, it seems against advice.  That outsourcing could potentially have cost the State money.  If there is a redress scheme, I imagine there will be a cost to the State.  A circular was issued to general practitioners, GPs.  We do not know who made the decision to issue it.  That seems to have been a failure that could cost the State money.  To say the very least, there were certainly breakdowns in communication.  There are allegations of a cover-up made by the solicitor of the lady who took the court case.  If that is the case and it costs the State money, it is obviously a difficulty.  Then there is the role of the State Claims Agency.  One of the issues at the heart of it is, unfortunately, that the woman concerned was dragged through the courts.  She had to fight every step of the way to get information that should have been made available to her.  </p> <p>  We are back to the point made in the earlier discussion with Mr. Martin Fraser.  The system seems to be at sixes and sevens in even being able to give us any information.  Either intentionally or unintentionally, deliberately or not, with the public, we are not in a position to get answers to questions.  The matter has been debated in the D&aacute;il and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health will examine it.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach will also look at it.  We have a very specific remit which we need to use because people need to be held to account.  There may be scoping reviews and, at some point, other investigations and examinations, but we have a particular role to play.  The starting point should be where process failures cost the State money.  I refer to the State Claims Agency and its role in fighting the case at greater cost to the State.  That is also an issue for us.  That is my recommendation to the Chairman.  I emphasise as strongly as I can that while I am talking about a cost to the State, I am deeply conscious of the cost to the women involved which is the most important overriding issue.  However, our remit is financial.  That is why I am emphasising that aspect.</p></speech>

I agree fully with Deputy David Cullinane.  This committee purely discusses value for money related issues.  Similar to Deputy David Cullinane, when the decision was made, if it was based on there being sufficient capacity, was there an examination of the scaling up of resources in the area of pathology, as opposed to having tests carried out abroad?  Could that have been done in parallel in order that we could have saved money?  We could be gearing up for other clinical programmes where there is already a lot of testing for various illnesses and there are plans for more.  Was that done and, if so, what did it show?  Was there a robust public procurement process to select the laboratories to be used?  What assurances about the level of competence were given in selecting the laboratories?  Did they form part of the procurement process criteria?  What is the nature and terms of the contracts in place?</p> <p>  There has already been a cost to the State in legal fees, communications fees and other fees.  We are only at the beginning of the crisis.  Clearly, there are going to be substantially more costs.  Within the contract, is the State eligible for compensation, as well as the individuals affected?  I refer to the cost and fallout of the problem.  The State will have to divvy up a huge amount of money, not just for redress but also for costs because this happened.  Do we have any comeback against the laboratories if, in fact, they are responsible?</p><p>I heard some criticism in the media today that the body politic is, with manufactured anger, jumping up and down to try to deal with this process.  However, if any of us can contribute in some small way to the very important need to restore confidence in testing and so on, we need to do so as quickly as possible.  Quite separate from scoping, commissions of investigation and whatever else is happening, we should do so pretty quickly because once this process starts, whatever form it may take, the shutters will come down and there will be no information at all for the public.  We have a small role on the value-for-money side that we could usefully fulfil, as Deputy Cullinane has said.  Other committees will focus on other aspects according to their responsibilities, but we should fulfil our role.</p></speech>

I think every one of us will reiterate the point that there is not only a human cost to this, but also a loss of confidence on the part of people who are not directly impacted.  There could end up being a healthcare cost due to people avoiding screening, which in turn could result in another cost.  If one is talking about saving money, sometimes cutting corners, as opposed to investment, is not the way to do it.  It is valid to consider the aspect of outsourcing from an economic perspective because it feeds into the human cost dimension of it.</p> <p>  We received a paper last February from the HSE on open disclosure.  There is a contingent liability.  That was not in that paper, but there is a contingent liability of-----</p></speech>

That document told us that 20,000 of the HSE's staff were trained in this.  The Health Service Executive has about 130,000 staff, and it is not that every one of them would need to be trained in this.  Is that the extent of the training?  There are things like that that jumped out, the fact that some of these things were established as pilots.  We need to understand how the process was then rolled out, and we need to understand the interaction with the State Claims Agency, which appears to be taking a different approach, judging by the apologies that are made outside the courts on a routine basis.  I still think, regarding the interaction between these two bodies, if they are not acting in symmetry in respect of the open disclosure approach, we do not have an open disclosure approach but an adversarial approach.  We need to square that circle or see where that conflict is happening because it is very obvious that it is playing out in public.</p> <p>  The other point we were talking about is how we reduce the legal costs in respect of settlements and stop putting people through the torment of court.  We absolutely need a State Claims Agency, and there will be claims that are put in that need to be challenged, but I think there is a conflict there and that is the substance of the piece of work we should do.  I think the other aspects will fall within that.</p></speech>

In our role as members of the Committee of Public Accounts, sometimes we have to look at the bare figures as opposed to the overarching issues, which fall within the remit of other committees.  Our role in taxpayers' money is very clear to all.  The matter at hand goes back to a policy decision that, I understand, emanated from 2008.  It was interesting that a current Member of the House spoke at length, and it was up on social media the other day-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-03a.1112" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1300" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018050300002#X01600"><p>I thank the Chairman.  Deputy O'Sullivan made some remarks in 2008 during the debate on this matter.  I went back to the transcript to see what others had said and it was interesting that one Member, who was not known to me, said this was a decision that was penny wise and pound foolish and shortsighted.  I suppose we are now seeing the appropriateness of that remark - during a Second Stage debate I think - in terms of the prospective cost to the taxpayer.  As members of this committee, it should be important for us to note that the precise nature of the settlement of the case in respect of the extraordinarily brave Vicky Phelan was met by the US lab and not the taxpayer.  That is the first thing and it is an interesting point for us to note in the context of the discussion on a redress scheme being established.  Deputy Cullinane hit the nail on the head when he asked whether the laboratory will meet the cost.  Is there redress for the State?  These things will have to be discussed in the context of the HSE or the unit appearing before this committee.  As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I am acutely aware that if wrong has been done - clearly it has - the committee, I am sure, does not wish to interfere in the establishment of facts, which is not for this committee, respectfully.  To Deputies Cullinane and MacSharry I say I am all for the HSE coming before the committee and answering questions on this subject matter, but at the same time we have to give, as I think the Taoiseach said, space and time in order that we can actually make the decision.  That decision will be made by Members of the D&aacute;il in consultation with the leaders and spokespersons and that is the most appropriate thing.  With that small caveat, I entirely support the call by Deputy Cullinane.</p> <p>  Finally, I think there are some questions that are perhaps not appropriate for this committee but I will put them out there anyway.  The overall cost to the taxpayer versus the provision of the service in this State was the point I read from the 2008 debate that I found most interesting.  It was a very common theme across most Members of the House, other than the Government, of course, but that is unsurprising.  The point was whether we had the capacity to provide this service within the State in an efficient manner.  As someone who looked at the options that are available to the women of this country in terms of the results of the smear tests, it is quicker to send them away.  There is a question there as to whether it might take longer but cost less and whether it is something that is extraordinarily time-sensitive in the context of this screening process taking place.  These are questions that we have to ask about the remit of this committee and whether it might not be more appropriate for us to at least have a State agency, a State-owned agency or a firm operating in this State to be able to come before us in the future, for instance, if we were to vary the policy as a result of the controversy surrounding this particular matter.</p></speech>

Deputy MacSharry has set out his serious concerns in his email.  I will not repeat them but they are clearly set out.  There are issues that must be looked at.  We should consider bringing the State Claims Agency in before the committee.  It comes under the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, which has also come before us.  That is one avenue we could immediately look at to get clarification generally.</p> <p>  With regard to being penny wise and pound foolish, I sat on a health forum for ten years.  I was there when the decision was made to privatise the service.  I come from a city that had a first-class laboratory, which was used to roll out the first phase of the cervical smear tests because the laboratory was so good and it had such capacity.  The problem arose for two reasons.  First, the capacity of the public system was deliberately run down and the expertise was lost and second, a policy decision was made through a Progressive Democrats philosophy that outsourcing was good, cheaper, quicker and better.  I must clarify this because it is about more than being penny wise and pound foolish.  At the time we knew it was not.  This was not me; it was the experts who were busily engaging with us in 2008.  We clearly put this on the record, not because I was saying it or because I was on the left of the political spectrum, but because the experts were telling us that the decision was dangerous, wrong and would come back to haunt us.  It is a fact that these opinions were absolutely ignored.  Since then I have had details as to the expertise of the service.  Even I was not aware of how expert it was and that it was chosen as a pilot project.</p> <p>  On the role of this committee, I do not know how we are to tease this issue out.  Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General might help us.  In value for money terms, nothing was presented to us to show that the service was more efficient or faster.  No evidence of the sort was presented to us at the time.  I would like to see the documents for the business case for changing the service providers.  As with the business case for the strategic communications unit, what underpinned this outsourcing other than a philosophy that privatisation was best?  There is scope for us to look seriously at the State Claims Agency or the NTMA, or whichever is the appropriate body, to come in to the committee.  It is unacceptable that practical aspects were not answered two days ago in the D&aacute;il.  It now transpires there were 21 cases.  Ten are active cases, six have initiated proceedings, four have written letters and there is one other case.  The case numbers are rising on a daily basis.  None of that practical information was available in the D&aacute;il.  I just wanted to put this into context.  </p></speech>

There are women in Ireland who are physically and mentally under pressure because of what has happened during the last ten years.</p><p>How far can this committee probe and investigate?  HIQA is currently conducting an inquiry and there will also be a public inquiry.  Will the information be <i>sub judice</i>? If Members of the Oireachtas ask questions about the issues while an investigation is ongoing - whatever sort of investigation is set up by the all-party group of Opposition spokespeople - how far can we probe?  I understand when a similar situation arose in 2008 there was no screening for cervical cancer until then.  The then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, brought it in during 2008.  I understand that there were many laboratories in Ireland at the time that did not have the international accreditation to be able to carry out the tests, that they did not have the capacity to do them in Ireland and this is why the service was outsourced.  That could be right, that could be wrong, I do not know.  I am told the laboratories did not hold the international accreditation to carry out the tests and that this was part of the criteria for doing the tests.</p><p>How far can an Oireachtas committee go with regard to investigating this and will our hands be tied?  Will we cross over into a danger area if an inquiry is ongoing when set up by the D&aacute;il?  Any light that can be shone on the issue or any relief that can be given to the ladies of this country will help.  I wonder about how far we can go or whether we will have to get legal advice.  Will our hands be tied on what we can ask and what we cannot ask?  Will there be certain aspects we can visit or not?  I would like to know how far we can go.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-03a.1115" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018050300002#Y00300"><p>We can only tie our own hands.  We have a very clear remit and we should do stay within that but I completely agree with Teachta Farrell that we should not trespass on the work of any other committee's remit.  With regard to the sectoral committees, the Minister for Health is responsible to the Joint Committee on Health and the Accounting Officer is responsible to the Committee of Public Accounts.  On the costs to the State, Vicky Phelan's settlement cost was incurred by the service provider in the United States of America.  If a redress scheme is set up, I cannot see how a redress scheme set up by the State or by a Minister can force a private company to do anything.  It would be a civil matter between the private company and the individual.  I imagine that a redress scheme would look at the State's failure and the HSE's failure and how it impacted on women.  That will be a cost to the State.  Redress costs will not be borne by any private company.  There will be parallel processes with private civil court cases between the company and individuals, and the redress process looking at where the State messed up or, what the Taoiseach described as a cock-up.  That will be a cost to the State.</p></speech>

By suggesting the taxpayer, I was inferring that if the fault is not with the State and the majority fault is primarily with the laboratory, the redress scheme would have to be funded via a settlement via the State taking a case against the laboratory.  I should have made myself clearer.  I must point out that I would not wish to block any proposal for a redress scheme.  As members of the Committee of Public Accounts, however, we should be acutely aware that if taxpayers' money is to be used the committee and the Houses should look directly at how the redress scheme is to be funded.</p></speech>

The picture is unfolding every day and we do not know what is going to happen next week.  I met some ladies last night and they have told me that last weekend they were afraid of every unrecognised number that rang on their phones in case it was a doctor or consultant ringing them with bad news.  They were in fear of phone calls coming from strange numbers last weekend.  That is understandable.  We are only starting down a very long road.</p> <p>  We need to focus on what we can do in the meantime.  It was agreed by the Oireachtas, by the Government, by Opposition parties and spokespeople and leaders that decisions on scoping exercises or commissions of investigation will happen though the Chamber and not through the Committee of Public Accounts.  We cannot do anything to conflict with that.  Issues of redress are interesting but that is way down the road and above our paygrade.  That will be decided at Government level.  It is no harm to flag it but that is a little bit down the road.</p> <p>  Since last week's committee meeting, we have written to the HSE to ask what lessons have been learnt from this case, and noted that the discretion extended to informing patients versus the patients' right to know.  We also asked for a copy of the circular that was sent to clinicians regarding the use of the judgment, and we asked for details of procedures to deal with errors in the system when they occur.  That letter was also sent to the Department of Health and to CervicalCheck.</p> <p>  We have discussed clinical negligence before.  The Committee of Public Accounts received a letter on 31 January from the State Claims Agency on the broader issue, not on this particular case.  The letter was from Ciar&aacute;n Breen, the director of the State Claims Agency.  If people would like to follow up on the correspondence it is reference No. PAC 32-1-708.  It was interesting because we had asked the State Claims Agency about the management of claims.  In that document, the agency told us that it had &euro;2.66 billion worth of claims on its books at that stage.  The vast majority of those claims related to clinical negligence.</p><p>The letter continued to give a breakdown of the payments in 2017.  In line with other years, approximately one third of the total payments were legal costs.  It is interesting that the letter from the State Claims Agency, which I have re-read in recent days and will republish it or let people know that it is on the system says: &quot;injury as a result of a clinical negligence event must be compensated appropriately and as quickly as the circumstances of their cases permit.&quot;  The agency states that &quot;it has a duty to act fairly, ethically and with compassion in all its dealings.&quot;  The agency also states that some cases are very traumatic and that it wants to avoid people being cross-examined in court.  The letter continued:</p><blockquote>So why does it happen?  Sometimes, it happens because the case is so complex that liability or causation have been difficult to determine or are in dispute.  But it mostly happens in cases where settlement demands made by plaintiffs' lawyers are significantly overstated.</blockquote><p>It goes on to repeat that point heavily in the following page.gives one example of a lawyer who sought too much money.  The State Claims Agency has bluntly told us that the reason many of these cases go to court is due to greedy lawyers and not the people concerned.  The agency has stated here, in public evidence, that there have been several cases where the injured party was happy with the settlement but the solicitor or legal team representing the legal party was unhappy so they went to court on those issues.  We are very far removed from dealing with the person who is the victim or the person who has suffered in these cases.  </p></speech>

The letter continued to quote chapter and verse about open disclosure, which was launched in 2008.  On 8 February, this committee received a letter, reference No. PAC 32-1-707, which was about open disclosure, plus a 96-page document on open disclosure, pilot schemes, a review of pilot schemes and training.  It is not happening yet, ten years on.  We have the 96-page document on our desk and we have been dealing with this topic.  We will contact the State Claims Agency again and specifically ask about the confidentiality clause.  I do not think the State can spend taxpayers' moneys on preventing people from disclosing settlements and it would never want to take somebody to court for disclosing what was done and spend money on preventing that information from coming out.  That has been part of the problem.</p></speech>

More than 40% of the Department's expenditure goes to RT&Eacute; so we will engage with it to help us understand how this public funding is used.  We are joined today from RT&Eacute; by Ms Dee Forbes, director-general, who is very welcome.  I believe it is her first time to come before the Committee of Public Accounts.  From RT&Eacute; we also have Mr. Jim Jennings, director of content, Ms Breda O'Keeffe, chief financial officer and Ms Eimear Cusack, director of human resources.  From the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment we are joined by Ms Patricia Cronin, assistant secretary and Ms Barbara Leeson, principal officer.  They are all very welcome to today's meeting.</p><p>I remind witnesses, members and those in the public Gallery that all mobile phones should be turned off, which means putting them in aeroplane mode.  Putting them on silent is not adequate because they will interfere with the recording system.</p><p>I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol for Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>I ask Ms Forbes for her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-03a.1191" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dee Forbes" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018050300002#JJ00400"><p>I thank the committee for inviting us here today.  While we routinely attend meetings of the joint Oireachtas committee on communications, this is the first time RT&Eacute; has been before the Committee of Public Accounts.  As the Chairman mentioned, I am joined by my colleagues Mr. Jim Jennings, director of content, Ms Breda O'Keeffe, chief financial officer and Ms Eimear Cusack, director of human resources.</p><p>I hope that, between us, we will be able to answer any questions members may have.  I also hope they have had the opportunity to read the briefing material we prepared and submitted earlier this week.  As per the letter of invitation, the material covers in some detail how public funding in RT&Eacute; is used and accounted for, and the extensive regulatory and oversight mechanisms that pertain to RT&Eacute; and RT&Eacute;'s reporting.  As clarified last week, it also specifically covers how RT&Eacute; operates as an employer and sets out the context and issues in the recently published report on the future of RT&Eacute; orchestras.  I do not intend to go over the briefing material in my opening remarks, but we are happy to elaborate on any questions members may have.</p><p> I would like to outline the broader issues that are relevant to today&rsquo;s discussion.  I welcomed in the Chairman's letter of invitation the fact that the committee is supportive of the independence of RT&Eacute; and that matters of programming are not intended for discussion.  Editorial independence and impartiality is the bedrock of public service media in Ireland.  It is central to understanding why RT&Eacute;'s journalism and programming remains highly trusted by the public, and still retains such large audiences on television, radio, online and on mobile devices, despite the growth of many alternatives.  However, as the committee will surely acknowledge, what we can produce and commission, and the quality of all we do is inextricably linked to the resources we have.  It may appear to some that the organisation has plenty of money but given the scope and breadth of our statutory obligations, the range of services we must provide and the nature and scale of the competition we face, RT&Eacute; has inadequate resources.  Over the past number of years that has been confirmed by numerous independent reports and reviews that have examined in detail everything RT&Eacute; does, and is obliged to do.  As the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment conveyed in its briefing material to the committee, the cost of RT&Eacute;'s public service activities is substantially in excess of the public funding it receives in the form of licence fee revenue.  The balance comprises commercial revenue which, as members will note from the briefing material, has fallen by 36% or close to &euro;90 million over the past ten years.</p><p> The greatest risk to public service broadcasting in Ireland and many other countries is restricted funding at a time of unprecedented competitive threats and fast-changing media consumption habits.  It would be remiss of me as director general at a time of such turbulence in media, when so much of what we have relied upon for our news, information and culture is under such threat, not to impress on members the urgent and substantial financial challenges facing RT&Eacute; and, by extension, the broader sector that relies on a healthy RT&Eacute;.  Since 2008, RT&Eacute;'s overall annual funding has fallen by in excess of &euro;100 million or 23%, while, in parallel, our obligations to develop online and mobile services and to fund and deliver digital television have increased substantially.  This is why we are not investing enough in television drama, children&rsquo;s programming, arts and culture output, and Irish language television programming &ndash; programming that is essential if RT&Eacute; is to support and sustain Irish culture and Ireland's most talented writers, animators, directors and actors.  This is why RT&Eacute;'s investment in the independent production sector has halved from &euro;79.5 million in 2007 to just under &euro;40 million in 2016.   This is why we are finding it harder to sustain audience share and compete for commercial revenue against highly resourced competitors such as Virgin Media, SKY, BBC, ITV, Netflix, Amazon and a host of opt-out channels that take advertising from Ireland but invest little or nothing in Irish programming or the Irish creative sector.  This is why we do not have enough international-foreign correspondents at a time global and international affairs are affecting the lives of Irish people more than ever.  This is why we are struggling to maintain, let alone grow, our investment in investigative reporting and programming, which is essential to our public purpose but which is high risk, difficult to produce and expensive.  This is the context for the review we have just published on RT&Eacute;'s orchestras.  This is why we have had to restrict capital investment to 50% of depreciation for almost ten years now, which is unsustainable for any industry but particularly for one that is changing so quickly. </p><p> There is much RT&Eacute; can do and is doing to change the organisation to meet the challenges of the digital era.  We are completely restructuring how we operate, moving away from traditional media-based structures and reorganising around key areas of output across our services such as drama and comedy, arts and culture, news and current affairs, factual, sport, Irish language, and young people's.  We have sold a significant portion of land in Donnybrook, freeing up finance to invest in critical digital infrastructure and building fabric that has been in existence since the 1960s.  Anyone who visits RT&Eacute; today will see this change very much in evidence.  We reduced our costs substantially - by &euro;96 million or 22% - between 2008 and 2016 through a series of measures, including pay cuts and a large reduction in our workforce.  We have much to do but we are well under way.  This is a difficult process, particularly for staff, of whom much is being asked, but we are determined to ensure RT&Eacute; continues to remain at the centre of Irish public and cultural life as so much changes around us.</p><p> Just as there is, rightly, a responsibility on me, and on us, to modernise and change RT&Eacute;, surely there is also an obligation on policymakers and Government to modernise the television licence system, which is fundamentally unfit for purpose and unreflective of how people consume and interact with public service media and content today.  As we have detailed in our briefing note, television licence evasion currently stands at 15%, which results in a gross loss of approximately &euro;37 million annually; "No television homes", due to outdated television licence exemptions result in a gross loss of &euro;24 million annually; as a percentage of revenue received, An Post collection costs are at 5.5%; and evasion levels in Ireland are more than twice that of the UK while collection costs are more than double those of other European counterparts.  This is not something for which RT&Eacute; is responsible but it has a massive bearing on our capacity to plan for the future and invest in the type of programming that we know audiences want and have a right to expect from us.  Why is it acceptable that the television licence fee collection system is so inefficient that more than &euro;60 million goes uncollected every year?  The State is failing to collect what it believes is an appropriate fee for having a television licence and for the service that funding underpins.  That is not acceptable in any other area of the public finances and it should not be acceptable when it comes to public service broadcasting.  RT&Eacute; is not asking for additional money from households; we are simply asking that the fee the State believes is appropriate for television licensing be collected.  Aside from the lost revenue to a sector that badly needs increased investment, more than anything, the current system is fundamentally unfair on those who pay.</p><p> An all-party committee similar to this has made a series of clear recommendations, including the need for responsibility for collection of the fee to be ascribed to the Revenue Commissioners.  The Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment published a comprehensive report following months of consultations and hearings that resulted in sensible and achievable recommendations.  All RT&Eacute; is asking for is that the recommendations in the report be implemented.  The broader sector, including the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, which represents commercial radio, Screen Producers Ireland, which represents the independent production sector, and the Screen Directors Guild of Ireland, which represent directors involved in the Irish and international audiovisual industry, shares this view.</p><p>If members believe the future of public media and quality Irish programming is important, we ask them to do what they can to support the implementation of the recommendations advanced by their colleagues.  </p><p> Much is now at risk.  If one talks to anybody in our sector, he or she will tell you the Irish media sector is in real trouble.  All of us who invest in quality Irish journalism and original reporting, all of us who invest in quality home produced programming &ndash; newspapers, commercial broadcasters and public service broadcasters &ndash; are struggling to sustain what we do.  </p><p> The only organisations that benefit from a severely diminished Irish media are international media groups, tech companies and international content providers, none of which invest in Irish journalism, culture or programming or in the Irish creative economy.  In television in particular, without reforms, Ireland will quickly become just an extension of the UK and the US markets.  Is that really the future we all want?  If not, there are options and there are solutions if there is political will to act.  I understand, for example, that the newspaper industry in Ireland is requesting that the VAT rate on newspapers, currently at 9%, be reduced to zero as it is elsewhere in Europe.  As for RT&Eacute;, one such solution is to ensure there is strong indigenous public media service at the heart of Irish life that has the resources, authority and trust to ask the tough questions and address as its priority the issues, challenges and questions facing this society.  It should be one that is strong enough to help sustain a vibrant indigenous culture, to support local programme makers and local creative talent and to ensure distinctive Irish voices on our airwaves, as well as ensuring we continue to have moments of shared national experience, available to all free-to-air, where all the expressions and iterations of ourselves have a home.  </p><p> For more than 90 years, although at times imperfectly, RT&Eacute; has uniquely and consistently connected journalism, politics, culture and communities in Ireland while retaining the trust of the public.  This role is as relevant and important today as it was when RT&Eacute; was established.  RT&Eacute; has reported net operating deficits for 2015 and 2016 and will do so for 2017.  If this continues it will have a devastating impact on both RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s dual funding model and on its schedules, its capacity to deliver on its remit and its relevance to Irish audiences.  Notwithstanding all we are doing, will continue to do and have done over the past decade, we are now at a point of decision.  It is simply not possible for RT&Eacute; to stabilise its financial position, continue to fulfil its role or act as an engine for the broader creative sector without addressing the issue of its resources and the TV licence system.  </p><p> This meeting will no doubt touch on many issues and we will do our best to answer members&rsquo; questions but I ask them to also bear in mind the broader challenges facing much of our national media today and the implications they have for much of what we in this country hold dear, including our culture and identity; our obsessive interest in news and current affairs; our creativity, our music and our stories.  It is surely in the national interest that this issue is urgently addressed.</p></speech>

It is good to see a healthy gender balance in her delegation.  I think this is the first time that RT&Eacute; has been before the Committee on Public Accounts.

The people who are watching, the public who we represent, do not have those briefing notes.  They will only have or can see what Ms Forbes read out, her opening statement.  It is all very wonderful that she has alerted the committee to her concerns about the licence fee, which is an issue worthy of its consideration, but members wanted to discuss what they saw as very important issues.  I wanted to put some context on her remarks, as I am somewhat disappointed that it did not feature in the opening statement because it is a real problem.  Incidentally, the reason Ms Forbes was invited before the committee was because the Accounting Officer, who is the Secretary General of the Department, was not in a position to answer specific questions members had.  A large chunk of its voted expenditure goes to RT&Eacute; - I believe it is &euro;170 million of taxpayers' money - and there must be some level of public accountability.</p> <p>  How much of RT&Eacute;'s funding comes from the taxpayer, whether directly or indirectly? </p></speech>

Furthermore, when we develop annual budgets, we meet the Department and discuss the budgets and the challenges within them every year.

I understand that.  However, what is the difference between the oversight agreement and what would be a service level agreement, which normally would be in that type of relationship especially when there is significant funding?  There could be a very substantial service level agreement.  The HSE, for example, would operate them with organisations.</p></speech>

I understand the oversight arrangements that are currently in place between ourselves and the Department under the Broadcasting Act.  There are extensive requirements under the Act.  In addition to that, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, is the regulator for RT&Eacute;.  It makes sure that the various sections of the Broadcasting Act are implemented.  Beyond that, obviously, we have all the financial controls.  Then there is the annual statement of performance commitments, which is, perhaps, the territory the Deputy is talking about.  Every year, we submit to the BAI our annual statement of performance commitments.  It is RT&Eacute;'s commitments on what it will do with that funding every year.</p></speech>

That is the reason we invited our guests to this meeting.  Would it not be better if the director general of RT&Eacute; was accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts?  Is there a problem in the relationship with the Department?  I accept that Ms O'Keeffe cannot speak for the performance of the Department's Accounting Officer but the view here is that it was quite weak and he was not in a position to answer very basic questions about how the &euro;170 million was spent.</p></speech>

We have a very good mutual relationship with the Department.  We share information extensively, particularly on financial matters.  As the director general outlined, there are significant financial challenges in RT&Eacute; at present and we meet regularly.  We report very extensively on what one might call the service level arrangements, which is our annual statement of performance commitments.  We submit that to the BAI and an independent reviewer, appointed by the BAI, comes to RT&Eacute; each year and reviews those obligations and reports on them.  In turn, we also report on the outcome of the annual statement of performance commitments in our annual accounts, which is published on our website and extensively across radio and television.</p></speech>

The briefing document that was provided refers to "over and above" the statutory requirements.  Perhaps we could be given a detailed note on what they are.  The document also says that in the interest of working to best practice standards, RT&Eacute; has also been the subject of external assessment sought on a voluntary basis.  What type of external assessment?  Perhaps a detailed note could be provided.  That would be helpful.</p> <p>  I wish to move to the employment issues and to put a question to Ms Forbes.  The 2016 annual report is very good and extensive and I congratulate RT&Eacute; on that.  The report was very helpful in preparing for this meeting.  It is stated on page 14 that, 31 December 2016, there were 1,984 employees, of whom 278 were part-time casual.  The full-time equivalent head count at 31 December 2016 was 1,834.  Does Ms Forbes see that?</p></speech>

Across the organisation, they span everything from broadcast-related activities to special events, sports programming and on-air presenters.  The nature of our business is wide and varied.  There are times when it does not make sense to have people in the organisation on a full-time basis.  Take the example of the Olympics.  Every four years, we may need the services of a swimming expert to come in and talk to us.  Likewise, the Eurovision is coming up in a few weeks and we will need some specialist services around that.  We bring people into the organisation on a contract basis for a special service.  That is reflective of the wide and varying business we conduct.</p></speech>

However, it has been suggested, even on one of RT&Eacute;'s programmes, that it is much wider than that and that many of RT&Eacute;'s employees are being coerced into accepting contracts for service.  It was described by one of the Ms Forbes's colleagues as rife within RT&Eacute;.  This is the notion of bogus self-employment.  Essentially, some employees are not being given a choice.  They are being told by management that it is a contract for service and they do not have any choice.  Does Ms Forbes accept that there is a problem in RT&Eacute; with bogus self-employment?  Is the latter rife within the organisation?</p></speech>

At the end of last summer, on foot of the Kieran Mulvey report, I committed to investigating the situation around contractors in the organisation because it was pointed out that there might be some concerns.  I committed to that review and it is currently under way.  Eimear Cusack, our head of human resources, is in the middle of that review.

Before I do that, I should point out that the 472 people Ms Forbes refers to as contractors do not see themselves as such and do not want to be contractors.  In fact, they are being forced into being contractors and self-employed.  I have met a number of them and they have informed me that they lose rights in terms of sick pay, holiday pay, trade union recognition and a range of employment rights and benefits.  Many of them were not given any choice and felt they were coerced into accepting these contracts.  This was dealt with on the "Drivetime" programme.  Ms Forbes will recall a programme by Philip Boucher-Hayes.</p><p>To provide context, I will play a clip from a feature he did on the issue, during which he gave his view.</p></speech>

He spoke directly to people.  Many of them were fearful about coming forward.  That was his view.  He went on to say that people were fearful about talking to him, although some people did.  That was my experience when I dealt with people who came to me after I raised these issues.  They privately expressed concern to me that if they raised any issues, their contracts might not be renewed.  I ask Ms Forbes to respond to the view that has been communicated to me and to Mr. Boucher-Hayes.</p></speech>

I need to understand whether it is correct.  For that reason, I have committed to undertaking a thorough root-and-branch review of the situation of our contractors.  That is currently under way.

The perception is that these people are being forced into these contracts.  As a consequence of being forced into these contracts, they are essentially being asked - the word "coerced" was used during the programme in question - to surrender rights.  If any other organisation were doing this, it would be looked at by "Prime Time" or "RT&Eacute; Investigates" so that such organisations could quite rightly be called out.

I have spoken to people who say there is a problem as well.  As there are consequences in terms of PRSI contributions, which are different for the self-employed, there may well be a cost to the Exchequer.  That is a difficulty.  The question of how RT&Eacute; potentially treats some of its staff is also an issue.  We need to know whether this is now a pattern.  Is it going to get worse and worse?  Is it a policy of RT&Eacute; to have more people on contracts for service and fewer people on contracts of service?  That is an obvious concern.  I have a number of other questions.  Is Ms Forbes saying that RT&Eacute; will review this issue?</p></speech>

We are undertaking quite a detailed piece of work.  As I have said, this is important and serious.  We need to get to the nub of this problem.  Ms Cusack is in a better position to talk about what we are doing.  She might be able to provide some comfort in this regard.</p></speech>

A number of months into my employment, the trade union group raised some concerns with me about contractors.  At the time, we were beginning the investigation into gender and role equality, which resulted in the Mulvey report.  The trade union group and others were given a commitment that when the investigation was complete, their concerns would be addressed by means of a full review of all of those who were providing contracts for services into RT&Eacute;.  It was intended that there would be two parts to the review.  The first part involved a review of the situation to ascertain whether everyone providing services was properly categorised as a contractor or should be categorised as "other".  It was intended that in the event of improper categorisation, it would be dealt with upfront.</p></speech>

Is the review simply a fact-finding exercise?  Is it simply about finding out whether this is a problem?  I would urge that there should be full disclosure as part of RT&Eacute;'s genuine, open and transparent consultation with its employees.  People should not have any fear about expressing their views.  That should underpin part of the review.  People who have experience of these contracts should be able to give their full views without any fear of reprisal.  Maybe that would be a better way of approaching the issue.</p></speech>

That is one of the issues.  The terms of reference for the review were shared with the trade union group.  As I have said, there are two parts to the review.  The Deputy has mentioned the fact-finding element of the review, which is the first part.  If we find that there are things to be rectified, we will consider how to rectify them.  The second part of the review, which relates to the point made by the Deputy, involves ensuring we engage with contracts for service in the right way.  We will always have contractors.  We need to engage with them in a manner that is future-proof.</p></speech>

Most of the ten most highly paid people in RT&Eacute; are on contracts and are paid through companies.  I have raised this previously with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  When these companies are established, the person is not paid directly.  The company is paid.  After the person involved, who might be a well-paid presenter on a six-figure salary, has paid PAYE, PRSI and the universal social charge on the income he or she derives from this activity, the rest of the income is profit and is taxed at the corporation tax rate of 12.5%.  How many people in the organisation are paid through companies?</p></speech>

We are talking about sports analysts, for example, or those who are brought in for events like the Eurovision song contest.  They do not fall into the category the Deputy is talking about.  Contracts of a longer duration can apply to on-air presenters, producers, directors and researchers, etc.  Of the 472 people we contracted in the year in question, 391 of them were sole traders and 81 of them were incorporated limited companies.</p></speech>

Based on what I can see here, it is mostly very well-paid people who avail of this service.  That is the contrast, if I may make one final point.  Those employees are very well paid and can establish companies.  I will not suggest why it is attractive to set up those companies; people can make up their own minds and then there are others who claim they are on bogus self-employment contracts.</p> <p>  Ms Forbes mentioned the employment practices in RT&Eacute; earlier.  Gender was one of the issues, as Ms Forbes knows herself, that is being addressed, which I welcome.  RT&Eacute; has a long way to go on that issue.  There also seems to be an issue here with bogus self-employment.  I have a difficulty with people on six-figure salaries not paying full taxes if that is the case.  There is a lot of work to be done in those areas.  RT&Eacute; gets very substantial taxpayers' money and, as Mr. Boucher-Hayes says, it has a special responsibility to make sure that the employment practices are what they should be.</p></speech>

I do have the figures.  For 2017, as I mentioned, of the 472 contracts for services, 81 of those were through limited companies.  Some of them are the names the Deputy mentioned and some are less well-known names.  The total payment to those 81 companies for 2017 was &euro;5.4 million and some change.

There are two parts, one in respect of remedying the current state of affairs, and the other setting up the protocols and processes to ensure that it is rectified going forward.</p></speech>

RT&Eacute; insists that they register as self-employed.  Did I hear that correctly?  They are not on a temporary contract.  They are registered as self-employed on RT&Eacute;'s insistence.

It can be anything from a musician, actor, scriptwriter, researcher, a contributor to a programme - there is a threshold for contributors to programmes and if they exceed it they must have a contract of employment.

I thank the witnesses for their detailed document, on page 5 of which there is a table which sets out total income and operating costs.  The difference is very notable.  Commercial revenue has dropped by 36% and licence fee revenue has dropped by 12% such that total income is reduced by 23%.  The licence fee revenue was easy to determine.  In terms of the commercial revenue, is the market a smaller market?  I note that there are online platforms and more targeted advertising which were not available in 2008 to the extent that they are now.  What evaluation has been done on this particular component?  I am presuming that the absence of being able to invest in output such as drama probably inhibits the ability of RT&Eacute; to earn by virtue of the fact that it can sell content to other platforms.  Perhaps the witness would provide an overview in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-03a.1338" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dee Forbes" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018050300002#PP00500"><p>The advertisement market is reflected in the moneys we have got from commercial income.  This market has reduced significantly in Ireland and around the world since the big recession.  In this respect, television has been particularly and seriously affected.  Why is this?  It is to do with the amount of choice now available to advertisers in the marketplace.  As advertising revenues on television have reduced they have increased in the digital arena.  For example, there are now a lot more places to advertise, whether on Facebook or on other websites.  This is to where a lot of the money has shifted.  It is not a traditional place for RT&Eacute; to be in.  We are there but we do not have the level of volume that Facebook in particular would have in this area. It is a fact of life in Ireland now that of every euro spent in digital advertising 80 cent goes to the big players.  </p> <p>  The market has evolved and it is a challenging place to be in.  In terms of our response to this, we have to ensure that we have a very compelling place for Irish advertisers to advertise and we do this by having really strong Irish content.  There is demand for it.  We hear every day from agencies that they want to have their advertisers surrounded by strong indigenous content.  When we do not have as much of that as we would like there is a problem.  Coupled with this, we do not have extensive dramas for sale on the external market.  It is the golden age of television.  Most countries in the world are investing heavily, particularly in drama.  Denmark and Israel are seeing big returns in this regard.  To benefit from this, one has to have a lot of volume and, obviously, quality.  We are not able to go there.  That said, we are doing everything we can.  We have to look at new revenue streams.  For example, sponsorship is a growing area, as is product placement in programming but it is not yet making up for what has been being lost.  The market is a very different place.  Everybody is being challenged in this area.  As I said, our best response is to have the best environment for the advertisers, which allows us to compete.  That is our challenge.</p></speech>

They are non-indigenous television channels that advertise in Ireland.  There are more than 40 of them at this point and they earn &euro;250 million from the advertising revenue.  Indigenous channels such as RT&Eacute; and TV3 reinvest in the marketplace but these opt-out channels do not.</p></speech>

The creative sector is a very exposed and precarious area.  Is Ms Forbes conscious of this when contracting in staff or is there a public service obligation from the point of view of protecting the indigenous resource that is RT&Eacute;, which is very much a people resource?</p></speech>

RT&Eacute; and I take this very seriously because that is the next generation that will come through.  What is incredibly said in all of this, given where we are as an organisation from a funding point of view, is that we typically work with the independent creative sector such that we make some programming in-house and we also contract out as part of our obligations.  A number of years ago we were spending &euro;80 million in the independent sector on programming coming to RT&Eacute; from outside.  This has halved over the years, again because of the reduction in funding.  I am concerned about the sector, as is the sector generally, because without RT&Eacute; being strong in this area the sector is under-developing.  As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the sector is desperate for a solution on the licence fee because the licence fee is one of big mechanism in this country to develop creative output but it is not being collected to the fullest extent.  This is a problem.  A few of us were in London last week at an event where the Irish ambassador was celebrating the great collaboration that goes on between the UK and the Irish creative sectors.  There was a lot of Irish talent there, including actors and comedians, because they do not have jobs at home.</p><p>They are there because we in particular are not able to invest like we should do in that sector.  That is a worry and is one of the biggest arguments that we as a society need to think about as we look to developing for the future.  Without that creative culture, we are seriously missing out.  </p></speech>

I think it is important to note that in our last strategy document, which we have submitted to the Department and to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, we outlined that we have worked very closely with all these external bodies.  I refer to the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, IBI, in the radio sector, Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, in television production, the Irish Film Board and the Screen Directors Guild of Ireland.  We have worked in partnership with these people to develop a strategy to enhance the creative sector in Ireland, create jobs and maybe bring it back to the level it was at.  My own view is that the sector that has been hardest hit in this downturn has been the independent sector, particularly in the television sector.  Halving the available revenue has hit a lot of families and a lot of people's jobs.  People have had to move abroad to find jobs in other sectors.  It has been very difficult for those people with whom we work on a regular basis.</p></speech>

Obviously we have got a list of RT&Eacute;'s top ten earners.  If RT&Eacute; did not publish that, we would all be complaining that it did not publish it.  Let me acknowledge that first.  However, it does give the impression that RT&Eacute; has shed-loads of money.  Whether the witnesses like that or not, that is the impression that it gives.  It is then very difficult to argue that RT&Eacute; is short of money.  I do not know how the witnesses square that circle but I would be interested in a comment from them on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-03a.1356" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dee Forbes" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018050300002#QQ00400"><p>First, I appreciate why the Deputy would think that and why people think it generally.  Let us put some context around it.  First, the cost of that talent to us as an organisation is 1% of our total cost base.  Some 99% of our costs go to other things.  That is the percentage that expenditure takes up.</p> <p>  The other thing that we really have to remember as we think about this is that we get half of our funding from the licence fee and half from commercial revenues.  It is incumbent on these presenters and broadcasters, who are the best in the country, to ensure that RT&Eacute; gets strong audiences, both from a relevance point of view and to be attractive to advertisers.  We should remember that there is an onus on those people not just to provide a public service but also to make us attractive from a commercial point of view.  One of our objectives as stated in the Broadcasting Act 2009 is to optimise our content from a commercial point of view.</p> <p>  The other thing to bear in mind is that there is a competitive marketplace for broadcasters.  It is not unnoticed, in this country and in others, that these broadcasters can command big audiences and are in demand.  There is a market for that.  Outside RT&Eacute;, some other broadcasters are being paid even more than some of ours but that is another discussion.  It is also important to bear in mind that my predecessor, Noel Curran, looked at the situation a couple of years ago and corrected the level of salaries.  They were significantly higher than they are today and were reduced by between 30% and 40%.  We have committed as an organisation to maintain that and I am committed to that.  When contracts come up for review, they will be assessed on the basis of the market at the time, as well as on a number of other factors.  I recognise that it looks like a lot of money but a lot is expected of these people.</p></speech>

One only has to read this morning's newspapers, which mentioned the company returns of somebody who has left our company.  They have gone up significantly in the last couple of years, so obviously there is a market out there.  Our assessment is that of the top ten broadcasters in the country, five work in RT&Eacute; and five are in the independent sector.  That is our honest assessment of it.</p> <p>  I will also add a further point.  The director general has noted that our top talent is really important to us but our top talent cannot produce programmes without the production team.  I am always cognisant of the fact that it is not just the top talent; it is the production teams, that is, those who work with them on a daily basis.  It would be remiss of me if I did not say that. </p></speech>

That might explain Ms Forbes' opening statement, because it certainly does not look at value for money.  I appreciate the opening statement, and I actually share her concerns about the challenges facing RT&Eacute;, which I will come back to.  However, it really does not address what we are here about.  Certainly in a personal capacity, let me say that I want to support RT&Eacute;.  Public broadcasting is absolutely an essential tool of any democracy, so let me preface all my comments with that.</p> <p>  However, there is also a duty on the public broadcaster to show that they are providing value for money.  That is certainly not jumping out of Ms Forbes' opening statement.  Maybe she was more concerned about telling the committee RT&Eacute;'s difficulties but it would be easier to address those difficulties if we saw the value for money.  Before I ask a few questions, on a personal level, I certainly do not think the top presenters, the vast majority of whom are men, deserve that money.  I have just done a quick count of the women listed.  I think it is something that RT&Eacute; should look at.  I think the broadcaster has a very important role in providing a different voice and a different ear.  As it is statutorily obliged to do that under the 2009 Act, there is huge scope to be different, instead of falling into the traditional market idea that we have to pay the top price, particularly for men.  I do not think it is justified, that is just a comment.  </p> <p>  I had a question about the review but I think the witnesses have partly answered it.  Is the review due to be completed at the end of this month?</p></speech>

Our systems are very old.  That our overall finance and resource planning systems date from 2003 is one of the reasons for this issue, as is the lack of capital investment.

I have expressed that view at the executive board.  I have been in my current role for six months and have told the director general that I want the production of Irish language programmes within cl&aacute;racha Gaeilge restored to its level before the cuts were imposed because that is important for us.  I worked in rann&oacute;g na gcl&aacute;r Gaeilge many years ago and have strong feelings on the issue.  There are many gaps in our Irish language output.  The Irish language output on RT&Eacute; Radio 1 is not stellar.  We recently piloted a programme with Daith&iacute; &Oacute; S&eacute; and Maura Derrane and I hope to get it on the air.  Leaving aside "Nuacht" and Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta, we are doing things which are very important and quite costly parts of our remit------</p></speech>

The 1916 project was a good example.  RT&Eacute; found itself financially challenged.  There were a lot of big projects that we wanted to broadcast for 1916 and we could not have done it without the support of certain Departments, such as the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Extra funding was delivered-----</p></speech>

That was the recommendation from the Boaden report, which was published recently.  The report also outlined that, because of the challenges we have, it is not feasible for RT&Eacute; to continue to fund both orchestras in the current format.  RT&Eacute; must engage with the Government on how this will go forward because the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment have said that they recognise the need for two orchestras and they are willing to engage in conversation.

I have just a few more questions on the finance side.  Ireland has one national broadcaster and we just take it as it is.  The best judge of how that broadcaster performs is probably through comparison with television stations in other countries.  I will ask some simple questions.  What is the average cost of content for one hour?  What is the average cost per hour of bought-in programming and home-produced programming, be they produced internally or through local production companies?  How do RT&Eacute;'s figures compare?  To me this is an obvious question.  How much does it cost a station to put out one hour of television?  Maybe my description of different ways of getting on air is not the same as the descriptions used by the witnesses, but they get my point.</p></speech>

One hour of drama compared with one hour of documentary, for example, is very different in cost.  I will happily come back to the Chairman with detail on this, but in broad terms and with regard to value-----</p></speech>

Obviously we all know there is a big differential, but I am taken aback at the level of differential.  RT&Eacute; needs to get this type of information out.   RT&Eacute; can state it can run away on this cheaply bought in stuff but that if people want Irish content, this is what is required.  There is no harm in starting to put some of this out there as part of the public debate and information.  I hope today might help, or be the start of it.</p></speech>

A big organisation such as RT&Eacute; has gone to the trouble of signing off its audited accounts at the end of April.  The Minister should do whatever the Minister has to do to get them out there in the public arena as soon as possible.  Coming out three months later makes it look as if it took the organisation six or seven months to publish its accounts.  There is no good reason for this.  I am sure it only takes a few minutes.  If it has these quarterly reports, there should be nothing in the financial statements of surprise to the Department.  It should be a very quick process to give a memo to the Minister to get them cleared.  I ask the witnesses to speed up this process.  This is something we are asking across the board with regard to shortening the release of annual financial statements.  RT&Eacute; is there or thereabouts.</p> <p>  We have asked about the top presenters, but there is a section on the remuneration of the director general.  Will the witnesses explain and refresh my memory on this?  It is on page 112 and it mentions Ms Dee Forbes and Mr. Noel Curran.  I take it they are operating within public sector guidelines.</p></speech>

It is normal to have the chief executive or board of directors.  It also lists the directors' remuneration.  In that year, Moya Doherty as chairperson received &euro;31,000 and the ordinary members received &euro;16,000.  The witness can come back to us on this.  They can send a paragraph to confirm it to us.  I am not being personal, but it is regular that board remuneration crosses our desk.</p> <p>  I have a question or two more to ask.  Will the witnesses talk to me about the sale of RT&Eacute;'s lands in Donnybrook and the impact it will have?  It is something in the order of &euro;100 million - I forget the figure.  What will it do for RT&Eacute;'s balance sheet?  It has loans of approximately &euro;50 million.  Will the witnesses tell us what happened?  How helpful will it be to RT&Eacute;'s financial situation?</p></speech>

A number of years ago the board decided that we should look at the sale of some land.  It was agreed that we could sell up to ten acres of unused land within Montrose.  Of course we had to go through the various Department consents.  That involved a combination of our Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We did all of that and we had consent to sell the land in March 2017, although it seems like it was longer ago.  As you said, Chairman, we received &euro;107.5 million for that land.  In the course of seeking the approval and consent we were required to have clear guidelines with regard to what the money would be spent on.</p> <p>  The guidelines fall into three categories.  One is around capital investment.  As we mentioned earlier, we have not been spending money on capital over the years because of the cuts.  Capital investment is much-needed in RT&Eacute; throughout the country.  The second area relates to paying down some debt.  We have some debt.  Again, we had to pay some of that down.  The third area was to allow us to restructure the organisation.  Again, we are cognisant of our costs in the organisation.  We launched a voluntary exit plan that was enabled by the land sale; it was an attempt to reduce our cost base.  These were the three areas of expenditure for which we could use the land money.  It is clear.  We have a clear process internally about how we do this.  The money is ring-fenced.  It is only for those purposes and nothing else.  It will not be used for operational purposes because there are state aid rules etc. involved in all of that.</p></speech>

We are investing at half our depreciation levels at the moment.  We anticipate that the majority of our funds &ndash; between &euro;30 million and &euro;40 million of the funds &ndash; will go on capital reinvestment.  Some of that has already happened.  It will take some years to roll out the projects but we are in dire need of capital investment.</p></speech>

I am looking at page 141 of the RT&Eacute; financial statements.  How much interest has RT&Eacute; been paying up to now?  What are the interest rates?  If RT&Eacute; had borrowings of &euro;50 million, the company must have been paying &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million.  What is the ballpark figure?  It is a complicated structure in the financial statements.  Can you simplify it for viewers, Ms O'Keeffe?  Is RT&Eacute; paying much in annual interest?  Can you give a figure to the nearest million?  I am not looking for an exact figure.</p></speech>

It refers to lender security for the project loan facility.  The note refers to how the facility for 2RN has been arranged with Barclays Bank Ireland plc amounting to &euro;53 million in aggregate.  The note relates to lender security.  I am surprised at the level of security that the bank appears to have over RT&Eacute; assets.  One of the conditions of the availability of the project loan facility was that 2RN executed a security deed agreement and provided lender security, including security of lands of 13 main digital terrestrial television transmission sites.  The bank has security on the land and all RT&Eacute; re-transmission sites throughout the country.</p></speech>

That includes anything 2RN constructs on those sites.  The bank has security over all 2RN rental income from occupational leases.  That is fine.  The bank has rights and benefits of 2RN insurance policies and an insurance proceeds account.</p><p>Will Ms O'Keeffe explain it to me?  If there is a claim in respect of any of the properties, is it the case that Barclays Bank will have first call on the proceeds?</p></speech>

It cost in excess of &euro;60 million.  The Barclays project finance enabled it.  Barclays Bank is an important business partner for us.  The loan is secured on the assets and the income, if we or 2RN do not pay.  However, 2RN is a profitable subsidiary in the overall RT&Eacute; group, meaning that there is not an issue in that regard.  It is not unusual to have project finance facilities secured on the assets with which they were built.</p></speech>

As the committee produces periodic reports, we will be reporting back on issues which arise from this hearing.</p> <p>  I am precious about the editorial independence of the national broadcaster which I fully respect and support.  Like other members, I have a huge interest in public service and public broadcasting.  Accordingly, editorial independence is important to me.  However, so too is impartiality, most certainly political impartiality.  How is it policed?  Is it policed internally or externally to ensure there is no political bias, or any other bias for that matter, on RT&Eacute; programmes?</p></speech>

If one takes the current referendum, we have a strict process for measuring the amount of broadcast time given to each side.  There is a group in place to do this.  We take the matter seriously.  I hope the Deputy will appreciate that we have to look at it in the round.  On one programme one may get one particular viewpoint and the same viewpoint in another.  We have to make sure that, in a given week, we are being impartial, unbiased, etc.  It is a big principle and for what we stand.  We take it very seriously.</p></speech>

RTE has just under 2,000 employees while it uses 500 people who are classified as self-employed or freelance, which is 25% of the overall staffing complement.

I ask the witnesses to put themselves in the shoes of those who are earning &euro;30,000 or less on one of these contracts but who are in the trade union.  Their contract might be due to expire or they might have a difficulty with an element of the contract but RTE will not engage with their trade union for the reasons outlined by Ms Cusack.  However, when it comes to those in the top ten or 20 earners who are contracted on the same terms and who are paid through companies, their agents engage with Ms Cusack.  Why will she engage with the agents of these contractors who are well paid but not with the trade union representatives of contractors who are at the lower end of the scale?</p></speech>

RTE has a two-tier system.  The well-paid contractors have leverage because of who they are and they can have an agent walk in and have a conversation with her about their contracts but she will not deal with the poor unfortunate contractor who is not as high profile as them and who does not have agent but who many have a trade union representative.</p></speech>

I accept that Ms Cusack and Ms Forbes are committed to reviewing these issues and I have no reason to doubt their sincerity but there is a problem.  Ms Cusack has not explained why one of these contractors on &euro;400,000 who employs an agent can have access to her with the agent negotiating on behalf of him or her, yet other contractors do not have such access.  I spoke to one of the more high profile people before the meeting.  Mr. Jennings outlined why these presenters are so valuable and why are paid so much.  There is competition and so on.  He rightly mentioned that their producers and researchers are equally important.  I have spoken to some of them who work on these high profile programmes.

One of those very senior people I mentioned - one of those people the witness was quick to praise who is a producer on one of the top programmes and who is on one of these contracts - said to me when I spoke to them yesterday that if we do not address this issue, the RT&Eacute; canteen will continue to look like a sample of people from Dublin 4 and will be not reflective of society.  The reason is that if a person is offered one of these contracts on less than &euro;30,000 a year, or something in that territory, one has to pay rent costs or mortgage costs, live in Dublin, etc.  There is a particular type of person who is attracted to those jobs and it might be somebody who comes from a very wealthy background and whose parents can subsidise him or her as opposed to people from other backgrounds.  The person I spoke to would be very respected within the organisation and a very public person.  There seems to be an issue and that is why I raised the issue of class, which is important to me, and that the public broadcaster is not seen as reflective of one class of society, but of society in general.  I welcome the fact that this is being reviewed, but I ask Ms Forbes, who certainly seems to be pioneering - I really commend her on the gender pay issue and some of the other work that is being done - that she look at this if possible.</p> <p>  I completely agree with the Cathaoirleach on Irish productions and the value of these and the spin-off from them.  I would encourage more of that because it is of real benefit in terms of keeping talent here, notwithstanding the cheaper costs of getting in some of the American franchise programmes, which can attractive to do and which may be easier, and that it is more expensive and more difficult to hone domestic talent.  I commend the director-general on that because it is very good.</p></speech>

Indeed, there is a very big difference even if somebody is earning as much.  That status can determine, for example, the ability to get a mortgage and so on.  People's life choices can be determined by virtue of the type of employment they are in.</p> <p>  Leaving the review out of it for a moment, if someone was working constantly and looked for a change in his or her status, that is, to become an employee, would that be available to him or her?  Is there an option like that for people who are essentially employees but who are self-employed?</p></speech>

There was one employee of RT&Eacute; and Mr. Seamus Dooley from the NUJ.  They are probably in more secure positions.  Would the security of a position make a difference, for example, to a contractor presenting that kind of a story as opposed to someone who is a direct employee and who would be more secure in his or her employment?

In terms of the influence of the legals in regard to programmes broadcast, obviously legal people are very cautious.  Judgment calls have to be made all the time.  How are the conflicts resolved when they come up because it may well be that RT&Eacute; may be broadcasting something more hard-hitting that people might be happy to engage with in terms of programming?  Does that inhibit such programming?  Are the defamation laws something that the organisation would be concerned about in regard to the risks that the witness talked about in current affairs broadcasting?</p></speech>

We call it a compliance group.  If there is a programme that is deemed risky or deemed controversial, we will take it to this group, which is made up of internal people, who are very experienced journalists.  Those people will work with the producer on that programme to discuss, debate, etc. and to bring the programme to place where it will be okay to air.</p> <p>  The defamation laws are restrictive, of course, but we also have to be mindful of what is said.  However, I do not think it inhibits us in doing our job.  The journalists and producers are very well-versed in this.  I cannot think of one instance of this since I have been there.  Typically, we have an elevation and if there is a concern, I am the last port of call.</p></speech>

As the committee is aware, there was a thorough review of the editorial process within RT&Eacute;.  There were new editorial guidelines put in place.  There was an editorial standards board, as the director-general said, put in place to deal with these issues.</p> <p>  We value and invest a lot of money and resources into investigative journalism.  We are one of the few companies on this island that does this.  We value it highly.  If one looks at our output from the RT&Eacute; Investigations Unit over the last few years, many of these programmes and their outcome have been debated in the Houses.  It is really important in terms of public service broadcasting.  It is something that we support wholeheartedly.  There are some challenging decisions.  One has robust debates, editorially, with lawyers and with the teams.  As the director-general said, there is a structure in place and if editorial issues need to be escalated, they will be.  Legal advice is legal advice and, ultimately, an editorial decision will be taken on these programmes.</p></speech>

In fact, there was an excellent programme broadcast last Thursday night on child and youth mental health.  I would hope that this programme might be repeated because it has been trapped in yet another crisis, and it did not get the kind of attention that it certainly deserved afterwards.</p> <p>  I want to finish by returning to the licence fee and the evasion rates.  Are we comparing like with like in terms of other countries?</p><p>Is it very similar?  I am only familiar with the Irish licence fee arrangement.</p></speech>

We met the British Broadcasting Corporation, BBC.  It is comparable.  The Royal Mail used to collect the fee in the United Kingdom a number of years ago, but there was a move from the Royal Mail to collection by an independent third party and the evasion rates reduced dramatically.  Before the agent was changed, the evasion rate was in the mid-teens.  The Department's calculation was that there was a 15% evasion rate in Ireland; it is around 6.5% in the United Kingdom.  It is mentioned in the briefing document that the rate is lower than that in some of the Nordic countries.</p></speech>

The meeting has been informative which is important and one of the reasons we are here.  </p> <p>  Our next meeting is next Thursday at 10 a.m.  We have changed our schedule for the public session.  The purpose of the meeting will be to discuss the CervicalCheck scandal and the screening programme run by the HSE at a cost of &euro;60 million.  It also includes BreastCheck and BowelScreen.  We have been in touch with the HSE to discuss its policy on open disclosure and legal costs and the State Claims Agencies to discuss its policy on open disclosure and the management of claims.  We have to confirm who precisely will be here next Thursday.  We will work on that matter tomorrow, but both organisations will be represented.  We will try to reschedule the meeting that was planned with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have a commitment that both organisations will be represented next Thursday.</p></speech>

Assisting constituents by making representations and requests on their behalf is a valuable as well as a time-honoured aspect of our democratic system.  Amendment No. 50 introduces a new section that will facilitate specified persons in using personal data in the course of their electoral activities in the State for the purpose of communicating with data subjects.  Under subsection (2), such communication is considered to be the performance of a task being carried out in the public interest.</p><p>Amendment No. 51 introduces a new section that will provide a robust legal basis for the making of representations on behalf of individuals.  Where special categories of personal data are involved, subsection (3) will require that measures to limit access to the data be taken in order to prevent unauthorised consultation, alteration, disclosure or even erasure of data.  Subsection (4) establishes a legal basis for responding to representations and requests received by public authorities and public bodies from elected representatives on behalf of data subjects.</p><p>The amendments cover the subject matter of amendment No. 65 tabled by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan.  An issue that remains under consideration in my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is the extent to which the Electoral Acts may need to be looked at and tweaked.  If necessary, I will table an appropriate amendment on Report Stage in that regard.  I am in consultation with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p></speech>

I welcome that the Minister has put down these amendments.  It is appropriate that there is recognition of the important role that democracy plays and how it operates in this country.  We are sometimes too self-deprecating as politicians.  We are not simply politicians but elected representatives of the people and the people are entitled to have their democracy protected.  I will support amendments Nos. 50 and 51.  I will withdraw amendment No. 65 in light of amendments Nos. 50 and 51 but I may bring forward Report Stage amendments relating to amendments Nos. 50 and 51 with the purpose of strengthening them since there are other aspects of democratic and electoral activity which need to be covered and are not covered in the Minister's amendment.</p></speech>

Under the GDPR, the legitimate interest of communicating with constituents is covered but we are trying to say that any communication by a politician is in the public interest, which is a stretch, given some of the bile that is foisted on householders by politicians claiming that it is in the public interest.  It is not necessary.  The British authorities had something like amendment No. 50.  I will not make a big deal about it here.  My point is that political work is covered by "legitimate interest" and we do not need this extra clause.  It is a stretch to say that some of the stuff that is sent out by politicians or would-be politicians is in the public interest because it is only in the interests of them getting re-elected.</p></speech>

I make the point, which the amendment covers, regarding the need to ensure that public representatives continue to do what is an important part of our duty.  It is fair to say that it is within the public interest to make representations but I wonder about the respondent - the person or body to which the representation is made - and whether that might be regarded in the same way as we would.  The amendment is important.  I acknowledge what Deputy O'Callaghan said.  If there are further issues which are not immediately apparent now that might be covered in amendment No. 65, then it is open to us all to come back on Report Stage.  I acknowledge the importance of these amendments and welcome, if not the support, then the lack of opposition.</p></speech>

I still think we have reason to be concerned about what the section might permit.  Article 23 of the GDPR is the relevant part.  It does not make an explicit distinction between the processing of personal and special categories of data but, throughout the GDPR, we are told that special categories of data should be treated with special care, hence we are attempting to separate it in amendment No. 56 and in the related amendments, for example, amendment No. 52, separating the two categories of data, personal data and &quot;special categories of personal data&quot;.</p><p>I accept that Article 23 of the GDPR refers to the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, which is inserted in the Bill in section 38(<i>b</i>).  The problem these amendments try to address relates to the scope the word &quot;preventing&quot; introduces with regard to criminal offences, particularly relating to special categories of personal data, such as religious beliefs, political opinion, ethnicity and so on.  Section 38 of the Bill is not part of Part 5 of the Bill, which relates to processing of personal data for law enforcement purposes.  The processing of data referred to in section 38 does not apply to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for example.  The kind of processing proposed in section 38 might well be done by private companies.  Section 38 essentially permits racial profiling if we include the processing of special categories of data.  A body other than the Garda, for example, can profile a person based on ethnicity, religion and political opinions in the name of preventing, in the broadest sense, a criminal offence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-03a.1789" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018050300002#B01100"><p>The last amendment is listed as being in section 39.  It is actually section 38, as the line numbers would indicate.  Under the GDPR in general, processing of personal data for purposes other than that for which it was initially collected should be allowed only where the processing is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were collected in the first place.  In other words, if one gives Twitter one's phone number to verify when one is connecting from a different device, it cannot start ringing that person about other stuff.  That is straightforward but there is some wriggle room according to Recital 50, on processing for purposes which are incompatible with the basis on which the data were initially collected.  That can be allowed in two circumstances.  First, where somebody gives consent for that to happen and, second, when the "processing is based on Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard, in particular, important objectives of general public interest".</p> <p>  Section 38 tries to give effect to this wriggle room but it goes a little too far because it allows for the processing of both sensitive categories of data, including the serious stuff about political opinions, sexual orientation and so on, and the general personal data, for reasons other than the purposes for which it was collected, in order to prevent a threat to national security, to prevent, investigate or prosecute crimes and for getting legal advice and legal proceedings.</p> <p>  In amendments Nos. 52, 53 and 55, we are proposing that further processing of personal data would be lawful for all of those reasons with the tweak that, rather than it being for preventing crime, we would use the tighter wording of "avoiding prejudicing the prevention" of crime.  There is a further small tweak in amendment No. 53, that further processing would be allowed only if "having regard to the fundamental rights and legitimate interests of the data subject".  It is necessary and proportionate for various crime and terror-fighting purposes.</p><p>The wording for our first amendment is taken from the British wording and our second amendment is a balancing requirement.</p><p> In amendment No. 56 we propose that further processing of very sensitive data would be permitted for all of the aforementioned except the prevention for crime.  Our reason is that the GDPR does not apply to competent authorities like the Garda.  What section 38 asks us to prove is a right for public bodies or companies to collect or compile databases on things like people's political opinions, trade union membership, religious beliefs and so on for the purposes of preventing crime, which is a bit broad.</p><p> For example, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, has loads of documentation and data about people.  Let us say the Garda says there is crime afoot, they think it is linked to an area where there is a higher concentration of immigrants, for example, and want to hoover up all of the data, closed circuit television, CCTV, surveillance and so on that is linked to an immigrant community in a particular area.  That is racial profiling.  It is very hard to see how information held by private companies or public bodies would be so important to prevent a crime yet outweigh the balance of people's individual rights and so on.  That is where my colleague and I are coming from.</p><p> On balance, other information about political opinions could be important.  Let us say there was an urgent situation to prevent a threat to public security and a bunch of neo-Nazis threatened to set off a bomb in Dublin and the Garda needed to get information from a social media site, such a situation would not be hampered by our amendments.  I wish to stress that our amendments do not prevent the reuse of personal data in general, just special category data.  Names, phone numbers, addresses, emails and all of that can still be reused for a crime prevention aim.  We do not seek to stop that but we want to prevent the more personal and sensitive information being abused.</p><p> We think the terminology &ldquo;avoiding prejudicing the prevention, investigation or prosecution of&rdquo; is stronger.  Again, our amendment is based on the British wording.  Anybody can say something is for the prevention of crime.  A controversial CCTV scheme is being introduced on that basis even though there is no evidence that extra crime has taken place in that area.  If there is an immediate incident of a likelihood of crime, then that is a different situation.  I have outlined our motivation for tabling our amendments.</p></speech>

I note the point made by the Chairman regarding amendments Nos. 54 and 55.  In any event, I am unable to accept amendments Nos. 52, 53, 55 and 56 and I shall give my reasons.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 53, in section 38, has a provision for the processing of personal data for certain public interest purposes for which the data were originally collected but only to the extent that such processing is necessary for and proportionate to the purpose, and that acts very much as a restrictor.  The position is as follows.  Statutory provisions that permit, or require, further notification or disclosure of personal data are to be found right across the Acts of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  Let me give a brief example.  Section 42 of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 refers to a range of designated persons such as financial institutions, auditors and property service providers who know, may suspect or may have reasonable grounds to suspect, on the basis of information that they have that another person has been or is engaged in an offence of money laundering or terrorist financing.  Of course there is an obligation that such knowledge or suspicion on those grounds be reported not only to the Garda but also to Revenue.</p> <p>  Under sections 2 and 3 of the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, it is an offence to withhold any information on offences referred to in that Act.  The Children First Act 2015 requires a range of mandated persons, including health practitioners, teachers and youth workers, who know, believe or suspect that a child has been harmed, is being harmed or, indeed, is at risk of being harmed, to report that to Tusla.</p> <p>  I am sure that committee members would agree that the public interest in such cases should not in any way be jeopardised or compromised.  This section provides an effective and appropriate safeguard in the words "necessary and proportionate".  I cannot accept the proposals in amendments Nos. 52 and 56 to remove the reference to special categories of personal data in section 38 and add a new section.  Neither can I accept insertion of the words &ldquo;having regard to the fundamental rights and legitimate interests of the data subject&rdquo; as an addition in amendment No. 54, because this would place an additional burden on, for example, a youth worker reporting suspected harm to a child or perhaps even a bank official reporting his or her suspicion that certain transactions may from time to time be linked to money laundering or illegal activity.</p> <p>  I see where Deputy Daly is coming from but I think there are adequate safeguards.  If I were to accept her amendments, I would be jeopardising long-standing obligations on persons.</p></speech>

The committee had a lengthy discussion recently on the importance of independent journalism, journalists' sources and their importance for the functioning of a democratic society.  There are many discussions in the public domain about recent data breaches in significant media outlets in this State that have caused a lot of concern about potential interference with journalists and what they do.  That is wrong.  It is a matter of concern for free media and democracy in this country, so it is vitally important that journalists and their sources are protected.  They are integral to a functioning democracy that holds Government, Opposition and public institutions to account.</p><p>I do not believe the Bill adequately provides for this.  That is a view shared by others.  I will be pressing the amendment.</p></speech>

The text of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's new section seems to be inspired by the recommendation of this committee arising from the pre-legislative scrutiny of the communications (retention of data) Bill 2017.</p> <p>  The joint committee's report was issued recently but the Government, and more importantly the Attorney General, have not yet had the opportunity to examine the recommendations in the detail this deserves.  I have doubts as to whether this is the correct location for a far-reaching statutory provision of this kind.  I ask Deputies to appreciate that the potentially far-reaching nature of this amendment, and the provision of proposed subsection (3) whereby the High Court could permit identification of confidential sources of information where a journalist is the subject of investigation for suspected commission of a serious criminal offence, raise several important issues, not least what is meant by a serious offence.  Does it cover dangerous driving or domestic violence?  There is no definition of any kind and the result is that journalistic privilege may in effect be put at risk rather than be safeguarded.</p> <p>  Balancing the rights of journalists to protect their sources with other sources is rightly a matter for the courts.  For example, the European Court of Human Rights has underlined that protection of confidential sources is an essential means of enabling the press to perform its important function as a public watchdog.  That should not be interfered with except in the most exceptional of circumstances where some vital public or individual interests may be at stake.  I do not disagree with the points raised by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire but I am very concerned about the imported consequences of the amendment in the form of the text as it is.  This is an issue that deserves the fullest of consideration.  I do not believe we should decide it in the context of this Bill.  Therefore I will not accept the amendment now.</p></speech>

The amendment raises very important issues that go beyond the data protection measures, the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and this legislation.  The Minister's point about what is a serious offence involves a balancing of rights which are adjudicated by the courts, and as Deputy Wallace just said to me, if at some stage we did have a crusading independent media and journalist corps, it would be nice to have their interests protected, but we are a long way from that given the conduct of many journalists in front of the Charleton tribunal.

These include the right to access environmental information under the European Communities (Access to Information on the Environment) Regulations 2007 to 2014 and the European Communities (Re-Use of Public Sector Information) Regulations 2005 to 2015.  There is no good reason to refer in the Data Protection Bill 2018 only to freedom of information without also including the other major regimes accessed under those regulations.  This amendment can correct that and would be a useful addition to the Bill.</p></speech>

He has given a good account of why it has been put forward.  Section 41 deals with circumstances when a request under the Freedom of Information Act 2014 means that personal data contained in a record may be disclosed if it comes pursuant to a freedom of information request.  The objective of the amendments is to broaden the applicable statutory provisions so that they include not just the Freedom of Information Act 2014 but also the European Communities regulations on re-use of public sector information and on access to information on the environment.</p></speech>

Section 2 contains a comprehensive definition of the term.  Access rights under the Act include access to records.  Section 11 provides that every person has a right to and shall, on request, be offered access to any record held by any freedom of information body.  Section 12 also references a record.  Therefore, reference to a record appears to be right and proper.</p> <p>  On amendments Nos. 58 and 60 to 62, inclusive, I accept, subject to the advice of the Attorney General, the principle of extending the scope of the section to include the regulations of 2005 and 2007.  I have asked my officials to consult the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel with a view to ensuring the text is appropriate and does not in any way conflict with other sections.  In short, if Deputies withdraw their amendments, I will give a commitment to table an appropriate amendment on the subject on Report Stage with which I will certainly attempt to meet concerns.</p></speech>

I do not have it to hand, but I am not necessarily clear on what harm would be done if the words "contained in a record" were not included or there was a broader view on the information on a person that might be owned by a data processor or any organisation.

To be honest, I do not know why the amendments have been grouped like this, as they deal with two sections.  That probably has caused part of the confusion, about which I am sorry.  </p> <p>  Section 43 deals with providing for a general exemption from the prohibition on processing special categories of data imposed on either the controller or the subject by employment or social welfare law.  All we are trying to do is change the words "any right or obligation" to "specific rights or obligations", which would be much more in line with Article 9.  We have a little concern that it is being left too general and that it would allow special categories to be processed for reasons for which they do not need to be processed.  It is a slight change.</p></speech>

Deputy Mick Wallace has an amendment that is much the same on the matter.  I will oppose section 45.  All of its purposes are covered by Article 9 of the GDPR.  In the possible or likely event that the section is agreed to, I still believe it requires amendment.  There is a view, which I share, that section 45 creates a loophole in allowing companies from other jurisdictions to operate here.  It essentially creates a position where companies not dissimilar to Cambridge Analytica or other organisations which are mining and exploiting data in that way could operate and use data gathered here, provided they did not interfere in electoral activity in the State.  That is not covered, but it is the purpose of amendment No. 66.  I will oppose the section, but I will also press the amendment.</p></speech>

We might be deemed to be wiser to oppose it and adhere to the GDPR in full, rather than trying to shape the section.  My amendment is a fall-back position if the section is not completely opposed.  We would like to return to it on Report Stage.  Article 9 of the GDPR is very clear that the processing of political opinion is prohibited without the full and informed consent of the data subject, except in certain and very limited circumstances.  Section 45 of the Bill is a bizarre attempt to carve out an exception for the processing of political opinion that is simply not provided for in the GDPR.  We could write it into Irish law via section 45, but it would simply be superseded in any case by the GDPR.  The phrase "subject to suitable and specific measures" appears many times in the Bill and points us back to section 35, to which the Minister referred as a toolbox for processing and protecting the rights of the data subject.  Section 35 and the suitable and specific measures therein are extremely important and, in the case of the most important, lifted from various parts of the GDPR.  The section does not require explicit consent, which is optional.  Ministers do not have to use the toolkit in the section.  Section 45 is a bizarre attempt to carve exemptions to the GDPR, particularly in the light of the Cambridge Analytica story and the fundamental threat to democracy that such companies pose.</p> <p>  Removing section 45 would not affect the use of the electoral register or the work of the Referendum Commission.</p><p>Article 13 of the GDPR explains the necessary steps we should take in terms of electoral activities such as door to door canvassing to adhere to the GDPR.  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner recently published guidelines on how canvassers would have to adapt.  It will not affect polling companies or the use of focus groups or market research, only in the sense that consent will be required from the person being polled.  Obtaining this consent should not be especially difficult or onerous.  In any case, the GDPR absolutely requires the seeking of this consent, as per Article 9, in processing special categories of data such as political opinion.</p></speech>

Where any right or obligation is conferred or imposed by law, it is a specific right or obligation.  Apart from that, there is a grammatical problem because of the plural nouns "rights or obligations" being used with a singular verb.  This means that the wording would read "exercising or performing specific rights or obligations which is conferred or imposed".  For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 66 brings us back to the Seanad where I introduced amendments to ensure the processing of political opinions for electoral purposes would apply only in the course of elections within the State.  That was an issue.  Of course, the content is based on Recital (56) of the GDPR which makes it quite clear that, where in the course of electoral activities the operation of the democratic system in a member state requires political parties to compile personal data for people's political opinions, the processing of such data may be permitted for reasons to do with the public interest, provided that appropriate safeguards are established.  I am at a loss to determine the consequences of what Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire has in mind.  I do not recognise circumstances in which such personal data would be shared with a private company.  They would more likely be used during the course of an election campaign when parties were canvassing and seeking reactions to election manifestoes or questionnaires and the voting intentions of constituents.  I am not sure whether the amendment is needed and even if I were minded to accept it, I am not clear on the actors and entities involved.  I will not accept it today, but there might be scope for further debate on it.  With its current wording, I cannot accept it.</p></speech>

Article 9 of the GDPR , from which the section is derived, states the processing of special categories of data in the context of employment and social welfare law is allowed as long as the "processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the controller or of the data subject" in these areas.  That is where we took the word "specific" instead of "any".  We think it is more in line with Article 9.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 66 and the section, I am in favour of the deletion of the entire section.  It was the subject of a huge amount of debate in the Seanad.  Polls, focus groups and canvass tallies will all still be allowed if the section is deleted.  All that has to happen is for consent to be gained to note somebody's political view, only if someone is planning to use it with the person's name and address or IP address in the course of one or other of these activities.  It is not really a big ask.  Notably, there was a letter yesterday in the newspapers from Digital Rights Ireland, Data Compliance Europe, Dr. T. J. McIntyre of the Faculty of Law in UCD, FP Logue Solicitors, Rossa McMahon and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  The top people in this area are warning us.  They have taken successful legal actions against the State.  Because of their knowledge, they are warning us and arguing for the removal from the section of the blanket exemptions in the processing of personal data which reveals political opinions.  That is why we are pushing to oppose the section.  The State will pay heavily if we do not delete the section.  Parties and candidates will still be able to run an analysis of election results in granular form.  They will still be able to have super sophisticated analysis of polling data.  The only things involved are personal data that can identify people in the context of their political opinions and the State would be well served by deleting the section in its entirety.</p></speech>

I know that the Minister has said the same.  I have to say his suggestion that the use of the word "is" is a reason not to support the amendment is not a strong one.  I will not support the amendment because I do not believe it would add anything to the Bill.</p> <p>  On section 45, as elected representatives, we should be supporting the political process.  Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire should be allowed to move around Cork South Central and, if he comes to a house where the individuals tell him that they will vote for him, he should be able to record that information.  He should not have to ask them whether they would mind if he was to record their names such that they would be recorded as Sinn F&eacute;in supporters.  It is completely artificial.  We need to recognise the reality.  I will not support the deletion of section 45.</p> <p>  I will not support the amendment either.  It is part of a political process that parties and candidates are entitled to identify the political opinions people hold.  Some people want to express their political opinions, while others want to keep theirs private, but at times it is an objective fact as to what is a person's political opinion.  We do not need to be so nervous about it that it has to be protected.</p></speech>

Its intention is to prohibit the gathering of data in this jurisdiction for use elsewhere.  There is a belief, which I share, that it is not currently prohibited and that it is something we should seek to do.</p> <p>  The other point made by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan and the Minister is fine, but the issue is why are we drafting a provision when all of these practices and behaviours in canvassing and making representations are provided for under the GDPR.  This is a regulation, not a directive.  Most of it has direct effect.  There is a margin of appreciation of certain provisions, but as Article 9 of the GDPR has direct effect, I do not see any need for section 45 in that context.  People have spoken about lawyers' holidays.  The greatest example will be when the GDPR and the Act will be in conflict.  Section 45 is a prime example in that regard.</p></speech>

If a really nice individual who I like comes to my door and asks me for my vote and I tell him that I will give it to him and he happens to be from Fianna F&aacute;il, I might not want it to be made public or recorded that I was actually prepared to support Fianna F&aacute;il.  Someone might want to make a call and agree to support a fellow, but I can understand that person not necessarily wanting it to be made public or recorded.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that section 47 invokes suitable and specific measures which revert to some of the safeguards provided in section 35, but Recital 52 of the GDPR makes absolutely no references to occupational pensions, for example, as is the case in respect of section 47(c) or to the mortgaging of property, as provided for in section 47(d).  This section essentially provides for exemptions from the requirement for explicit consent under the GDPR for the processing of special or sensitive categories of data.  That is fine, as long as we adhere to the possible exemptions provided for in the GDPR.  However, we are surely overstepping the mark in this section and going beyond services provided under the health insurance system, as per Recital 52 of the GDPR.  Why could consent not be sought in the instances given in section 47(c) and (d)?  Surely obtaining consent in these instances would not be too onerous or difficult.  The proposed insertions in amendment No. 70, subsection (2)(a) and (b), even stipulate that processing might take place without the consent of the data subject if the data controller could not reasonably be expected to obtain consent for whatever reason.  In other words, obtaining consent should be a reasonable step.</p></speech>

The processing of health data is not necessary for the management of the health service.  It obviously has some function in that regard, but I do not think it should do so without having to ask for our permission.  For example, VHI is running a TV advertisement campaign asking members to sign up to be DNA tested by it in order that it can help an individual to find out what future ailments to which he or she might be genetically disposed, but that is not the reason it is doing it.  It is doing it in order that it can charge higher premiums to individuals who are predisposed to something that could trigger an illness later.  It wants our data in order that it can levy higher premiums.  It is not doing it for the good of the health service.  There is no reason we should give such data to it; it should have to obtain an individual's consent first.  That is all we are asking for.</p> <p>  It is an even bigger problem in the case of the banks because this allows for an exemption for the banks to process health data in the case of mortgage applications.  The Government's proposal is that the banks can do this without obtaining the consent of the person concerned.  That is ludicrous.  Everybody knows that when he or she fills in the application form for a mortgage, he or she will have to fill in numerous forms.  I do not think one of them being a consent form would be too onerous.  It woud not stop the banks or insurance companies from obtaining the information, but they would have to have our consent first.</p></speech>

The matter also arose during the preparation of legislation in a number of other member states, of which we are aware.</p> <p>  The matters referred to in section 47, paragraphs (a) to (d), inclusive, insurance or life assurance policies, pensions, annuities and mortgages, are normally the subject matters of a detailed contract between the data subject and an insurance company or a financial institution.  In order to determine contributions, it may well require obtaining information on the health of the data subject, or his or her welfare or disposition.  Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR permits the processing of non-sensitive personal data.</p><p>Article 9.2 does not permit the processing of such personal data for contractual purposes.  The question then is whether the explicit consent of the data subject in Article 9.2(a) provides a sufficiently robust ground for securing the benefits of such a contract.  The difficulty that arise relates to the strict definition of "consent" in Article 4.11 of the GDPR.  It prescribes that for the consent to be valid, it must be "freely given".  Recital 43 states that consent should not provide a valid legal ground for the processing of personal data "where there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller".  My concern, which is shared by a number of other member states, is that the insurance company or financial institution may in certain circumstances, in the absence of this section, seek to resile from the contract with the data subject on the basis that the consent of the subject could not have been freely given.  The need for the provision has been discussed and agreed with the Attorney General and I am not inclined, therefore, to accept the amendments.</p></speech>

I worked in the insurance industry and the health insurance industry, in particular, and, therefore, I am familiar with the motivation behind the section.  Deputy Daly will be glad to know that the advertisements that the VHI or other health insurers run and any tests they may perform as regards a predisposition to various conditions and diseases under law can have no effect on the premium they charge because of community rating, which means health status and categories of illness are immaterial when it comes to premium pricing.</p> <p>  There is a difficultly with the amendments.  The Minister stated that one of the grounds for the purposes of a contract is that consent be freely given.  Life insurance has always been risk-rated as opposed to community-rated and there is a difficulty in this regard.  For instance, when completing a proposal form, one is required to outline various health conditions and information which is necessary for actuarial pricing for the performance of the contract.  Under the amendment, there is the possibility of the data subject withholding consent.  I do not know how that would work if a contract has been signed.  If a client filled out a proposal form to take out a life insurance contract and at a later stage withheld consent for the use of this information, how could a claim be processed if no one has access to the information that was the subject of the contract in the first place?  The amendments are well-intentioned but they are problematic and I do not see how they could work.  I will oppose the amendments.</p></speech>

The section replaces section 2B(1)(b)(II) of the 1988 Act.  However, the original wording of section 48 was narrower in scope than section 2B(1)(b)(II) and it did not extend to personal data in respect of criminal convictions and offences.  This is because data relating to criminal convictions and offences fall within the definition of &quot;sensitive personal data&quot; under the 1988 Act whereas it forms the subject matter for a separate Article 10 under the GDPR.  The purpose of the amendment, therefore, is to bring section 48 more fully into line with the 1988 Act.  Yesterday, I outlined some of the statutory instruments made under the corresponding section 2(B) of the 1988 Act in respect of the historic institutional abuse inquiry in Northern Ireland, the coroner's inquest into the death of Arlene Arkinson, and the coroner's inquest into the Kingsmill massacre.  The processing of personal data under those regulations could involve the processing of personal data in respect of criminal convictions or offences or the alleged commission of an offence.  These are matters of great importance and they necessitate the making of regulations to facilitate processing of sensitive personal data.  The provisions of section 48 will permit the making of similar regulations in the future where that is justified for reasons of substantial public interest such as those I have outlined.</p><p>I will not accept amendments Nos. 72 and 73 because they seek to narrow the scope of the regulation-making power under the section.  If I was to confine the scope of the section to the processing of data by public authorities in cases of urgency, it would mean that the making of regulations such as those we made to facilitate the McAleese committee and its important work would no longer be possible.  I have concerns about the content and the cumulative impact of the proposals in amendments Nos. 74 to 76, inclusive, and I am not minded to accept them.</p></speech>

The amendment relates to the processing of sensitive categories of data, which can only be done in the substantial public interest.  None of us will have a problem with the example cited by the Minister but we are concerned to head off that interpretation being stretched in the future based on the current definition.  The Sinn F&eacute;in position is similar.  We propose that regulations under the section should be examined by a body or organisation that has data protection expertise.  Amendment No. 72 provides that anybody who wants to rely on the substantial public interest ground to process special category data should be a public authority.  That is both a matter of principle and a matter of the public authorities having an obligation to appoint data protection officers.</p> <p>  We propose in amendment No. 74 that the data protection officer of the relevant public authority the Minister wants to give permission to process special category data has to conduct a privacy impact assessment on the proposal and refer it back to him or her whereupon he or she can take the findings on board and, if not, make a statement in the Houses as to why not.  Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment is similar.  Regulations would be referred in draft form to the DPC for his or her opinion and he or she would have three months to think about them and refer them back to the Minister.  If the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment is considered to be drafted appropriately, I am happy to go with it over ours.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 76 is of a piece with our amendments Nos. 96 and 111, which we discussed earlier.  It is about oversight.</p></speech>

Section 48(4) is the result of a Sinn F&eacute;in amendment that was made in the Seanad.  I have sought to refine it to take account of a point made by the Minister to tighten it up.</p><p>To identify the point exactly, rather than section 48(4)(a) seeking an impact assessment, it would be defined as an opinion.  The Minister made the point in the Seanad that the provisions would have some implications for the independence of the data protection commissioner.  This is an attempt to refine that.  Deputy Daly's amendment diverges from the existing section 48(4)(a) in part (c).  Will the Deputy explain the difference in (c) to me?</p></speech>

The Minister has given examples.  In recent days, we have seen other issues that have arisen which may result in an investigation.  That also illustrates an example of how, on occasion, the processing of personal data is necessary on the basis of substantial public interest.  I will support the Minister's amendment No. 71.  The amendments put forward by Deputies Daly, &Oacute; Laoghaire and Wallace seek to put further obstacles in the way of regulations that are to be made by the Minister under section 48.</p> <p>  We need to remember that we did something quite novel yesterday.  We introduced an amendment that requires the Minister to seek prospective approval from the Houses of the Oireachtas before he introduces these regulations, so if he decides to introduce regulations in accordance with section 48, he has to lay them before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  He has to do that because it is a form of secondary legislation.  Law is being made.  I would be concerned about handing out these regulations to get the approval of some unelected official, such as a data protection officer or another public authority that will then assess whether they think it is necessary or proportionate for laws to be made.  We keep delegating our responsibility.  Regulations and statutory instruments are a delegation of legislation.  They go to the Minister but they are still legislation, which is why, yesterday, we wanted to have prospective approval of those regulations.  I will not support putting it out to some other unelected individual who will have a process for recommending them or giving an assessment.  We, as legislators, need to say that it is our responsibility to make laws, that we will see them and if we do not like them, we can vote them down.</p></speech>

We are talking about sensitive personal data and I do not see any reason private companies would be processing sensitive data for what is referred to as "substantial public interest".</p></speech>

We tabled two amendments to get around the legal prohibition on us placing an obligation on the Data Protection Commissioner to do anything.  We have probably favoured Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's amendment to ours but we were worried how that might stack up in that legal context and we put them in as reserves.  I am happy enough to withdraw these for now with the option, when we look at the final draft, to see how it might fit in.  Amendment No. 76 is consequential on amendment No. 5, and, on the point that Deputy O'Callaghan made about democratic oversight, we need to get that one passed.  We are okay with withdrawing the others.</p></speech>

I take the point that Deputy O'Callaghan raised about decisions being made by the Oireachtas.  There is no provision here that ensures that the Data Protection Commissioner would take a decision.  Any decision could only be made by a Minister and now perhaps requires prospective sanction by the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  Any decision that is made by elected representatives has to be based on gathering the information available, evaluating it, and then taking the decision.  The expert in these matters will be the Data Protection Commissioner.  The commissioner's say on what additional exceptions and special categories might be required to be processed is necessary information, even with the prospective approval of the D&aacute;il.  We should have that and should be able to evaluate it.  I will not support the Minister's amendment and will press my own.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that the Seanad is more academically minded than the D&aacute;il.  I think, from time to time, that the Seanad does not have the practical experience of life that we bring as Members of the D&aacute;il.  I would not be overly exercised at the debate in the Seanad as far as this issue is concerned.  I feel that, were we to accept these amendments, it would be grossly excessive with regard to the obligation on outside bodies.

The GDPR provides member states with possible exemptions and Article 22.2(b) is different from (a) and (c) in the sense that there does not seem to be a provision in (c) for a data subject's right to obtain human intervention on behalf of the controller.  I also accept the fact that section 54 of the Bill refers to suitable and specific measures and, therefore, the toolbox of safeguards.  I accept that automated decision-making might be necessary at times but we are uncomfortable with blanket, catch-all, automated decision-making.  In the Seanad debate, the Minister talked about the unintended consequences of amending this section in line with our amendment, suggesting it would facilitate wrongdoing and fraud.  Perhaps the Minister can clarify this.</p><p>One of the problems with this section of the Bill is that it is not specific in any way on the matter of automated decision-making.  It gives the power to introduce automated decision-making in a whole host of cases and we feel this may alienate certain vulnerable people from the institutions of the State.  I do not know if anybody has seen the film &quot;I, Daniel Blake&quot; by Ken Loach, which would remind one of the issue in this case.</p></speech>

Paragraphs 2(a) and (c) of Article 22, which have direct effect, permit automated processing, including profiling, where it is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between a data subject and a controller and where the data subject has given explicit consent.  Paragraph 2(b) of Article 22 permits such processing where it is authorised by the European Union or national law but subject to appropriate safeguards.  Recital 71 of the GDPR mentions measures to combat fraud and to monitor tax evasion, areas where such activity is relevant under national law but subject, again, to safeguards.</p><p>Section 54 makes it clear that the steps that need to be taken to safeguard the interests of the data subject must include an arrangement whereby the data subject has the opportunity to make representations on any intended decisions.  This means, in the first place, that a data subject has the information on any proposal to make such a decision and, secondly, has the opportunity to bring any concerns to the attention of the controller.</p><p> As I have said, the general data protection regulation, GDPR, mentions fraud and tax evasion as areas justifying automated processes.  It seems to me that the existing safeguards are adequate and are GDPR compliant.  The essential features of amendment No. 84 are contained in section 54.  I am not inclined to accept it.  In this regard we must ensure that our laws combating fraud and tax evasion are fully fit for purpose.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-03a.1958" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018050300002#L00200"><p>Article 29 of the GDPR is the god of guidance on the GDPR.  On automated processing the GDPR says that minimum safeguards must provide an explanation of the decision reached and a way for the data subject to obtain human intervention, to express his or her point of view and to contest the decision.  This Bill refers to making what are called representations.  It is not clear at what stage the data subject can make representations and there is no guarantee that he or she will get a human intervention if it is wanted.  There is no obligation on a controller in this regard.  We have to see this in the context of the fallibility of machines.  It is crucial that there needs to be a clear right for people in Ireland to get a human intervention and an appeal process for any decisions that are made by the machine.  This is what our amendment provides for.  We have to be cognisant that over the next ten years, automated decision-making is going to become much more prevalent.  There is a problem with the wording of the Bill in that the rights enshrined in the GDPR are somewhat circumscribed by this.  Unless we clearly delineate the rights now, there will be confusion and possible court cases in the future.  It is far better not to use the phrase "make representations", which is in the Bill.  If the phrase is to be used, then accept our amendment.</p></speech>

Further, it requires that the effect of any decision is either to grant a request of the data subject or that adequate steps have been taken to safeguard the interests of the data subject.  This covers the points raised by Deputy Clare Daly and therefore I am not inclined to accept amendment No. 84.</p></speech>

The Government inserted this new section in the Bill in the Seanad that says receiving direct mail from a political party or the Referendum Commission is not direct marketing, so a person has no right to object.  Essentially, it limits a person's right to object to being spammed so long as the bodies sending unsolicited mail are political parties or candidates.  Is the Government doing this to get around the freepost thing that everybody gets in an election, which is sent out by An Post?  If it is, then deal with that.  By doing it this way the legislation is just allowing any unsolicited mail from a political party or candidate to get through.  I do not believe this would be desirable.</p></speech>

This exception is based on the idea that citizens not only have rights but also obligations to inform themselves as part of their civic responsibilities.  During Seanad discussions on this Bill, Senator Norris referred in passing to his practice of sending information circulars on his parliamentary activities to the Trinity College electorate by direct mailing.  This section is intended to contribute to the formation and maintenance of an informed electorate in the State as part of our democratic system of government.  I was not minded to recall the incidents, as referred to by Deputy Clare Daly, but it is important that direct mailing be retained as part of the civic engagement.</p></speech>

We do not know who the funders are, the information is not verified and the publishers of the information are not identified.  We have a Constitution that has established that the people can elect people to the D&aacute;il.  We have a process whereby democracy manifests itself.  People might not like it and they may believe it is not democratic enough, but it is the method by which the people of Ireland elect the Government.  Unless we start standing up for the democratic structures in the State, we will expose ourselves to the threats to democracy that have had an impact in other countries.  We should not be embarrassed by the fact that candidates in an election, be they members of a political party or independent, can market themselves to tell people to vote for them.  It is an integral part of the democratic process.  The more we keep undermining ourselves and apologising for our existence, the more we undermine democracy.  We should stand up and be proud of the fact that we are politicians, that we get elected and that we represent the people.  That is the end of my party broadcast.</p></speech>

There is nothing to stop politicians continuing to mail people, every day of the week if they like.  Section 55, however, prevents a constituent from objecting to that process.  This is an entirely different matter.  While I will continue to use my Oireachtas envelopes, with which I think I am informing my constituents, if someone contacts me and gives me their name and address and objects to that, I believe the objection should be upheld.

A thread is emerging in this debate that rather than going out and canvassing during elections or gathering data, candidates should stay behind closed doors and pray for people to vote for them.  No one is suggesting that.  We are trying to ensure that we comply with an EU law that will have a direct effect, and where people hold data around political opinions and constituents' issues, they must mind it carefully, delete it where appropriate and have proper consent for it.</p><p>In that regard, if a person repeatedly receives letters that he or she considers nuisance mail, it is reasonable for that person to have the right to say that he or she does not wish to receive such mail.

However, I recall more than one occasion on which I did not leave a leaflet but was subsequently contacted by or spoke to the householder and pointed out that I had honoured the sign declining junk mail only to be told that it did not apply to me but, rather, the other crowd.

I acknowledge that the section refers to personal data rather than special categories of data such as political opinion, sexual orientation, ethnicity and so on.  However, no provision in the GDPR allows the Government to deny data subjects the right to object to the processing of personal data.  The Minister may object and state that I want to deny the Referendum Commission the ability to do its job but that would not happen with our amendment as the work of the Referendum Commission would be permitted as per Recital 69 of the GDPR and the reference therein to a compelling and legitimate interest.  The Referendum Commission is a legitimate interest under the GDPR and section 56 of the Bill makes no difference to it.  Section 56 is, therefore, unnecessary.  Surely we should have the basic right to object if our data is being processed in an inappropriate manner for election purposes.</p></speech>

A strict reading of the right to object indicates that it is subject to compelling and legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.  I believe that the effective operation of our democratic system depends on the right of those seeking or in elected political office to communicate their programmes, manifestos, policies, platforms, decisions and, often, achievements to the electorate.  There is a corresponding obligation that voters be informed in order to promote the discharge of civic duties in society.  That is the same argument as made previously.   The section as drafted is not unimportant.</p></speech>

I am aware that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire is opposing the section, and Deputy Wallace and I support him in that regard.  However, on the basis of the debate on the section in the Seanad, we did not think that approach would be heard or accepted and have, therefore, taken a harm mitigation approach.  However, we support Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire on the section other than in that regard.</p><p>As discussed in regard to amendment No. 6, section 57 allows for the restriction of rights under various articles for the purpose of so-called important objectives in the public interest.  Amendment No. 85 proposes to change the rights which can be restricted under the section to those outlined in Articles 12 to 21 of the GDPR rather than Articles 12 to 22.  It is not a major change but would mean that people would have the right not to be subjected to automated decision making or profiling under any circumstances under the section, which is important.  The British legislation on this matter includes a provision similar to that which we are proposing and it is important in that regard.</p><p>On amendment No. 90, as previously mentioned, section 57 proposes that the Minister would have wide discretion in limiting the rights of persons under Articles 12 to 22 in respect of certain circumstances that are united under the vague banner of being in the general public interest.</p><p>The section also proposes to give the Minister wide discretion in limiting the rights of persons if he or she believes it is necessary to do so for the protection of the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others to do so.  While this provision appears to be fair, the section does not include an obligation on the Minister to balance the rights and freedoms of data subjects with the rights and freedoms of others in circumstances in which he proposes to restrict the right of access to information under this section.  I am concerned that the provisions under this section could be used to deny adopted persons' requests for information about where they come from on the basis that another party is involved.  To oblige the Minister to balance rights would not be a great imposition.  It is important that he should be obliged to do so.</p><p>This ties in with amendment No. 90 where the Minister also has the power to limit the rights of data subjects in respect of personal data kept for or obtained in the course of the carrying out of social work by a public body.  On the face of it, this appears to be vaguely acceptable.  However, if one scratches a little deeper, it becomes obvious that the restriction of rights could and, given the history of the State, probably would be used to refuse information to adopted children about their natural parents.  If this is not the Minister's intention, I ask him to review these provisions and improve the wording.  As matters stand, I propose to press the amendment. </p><p> Amendments Nos. 92 and 94 limit the Minister's right to invent a new public interest objective with a view to restricting rights.  The key word in this context is "indicative".  The 14 objectives listed are only some of the public interest objectives the Minister may use as a basis for restricting rights.  A Minister can, at any time, add to these objectives without consulting elected representatives.  As matters stand, restrictions of rights could be justified on any basis.  Data centres, for example, have been justified on the basis that they are crucial and in the public interest.  Given that a caveat could be applied in respect of anything, it is necessary to introduce some checks and balances.  For this reason, we propose to restrict the public interest objectives by providing that a Minister who wants to designate an objective that is not already listed in the Bill as one that is of general public interest will be required to submit the proposal to the Oireachtas for approval.  The amendment introduces a check on the Minister's powers in this regard. </p><p> Amendment No. 95 requires the Minister to consult the Data Protection Commission before making regulations and present to the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality his rationale should he ignore the advice of the commission.  In that respect, the amendment is in line with previous amendments. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-03a.2004" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018050300002#N00200"><p>Of the 12 amendments in the group, six are in my name.  The purpose of section 57 is to protect the public and other objectives of general public interest.  I state categorically that it does not restrict, nor will it be used to restrict, the data protection rights of citizens.  For example, the Medical Council or the Property Services Regulatory Authority may have good reason to investigate a doctor or estate agent on foot of a complaint by a patient or client alleging unfitness to practice or otherwise.  If the data protection rights of the individuals in question are not restricted on a temporary basis while the complaint is investigated, the doctor or estate agent could apply to have his or her data rectified, restricted or erased in certain circumstances.  Any of these actions would put pay to an investigation, which would be to the detriment of the complainant and the regulatory body charged with supervision.</p><p>Regulations made under this section will permit regulatory bodies to carry out their statutory obligations to conduct inquiries or investigate complaints in the knowledge that those being investigated will not be permitted to exercise data subject rights in a manner that could jeopardise the regulatory body's performance of its statutory functions.  Persons under investigation will not be permitted to exercise rights to rectification or erasure of their personal data while the investigations are ongoing.  I say this against the background of the importance of meeting the conditions set out in Article 23 of the general data protection regulation in the text of section 57. </p><p>Subsections (1) and (2) give effect to the introductory text of Article 23.1 of the GDPR.  Subsection (3) restricts the exercise of data subject rights.  These are important issues and include Cabinet confidentiality and parliamentary privilege.  We need to be mindful of many examples, including in the context of protected disclosures and other whistleblowing activity.</p><p>Amendment No. 86 is a drafting amendment that substitutes revised text for subsection (2).  Amendment No. 87 removes reference to judicial independence and court proceedings from subsection (3)(<i>a</i>)(i), while amendments Nos. 194 to 196, inclusive, make more detailed provision for restrictions on the exercise of data subject rights in the case of courts acting in their judicial capacity.  Amendment No. 89 inserts reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General alongside the Data Protection Commission and Information Commissioner.  This will protect investigations and inquiries undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the performance of his or her constitutional and statutory functions.  </p><p>As regards other amendments, my position is as follows.  While I cannot accept amendment No. 85, which is not in line with Article 23 of the GDPR, I can accept amendment No. 88 tabled by Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace.  Amendment No. 90 is unnecessary in light of the requirement in subsection (10) that any regulations must &quot;respect the essence of the right to data protection and protect the interests of the data subject&quot;.  I cannot accept amendment No. 91, which seeks to delete subsection (5)(<i>b</i>), nor can I accept amendment No. 92, which seeks to limit the scope of &quot;important objectives of general public interest&quot; contrary to Article 23.1(e) of the GDPR.  As regards amendment No. 94, it repeats the content of the existing subsection (8) and paragraph (<i>b</i>) duplicates the content of subsection (11).  For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.  I will accept amendment No. 95.</p><p>Amendment No. 97 would, if accepted, breach the GDPR insofar as the controller or processor is responsible for carrying out impact assessments.  This is not a task for the data protection authority, not least because it would erode the authority's independence, which is important in the context of the legislation.  As I stated in respect of section 48, the cumulative effect of the provisions proposed would be excessive and disproportionate.  The making of regulations could take six, eight or nine months or perhaps longer.  There are circumstances in which we would find that to be less than acceptable.  In view of the issues I have outlined, I will not accept amendment No. 97.</p></speech>

While it is important to protect the public interest, it can often be used by organisations, agencies and government to make decisions that suit their objectives at a particular time.  Articles 9 and 145 of the GDPR specifically cover these matters.  In the absence of a proper definition of public interest and in view of the wide powers and discretion provided for the Minister under this section, I will oppose the section and support the amendments proposed by Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace.</p></speech>

If regulations are going to be made under section 57, the Minister is going to have to lay them before the Oireachtas for prospective approval.  The Minister did not mention his own amendment, amendment No. 87.  Will he tell us why he is removing judicial independence as one of the important objectives of general public interest?  Is it because the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has asked him to do so?  Perhaps not.  I would be interested to hear the logic behind that provision.</p> <p>  I am interested in amendment No. 92, proposed by Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace.  Subsection (7) of section 57 sets out important objectives of general public interest referred to in subsection (6).  It is better to have it slightly vague so that paragraphs (a) to (n) are not exclusive and that one can go beyond them.  The way this could be challenged in court, we could have a large corporation challenging regulations that have been made by the Minister and approved by the Oireachtas.  If it is the case that subsection (7) states that the important objectives can only include (a) to (n), that is a good opportunity for them to say the regulations are not valid because they do not come within that list.  On balance, we are better off not limiting the scenarios pursuant to which general public interest can be identified.  It is very broad.  If we limit it, there may be a situation that we have not envisaged whereby regulations in respect of public interest are introduced.</p> <p>  A lot of the time here, we are thinking of situations that will arise where a villainous Minister is issuing regulations supported by an oppressive Government and the rest of us are trying to oppose them.  The reality is that it will be large corporations trying to challenge regulations that have been brought in by the State.</p> <p>  I will be supporting amendment No. 95.  Amendment No. 96 is effectively provided for because of amendment No. 5.  I do not think it is necessary for that reason.  Amendment No. 97 is proposed by Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire.  I would make the same point again.  It is legislation that is being made by way of regulation although it is referred to as secondary legislation.  We should do it.  I understand Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's point.  We are not farming it out to the Data Protection Commissioner.  We should make our decision based on what we view as being in the public interest.  The elected Members of the Oireachtas are much more in tune with what is or is not in the public interest than any statutory body established by us.</p></speech>

It provides that, "The rights and obligations ... are restricted to the extent that the restrictions are necessary and proportionate to safeguard judicial independence and court proceedings."  This amendment is in respect of section 156, which we will address later on.</p></speech>

The intention is to ensure the controller retains overall control over the processing chain, especially where the processor needs to obtain the assistance of a sub-processor.  A very simple example is where, for example, the Garda, acting as a controller, obtains documents in a foreign language and transmits them to a translation service, which would be a processor, for translation into the English language.  If that translation service does not have the necessary expertise to translate the particular language into English, it may need to obtain the services of another service with the necessary translation expertise, which would be the sub-processor.  The proposed amendments to section 77 are technical in nature, but the intention is simply to ensure the controller which in my example is the Garda retains control over the personal data contained in the documents.  That will enable it to retain control over the data and facilitate the exercise of data subject rights.  It will also enable it to demonstrate compliance with the requirements in Part 5 of the Bill to the Data Protection Commission if called upon by the commission to do so.  A possible Report Stage amendment is being considered with regard to determining the controller-processor relationship between the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the prosecuting counsel on behalf of the State.</p></speech>

Section 84(1) deals with situations where a personal data breach occurs and is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of a data subject.  In such cases, the controller shall provide him or her with the details of the breach.  I wish to add that if a data subject requests information in regard to a personal breach which affects him or her, he or she has a right to be provided with all of the pertinent information in respect of that breach.  It would provide a statutory basis for people being given information without having to write to the Data Protection Commissioner or go to court.  I am interested in hearing what the Minister has to say.</p></speech>

As I mentioned in the Seanad when dealing with a similar amendment, I am unable to accept an amendment which would insert a new subsection (9) in section 84.</p> <p>  Under section 84 there is already an obligation on a controller to inform a data subject where there is a high risk to the data subject's rights and freedom arising from a breach.  In such a case, the controller, in clear and plain language, must notify the data subjects of the nature of the breach, its likely consequences and a description of the measures taken or proposed to be taken to mitigate its possible adverse effects.  The proposed amendment refers to a data breach which affects a data subject.  It is far from clear what it is intended to mean.  Under the GDPR and the law enforcement directive, the thresholds for informing the Data Protection Commissioner of a data breach and informing the data subject whose data protection rights have been breached are defined in terms of risks for the data subject arising from the breach.</p> <p>  If a data breach involves a high risk for the data subject, then the data subject must be given all relevant information and may require further information.  I should add that acceptance of the amendment would also create a confusing and perhaps even undesirable divergence between the reporting thresholds in the section and the corresponding provision in the GDPR.  I know where Deputy O'Callaghan is coming from, but I am somewhat concerned that we would be making matters less certain.  For those reasons, I am not minded to accept the amendment.  Perhaps the Deputy would like to think about it further.</p></speech>

Obviously, my concern is that under section 84(1), a data subject is only entitled to be given information in respect of a breach where that breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of a data subject.  Somebody who has breached a person's data rights will be able to justify not giving him or her the information on the basis that there was no high risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject.  I will re-examine the issue for Report Stage.  The way to deal with it may be to table an amendment to section 84(1) rather than inserting a new subsection.</p></speech>

The revised wording is closer to the text of paragraph 2 of Article 32 of the directive.  I will briefly refer to the other amendments at this stage. </p><p>I recognise the intent on the part of Deputies Daly and Wallace in respect of amendment Nos. 120 to 123, inclusive.  They wish to bring the content of the section into line with the corresponding provision in the GDPR.  While the directive does not contain or require the same level of detail, I will consider the matter with a view towards a Report Stage amendment if the Deputies withdraw their amendments today.  I know what they are trying to achieve, but I do not want to have different consequences.</p><p>I see the reasoning of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire but I cannot accept amendment No. 124 because it deals with the risk that a data protection officer might encounter non-co-operation, harassment, duress or even victimisation in the workplace as a result and would no longer be in a position to perform his or her duties.  We considered that matter during the Seanad discussions in the context of a similar amendment.  I am strongly of the view that a more effective remedy is already available to data protection officers under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and that it is better that we address these issues under that Act rather than introduce them into data protection.</p></speech>

They might make protected disclosures to bring themselves within the scope of this Bill.  We think it would be preferable to avoid the need for them to artificially bring themselves under the protected disclosures legislation if they could get protection under this Bill.  That is what we are trying to do.</p> <p>  Part of the confusion is that Part 5 is a new Bill.  A second Bill has been inserted into the Bill to give effect to the criminal justice directive.  Due to the fact that the GDPR does not apply to the criminal justice system, not everything is transposed and so on.  We are trying to give data protection officers specific protection against victimisation and being penalised for doing their job.  We are allowed to go beyond the directive.  That is what we are trying to do and it is necessary because by going beyond the directive we are bringing them in line with the GDPR.  That is all that is being sought.  We will withdraw the amendment, but if the Minister does not address the issue at a later Stage with something better we will come back with this.</p></speech>

The organisation he or she is responsible for may not be complying properly with data protection or may be abusing or misusing people's data or being careless in some respect.  One can see how it would be in the interests of the data controller to frustrate, victimise or harass a data protection officer.  That is very apparent.</p> <p>  I appreciate there is the Protected Disclosures Act, but that could be a cumbersome mechanism in some respects.  If this all relates to data I do not see how a data protection officer could not say to the Data Protection Commissioner that he or she has an issue with data protection in the organisation in which he or she works and is being frustrated by his or her superior, that is, the data controller and is seeking an intervention and assessment.  That is reasonable.  There are probably a number of ways that could be done.  The existing subsection on corrective powers could be used to facilitate that. </p> <p>  I will press my amendment, but I will not call a vote.  I would appreciate if the Minister could consider that.  There must be another mechanism beyond the protected disclosure legislation which would be potentially cumbersome and probably quite slow.</p></speech>

I am satisfied that it provides an effective remedy where a data protection officer is experiencing difficulty in the performance of his or her functions.</p><p>An important thing to take into account is the fact that a data protection officer who makes such a protected disclosure would enjoy the extensive protections against dismissal and against victimisation or any form of loss or detriment which is provided specifically under Part 3 of the 2014 Act.  I believe it is better and clearer if it is under that umbrella.  I note what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has said.</p></speech>

Most of the items of information in subsection (2), such as information on controller's contact details and the right to lodge a complaint, are replicated in the GDPR and the directive but two of them, namely, the legal basis for any transfers and such further information as is necessary to enable the data subject to exercise his or her rights, which are in the GDPR, have not been included in this Bill.

It is slightly different as the GDPR Article 13.2(f) gives people the right to be given information about the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling.  The right is not replicated in the directive or this Bill and we think it is no harm to put it in there as it could be valuable.  The directive prohibits automated processing, including profiling, that results in discrimination.  To enforce the right not to be profiled in a discriminatory way, a data subject has to know they have been subjected to automated processing.  To know that, he or she would have to be told about it when he or she exercised his or her right to access information under section 89.  At the moment, section 89 does not oblige controllers to inform people of the fact that they have been profiled or subjected to automated processing.</p> <p>  This section is in Part 5, which means we are talking about the potential profiling of innocent people in a discriminatory way by the Garda.  We know that ethnic profiling has taken place, so we are trying to provide that a person who asks for information about what the Garda has been up to with his or her data will get the information they need.</p></speech>

Rights relating to automated data processing, including profiling, are set out directly in Article 11 of the directive and in section 87 of the Bill.</p> <p>  I am reluctant to accept amendment No. 125, which proposes to insert a specific reference to the legal basis for any transfers of personal data in section 88.  The existing reference to the legal basis for processing the data includes reference to transfers because of the wide definition of processing in section 66.  In accordance with the definition in section 66, it is clear that processing includes the disclosure of data by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making the data available.  This would include the transfer of personal data.  My concern is that the inclusion of a specific reference to transfers of data in this section could well cast doubt on its usage, validity or application in other parts of the Bill.  Subsection (2)(f)(iii) requires that information be given on categories of recipients, and this includes recipients in third countries and in international organisations.</p> <p>  I will not accept amendment No. 125 and amendment No. 126 is not needed.  In respect of amendment No. 127, section 89 refers to Article 14 of the directive.</p></speech>

For that reason, I will support amendment No. 125.  I also think amendment No. 126 is appropriate.  The Minister's only objection to it is that it is not needed.  That may be the case but I do not see any harm in replicating it, notwithstanding the fact that it is referred to previously.  If there is any legal doubt over it, the fact that it is expressly contained in section 88 will be of assistance to the person who is seeking information.</p> <p>  I will not support amendment No. 127 as it is too vague.  It refers to looking for information relating to the logic involved, but it is very difficult to get a definition of logic in statutes.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 138 is similar to amendment No. 137 which was tabled by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  On balance, I prefer his drafting which is more concise.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-03a.2178" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018050300002#S03300"><p>Sections 103, 107, 108, 109, 111, 120 and 121 deal with the complaints handling process, which is both streamlined and comprehensive.  I will focus on the key amendments.  As regards Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's amendment No. 137 and Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment No. 138, both of which would replace section 107(1), I have a serious problem with the introduction of a discretion on the part of the commission not to investigate a complaint that is "frivolous or vexatious."</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 139, 144, 159, 160, 164 would also allow the commission to decide not to investigate complaints on the basis that they were considered to be frivolous or vexatious.  I am completely opposed to the introduction of this discretionary filter into the Bill for a number of reasons.  First, it would not be compliant with the GDPR.  Second, while the term "frivolous or vexatious" has a specific meaning in our law when used by the courts, that is, that the claim is unsustainable in law and is bound to fail, the term is not understood in other member states, except possibly in a common law jurisdiction such as the UK.  On the contrary, to a data subject or a data protection authority in another member state, use of the word "frivolous" suggests that the matter is not regarded as sufficiently serious for investigation, while "vexatious" suggests that the complaint is seen as a deliberate intention to cause annoyance.  The scope for such misunderstandings will be much greater under the "one-stop-shop" mechanism because the data protection commission will be acting as lead supervisory authority in many cross-border cases.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, the term "frivolous and vexatious" is used in section 10(1)(b) of the 1988 Act and it has created confusion and misunderstandings in recent years, especially in cross-border cases.  In the Schrems judgment, Judge Hogan commented that the wording of that provision "is somewhat unfortunate and perhaps even unhelpful".  Its use was widely misinterpreted and misunderstood in the aftermath of that case in which Mr. Schrems successfully contested the adequacy of the safe harbour mechanism.  His original complaint concerning the shortcomings of the safe harbour mechanism had been rejected on the grounds that it was frivolous or vexations, that is, unsustainable in law because of the European Commission's decision to recognise the adequacy of privacy safeguards provided by the safe harbour mechanism.</p> <p>  The risk therefore of misinterpretation or misunderstanding will be very much greater in future because of the expected increase in the number of "one-stop-shop" cases handled by the data protection commission, which have originated in other member states.  As I said, I cannot accept the alternative models put forward in the amendments to the complaints-handling mechanisms in Chapters 2 and 3 of Part 6.  I ask for the understanding and support of the committee in the avoidance of any reference to the term "frivolous and vexatious".  I believe that the robustness and effectiveness of the mechanisms outlined in Part 6 will be compromised by the introduction of a filter based on the commission's opinion as to whether a complaint it has received is "frivolous or vexations".</p> <p>  As regards amendments Nos. 140 and 161, a reference to consent of the parties is not required because an amicable resolution cannot take place without the consent of the parties in any event.</p><p>On section 108, I am not in favour of replacing reference to 107(5)(<i>e</i>) with a general reference to section 107(1) as proposed by amendment No. 147, where a complaint, following an examination by the commission under section 107(1), has been rejected or dismissed under 107(5)(<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>), a data subject has a specific right to appeal against that decision under section 148(<i>a</i>).  Where the commission, following an examination of a complaint, has already issued an enforcement notice on the controller or processor in any of the situations referred to in section 107, the carrying out of a further inquiry would be unnecessary.  The same applies where a data subject has been provided with advice by the commission, for example, where a data subject is seeking compensation and the commission explains that compensation remains a matter for the courts.<br/><br/>Amendments Nos. 149 and 170, which seek to insert new sections into the Bill, contain provisions that are taken from surrounding sections without deletion of those provisions.  This would give rise to confusion and legal uncertainty.  I cannot accept the amendments as drafted but I am happy to come back to them on Report Stage.The word &quot;where&quot; is correct and is consistent with usage throughout the Bill.  I cannot accept amendment No. 171.<br/><br/>In summary, sections 107, 108, 120 and 121 of the Bill provide, in my view, a coherent and streamlined approach to the future handling of complaints by the Data Protection Commission and I am not disposed to accepting amendments that would militate against that coherence or streamlined frame that is envisaged under the Bill.</p></speech>

As mentioned by the Minister, the words "frivolous" and "vexatious" are frequently used in respect of cases which fail to reach a fairly low threshold.  I note what the Minister says but it appears to me that as things stand in the Bill there is greater discretion and flexibility than would be the case were amendments Nos. 137 and 138 accepted, in regard in particular to the requirement for a formal decision, which, I think, is important.</p></speech>

The intention was to give the commission some leeway to reject complaints that appeared to be frivolous or vexatious.  I appreciate the Minister's point that this has a legal connotation.  I am happy if the Minister commits to look at this again on Report Stage.  I think some mechanism and statutory power needs to be given to the commission to allow it deal with complaints that it believes do not merit extensive investigation.  If this is not done, the commission will be bogged down in that it will have to investigate every complaint made, irrespective of how small it is and irrespective of the cost of any investigation in that regard.  The investigating commission should be given the power to reject complaints which appear to be unlikely to succeed or disclose no cause of action.</p></speech>

I am anxious to ensure that the provisions of Part 6 are not compromised by the introduction of a new layer in terms of whether a complaint is frivolous or vexatious.  I am conscious that there are different interpretations and different understandings in this regard.  However, I will take another look at the amendments.  I do not want to overestimate what is a real problem.  Given the manner of interpretation of words such as this I am concerned.  It is within this framework that I would be happy to discuss the matter further.

I would like to speak to amendments Nos. 155 to 158, inclusive.  Section 115(7) of the Bill as drafted permits not-for-profit bodies such as, for example, Digital Rights Ireland, to bring an action on behalf of a data subject when it has been mandated by the data subject to do so.  However, as argued by Dr. T.J. McIntyre during the pre-legislative scrutiny process, the Bill should provide that not-for-profit bodies also be allowed to independently bring actions without their having to be mandated by an individual data subject to do so.  Amendment No. 155 seeks to remedy this.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, will explain why the Bill excludes this as I understand Article 80 includes this possibility as a discretionary provision, although in such cases compensation for damages would not be awarded unless the Article 80 body was specifically mandated by a data subject to bring the action.</p><p> Amendment No. 156 is an attempt to address the lack of provision in the Bill for a not-for-profit body of the type described in Article 80 of the GDPR, for example, Digital Rights Ireland, to bring an action for compensation for damages on behalf of a data subject.  I do not understand why this is prohibited.  Dr. T.J. McIntyre made a compelling case for it during the pre-legislative scrutiny phase.  He said that, without it, there would be a gap in protection for data subjects.  We must remember that when a data subject seeks to take a case for a data breach or violation of his or her data rights, he or she would in many instances be forced to discuss sensitive personal data publicly.  Therefore, many people would be reluctant to come forward and become the public face of an issue.  There is also the fact that many, if not most, individuals affected would not have the financial ability to bring an action themselves.  Class actions are not permitted in Ireland as of yet.  If a large number of people are affected by a single data breach, it makes sense on a practical level that they could be represented by a single Article 80 body instead of them taking cases individually, which the courts would not be equipped to handle.  Surely it would make sense that Digital Rights Ireland, for example, should be allowed to act on behalf of such people if it is mandated to do so, as the GDPR permits, without taking the possibility of compensation off the table for complainants.</p></speech>

Section 115 makes provision for a judicial remedy in the case of infringements of the GDPR.  Article 80.2 of the GDPR recognises that a member state may allow in its national laws for a not-for-profit body, association or organisation to take action on behalf of a data subject without the data subject's mandate.  However, that is not part of our law and compliance with the GDPR does not require such a provision.</p> <p>  The restrictions in the Bill on the taking of compensation claims by a not-for-profit body, association or organisation is understandably intended to discourage speculative compensation claims, especially where the data subject will be relieved of any risk that costs of the action might be awarded against him or her.  There are sound public policy reasons for discouraging the growth of a compensation culture in respect of data protection claims, which is reflected in the Bill's provisions.  As Deputy Wallace may be aware, there is already concern at the level of compensation claims, which is contributing to increasing insurance premiums and affecting business, especially SMEs.  I am very conscious of this matter when I wear my other ministerial hat.</p> <p>  I cannot accept subsection (8) as proposed in amendment No. 155 or subsection (9) as proposed in amendment No. 157.  The same applies to amendment No. 136, which seeks to make provision for the taking of action on behalf of a data subject without a mandate, or permission, from him or her.  Deputy Wallace referred to amendment No. 156.  I cannot accept it, as it would allow courts to award compensation to data subjects in cases taken under section 115 by a not-for-profit body, association or organisation on their behalf.</p> <p>  Regarding amendment No. 158, the position is that Article 55 of the directive, unlike the GDPR, does not provide for actions to be taken on behalf of data subjects without their permission.  For this reason, I cannot accept the amendment, which would allow a not-for-profit body, association or organisation to take action on behalf of a data subject under section 118 without his or her permission.  This is understandable, given that the data subject might have specific reasons for not wishing the case to be taken.</p> <p>  I cannot accept the proposed changes in amendments Nos. 172 and 173 to section 126 for the reasons already outlined in respect of the GDPR.  That being the case, amendment No. 190, which proposes to amend section 146(1) in order to accommodate the withdrawal of complaints by a not-for-profit body, association or organisation that has not been mandated to act on behalf of a data subject, is not required.</p></speech>

The consequence of it would be that, if someone's data were breached and he or she did not want to make a complaint or take an action, a not-for-profit body could take an action on his or her behalf.  It is very unusual in Irish law that someone might be able to take an action or make a complaint on behalf of an individual when the individual has not mandated that such a complaint would be made.  Before a court, it would probably be struck out on grounds of lacking<i>locus standi</i>.  It is a well-intentioned amendment, but I am concerned that a not-for-profit body could bring the complaint or take the action without permission.  Significant legal costs will be associated with that.  A not-for-profit body can hire lawyers to take the case who will cost a considerable amount of money and the financial cost to the data breacher would be significant.</p><p>Obviously, there must be a remedy, but given that this provision is so unusual and I do not believe that a not-for-profit body should be in a position to take an action on behalf of a person who does not want it taken, I would be slow to support the amendment.</p></speech>

When a draft report is prepared by an authorised officer on foot of his or her investigation under section 137 of this Bill, fair procedure rules require the contents of that report to be shared with the controller or processor concerned for any representation that he or she may wish to make.  The authorised officer is required to have regard to any such representations.  This, of course, does not necessarily require changes to the report.  The same considerations apply where the report is submitted to the commission for its consideration and for a decision under section 138.  I fear that the sharing of a draft report with a complainant - an individual, or a not-for-profit body, organisation or association acting on his or her behalf &ndash; could provide very strong grounds for a later challenge to the validity of any decision reached by the commission and to any corrective action or fine it imposes on the controller or processor concerned.  If significant sanctions, especially administrative fines, are to be imposed, it will be important to ensure high standards of due process and the integrity and independence of the investigative process are maintained throughout the investigation and adjudication process.  Specific references to these aspects of the matter are included Articles 58.4 and 83.8 of the GDPR.  For these reasons, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 181 to 184, inclusive.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, section 137 links the draft report and the final report.  I will wait to hear what Deputy Wallace has to say.</p></speech>

I will come back to this matter on Report Stage.  I think the complainant should be given some access to a final report.

I appreciate that the processor or controller is entitled to look at a draft report and point out what is wrong with it in advance of the completion of the final report.  Rather than pushing these amendments now, I will consider them again in advance of Report Stage.  I ask the Minister of State to do likewise in order to provide for a complainant to have access to a final investigation report.</p></speech>

The proposed new subsection (4) provides that the commission will issue a notice requiring payment of a fine within 28 days of its decision to impose the fine.  The proposed new subsection (5) requires the controller or processor concerned to comply with such a notice.  The proposed new subsection (6) provides for the payment of any fines into the Exchequer.  Amendment No. 188 corrects an incorrect reference to section 139 in section 140.  I assure Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire that the issue at the heart of amendment No. 187, in his name - the recovery of any profits made by a controller or processor because of infringements - is dealt with in Article 83.2(k) of the GDPR.  It provides that when determining the amount of any administrative fine, the data protection authority shall have regard to &quot;financial benefits gained, or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, from the infringement&quot;.  I thank Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire for his amendment, but I think the matter is adequately covered already in Article 83 of the GDPR.</p></speech>

The amendment seeks to change the parameters by which such an appeal may take place.  Having re-read the Government's draft, I believe subsection (5) is probably better than the my proposed subsection (5) as the former provides for a broader ground upon which a decision can be appealed.  Anyone affected by the decision can appeal, whereas in the amendment the decision can be appealed only by the person concerned.  On that basis, I will withdraw the amendment.</p><p>I will pursue amendment No. 193.  A decision of the Data Protection Commission can be appealed to the Circuit Court and High Court.  The Government proposes that a person may only appeal a decision to the High Court if he or she obtains the leave of the court.  The amendment proposes to remove the words &quot;by leave of that court&quot; to give persons an entitlement to have their case heard by a High Court judge having taken a case to the Circuit Court.</p></speech>

This is a standard provision in legislation of this kind and it will ensure that a further appeal on the merits of the case does not take place.  For this reason, I cannot accept amendment No. 193.</p></speech>

However, a person must obtain the leave of the relevant court.  Obviously in such circumstances, the judge who heard the case will not have found in favour of the plaintiff.  The person who takes the case should be able to appeal.  As matters stand, the judge who rejected his or her case can also refuse to allow an appeal.</p></speech>

We will not ask members to attend at 9 a.m. on that date.  Deputy Clare Daly can sleep in that morning.  However, we will address this short Bill as a single item at 4.45 p.m. that afternoon.  I hope the time works for members, the Minister and Deputies R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall and Catherine Murphy, who are the proposers. </p><p> The joint committee will meet at 9 a.m. next Wednesday, 9 May, in the normal way of our business.  The following Wednesday, 16 May, the select committee will meet at 4.45 p.m.</p></speech>
