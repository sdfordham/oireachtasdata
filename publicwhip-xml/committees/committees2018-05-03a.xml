Assisting constituents by making representations and requests on their behalf is a valuable as well as a time-honoured aspect of our democratic system.  Amendment No. 50 introduces a new section that will facilitate specified persons in using personal data in the course of their electoral activities in the State for the purpose of communicating with data subjects.  Under subsection (2), such communication is considered to be the performance of a task being carried out in the public interest.</p><p>Amendment No. 51 introduces a new section that will provide a robust legal basis for the making of representations on behalf of individuals.  Where special categories of personal data are involved, subsection (3) will require that measures to limit access to the data be taken in order to prevent unauthorised consultation, alteration, disclosure or even erasure of data.  Subsection (4) establishes a legal basis for responding to representations and requests received by public authorities and public bodies from elected representatives on behalf of data subjects.</p><p>The amendments cover the subject matter of amendment No. 65 tabled by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan.  An issue that remains under consideration in my Department and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is the extent to which the Electoral Acts may need to be looked at and tweaked.  If necessary, I will table an appropriate amendment on Report Stage in that regard.  I am in consultation with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p></speech>

I welcome that the Minister has put down these amendments.  It is appropriate that there is recognition of the important role that democracy plays and how it operates in this country.  We are sometimes too self-deprecating as politicians.  We are not simply politicians but elected representatives of the people and the people are entitled to have their democracy protected.  I will support amendments Nos. 50 and 51.  I will withdraw amendment No. 65 in light of amendments Nos. 50 and 51 but I may bring forward Report Stage amendments relating to amendments Nos. 50 and 51 with the purpose of strengthening them since there are other aspects of democratic and electoral activity which need to be covered and are not covered in the Minister's amendment.</p></speech>

Under the GDPR, the legitimate interest of communicating with constituents is covered but we are trying to say that any communication by a politician is in the public interest, which is a stretch, given some of the bile that is foisted on householders by politicians claiming that it is in the public interest.  It is not necessary.  The British authorities had something like amendment No. 50.  I will not make a big deal about it here.  My point is that political work is covered by "legitimate interest" and we do not need this extra clause.  It is a stretch to say that some of the stuff that is sent out by politicians or would-be politicians is in the public interest because it is only in the interests of them getting re-elected.</p></speech>

That is exactly what I was going to say.  The GDPR covers this.  I do not know if this is necessary but it may not do any great harm.  If people accept and consent to their data being used, provided it is stored safely and securely, that seems to be in compliance with the GDPR.</p></speech>

I take Deputy Daly's point though I do not particularly agree with it.  She says she does not agree with it but feels it is not necessary.  That is the point raised by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire too.  I make the point, which the amendment covers, regarding the need to ensure that public representatives continue to do what is an important part of our duty.  It is fair to say that it is within the public interest to make representations but I wonder about the respondent - the person or body to which the representation is made - and whether that might be regarded in the same way as we would.  The amendment is important.  I acknowledge what Deputy O'Callaghan said.  If there are further issues which are not immediately apparent now that might be covered in amendment No. 65, then it is open to us all to come back on Report Stage.  I acknowledge the importance of these amendments and welcome, if not the support, then the lack of opposition.</p></speech>

I invite Deputies Daly and Wallace to address these amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-03a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018050300002#B01000"><p>I move amendment No. 52:</p><blockquote>In page 29, line 2, to delete &ldquo;and special categories of personal data&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>Much of the wording of section 38 is taken directly from the GDPR.  I still think we have reason to be concerned about what the section might permit.  Article 23 of the GDPR is the relevant part.  It does not make an explicit distinction between the processing of personal and special categories of data but, throughout the GDPR, we are told that special categories of data should be treated with special care, hence we are attempting to separate it in amendment No. 56 and in the related amendments, for example, amendment No. 52, separating the two categories of data, personal data and &quot;special categories of personal data&quot;.</p><p>I accept that Article 23 of the GDPR refers to the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, which is inserted in the Bill in section 38(<i>b</i>).  The problem these amendments try to address relates to the scope the word &quot;preventing&quot; introduces with regard to criminal offences, particularly relating to special categories of personal data, such as religious beliefs, political opinion, ethnicity and so on.  Section 38 of the Bill is not part of Part 5 of the Bill, which relates to processing of personal data for law enforcement purposes.  The processing of data referred to in section 38 does not apply to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for example.  The kind of processing proposed in section 38 might well be done by private companies.  Section 38 essentially permits racial profiling if we include the processing of special categories of data.  A body other than the Garda, for example, can profile a person based on ethnicity, religion and political opinions in the name of preventing, in the broadest sense, a criminal offence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-03a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018050300002#B01100"><p>The last amendment is listed as being in section 39.  It is actually section 38, as the line numbers would indicate.  Under the GDPR in general, processing of personal data for purposes other than that for which it was initially collected should be allowed only where the processing is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were collected in the first place.  In other words, if one gives Twitter one's phone number to verify when one is connecting from a different device, it cannot start ringing that person about other stuff.  That is straightforward but there is some wriggle room according to Recital 50, on processing for purposes which are incompatible with the basis on which the data were initially collected.  That can be allowed in two circumstances.  First, where somebody gives consent for that to happen and, second, when the "processing is based on Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard, in particular, important objectives of general public interest".</p> <p>  Section 38 tries to give effect to this wriggle room but it goes a little too far because it allows for the processing of both sensitive categories of data, including the serious stuff about political opinions, sexual orientation and so on, and the general personal data, for reasons other than the purposes for which it was collected, in order to prevent a threat to national security, to prevent, investigate or prosecute crimes and for getting legal advice and legal proceedings.</p> <p>  In amendments Nos. 52, 53 and 55, we are proposing that further processing of personal data would be lawful for all of those reasons with the tweak that, rather than it being for preventing crime, we would use the tighter wording of "avoiding prejudicing the prevention" of crime.  There is a further small tweak in amendment No. 53, that further processing would be allowed only if "having regard to the fundamental rights and legitimate interests of the data subject".  It is necessary and proportionate for various crime and terror-fighting purposes.</p><p>The wording for our first amendment is taken from the British wording and our second amendment is a balancing requirement.</p><p> In amendment No. 56 we propose that further processing of very sensitive data would be permitted for all of the aforementioned except the prevention for crime.  Our reason is that the GDPR does not apply to competent authorities like the Garda.  What section 38 asks us to prove is a right for public bodies or companies to collect or compile databases on things like people's political opinions, trade union membership, religious beliefs and so on for the purposes of preventing crime, which is a bit broad.</p><p> For example, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, has loads of documentation and data about people.  Let us say the Garda says there is crime afoot, they think it is linked to an area where there is a higher concentration of immigrants, for example, and want to hoover up all of the data, closed circuit television, CCTV, surveillance and so on that is linked to an immigrant community in a particular area.  That is racial profiling.  It is very hard to see how information held by private companies or public bodies would be so important to prevent a crime yet outweigh the balance of people's individual rights and so on.  That is where my colleague and I are coming from.</p><p> On balance, other information about political opinions could be important.  Let us say there was an urgent situation to prevent a threat to public security and a bunch of neo-Nazis threatened to set off a bomb in Dublin and the Garda needed to get information from a social media site, such a situation would not be hampered by our amendments.  I wish to stress that our amendments do not prevent the reuse of personal data in general, just special category data.  Names, phone numbers, addresses, emails and all of that can still be reused for a crime prevention aim.  We do not seek to stop that but we want to prevent the more personal and sensitive information being abused.</p><p> We think the terminology &ldquo;avoiding prejudicing the prevention, investigation or prosecution of&rdquo; is stronger.  Again, our amendment is based on the British wording.  Anybody can say something is for the prevention of crime.  A controversial CCTV scheme is being introduced on that basis even though there is no evidence that extra crime has taken place in that area.  If there is an immediate incident of a likelihood of crime, then that is a different situation.  I have outlined our motivation for tabling our amendments.</p></speech>

I wish to advise everyone that if the question on amendment No. 54 is agreed, then amendment No. 55 cannot be moved as one is an alternative to the other.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-03a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018050300002#C00300"><p>Amendment No. 54 is merely a drafting amendment that seeks to insert the word "detecting" after the word "preventing", which will have the effect of bringing the wording into line with provisions elsewhere in the Bill.  I note the point made by the Chairman regarding amendments Nos. 54 and 55.  In any event, I am unable to accept amendments Nos. 52, 53, 55 and 56 and I shall give my reasons.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 53, in section 38, has a provision for the processing of personal data for certain public interest purposes for which the data were originally collected but only to the extent that such processing is necessary for and proportionate to the purpose, and that acts very much as a restrictor.  The position is as follows.  Statutory provisions that permit, or require, further notification or disclosure of personal data are to be found right across the Acts of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  Let me give a brief example.  Section 42 of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 refers to a range of designated persons such as financial institutions, auditors and property service providers who know, may suspect or may have reasonable grounds to suspect, on the basis of information that they have that another person has been or is engaged in an offence of money laundering or terrorist financing.  Of course there is an obligation that such knowledge or suspicion on those grounds be reported not only to the Garda but also to Revenue.</p> <p>  Under sections 2 and 3 of the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012, it is an offence to withhold any information on offences referred to in that Act.  The Children First Act 2015 requires a range of mandated persons, including health practitioners, teachers and youth workers, who know, believe or suspect that a child has been harmed, is being harmed or, indeed, is at risk of being harmed, to report that to Tusla.</p> <p>  I am sure that committee members would agree that the public interest in such cases should not in any way be jeopardised or compromised.  This section provides an effective and appropriate safeguard in the words "necessary and proportionate".  I cannot accept the proposals in amendments Nos. 52 and 56 to remove the reference to special categories of personal data in section 38 and add a new section.  Neither can I accept insertion of the words &ldquo;having regard to the fundamental rights and legitimate interests of the data subject&rdquo; as an addition in amendment No. 54, because this would place an additional burden on, for example, a youth worker reporting suspected harm to a child or perhaps even a bank official reporting his or her suspicion that certain transactions may from time to time be linked to money laundering or illegal activity.</p> <p>  I see where Deputy Daly is coming from but I think there are adequate safeguards.  If I were to accept her amendments, I would be jeopardising long-standing obligations on persons.</p></speech>

The committee had a lengthy discussion recently on the importance of independent journalism, journalists' sources and their importance for the functioning of a democratic society.  There are many discussions in the public domain about recent data breaches in significant media outlets in this State that have caused a lot of concern about potential interference with journalists and what they do.  That is wrong.  It is a matter of concern for free media and democracy in this country, so it is vitally important that journalists and their sources are protected.  They are integral to a functioning democracy that holds Government, Opposition and public institutions to account.</p><p>I do not believe the Bill adequately provides for this.  That is a view shared by others.  I will be pressing the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-03a.37" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018050300002#D00400"><p>We had considerable debate on this in the Seanad.  The text of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's new section seems to be inspired by the recommendation of this committee arising from the pre-legislative scrutiny of the communications (retention of data) Bill 2017.</p> <p>  The joint committee's report was issued recently but the Government, and more importantly the Attorney General, have not yet had the opportunity to examine the recommendations in the detail this deserves.  I have doubts as to whether this is the correct location for a far-reaching statutory provision of this kind.  I ask Deputies to appreciate that the potentially far-reaching nature of this amendment, and the provision of proposed subsection (3) whereby the High Court could permit identification of confidential sources of information where a journalist is the subject of investigation for suspected commission of a serious criminal offence, raise several important issues, not least what is meant by a serious offence.  Does it cover dangerous driving or domestic violence?  There is no definition of any kind and the result is that journalistic privilege may in effect be put at risk rather than be safeguarded.</p> <p>  Balancing the rights of journalists to protect their sources with other sources is rightly a matter for the courts.  For example, the European Court of Human Rights has underlined that protection of confidential sources is an essential means of enabling the press to perform its important function as a public watchdog.  That should not be interfered with except in the most exceptional of circumstances where some vital public or individual interests may be at stake.  I do not disagree with the points raised by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire but I am very concerned about the imported consequences of the amendment in the form of the text as it is.  This is an issue that deserves the fullest of consideration.  I do not believe we should decide it in the context of this Bill.  Therefore I will not accept the amendment now.</p></speech>

The amendment raises very important issues that go beyond the data protection measures, the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and this legislation.  The Minister's point about what is a serious offence involves a balancing of rights which are adjudicated by the courts, and as Deputy Wallace just said to me, if at some stage we did have a crusading independent media and journalist corps, it would be nice to have their interests protected, but we are a long way from that given the conduct of many journalists in front of the Charleton tribunal.  That is another story.</p></speech>

These include the right to access environmental information under the European Communities (Access to Information on the Environment) Regulations 2007 to 2014 and the European Communities (Re-Use of Public Sector Information) Regulations 2005 to 2015.  There is no good reason to refer in the Data Protection Bill 2018 only to freedom of information without also including the other major regimes accessed under those regulations.  This amendment can correct that and would be a useful addition to the Bill.</p></speech>

He has given a good account of why it has been put forward.  Section 41 deals with circumstances when a request under the Freedom of Information Act 2014 means that personal data contained in a record may be disclosed if it comes pursuant to a freedom of information request.  The objective of the amendments is to broaden the applicable statutory provisions so that they include not just the Freedom of Information Act 2014 but also the European Communities regulations on re-use of public sector information and on access to information on the environment.</p></speech>

Section 2 contains a comprehensive definition of the term.  Access rights under the Act include access to records.  Section 11 provides that every person has a right to and shall, on request, be offered access to any record held by any freedom of information body.  Section 12 also references a record.  Therefore, reference to a record appears to be right and proper.</p> <p>  On amendments Nos. 58 and 60 to 62, inclusive, I accept, subject to the advice of the Attorney General, the principle of extending the scope of the section to include the regulations of 2005 and 2007.  I have asked my officials to consult the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel with a view to ensuring the text is appropriate and does not in any way conflict with other sections.  In short, if Deputies withdraw their amendments, I will give a commitment to table an appropriate amendment on the subject on Report Stage with which I will certainly attempt to meet concerns.</p></speech>

I do not have it to hand, but I am not necessarily clear on what harm would be done if the words "contained in a record" were not included or there was a broader view on the information on a person that might be owned by a data processor or any organisation.

To be honest, I do not know why the amendments have been grouped like this, as they deal with two sections.  That probably has caused part of the confusion, about which I am sorry.  </p> <p>  Section 43 deals with providing for a general exemption from the prohibition on processing special categories of data imposed on either the controller or the subject by employment or social welfare law.  All we are trying to do is change the words "any right or obligation" to "specific rights or obligations", which would be much more in line with Article 9.  We have a little concern that it is being left too general and that it would allow special categories to be processed for reasons for which they do not need to be processed.  It is a slight change.</p></speech>

Deputy Mick Wallace has an amendment that is much the same on the matter.  I will oppose section 45.  All of its purposes are covered by Article 9 of the GDPR.  In the possible or likely event that the section is agreed to, I still believe it requires amendment.  There is a view, which I share, that section 45 creates a loophole in allowing companies from other jurisdictions to operate here.  It essentially creates a position where companies not dissimilar to Cambridge Analytica or other organisations which are mining and exploiting data in that way could operate and use data gathered here, provided they did not interfere in electoral activity in the State.  That is not covered, but it is the purpose of amendment No. 66.  I will oppose the section, but I will also press the amendment.</p></speech>

We might be deemed to be wiser to oppose it and adhere to the GDPR in full, rather than trying to shape the section.  My amendment is a fall-back position if the section is not completely opposed.  We would like to return to it on Report Stage.  Article 9 of the GDPR is very clear that the processing of political opinion is prohibited without the full and informed consent of the data subject, except in certain and very limited circumstances.  Section 45 of the Bill is a bizarre attempt to carve out an exception for the processing of political opinion that is simply not provided for in the GDPR.  We could write it into Irish law via section 45, but it would simply be superseded in any case by the GDPR.  The phrase "subject to suitable and specific measures" appears many times in the Bill and points us back to section 35, to which the Minister referred as a toolbox for processing and protecting the rights of the data subject.  Section 35 and the suitable and specific measures therein are extremely important and, in the case of the most important, lifted from various parts of the GDPR.  The section does not require explicit consent, which is optional.  Ministers do not have to use the toolkit in the section.  Section 45 is a bizarre attempt to carve exemptions to the GDPR, particularly in the light of the Cambridge Analytica story and the fundamental threat to democracy that such companies pose.</p> <p>  Removing section 45 would not affect the use of the electoral register or the work of the Referendum Commission.</p><p>Article 13 of the GDPR explains the necessary steps we should take in terms of electoral activities such as door to door canvassing to adhere to the GDPR.  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner recently published guidelines on how canvassers would have to adapt.  It will not affect polling companies or the use of focus groups or market research, only in the sense that consent will be required from the person being polled.  Obtaining this consent should not be especially difficult or onerous.  In any case, the GDPR absolutely requires the seeking of this consent, as per Article 9, in processing special categories of data such as political opinion.</p></speech>

Where any right or obligation is conferred or imposed by law, it is a specific right or obligation.  Apart from that, there is a grammatical problem because of the plural nouns "rights or obligations" being used with a singular verb.  This means that the wording would read "exercising or performing specific rights or obligations which is conferred or imposed".  For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 66 brings us back to the Seanad where I introduced amendments to ensure the processing of political opinions for electoral purposes would apply only in the course of elections within the State.  That was an issue.  Of course, the content is based on Recital (56) of the GDPR which makes it quite clear that, where in the course of electoral activities the operation of the democratic system in a member state requires political parties to compile personal data for people's political opinions, the processing of such data may be permitted for reasons to do with the public interest, provided that appropriate safeguards are established.  I am at a loss to determine the consequences of what Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire has in mind.  I do not recognise circumstances in which such personal data would be shared with a private company.  They would more likely be used during the course of an election campaign when parties were canvassing and seeking reactions to election manifestoes or questionnaires and the voting intentions of constituents.  I am not sure whether the amendment is needed and even if I were minded to accept it, I am not clear on the actors and entities involved.  I will not accept it today, but there might be scope for further debate on it.  With its current wording, I cannot accept it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-03a.86" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018050300002#F00300"><p>I wish to speak briefly to amendment No. 64.  Article 9 of the GDPR , from which the section is derived, states the processing of special categories of data in the context of employment and social welfare law is allowed as long as the "processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the controller or of the data subject" in these areas.  That is where we took the word "specific" instead of "any".  We think it is more in line with Article 9.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 66 and the section, I am in favour of the deletion of the entire section.  It was the subject of a huge amount of debate in the Seanad.  Polls, focus groups and canvass tallies will all still be allowed if the section is deleted.  All that has to happen is for consent to be gained to note somebody's political view, only if someone is planning to use it with the person's name and address or IP address in the course of one or other of these activities.  It is not really a big ask.  Notably, there was a letter yesterday in the newspapers from Digital Rights Ireland, Data Compliance Europe, Dr. T. J. McIntyre of the Faculty of Law in UCD, FP Logue Solicitors, Rossa McMahon and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  The top people in this area are warning us.  They have taken successful legal actions against the State.  Because of their knowledge, they are warning us and arguing for the removal from the section of the blanket exemptions in the processing of personal data which reveals political opinions.  That is why we are pushing to oppose the section.  The State will pay heavily if we do not delete the section.  Parties and candidates will still be able to run an analysis of election results in granular form.  They will still be able to have super sophisticated analysis of polling data.  The only things involved are personal data that can identify people in the context of their political opinions and the State would be well served by deleting the section in its entirety.</p></speech>

I know that the Minister has said the same.  I have to say his suggestion that the use of the word "is" is a reason not to support the amendment is not a strong one.  I will not support the amendment because I do not believe it would add anything to the Bill.</p> <p>  On section 45, as elected representatives, we should be supporting the political process.  Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire should be allowed to move around Cork South Central and, if he comes to a house where the individuals tell him that they will vote for him, he should be able to record that information.  He should not have to ask them whether they would mind if he was to record their names such that they would be recorded as Sinn F&eacute;in supporters.  It is completely artificial.  We need to recognise the reality.  I will not support the deletion of section 45.</p> <p>  I will not support the amendment either.  It is part of a political process that parties and candidates are entitled to identify the political opinions people hold.  Some people want to express their political opinions, while others want to keep theirs private, but at times it is an objective fact as to what is a person's political opinion.  We do not need to be so nervous about it that it has to be protected.</p></speech>

Its intention is to prohibit the gathering of data in this jurisdiction for use elsewhere.  There is a belief, which I share, that it is not currently prohibited and that it is something we should seek to do.</p> <p>  The other point made by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan and the Minister is fine, but the issue is why are we drafting a provision when all of these practices and behaviours in canvassing and making representations are provided for under the GDPR.  This is a regulation, not a directive.  Most of it has direct effect.  There is a margin of appreciation of certain provisions, but as Article 9 of the GDPR has direct effect, I do not see any need for section 45 in that context.  People have spoken about lawyers' holidays.  The greatest example will be when the GDPR and the Act will be in conflict.  Section 45 is a prime example in that regard.</p></speech>

If a really nice individual who I like comes to my door and asks me for my vote and I tell him that I will give it to him and he happens to be from Fianna F&aacute;il, I might not want it to be made public or recorded that I was actually prepared to support Fianna F&aacute;il.  Someone might want to make a call and agree to support a fellow, but I can understand that person not necessarily wanting it to be made public or recorded.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that section 47 invokes suitable and specific measures which revert to some of the safeguards provided in section 35, but Recital 52 of the GDPR makes absolutely no references to occupational pensions, for example, as is the case in respect of section 47(c) or to the mortgaging of property, as provided for in section 47(d).  This section essentially provides for exemptions from the requirement for explicit consent under the GDPR for the processing of special or sensitive categories of data.  That is fine, as long as we adhere to the possible exemptions provided for in the GDPR.  However, we are surely overstepping the mark in this section and going beyond services provided under the health insurance system, as per Recital 52 of the GDPR.  Why could consent not be sought in the instances given in section 47(c) and (d)?  Surely obtaining consent in these instances would not be too onerous or difficult.  The proposed insertions in amendment No. 70, subsection (2)(a) and (b), even stipulate that processing might take place without the consent of the data subject if the data controller could not reasonably be expected to obtain consent for whatever reason.  In other words, obtaining consent should be a reasonable step.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-03a.116" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018050300002#G04300"><p>The provisions of the GDPR provide for exemptions from the requirement for consent for processing with a view to safeguarding public health, but that is not necessarily what health insurance companies do.  The processing of health data is not necessary for the management of the health service.  It obviously has some function in that regard, but I do not think it should do so without having to ask for our permission.  For example, VHI is running a TV advertisement campaign asking members to sign up to be DNA tested by it in order that it can help an individual to find out what future ailments to which he or she might be genetically disposed, but that is not the reason it is doing it.  It is doing it in order that it can charge higher premiums to individuals who are predisposed to something that could trigger an illness later.  It wants our data in order that it can levy higher premiums.  It is not doing it for the good of the health service.  There is no reason we should give such data to it; it should have to obtain an individual's consent first.  That is all we are asking for.</p> <p>  It is an even bigger problem in the case of the banks because this allows for an exemption for the banks to process health data in the case of mortgage applications.  The Government's proposal is that the banks can do this without obtaining the consent of the person concerned.  That is ludicrous.  Everybody knows that when he or she fills in the application form for a mortgage, he or she will have to fill in numerous forms.  I do not think one of them being a consent form would be too onerous.  It woud not stop the banks or insurance companies from obtaining the information, but they would have to have our consent first.</p></speech>

The matter also arose during the preparation of legislation in a number of other member states, of which we are aware.</p> <p>  The matters referred to in section 47, paragraphs (a) to (d), inclusive, insurance or life assurance policies, pensions, annuities and mortgages, are normally the subject matters of a detailed contract between the data subject and an insurance company or a financial institution.  In order to determine contributions, it may well require obtaining information on the health of the data subject, or his or her welfare or disposition.  Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR permits the processing of non-sensitive personal data.</p><p>Article 9.2 does not permit the processing of such personal data for contractual purposes.  The question then is whether the explicit consent of the data subject in Article 9.2(a) provides a sufficiently robust ground for securing the benefits of such a contract.  The difficulty that arise relates to the strict definition of "consent" in Article 4.11 of the GDPR.  It prescribes that for the consent to be valid, it must be "freely given".  Recital 43 states that consent should not provide a valid legal ground for the processing of personal data "where there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller".  My concern, which is shared by a number of other member states, is that the insurance company or financial institution may in certain circumstances, in the absence of this section, seek to resile from the contract with the data subject on the basis that the consent of the subject could not have been freely given.  The need for the provision has been discussed and agreed with the Attorney General and I am not inclined, therefore, to accept the amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-03a.119" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1323" speakername="James Lawless" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018050300002#H00200"><p>I agree with the Minister's comments.  I worked in the insurance industry and the health insurance industry, in particular, and, therefore, I am familiar with the motivation behind the section.  Deputy Daly will be glad to know that the advertisements that the VHI or other health insurers run and any tests they may perform as regards a predisposition to various conditions and diseases under law can have no effect on the premium they charge because of community rating, which means health status and categories of illness are immaterial when it comes to premium pricing.</p> <p>  There is a difficultly with the amendments.  The Minister stated that one of the grounds for the purposes of a contract is that consent be freely given.  Life insurance has always been risk-rated as opposed to community-rated and there is a difficulty in this regard.  For instance, when completing a proposal form, one is required to outline various health conditions and information which is necessary for actuarial pricing for the performance of the contract.  Under the amendment, there is the possibility of the data subject withholding consent.  I do not know how that would work if a contract has been signed.  If a client filled out a proposal form to take out a life insurance contract and at a later stage withheld consent for the use of this information, how could a claim be processed if no one has access to the information that was the subject of the contract in the first place?  The amendments are well-intentioned but they are problematic and I do not see how they could work.  I will oppose the amendments.</p></speech>

The section replaces section 2B(1)(b)(II) of the 1988 Act.  However, the original wording of section 48 was narrower in scope than section 2B(1)(b)(II) and it did not extend to personal data in respect of criminal convictions and offences.  This is because data relating to criminal convictions and offences fall within the definition of &quot;sensitive personal data&quot; under the 1988 Act whereas it forms the subject matter for a separate Article 10 under the GDPR.  The purpose of the amendment, therefore, is to bring section 48 more fully into line with the 1988 Act.  Yesterday, I outlined some of the statutory instruments made under the corresponding section 2(B) of the 1988 Act in respect of the historic institutional abuse inquiry in Northern Ireland, the coroner's inquest into the death of Arlene Arkinson, and the coroner's inquest into the Kingsmill massacre.  The processing of personal data under those regulations could involve the processing of personal data in respect of criminal convictions or offences or the alleged commission of an offence.  These are matters of great importance and they necessitate the making of regulations to facilitate processing of sensitive personal data.  The provisions of section 48 will permit the making of similar regulations in the future where that is justified for reasons of substantial public interest such as those I have outlined.</p><p>I will not accept amendments Nos. 72 and 73 because they seek to narrow the scope of the regulation-making power under the section.  If I was to confine the scope of the section to the processing of data by public authorities in cases of urgency, it would mean that the making of regulations such as those we made to facilitate the McAleese committee and its important work would no longer be possible.  I have concerns about the content and the cumulative impact of the proposals in amendments Nos. 74 to 76, inclusive, and I am not minded to accept them.</p></speech>

The amendment relates to the processing of sensitive categories of data, which can only be done in the substantial public interest.  None of us will have a problem with the example cited by the Minister but we are concerned to head off that interpretation being stretched in the future based on the current definition.  The Sinn F&eacute;in position is similar.  We propose that regulations under the section should be examined by a body or organisation that has data protection expertise.  Amendment No. 72 provides that anybody who wants to rely on the substantial public interest ground to process special category data should be a public authority.  That is both a matter of principle and a matter of the public authorities having an obligation to appoint data protection officers.</p> <p>  We propose in amendment No. 74 that the data protection officer of the relevant public authority the Minister wants to give permission to process special category data has to conduct a privacy impact assessment on the proposal and refer it back to him or her whereupon he or she can take the findings on board and, if not, make a statement in the Houses as to why not.  Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment is similar.  Regulations would be referred in draft form to the DPC for his or her opinion and he or she would have three months to think about them and refer them back to the Minister.  If the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment is considered to be drafted appropriately, I am happy to go with it over ours.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 76 is of a piece with our amendments Nos. 96 and 111, which we discussed earlier.  It is about oversight.</p></speech>

Section 48(4) is the result of a Sinn F&eacute;in amendment that was made in the Seanad.  I have sought to refine it to take account of a point made by the Minister to tighten it up.</p><p>To identify the point exactly, rather than section 48(4)(a) seeking an impact assessment, it would be defined as an opinion.  The Minister made the point in the Seanad that the provisions would have some implications for the independence of the data protection commissioner.  This is an attempt to refine that.  Deputy Daly's amendment diverges from the existing section 48(4)(a) in part (c).  Will the Deputy explain the difference in (c) to me?</p></speech>

The Minister has given examples.  In recent days, we have seen other issues that have arisen which may result in an investigation.  That also illustrates an example of how, on occasion, the processing of personal data is necessary on the basis of substantial public interest.  I will support the Minister's amendment No. 71.  The amendments put forward by Deputies Daly, &Oacute; Laoghaire and Wallace seek to put further obstacles in the way of regulations that are to be made by the Minister under section 48.</p> <p>  We need to remember that we did something quite novel yesterday.  We introduced an amendment that requires the Minister to seek prospective approval from the Houses of the Oireachtas before he introduces these regulations, so if he decides to introduce regulations in accordance with section 48, he has to lay them before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  He has to do that because it is a form of secondary legislation.  Law is being made.  I would be concerned about handing out these regulations to get the approval of some unelected official, such as a data protection officer or another public authority that will then assess whether they think it is necessary or proportionate for laws to be made.  We keep delegating our responsibility.  Regulations and statutory instruments are a delegation of legislation.  They go to the Minister but they are still legislation, which is why, yesterday, we wanted to have prospective approval of those regulations.  I will not support putting it out to some other unelected individual who will have a process for recommending them or giving an assessment.  We, as legislators, need to say that it is our responsibility to make laws, that we will see them and if we do not like them, we can vote them down.</p></speech>

We tabled two amendments to get around the legal prohibition on us placing an obligation on the Data Protection Commissioner to do anything.  We have probably favoured Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's amendment to ours but we were worried how that might stack up in that legal context and we put them in as reserves.  I am happy enough to withdraw these for now with the option, when we look at the final draft, to see how it might fit in.  Amendment No. 76 is consequential on amendment No. 5, and, on the point that Deputy O'Callaghan made about democratic oversight, we need to get that one passed.  We are okay with withdrawing the others.</p></speech>

I take the point that Deputy O'Callaghan raised about decisions being made by the Oireachtas.  There is no provision here that ensures that the Data Protection Commissioner would take a decision.  Any decision could only be made by a Minister and now perhaps requires prospective sanction by the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  Any decision that is made by elected representatives has to be based on gathering the information available, evaluating it, and then taking the decision.  The expert in these matters will be the Data Protection Commissioner.  The commissioner's say on what additional exceptions and special categories might be required to be processed is necessary information, even with the prospective approval of the D&aacute;il.  We should have that and should be able to evaluate it.  I will not support the Minister's amendment and will press my own.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that the Seanad is more academically minded than the D&aacute;il.  I think, from time to time, that the Seanad does not have the practical experience of life that we bring as Members of the D&aacute;il.  I would not be overly exercised at the debate in the Seanad as far as this issue is concerned.  I feel that, were we to accept these amendments, it would be grossly excessive with regard to the obligation on outside bodies.  We would find it very difficult to get matters done in a way that might be regarded as efficient or timely in response to a public interest issue.</p></speech>

It should not happen frequently.  If we are talking about new special categories being taken into account and that the Minister would be able to provide for that, that should not be happening willy-nilly or frequently but should be infrequent.  One would hope that it would not happen any more often than once a year or even less often than that.  I do not see why the Data Protection Commissioner cannot match up to that job.  I do not think it is an onerous obligation.  If it is, it means that the provision is being abused and that we are looking for new special categories to be sanctioned too frequently.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-03a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018050300002#K03400"><p>I move amendment No. 84:</p><blockquote>In page 36, to delete lines 17 and 18 and substitute the following:<blockquote>&ldquo;him or her to&mdash;<blockquote>(I) make representations to the controller in relation to the decision,<br /><br />(II) request human intervention in the decision-making process,<br /><br />(III) request to appeal the decision.</blockquote></blockquote>(2) In the case of requests made under <i>subsection 1(b)(ii) </i>or <i>(iii) </i>the controller shall&mdash;<br /><br />(a) comply with the request, and<br /><br />(b) notify the data subject in writing of&mdash;<blockquote>(i) the steps taken to comply with the request, and<br /><br />(ii) in the case of an appeal under <i>section 1(b)(iii)</i>, the outcome of the appeal.&rdquo;.</blockquote></blockquote> <p>Article 22.1 of the GDPR specifically states that people should not be subjected to automated decision-making, which it describes as &quot;profiling&quot;.  The GDPR provides member states with possible exemptions and Article 22.2(b) is different from (a) and (c) in the sense that there does not seem to be a provision in (c) for a data subject's right to obtain human intervention on behalf of the controller.  I also accept the fact that section 54 of the Bill refers to suitable and specific measures and, therefore, the toolbox of safeguards.  I accept that automated decision-making might be necessary at times but we are uncomfortable with blanket, catch-all, automated decision-making.  In the Seanad debate, the Minister talked about the unintended consequences of amending this section in line with our amendment, suggesting it would facilitate wrongdoing and fraud.  Perhaps the Minister can clarify this.</p><p>One of the problems with this section of the Bill is that it is not specific in any way on the matter of automated decision-making.  It gives the power to introduce automated decision-making in a whole host of cases and we feel this may alienate certain vulnerable people from the institutions of the State.  I do not know if anybody has seen the film &quot;I, Daniel Blake&quot; by Ken Loach, which would remind one of the issue in this case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-03a.186" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018050300002#K03500"><p>Section 54 gives further effect to Article 22 of the GDPR, which deals with the automated processing of personal data including profiling.  Paragraphs 2(a) and (c) of Article 22, which have direct effect, permit automated processing, including profiling, where it is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between a data subject and a controller and where the data subject has given explicit consent.  Paragraph 2(b) of Article 22 permits such processing where it is authorised by the European Union or national law but subject to appropriate safeguards.  Recital 71 of the GDPR mentions measures to combat fraud and to monitor tax evasion, areas where such activity is relevant under national law but subject, again, to safeguards.</p><p>Section 54 makes it clear that the steps that need to be taken to safeguard the interests of the data subject must include an arrangement whereby the data subject has the opportunity to make representations on any intended decisions.  This means, in the first place, that a data subject has the information on any proposal to make such a decision and, secondly, has the opportunity to bring any concerns to the attention of the controller.</p><p> As I have said, the general data protection regulation, GDPR, mentions fraud and tax evasion as areas justifying automated processes.  It seems to me that the existing safeguards are adequate and are GDPR compliant.  The essential features of amendment No. 84 are contained in section 54.  I am not inclined to accept it.  In this regard we must ensure that our laws combating fraud and tax evasion are fully fit for purpose.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-03a.188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018050300002#L00200"><p>Article 29 of the GDPR is the god of guidance on the GDPR.  On automated processing the GDPR says that minimum safeguards must provide an explanation of the decision reached and a way for the data subject to obtain human intervention, to express his or her point of view and to contest the decision.  This Bill refers to making what are called representations.  It is not clear at what stage the data subject can make representations and there is no guarantee that he or she will get a human intervention if it is wanted.  There is no obligation on a controller in this regard.  We have to see this in the context of the fallibility of machines.  It is crucial that there needs to be a clear right for people in Ireland to get a human intervention and an appeal process for any decisions that are made by the machine.  This is what our amendment provides for.  We have to be cognisant that over the next ten years, automated decision-making is going to become much more prevalent.  There is a problem with the wording of the Bill in that the rights enshrined in the GDPR are somewhat circumscribed by this.  Unless we clearly delineate the rights now, there will be confusion and possible court cases in the future.  It is far better not to use the phrase "make representations", which is in the Bill.  If the phrase is to be used, then accept our amendment.</p></speech>

Further, it requires that the effect of any decision is either to grant a request of the data subject or that adequate steps have been taken to safeguard the interests of the data subject.  This covers the points raised by Deputy Clare Daly and therefore I am not inclined to accept amendment No. 84.</p></speech>

The Government inserted this new section in the Bill in the Seanad that says receiving direct mail from a political party or the Referendum Commission is not direct marketing, so a person has no right to object.  Essentially, it limits a person's right to object to being spammed so long as the bodies sending unsolicited mail are political parties or candidates.  Is the Government doing this to get around the freepost thing that everybody gets in an election, which is sent out by An Post?  If it is, then deal with that.  By doing it this way the legislation is just allowing any unsolicited mail from a political party or candidate to get through.  I do not believe this would be desirable.</p></speech>

This exception is based on the idea that citizens not only have rights but also obligations to inform themselves as part of their civic responsibilities.  During Seanad discussions on this Bill, Senator Norris referred in passing to his practice of sending information circulars on his parliamentary activities to the Trinity College electorate by direct mailing.  This section is intended to contribute to the formation and maintenance of an informed electorate in the State as part of our democratic system of government.  I was not minded to recall the incidents, as referred to by Deputy Clare Daly, but it is important that direct mailing be retained as part of the civic engagement.</p></speech>

We do not know who the funders are, the information is not verified and the publishers of the information are not identified.  We have a Constitution that has established that the people can elect people to the D&aacute;il.  We have a process whereby democracy manifests itself.  People might not like it and they may believe it is not democratic enough, but it is the method by which the people of Ireland elect the Government.  Unless we start standing up for the democratic structures in the State, we will expose ourselves to the threats to democracy that have had an impact in other countries.  We should not be embarrassed by the fact that candidates in an election, be they members of a political party or independent, can market themselves to tell people to vote for them.  It is an integral part of the democratic process.  The more we keep undermining ourselves and apologising for our existence, the more we undermine democracy.  We should stand up and be proud of the fact that we are politicians, that we get elected and that we represent the people.  That is the end of my party broadcast.</p></speech>

There is nothing to stop politicians continuing to mail people, every day of the week if they like.  Section 55, however, prevents a constituent from objecting to that process.  This is an entirely different matter.  While I will continue to use my Oireachtas envelopes, with which I think I am informing my constituents, if someone contacts me and gives me their name and address and objects to that, I believe the objection should be upheld.  This section removes their right to object.  It does not stop politicians from continuing to burn down the rain forest to churn out reams of paper to tell people how great we are.</p></speech>

I find it amusing that people view communications from themselves in one way but view as completely different the communications from others who are engaged in the same career path.

A thread is emerging in this debate that rather than going out and canvassing during elections or gathering data, candidates should stay behind closed doors and pray for people to vote for them.  No one is suggesting that.  We are trying to ensure that we comply with an EU law that will have a direct effect, and where people hold data around political opinions and constituents' issues, they must mind it carefully, delete it where appropriate and have proper consent for it.</p><p>In that regard, if a person repeatedly receives letters that he or she considers nuisance mail, it is reasonable for that person to have the right to say that he or she does not wish to receive such mail.  Democracy in this country is more feeble than I thought if such a right is considered a threat to it.</p></speech>

The Data Protection Act 1988 contains reference to direct marketing and direct mail.  Much of this is subjective on the part of the recipient.  All Members have seen signs stating "no junk mail" in the course of canvassing.  Such a sign is an objection in itself.  However, I recall more than one occasion on which I did not leave a leaflet but was subsequently contacted by or spoke to the householder and pointed out that I had honoured the sign declining junk mail only to be told that it did not apply to me but, rather, the other crowd.  This is merely subjective.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that the section refers to personal data rather than special categories of data such as political opinion, sexual orientation, ethnicity and so on.  However, no provision in the GDPR allows the Government to deny data subjects the right to object to the processing of personal data.  The Minister may object and state that I want to deny the Referendum Commission the ability to do its job but that would not happen with our amendment as the work of the Referendum Commission would be permitted as per Recital 69 of the GDPR and the reference therein to a compelling and legitimate interest.  The Referendum Commission is a legitimate interest under the GDPR and section 56 of the Bill makes no difference to it.  Section 56 is, therefore, unnecessary.  Surely we should have the basic right to object if our data is being processed in an inappropriate manner for election purposes.</p></speech>

A strict reading of the right to object indicates that it is subject to compelling and legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.  I believe that the effective operation of our democratic system depends on the right of those seeking or in elected political office to communicate their programmes, manifestos, policies, platforms, decisions and, often, achievements to the electorate.  There is a corresponding obligation that voters be informed in order to promote the discharge of civic duties in society.  That is the same argument as made previously.

The entities to which the Minister referred such as the Referendum Commission, political parties, political wannabes and others can rely on existing legitimate interest grounds to carry out direct mailing and so on.  These sections relate to removing a recipient's right to object.  The sections remove the existing right under the articles of the GDPR for a person who does not wish to receive spam via phone, text messages and so on to object to that.  The arguments being used to justify the section are neither valid nor accurate.  We stand over our opposition to the section.</p></speech>

I am aware that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire is opposing the section, and Deputy Wallace and I support him in that regard.  However, on the basis of the debate on the section in the Seanad, we did not think that approach would be heard or accepted and have, therefore, taken a harm mitigation approach.  However, we support Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire on the section other than in that regard.</p><p>As discussed in regard to amendment No. 6, section 57 allows for the restriction of rights under various articles for the purpose of so-called important objectives in the public interest.  Amendment No. 85 proposes to change the rights which can be restricted under the section to those outlined in Articles 12 to 21 of the GDPR rather than Articles 12 to 22.  It is not a major change but would mean that people would have the right not to be subjected to automated decision making or profiling under any circumstances under the section, which is important.  The British legislation on this matter includes a provision similar to that which we are proposing and it is important in that regard.</p><p>On amendment No. 90, as previously mentioned, section 57 proposes that the Minister would have wide discretion in limiting the rights of persons under Articles 12 to 22 in respect of certain circumstances that are united under the vague banner of being in the general public interest.</p><p>The section also proposes to give the Minister wide discretion in limiting the rights of persons if he or she believes it is necessary to do so for the protection of the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others to do so.  While this provision appears to be fair, the section does not include an obligation on the Minister to balance the rights and freedoms of data subjects with the rights and freedoms of others in circumstances in which he proposes to restrict the right of access to information under this section.  I am concerned that the provisions under this section could be used to deny adopted persons' requests for information about where they come from on the basis that another party is involved.  To oblige the Minister to balance rights would not be a great imposition.  It is important that he should be obliged to do so.</p><p>This ties in with amendment No. 90 where the Minister also has the power to limit the rights of data subjects in respect of personal data kept for or obtained in the course of the carrying out of social work by a public body.  On the face of it, this appears to be vaguely acceptable.  However, if one scratches a little deeper, it becomes obvious that the restriction of rights could and, given the history of the State, probably would be used to refuse information to adopted children about their natural parents.  If this is not the Minister's intention, I ask him to review these provisions and improve the wording.  As matters stand, I propose to press the amendment. </p><p> Amendments Nos. 92 and 94 limit the Minister's right to invent a new public interest objective with a view to restricting rights.  The key word in this context is "indicative".  The 14 objectives listed are only some of the public interest objectives the Minister may use as a basis for restricting rights.  A Minister can, at any time, add to these objectives without consulting elected representatives.  As matters stand, restrictions of rights could be justified on any basis.  Data centres, for example, have been justified on the basis that they are crucial and in the public interest.  Given that a caveat could be applied in respect of anything, it is necessary to introduce some checks and balances.  For this reason, we propose to restrict the public interest objectives by providing that a Minister who wants to designate an objective that is not already listed in the Bill as one that is of general public interest will be required to submit the proposal to the Oireachtas for approval.  The amendment introduces a check on the Minister's powers in this regard. </p><p> Amendment No. 95 requires the Minister to consult the Data Protection Commission before making regulations and present to the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality his rationale should he ignore the advice of the commission.  In that respect, the amendment is in line with previous amendments. </p></speech>

The purpose of section 57 is to protect the public and other objectives of general public interest.  I state categorically that it does not restrict, nor will it be used to restrict, the data protection rights of citizens.  For example, the Medical Council or the Property Services Regulatory Authority may have good reason to investigate a doctor or estate agent on foot of a complaint by a patient or client alleging unfitness to practice or otherwise.  If the data protection rights of the individuals in question are not restricted on a temporary basis while the complaint is investigated, the doctor or estate agent could apply to have his or her data rectified, restricted or erased in certain circumstances.  Any of these actions would put pay to an investigation, which would be to the detriment of the complainant and the regulatory body charged with supervision.</p><p>Regulations made under this section will permit regulatory bodies to carry out their statutory obligations to conduct inquiries or investigate complaints in the knowledge that those being investigated will not be permitted to exercise data subject rights in a manner that could jeopardise the regulatory body's performance of its statutory functions.  Persons under investigation will not be permitted to exercise rights to rectification or erasure of their personal data while the investigations are ongoing.  I say this against the background of the importance of meeting the conditions set out in Article 23 of the general data protection regulation in the text of section 57. </p><p>Subsections (1) and (2) give effect to the introductory text of Article 23.1 of the GDPR.  Subsection (3) restricts the exercise of data subject rights.  These are important issues and include Cabinet confidentiality and parliamentary privilege.  We need to be mindful of many examples, including in the context of protected disclosures and other whistleblowing activity.</p><p>Amendment No. 86 is a drafting amendment that substitutes revised text for subsection (2).  Amendment No. 87 removes reference to judicial independence and court proceedings from subsection (3)(<i>a</i>)(i), while amendments Nos. 194 to 196, inclusive, make more detailed provision for restrictions on the exercise of data subject rights in the case of courts acting in their judicial capacity.  Amendment No. 89 inserts reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General alongside the Data Protection Commission and Information Commissioner.  This will protect investigations and inquiries undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the performance of his or her constitutional and statutory functions.  </p><p>As regards other amendments, my position is as follows.  While I cannot accept amendment No. 85, which is not in line with Article 23 of the GDPR, I can accept amendment No. 88 tabled by Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace.  Amendment No. 90 is unnecessary in light of the requirement in subsection (10) that any regulations must &quot;respect the essence of the right to data protection and protect the interests of the data subject&quot;.  I cannot accept amendment No. 91, which seeks to delete subsection (5)(<i>b</i>), nor can I accept amendment No. 92, which seeks to limit the scope of &quot;important objectives of general public interest&quot; contrary to Article 23.1(e) of the GDPR.  As regards amendment No. 94, it repeats the content of the existing subsection (8) and paragraph (<i>b</i>) duplicates the content of subsection (11).  For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.  I will accept amendment No. 95.</p><p>Amendment No. 97 would, if accepted, breach the GDPR insofar as the controller or processor is responsible for carrying out impact assessments.  This is not a task for the data protection authority, not least because it would erode the authority's independence, which is important in the context of the legislation.  As I stated in respect of section 48, the cumulative effect of the provisions proposed would be excessive and disproportionate.  The making of regulations could take six, eight or nine months or perhaps longer.  There are circumstances in which we would find that to be less than acceptable.  In view of the issues I have outlined, I will not accept amendment No. 97.</p></speech>

While it is important to protect the public interest, it can often be used by organisations, agencies and government to make decisions that suit their objectives at a particular time.  Articles 9 and 145 of the GDPR specifically cover these matters.  In the absence of a proper definition of public interest and in view of the wide powers and discretion provided for the Minister under this section, I will oppose the section and support the amendments proposed by Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace.</p></speech>

If regulations are going to be made under section 57, the Minister is going to have to lay them before the Oireachtas for prospective approval.  The Minister did not mention his own amendment, amendment No. 87.  Will he tell us why he is removing judicial independence as one of the important objectives of general public interest?  Is it because the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has asked him to do so?  Perhaps not.  I would be interested to hear the logic behind that provision.</p> <p>  I am interested in amendment No. 92, proposed by Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace.  Subsection (7) of section 57 sets out important objectives of general public interest referred to in subsection (6).  It is better to have it slightly vague so that paragraphs (a) to (n) are not exclusive and that one can go beyond them.  The way this could be challenged in court, we could have a large corporation challenging regulations that have been made by the Minister and approved by the Oireachtas.  If it is the case that subsection (7) states that the important objectives can only include (a) to (n), that is a good opportunity for them to say the regulations are not valid because they do not come within that list.  On balance, we are better off not limiting the scenarios pursuant to which general public interest can be identified.  It is very broad.  If we limit it, there may be a situation that we have not envisaged whereby regulations in respect of public interest are introduced.</p> <p>  A lot of the time here, we are thinking of situations that will arise where a villainous Minister is issuing regulations supported by an oppressive Government and the rest of us are trying to oppose them.  The reality is that it will be large corporations trying to challenge regulations that have been brought in by the State.</p> <p>  I will be supporting amendment No. 95.  Amendment No. 96 is effectively provided for because of amendment No. 5.  I do not think it is necessary for that reason.  Amendment No. 97 is proposed by Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire.  I would make the same point again.  It is legislation that is being made by way of regulation although it is referred to as secondary legislation.  We should do it.  I understand Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's point.  We are not farming it out to the Data Protection Commissioner.  We should make our decision based on what we view as being in the public interest.  The elected Members of the Oireachtas are much more in tune with what is or is not in the public interest than any statutory body established by us.</p></speech>

It provides that, "The rights and obligations ... are restricted to the extent that the restrictions are necessary and proportionate to safeguard judicial independence and court proceedings."  This amendment is in respect of section 156, which we will address later on.</p></speech>

Section 65 is technical.  Its purpose is to carry over certain regulations already made under the 1988 Act and thereby obviate the need to remake regulations under this Bill.  I dare say the amendments are non-controversial.</p></speech>

The intention is to ensure the controller retains overall control over the processing chain, especially where the processor needs to obtain the assistance of a sub-processor.  A very simple example is where, for example, the Garda, acting as a controller, obtains documents in a foreign language and transmits them to a translation service, which would be a processor, for translation into the English language.  If that translation service does not have the necessary expertise to translate the particular language into English, it may need to obtain the services of another service with the necessary translation expertise, which would be the sub-processor.  The proposed amendments to section 77 are technical in nature, but the intention is simply to ensure the controller which in my example is the Garda retains control over the personal data contained in the documents.  That will enable it to retain control over the data and facilitate the exercise of data subject rights.  It will also enable it to demonstrate compliance with the requirements in Part 5 of the Bill to the Data Protection Commission if called upon by the commission to do so.  A possible Report Stage amendment is being considered with regard to determining the controller-processor relationship between the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the prosecuting counsel on behalf of the State.</p></speech>

Section 84(1) deals with situations where a personal data breach occurs and is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of a data subject.  In such cases, the controller shall provide him or her with the details of the breach.  I wish to add that if a data subject requests information in regard to a personal breach which affects him or her, he or she has a right to be provided with all of the pertinent information in respect of that breach.  It would provide a statutory basis for people being given information without having to write to the Data Protection Commissioner or go to court.

As I mentioned in the Seanad when dealing with a similar amendment, I am unable to accept an amendment which would insert a new subsection (9) in section 84.</p> <p>  Under section 84 there is already an obligation on a controller to inform a data subject where there is a high risk to the data subject's rights and freedom arising from a breach.  In such a case, the controller, in clear and plain language, must notify the data subjects of the nature of the breach, its likely consequences and a description of the measures taken or proposed to be taken to mitigate its possible adverse effects.  The proposed amendment refers to a data breach which affects a data subject.  It is far from clear what it is intended to mean.  Under the GDPR and the law enforcement directive, the thresholds for informing the Data Protection Commissioner of a data breach and informing the data subject whose data protection rights have been breached are defined in terms of risks for the data subject arising from the breach.</p> <p>  If a data breach involves a high risk for the data subject, then the data subject must be given all relevant information and may require further information.  I should add that acceptance of the amendment would also create a confusing and perhaps even undesirable divergence between the reporting thresholds in the section and the corresponding provision in the GDPR.  I know where Deputy O'Callaghan is coming from, but I am somewhat concerned that we would be making matters less certain.  For those reasons, I am not minded to accept the amendment.  Perhaps the Deputy would like to think about it further.</p></speech>

Obviously, my concern is that under section 84(1), a data subject is only entitled to be given information in respect of a breach where that breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of a data subject.  Somebody who has breached a person's data rights will be able to justify not giving him or her the information on the basis that there was no high risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject.  I will re-examine the issue for Report Stage.  The way to deal with it may be to table an amendment to section 84(1) rather than inserting a new subsection.</p></speech>

The revised wording is closer to the text of paragraph 2 of Article 32 of the directive.  I will briefly refer to the other amendments at this stage. </p><p>I recognise the intent on the part of Deputies Daly and Wallace in respect of amendment Nos. 120 to 123, inclusive.  They wish to bring the content of the section into line with the corresponding provision in the GDPR.  While the directive does not contain or require the same level of detail, I will consider the matter with a view towards a Report Stage amendment if the Deputies withdraw their amendments today.  I know what they are trying to achieve, but I do not want to have different consequences.</p><p>I see the reasoning of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire but I cannot accept amendment No. 124 because it deals with the risk that a data protection officer might encounter non-co-operation, harassment, duress or even victimisation in the workplace as a result and would no longer be in a position to perform his or her duties.  We considered that matter during the Seanad discussions in the context of a similar amendment.  I am strongly of the view that a more effective remedy is already available to data protection officers under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and that it is better that we address these issues under that Act rather than introduce them into data protection.</p></speech>

They might make protected disclosures to bring themselves within the scope of this Bill.  We think it would be preferable to avoid the need for them to artificially bring themselves under the protected disclosures legislation if they could get protection under this Bill.  That is what we are trying to do.</p> <p>  Part of the confusion is that Part 5 is a new Bill.  A second Bill has been inserted into the Bill to give effect to the criminal justice directive.  Due to the fact that the GDPR does not apply to the criminal justice system, not everything is transposed and so on.  We are trying to give data protection officers specific protection against victimisation and being penalised for doing their job.  We are allowed to go beyond the directive.  That is what we are trying to do and it is necessary because by going beyond the directive we are bringing them in line with the GDPR.  That is all that is being sought.  We will withdraw the amendment, but if the Minister does not address the issue at a later Stage with something better we will come back with this.</p></speech>

The organisation he or she is responsible for may not be complying properly with data protection or may be abusing or misusing people's data or being careless in some respect.  One can see how it would be in the interests of the data controller to frustrate, victimise or harass a data protection officer.  That is very apparent.</p> <p>  I appreciate there is the Protected Disclosures Act, but that could be a cumbersome mechanism in some respects.  If this all relates to data I do not see how a data protection officer could not say to the Data Protection Commissioner that he or she has an issue with data protection in the organisation in which he or she works and is being frustrated by his or her superior, that is, the data controller and is seeking an intervention and assessment.  That is reasonable.  There are probably a number of ways that could be done.  The existing subsection on corrective powers could be used to facilitate that. </p> <p>  I will press my amendment, but I will not call a vote.  I would appreciate if the Minister could consider that.  There must be another mechanism beyond the protected disclosure legislation which would be potentially cumbersome and probably quite slow.</p></speech>

I am satisfied that it provides an effective remedy where a data protection officer is experiencing difficulty in the performance of his or her functions.</p><p>An important thing to take into account is the fact that a data protection officer who makes such a protected disclosure would enjoy the extensive protections against dismissal and against victimisation or any form of loss or detriment which is provided specifically under Part 3 of the 2014 Act.

No. 125:</p><blockquote>In page 68, line 32, after &ldquo;concerned&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, including the legal basis for any transfers of data&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>With these amendments, we are adding two points of information to the list in section 88(2) that data subjects have a right to get from data controllers.  Most of the items of information in subsection (2), such as information on controller's contact details and the right to lodge a complaint, are replicated in the GDPR and the directive but two of them, namely, the legal basis for any transfers and such further information as is necessary to enable the data subject to exercise his or her rights, which are in the GDPR, have not been included in this Bill.  I understand that they are not specified in the directive but, unlike the GDPR, we can go beyond it to strengthen people's rights in this area.  That is what we are trying to do.</p><p>Amendment No. 126 proposes that the obligation regarding legal transfers will only apply in individual cases where further information is necessary to enable the data subject to exercise his or her rights.</p></speech>

It is slightly different as the GDPR Article 13.2(f) gives people the right to be given information about the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling.  The right is not replicated in the directive or this Bill and we think it is no harm to put it in there as it could be valuable.  The directive prohibits automated processing, including profiling, that results in discrimination.  To enforce the right not to be profiled in a discriminatory way, a data subject has to know they have been subjected to automated processing.  To know that, he or she would have to be told about it when he or she exercised his or her right to access information under section 89.  At the moment, section 89 does not oblige controllers to inform people of the fact that they have been profiled or subjected to automated processing.</p> <p>  This section is in Part 5, which means we are talking about the potential profiling of innocent people in a discriminatory way by the Garda.  We know that ethnic profiling has taken place, so we are trying to provide that a person who asks for information about what the Garda has been up to with his or her data will get the information they need.</p></speech>

Rights relating to automated data processing, including profiling, are set out directly in Article 11 of the directive and in section 87 of the Bill.</p> <p>  I am reluctant to accept amendment No. 125, which proposes to insert a specific reference to the legal basis for any transfers of personal data in section 88.  The existing reference to the legal basis for processing the data includes reference to transfers because of the wide definition of processing in section 66.  In accordance with the definition in section 66, it is clear that processing includes the disclosure of data by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making the data available.  This would include the transfer of personal data.  My concern is that the inclusion of a specific reference to transfers of data in this section could well cast doubt on its usage, validity or application in other parts of the Bill.  Subsection (2)(f)(iii) requires that information be given on categories of recipients, and this includes recipients in third countries and in international organisations.</p> <p>  I will not accept amendment No. 125 and amendment No. 126 is not needed.  In respect of amendment No. 127, section 89 refers to Article 14 of the directive.</p></speech>

For that reason, I will support amendment No. 125.  I also think amendment No. 126 is appropriate.  The Minister's only objection to it is that it is not needed.  That may be the case but I do not see any harm in replicating it, notwithstanding the fact that it is referred to previously.  If there is any legal doubt over it, the fact that it is expressly contained in section 88 will be of assistance to the person who is seeking information.</p> <p>  I will not support amendment No. 127 as it is too vague.  It refers to looking for information relating to the logic involved, but it is very difficult to get a definition of logic in statutes.</p></speech>

I will focus on the key amendments.  As regards Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's amendment No. 137 and Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment No. 138, both of which would replace section 107(1), I have a serious problem with the introduction of a discretion on the part of the commission not to investigate a complaint that is "frivolous or vexatious."</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 139, 144, 159, 160, 164 would also allow the commission to decide not to investigate complaints on the basis that they were considered to be frivolous or vexatious.  I am completely opposed to the introduction of this discretionary filter into the Bill for a number of reasons.  First, it would not be compliant with the GDPR.  Second, while the term "frivolous or vexatious" has a specific meaning in our law when used by the courts, that is, that the claim is unsustainable in law and is bound to fail, the term is not understood in other member states, except possibly in a common law jurisdiction such as the UK.  On the contrary, to a data subject or a data protection authority in another member state, use of the word "frivolous" suggests that the matter is not regarded as sufficiently serious for investigation, while "vexatious" suggests that the complaint is seen as a deliberate intention to cause annoyance.  The scope for such misunderstandings will be much greater under the "one-stop-shop" mechanism because the data protection commission will be acting as lead supervisory authority in many cross-border cases.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, the term "frivolous and vexatious" is used in section 10(1)(b) of the 1988 Act and it has created confusion and misunderstandings in recent years, especially in cross-border cases.  In the Schrems judgment, Judge Hogan commented that the wording of that provision "is somewhat unfortunate and perhaps even unhelpful".  Its use was widely misinterpreted and misunderstood in the aftermath of that case in which Mr. Schrems successfully contested the adequacy of the safe harbour mechanism.  His original complaint concerning the shortcomings of the safe harbour mechanism had been rejected on the grounds that it was frivolous or vexations, that is, unsustainable in law because of the European Commission's decision to recognise the adequacy of privacy safeguards provided by the safe harbour mechanism.</p> <p>  The risk therefore of misinterpretation or misunderstanding will be very much greater in future because of the expected increase in the number of "one-stop-shop" cases handled by the data protection commission, which have originated in other member states.  As I said, I cannot accept the alternative models put forward in the amendments to the complaints-handling mechanisms in Chapters 2 and 3 of Part 6.  I ask for the understanding and support of the committee in the avoidance of any reference to the term "frivolous and vexatious".  I believe that the robustness and effectiveness of the mechanisms outlined in Part 6 will be compromised by the introduction of a filter based on the commission's opinion as to whether a complaint it has received is "frivolous or vexations".</p> <p>  As regards amendments Nos. 140 and 161, a reference to consent of the parties is not required because an amicable resolution cannot take place without the consent of the parties in any event.</p><p>On section 108, I am not in favour of replacing reference to 107(5)(<i>e</i>) with a general reference to section 107(1) as proposed by amendment No. 147, where a complaint, following an examination by the commission under section 107(1), has been rejected or dismissed under 107(5)(<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>), a data subject has a specific right to appeal against that decision under section 148(<i>a</i>).  Where the commission, following an examination of a complaint, has already issued an enforcement notice on the controller or processor in any of the situations referred to in section 107, the carrying out of a further inquiry would be unnecessary.  The same applies where a data subject has been provided with advice by the commission, for example, where a data subject is seeking compensation and the commission explains that compensation remains a matter for the courts.<br/><br/>Amendments Nos. 149 and 170, which seek to insert new sections into the Bill, contain provisions that are taken from surrounding sections without deletion of those provisions.  This would give rise to confusion and legal uncertainty.  I cannot accept the amendments as drafted but I am happy to come back to them on Report Stage.The word &quot;where&quot; is correct and is consistent with usage throughout the Bill.  I cannot accept amendment No. 171.<br/><br/>In summary, sections 107, 108, 120 and 121 of the Bill provide, in my view, a coherent and streamlined approach to the future handling of complaints by the Data Protection Commission and I am not disposed to accepting amendments that would militate against that coherence or streamlined frame that is envisaged under the Bill.</p></speech>

As mentioned by the Minister, the words "frivolous" and "vexatious" are frequently used in respect of cases which fail to reach a fairly low threshold.  I note what the Minister says but it appears to me that as things stand in the Bill there is greater discretion and flexibility than would be the case were amendments Nos. 137 and 138 accepted, in regard in particular to the requirement for a formal decision, which, I think, is important.</p></speech>

The intention was to give the commission some leeway to reject complaints that appeared to be frivolous or vexatious.  I appreciate the Minister's point that this has a legal connotation.  I am happy if the Minister commits to look at this again on Report Stage.  I think some mechanism and statutory power needs to be given to the commission to allow it deal with complaints that it believes do not merit extensive investigation.  If this is not done, the commission will be bogged down in that it will have to investigate every complaint made, irrespective of how small it is and irrespective of the cost of any investigation in that regard.  The investigating commission should be given the power to reject complaints which appear to be unlikely to succeed or disclose no cause of action.</p></speech>

I am anxious to ensure that the provisions of Part 6 are not compromised by the introduction of a new layer in terms of whether a complaint is frivolous or vexatious.  I am conscious that there are different interpretations and different understandings in this regard.  However, I will take another look at the amendments.  I do not want to overestimate what is a real problem.  Given the manner of interpretation of words such as this I am concerned.  It is within this framework that I would be happy to discuss the matter further.  I am happy to listen further to Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire and Deputy O'Callaghan, as always.</p> <p>  I beg leave of the committee at this point as I have an important meeting to attend at 5 p.m., for which I am already late.

I would like to speak to amendments Nos. 155 to 158, inclusive.  Section 115(7) of the Bill as drafted permits not-for-profit bodies such as, for example, Digital Rights Ireland, to bring an action on behalf of a data subject when it has been mandated by the data subject to do so.  However, as argued by Dr. T.J. McIntyre during the pre-legislative scrutiny process, the Bill should provide that not-for-profit bodies also be allowed to independently bring actions without their having to be mandated by an individual data subject to do so.  Amendment No. 155 seeks to remedy this.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, will explain why the Bill excludes this as I understand Article 80 includes this possibility as a discretionary provision, although in such cases compensation for damages would not be awarded unless the Article 80 body was specifically mandated by a data subject to bring the action.</p><p> Amendment No. 156 is an attempt to address the lack of provision in the Bill for a not-for-profit body of the type described in Article 80 of the GDPR, for example, Digital Rights Ireland, to bring an action for compensation for damages on behalf of a data subject.  I do not understand why this is prohibited.  Dr. T.J. McIntyre made a compelling case for it during the pre-legislative scrutiny phase.  He said that, without it, there would be a gap in protection for data subjects.  We must remember that when a data subject seeks to take a case for a data breach or violation of his or her data rights, he or she would in many instances be forced to discuss sensitive personal data publicly.  Therefore, many people would be reluctant to come forward and become the public face of an issue.  There is also the fact that many, if not most, individuals affected would not have the financial ability to bring an action themselves.  Class actions are not permitted in Ireland as of yet.  If a large number of people are affected by a single data breach, it makes sense on a practical level that they could be represented by a single Article 80 body instead of them taking cases individually, which the courts would not be equipped to handle.  Surely it would make sense that Digital Rights Ireland, for example, should be allowed to act on behalf of such people if it is mandated to do so, as the GDPR permits, without taking the possibility of compensation off the table for complainants.</p></speech>

Section 115 makes provision for a judicial remedy in the case of infringements of the GDPR.  Article 80.2 of the GDPR recognises that a member state may allow in its national laws for a not-for-profit body, association or organisation to take action on behalf of a data subject without the data subject's mandate.  However, that is not part of our law and compliance with the GDPR does not require such a provision.</p> <p>  The restrictions in the Bill on the taking of compensation claims by a not-for-profit body, association or organisation is understandably intended to discourage speculative compensation claims, especially where the data subject will be relieved of any risk that costs of the action might be awarded against him or her.  There are sound public policy reasons for discouraging the growth of a compensation culture in respect of data protection claims, which is reflected in the Bill's provisions.  As Deputy Wallace may be aware, there is already concern at the level of compensation claims, which is contributing to increasing insurance premiums and affecting business, especially SMEs.  I am very conscious of this matter when I wear my other ministerial hat.</p> <p>  I cannot accept subsection (8) as proposed in amendment No. 155 or subsection (9) as proposed in amendment No. 157.  The same applies to amendment No. 136, which seeks to make provision for the taking of action on behalf of a data subject without a mandate, or permission, from him or her.  Deputy Wallace referred to amendment No. 156.  I cannot accept it, as it would allow courts to award compensation to data subjects in cases taken under section 115 by a not-for-profit body, association or organisation on their behalf.</p> <p>  Regarding amendment No. 158, the position is that Article 55 of the directive, unlike the GDPR, does not provide for actions to be taken on behalf of data subjects without their permission.  For this reason, I cannot accept the amendment, which would allow a not-for-profit body, association or organisation to take action on behalf of a data subject under section 118 without his or her permission.  This is understandable, given that the data subject might have specific reasons for not wishing the case to be taken.</p> <p>  I cannot accept the proposed changes in amendments Nos. 172 and 173 to section 126 for the reasons already outlined in respect of the GDPR.  That being the case, amendment No. 190, which proposes to amend section 146(1) in order to accommodate the withdrawal of complaints by a not-for-profit body, association or organisation that has not been mandated to act on behalf of a data subject, is not required.</p></speech>

The consequence of it would be that, if someone's data were breached and he or she did not want to make a complaint or take an action, a not-for-profit body could take an action on his or her behalf.  It is very unusual in Irish law that someone might be able to take an action or make a complaint on behalf of an individual when the individual has not mandated that such a complaint would be made.  Before a court, it would probably be struck out on grounds of lacking<i>locus standi</i>.  It is a well-intentioned amendment, but I am concerned that a not-for-profit body could bring the complaint or take the action without permission.  Significant legal costs will be associated with that.  A not-for-profit body can hire lawyers to take the case who will cost a considerable amount of money and the financial cost to the data breacher would be significant.</p><p>Obviously, there must be a remedy, but given that this provision is so unusual and I do not believe that a not-for-profit body should be in a position to take an action on behalf of a person who does not want it taken, I would be slow to support the amendment.</p></speech>

When a draft report is prepared by an authorised officer on foot of his or her investigation under section 137 of this Bill, fair procedure rules require the contents of that report to be shared with the controller or processor concerned for any representation that he or she may wish to make.  The authorised officer is required to have regard to any such representations.  This, of course, does not necessarily require changes to the report.  The same considerations apply where the report is submitted to the commission for its consideration and for a decision under section 138.  I fear that the sharing of a draft report with a complainant - an individual, or a not-for-profit body, organisation or association acting on his or her behalf &ndash; could provide very strong grounds for a later challenge to the validity of any decision reached by the commission and to any corrective action or fine it imposes on the controller or processor concerned.  If significant sanctions, especially administrative fines, are to be imposed, it will be important to ensure high standards of due process and the integrity and independence of the investigative process are maintained throughout the investigation and adjudication process.  Specific references to these aspects of the matter are included Articles 58.4 and 83.8 of the GDPR.  For these reasons, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 181 to 184, inclusive.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, section 137 links the draft report and the final report.  I will wait to hear what Deputy Wallace has to say.</p></speech>

I will come back to this matter on Report Stage.  I think the complainant should be given some access to a final report.  Perhaps the Minister of State will try to consider that in advance of Report Stage.  I can understand why a complainant might not be entitled to a draft report, but I see no basis for providing that a complainant should not be entitled to the final report.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the processor or controller is entitled to look at a draft report and point out what is wrong with it in advance of the completion of the final report.  Rather than pushing these amendments now, I will consider them again in advance of Report Stage.  I ask the Minister of State to do likewise in order to provide for a complainant to have access to a final investigation report.</p></speech>

The proposed new subsection (4) provides that the commission will issue a notice requiring payment of a fine within 28 days of its decision to impose the fine.  The proposed new subsection (5) requires the controller or processor concerned to comply with such a notice.  The proposed new subsection (6) provides for the payment of any fines into the Exchequer.  Amendment No. 188 corrects an incorrect reference to section 139 in section 140.  I assure Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire that the issue at the heart of amendment No. 187, in his name - the recovery of any profits made by a controller or processor because of infringements - is dealt with in Article 83.2(k) of the GDPR.  It provides that when determining the amount of any administrative fine, the data protection authority shall have regard to &quot;financial benefits gained, or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, from the infringement&quot;.  I thank Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire for his amendment, but I think the matter is adequately covered already in Article 83 of the GDPR.</p></speech>

Having re-read the Government's draft, I believe subsection (5) is probably better than the my proposed subsection (5) as the former provides for a broader ground upon which a decision can be appealed.  Anyone affected by the decision can appeal, whereas in the amendment the decision can be appealed only by the person concerned.  On that basis, I will withdraw the amendment.</p><p>I will pursue amendment No. 193.  A decision of the Data Protection Commission can be appealed to the Circuit Court and High Court.  The Government proposes that a person may only appeal a decision to the High Court if he or she obtains the leave of the court.  The amendment proposes to remove the words &quot;by leave of that court&quot; to give persons an entitlement to have their case heard by a High Court judge having taken a case to the Circuit Court.</p></speech>

This is a standard provision in legislation of this kind and it will ensure that a further appeal on the merits of the case does not take place.  For this reason, I cannot accept amendment No. 193.</p></speech>

However, a person must obtain the leave of the relevant court.  Obviously in such circumstances, the judge who heard the case will not have found in favour of the plaintiff.  The person who takes the case should be able to appeal.  As matters stand, the judge who rejected his or her case can also refuse to allow an appeal.</p></speech>

We will not ask members to attend at 9 a.m. on that date.  Deputy Clare Daly can sleep in that morning.  However, we will address this short Bill as a single item at 4.45 p.m. that afternoon.  I hope the time works for members, the Minister and Deputies R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall and Catherine Murphy, who are the proposers. </p><p> The joint committee will meet at 9 a.m. next Wednesday, 9 May, in the normal way of our business.  The following Wednesday, 16 May, the select committee will meet at 4.45 p.m.</p></speech>
