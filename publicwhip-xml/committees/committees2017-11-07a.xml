    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-07a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Gleeson" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017110700002#T00300"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it today on developments in relation to the future of the Common Agricultural Policy.  With a view to framing the discussion, it might be useful to remind ourselves of the contribution of the CAP to the citizens of Europe and of Ireland.  Within the EU, the farming and the food sectors provide employment for 44 million people.  Ireland's agrifood sector employs more than 173,000 people, or 8.6% of total employment, and accounts for approximately 7.6% of GDP.  This employment is largely rural based and contributes to the survival of rural and coastal communities, where alternative employment may not readily be available.</p><p>The agrifood sector is Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous sector, contributing &euro;26 billion in turnover, with an economic multiplier that exceeds that of other manufacturing industries because most of its inputs are indigenous.  Total agrifood exports in 2016 were &euro;12.2 billion.  This is a 56% increase since 2009, so agrifood was resilient through a period of extreme difficulty in the Irish economy.  The raw material for this vital sector is produced by approximately 129,000 farm families, and their activities are supported by the EU's Common Agricultural Policy.  The 2016 Teagasc national farm survey indicates that CAP supports account for 75% of family farm income on average, with a range from 37% in dairying to 113% in cattle rearing farms.</p><p> In addition to this, CAP, through the rural development programme, funds a range of activities to improve competitiveness and efficiency, and improve technology adoption on farms.  It also supports farmers who engage in the public good of positive environmental actions, such as nutrient management, retention of biodiversity, better breeding policy, protection of watercourses and the planting of hedgerows.  Within the period of the current multiannual financial framework, Ireland is projected to receive &euro;12 billion from CAP, with &euro;10.7 billion, or approximately 85%, in respect of Pillar I direct payments and Pillar II rural development payments.</p><p> We have now reached the point, following the reform in 2013, where it is necessary to look at the development of the policy that will bring us beyond 2020.  With this in mind, the Commission opened a public consultation online on 2 February 2017.  This ran for 12 weeks up to 2 May 2017.  What is most remarkable about this consultation is that of 322,000 replies received, only 7% of respondents described themselves as being involved in farming, which shows CAP is a policy in which the EU citizens who fund it take a significant interest.  Some of the themes that emerged from the consultation included public support for the need for CAP to deliver more benefits for the environment and climate change, the need for direct income support for farmers, the need to improve farmers' positions in the value chain, and to support investment in restructuring and innovation.</p><p> I want to turn briefly to issues related to the funding of any future CAP.  Earlier this year, the budget Commissioner published a reflection paper on the future of the EU finances.  The paper is a prelude to financial framework proposals expected to emerge from the Commission in mid-2018.  It acknowledges the likely pressure on EU finances arising from the departure of one of the Union's larger net contributors, and the emergence of new priorities, such as migration and security.  Against this background, it outlines five scenarios for future funding.  Four of these would involve either a reduced overall budget or a reduced share for CAP or both.  While this is a reflections paper only and not a proposal, it seems clear that the financial background against which discussions on the reform of CAP take place will be challenging.</p><p> I will turn now to a specific reflection on the future of CAP.  Many committee members are aware of a document believed to have been leaked from the Commission on 19 October.  The document is entitled "The Future of Food and Farming", and it outlines a range of principles and some specific proposals on the shape of a new CAP.  I want to be clear that the document has no official status whatsoever.  It is a leaked document.  The extent to which its content will be reflected in the final communication is therefore unclear.  Even if it were clear, the detail in the Commission communication will only be the starting point for a complex negotiation with member states.  It is, nonetheless, a useful vehicle for framing a discussion on the future of CAP.  In brief, the leaked document proposes a simpler CAP, with significantly more flexibility for member states and a sharper focus on objectives and results, particularly in the environmental area.</p><p>Some of the major themes include greater simplification; a commitment to a streamlined CAP, with reduced bureaucracy and administrative burden for farmers and member states; more subsidiarity; greater freedom for member states to implement CAP in a manner that suits their climatic and environmental conditions, with basic policy parameters and objectives laid down at EU level; a smarter CAP, with a focus on knowledge transfer, innovation and technology adoption; continued support for farm incomes; a continued commitment to EU funded direct payments, with a further move towards capping of direct payments, average support rates across the European Union and better support for small farmers - these are issues on which it is stated we need to reflect and as such not exactly proposals but food for thought.</p><p> Other themes include continued support for investment and financial instruments; support for farm investments for modernisation and diversification, including in new opportunities in bio and circular economy and climate friendly energy production; and better risk management.  We know that some of our sectors have been affected by dramatic price volatility in global markets in recent years and the document refers to an integrated approach to risk management, combining EU level interventions with member state strategies and private sector instruments with different types of instruments tailored to regional and sectoral needs.  The document also refers to more results based and relevant sustainability measures, which puts the flexibility back to member states in that they are required to define measures and targets to meet environmental and climate objectives laid down at EU level; and prioritising generational renewal.  This is a challenge worldwide; as we know, the average age of farmers in Ireland is 57.</p><p> This would allow member states to develop their own incentives through CAP, cohering with national measures such as tax incentives, land regulation inheritance law or territorial planning and addressing consumer concerns, for example, about food security, the production of foods with specific characteristics, such as geographical indications or organic foods, addressing health issues such as antimicrobial resistance or in promoting healthier lifestyles through measures such as school schemes for fruit or dairy products.</p><p> As I said, this is a leaked document.  If these are the basic principles underpinning the EU discussion on the future of CAP, then Ireland can support many of them.  However, as always, the devil will be in the detail.  We know from experience that greater latitude for member states is not always necessarily consistent with simplification.  One needs to look at the specifics of a proposal to determine whether it is workable.  Nonetheless, the leaked document would appear to be a reasonably good platform from which to initiate discussions on the future of CAP, and perhaps also to initiate a discussion today. </p><p> I look forward to hearing members contributions and I will endeavour to answer any questions that emerge.  This is, I believe, the beginning of future engagement on CAP as we move forward.</p></speech>

I will take questions from members in the following order - Deputy Cahill, Senator Mulherin and Deputy McConalogue, following which I will come back to Deputy Kenny.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-07a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017110700002#V00300"><p>I have been at the table of a number of discussions on CAP renegotiations.  On each occasion, I heard of how CAP was to be simplified only for every renegotiated CAP to end up more complicated than the one preceding it.  I will believe what we are being told this time when I see it come to fruition.  Farmers have seen no simplification of CAP.  It has not happened up to now and I do not believe it will ever happen.</p> <p>  In terms of the pressure on the budget, we can argue about how to divide the cake but if we are starting off with a smaller cake, then we are starting from a bad place.  The defence of that budget and the EU budget must be our primary concern.  We must keep the EU budget in tact and following on from that we must keep the agricultural budget in tact.  We have two battles to fight on that front.  </p> <p>  Mr. Gleeson did not mention intervention.  We forgot about intervention for a number of years.  There are 380,000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder in intervention, which has been there for some time now.</p><p>While milk prices have increased significantly, skimmed milk powder prices have not.  Had the intervention structure not been in place in 2015, I do not know where milk prices would have ended up.  The intervention mechanism is extremely important to us in terms of the floor it put under milk prices and the storage of skimmed milk powder.  We should not lose sight of the intervention supports.  While we might have thought that floor was bad there is, at least, a floor now.  This must be borne in mind in the context of the negotiations.  It is not popular to talk about intervention but the floor price is extremely important and we need to keep our eye on the ball in that regard.</p><p> In regard to small farmers and the redistribution of the CAP budget, our definition of a small farmer and Europe's definition of a small farmer are completely different.  As a country, we need to be extremely careful about budget redistribution.  The European average in comparison with our average is far apart.  On volatility in the different sectors, I do not know if the single farm payment should be linked with the management of volatility.  I would have serious concerns about how that would be done.  For example, would it be done through the type of insurance arrangement that has been spoken about previously?  Insurance comes at a cost.  On the dairy side, fixed price schemes are being put in place to address volatility to which people, depending on their financial circumstances, can sign up.  Some people need stability if they have a large amount of bank debt.  I would be worried about Brussels getting involved in volatility.  Its proposals are cumbersome and would probably benefit farmers less than they would cost them.  I would need to see more flesh on that proposal.  I would not be anxious to go down that route.</p><p> On greening and the move towards environmental payments, as a country we should not be afraid of this.  We are in a far better place than the rest of Europe in this regard.  This is something we could push for the benefit of our sectors.  Our agriculture is more sustainable and we can prove that without any fear of contradiction.  I would have no concerns about that.  </p><p> Mr. Gleeson mentioned health issues.  I believe it is going to become a big issue in this area.  Mr. Gleeson also mentioned consumer concerns and consumers looking for better value for money.  This is in direct contradiction to what we see happening with Mercosur.  How it is proposed to get the two to lie in the one bed will be interesting.  Again, this is something which we can use to our advantage.  On access for beef imports to Europe from other parts of the world this could lead to consumer concerns being raised in CAP and rightly so because at the end of the day the European taxpayer pays for CAP.  We produce food to a very high standard.  The European consumer makes no apology for demanding high standards.  There must be a level playing field for European farmers.  If there is to be access to our market then other countries must also have to meet high standards.  </p><p> On generation renewal, the age profile of our farmers is a serious concern.  We are trying to encourage young people to enter into farming.  The retirement scheme of the past was successful in terms of encouraging farmers to hand on farms to the next generation.  I would welcome more detail on the proposals from Brussels to finance a scheme that would allow older farmers to pass on the land and also have financial security.</p><p> Mr. Gleeson made a huge number of points in his statement.  They must all be seriously developed to ensure that we get the best we can from them.  It is like cattle negotiations.  We start in one place and end up in another.  The budget is definitely key.  In my view, the CAP has never been under as big a threat as it is at the moment.  We have a big battle ahead and we need a united front.  At the CAP negotiations, the percentage of the budget and the overall amount of the budget are the two key components with which we have to start.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-07a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017110700002#X00200"><p>I welcome this discussion.  These meetings give us an opportunity to think about CAP and the position in which it has put Europe and its member states.  We are the largest agrifood exporter in the world.  Many of the concerns which our farmers have are about South American countries having access to the market, but we are the biggest agrifood exporter.  Why are we the biggest agrifood exporter?  As has been said, it is because we have quality food, traceability, sustainability and innovation.  Our country is punching above its weight.  We are leading the way and pioneering in many areas.  It is very heartening because it means that we are carrying on a tradition into modern times.  We know the world has to be fed and that there are climate change targets, so all of that is very good.</p> <p>  I know that, for good reason, we can be cynical about simplification, an issue which Deputy Cahill raised.  Simplification is absolutely key from many points of view.  It is an issue which Commissioner Hogan has to take a hold of and he must ensure we see some results from it.  Farmers want to farm.  They are busy enough farming.  They do not want to be constantly tied up with documents and bureaucracy and so on.  In all of this it is key that, for once, rather than managing agricultural schemes and measures in minute detail, Europe sets out the broad objectives but empowers member states, including Ireland, to implement them in a style and in a fashion which is no less accountable, but which is appropriate to the unique Irish farming situation, farm families and so on.</p> <p>  As we know, questions have rightly been put about what has led us to Brexit.  Very often, when there is volatility in the markets, in farming or in security, we see a rise in anti-European sentiment.  That sentiment gave breath or life to Brexit.  When these types of issues arise, the Irish Government has to point to Europe, which it is right to do in many cases.  That is not very desirable because for the most part, other than in the case of our MEPs, government is at local level.  Elected local and national politicians are the people in whom the general populace has put its faith.  Therefore, they need to be trusted.</p> <p>  Implementing such a formula, perhaps in a number of sectors across the European Union, might inspire more confidence and more realism, because it is all too easy to blame Europe at times.  It would definitely be more empowering for us as a country and better for the European Union.  It has to be about more than simplification, even though I accept what Mr. Gleeson said about simplification not being a given if more power is given to governments.  It has to be both.  We cannot keep just being messengers for Europe.  That is not to take away from all the work which goes into negotiating the CAP and the fine job which was done previously.</p><p>We have to be more active players as this is critical for us and the European Union.  I know that some advances are being made in the simplification of the Common Agricultural Policy and wonder what that will entail.  I would welcome the comments of the officials on the areas where we could take a grip of the situation and best proceed at national level.  Could there be more autonomy in how we design schemes while at the same time complying with the overall objectives?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-07a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017110700002#Y00200"><p>I join the Chairman in welcoming the officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and thank them for their presentation, much of which focuses on the leaked European Commission communication.  That is understandable because it is probably a good signpost as to the direction the Commission wishes to take in reforming the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  Since the officials are appearing at the Joint Committee of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I am interested in hearing what the Department is seeking to achieve in respect of the CAP and an outline of the key priorities and objectives and how much is reflected in the leaked communiqu&eacute;.  Will the officials update us on the submissions that have been made by the Department and the Minister in the consultation process?  Are the negotiations being held in public?  What other submission have been made and will the officials enlighten us on the approach taken and Ireland's key asks in the reform of the CAP?</p> <p>  I echo the point made by Deputy Jackie Cahill about the importance of the budget for the CAP.  That budget will be crucial.  As has been pointed out, it is under massive pressure.  I have little doubt that it will require Ireland and other countries to be willing to step up to the mark in the provision of additional funding in terms of being willing to put more funds into the budget for the CAP.  That is where we should be at and we should be willing to do so as a country.  I know that the Minister has not yet given a clear indication that that will be our position.  The assistant secretary, Mr. Gleeson, outlined how the budget for the CAP, in terms of contributions and single farm payments, accounted for a figure of 37% in the dairy sector and 113% in the beef sector.  Although Brexit has dominated the debate on agriculture in recent months, the stakes in respect of the CAP are as high, if not higher.  If we were to see a significant drop-off in the budget for the CAP, it would impact immediately on incomes and put people out of farming.</p> <p>  The current programme for Government commits the Government to moving towards a cap of &euro;100,000 on the maximum payment under the current CAP programme.  Have efforts been made by the Government to direct the Department to achieve that objective?  The next Common Agricultural Policy should provide for a cap of &euro;60,000 on the maximum payment.  Has the Government taken a position on that issue?  I note that the leaked communiqu&eacute; indicates that the Commission is considering capping the maximum payment to individual farmers at between &euro;60,000 and &euro;100,000 under the next CAP programme.  </p> <p>  A system of averaging was applied in Ireland and in other countries.  Does the Department have a view on whether that system should continue as part of the next CAP programme?  </p> <p>  Some young farmers missed out under the last CAP programme.  What position is the Department taking to ensure the young farmers who missed out under the previous programme will be helped under the next one?</p><p>Will Mr. Gleeson update us on the current position on areas of natural constraint, ANC, payments?  Will they form part of the next CAP programme and will they continue to be considered under the current programme?  If farmers are to progress, we must discuss their income levels, profit margins and their position in the value food chain.  How does the Department envisage the next CAP programme addressing these issues and ensuring to include them as key priorities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-07a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Gleeson" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017110700002#Z00200"><p>I will try to deal with the issues raised.  I will respond first to Deputy Charlie McConalogue's question about the Irish position.  I should probably have mentioned our position on these issues in my opening statement.  My view is that the Irish position is reflected to a significant extent, or at least elements of it, in the leaked document.</p> <p>  The budget is the first matter.  The Deputy asked whether the Department had made formal submissions on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  At this stage that is not the nature of the beast.  As a member state, we did not formally respond in the public consultation process.  We do, however, engage on a regular basis with other member states.  Officials have accompanied the Minister and met most of our traditional allies to discuss Brexit and the CAP.  There is a group of G5 member states with which we meet regularly at official level.  There is an ongoing process of engagement before an event such as this takes place.</p> <p>  I will reiterate the issues that are of critical importance to us.  First, there is the budget.  One can have all the schemes one likes, but if one does not have a sufficient budget, they will not be as effective as they could be.  </p> <p>  In terms of there being a commitment to make direct payments, there has been a lot of discussion about the tension between risk management and direct payments and what direct payments should be made.  One must remember that we have just one pot of money and that we must decide what to do with it.  Our view is that direct payments are the fundamental barrier against productivity in the sense that they provide a guaranteed income for farmers.  We oppose the idea of co-financing because some member states would be in a position to co-finance, while others would not, thus undermining the Single Market.  </p> <p>  We need to address our continued contribution to environmental initiatives.  The issue is relevant to the budgetary discussion because if we want to convince the citizens of Europe that their tax funds should be used to support the Common Agricultural Policy, we must demonstrate that not only is there a public good beyond employment and an income for farmers but also a benefit for the environment.  </p> <p>  Despite what I have said, we strongly support the idea of further subsidiarity.  We did the last time around and will this time around.  As Senator Michelle Mulherin pointed out, we are conscious of the fact that the European Union stretches from Cyprus to Sweden and from the west of Ireland to Hungary.  Therefore, farming conditions are not the same everywhere.  We need to be able to adjust the implementation of CAP policy to suit local conditions.  The Department strongly supports adopting such a stance.  Like everybody else, we are a strong supporter of simplification, but executing the idea of simplification is more difficult than saying it.  These are the critical points we have made in all of our engagements with member states and the Commission.  Certainly, significant elements of Ireland's position are reflected in the leaked paper.  </p> <p>  Deputy Jackie Cahill mentioned intervention.  He is right that it is critical.  I have talked about risk management.  In the leaked paper there is talk about combining action at EU level with action by member states and the private sector, a principle with which we agree.  The Deputy is right that the paper is slightly unclear on where the Commission stands on traditional intervention mechanisms.  There is a range of EU interventions.  As the Deputy mentioned, there are intervention measures for skimmed milk powder, SMP.</p><p>There is intervention for butter.  There are aids to private storage.  These tools, however inefficient, have helped to put a line under prices in some sector, and we needed it.  We have 380,000 tonnes of skimmed milk powder in intervention at present and without it, matters would have been very much worse in 2014 and 2015.  We are strongly supportive of the retention of those existing mechanisms.</p><p> Also, at EU level, there are more flexible tools now.  There are exceptional measures.  These, in the form of additional payments to member states, were used during the dairy crisis as well.  We used the first tranche of what we got to make a payment to dairy farmers.  We used the second tranche in a more imaginative way to provide seed funding for a loan fund for dairy farmers of &euro;150 million.  That is a new tool introduced in 2013.  Then there is a range of private sector tools, such as fixed-price contracts which have become more common, and in some economies futures markets that operate well.  None of these is enough on their own to deal with the issue of volatility.  One needs a combination of these measures and I think that is what the paper is saying.  Specifically, what it is saying about the traditional intervention mechanisms is unclear.  However, this is not a proposal.  It is only a framework document.  Our position unambiguously would be that we need to retain those schemes.</p><p> Volatility management is all part of that picture.  We had options in the current dispensation to introduce voluntary measures on volatility management.  We could have, for example, supported an insurance scheme.  We could have supported the establishment of mutual funds, and there was an income stability mechanism, but the last time around - this was the product of consultation with all of the stakeholders - the view taken was that there was one pot of money here and some of the facilities here were constrained.  For example, on the income stability mechanism, there would have to be a reduction in somebody's income, compared to the average in the previous three years, of 30% and then one could only bring the income back up to 70% of the original threshold.  I have not done the maths but, I suspect, if I looked at the recent dairy crisis, I am not sure that we would have triggered that mechanism had we had it available on a national basis in those circumstances.  I would simply say that there were other mechanisms available to member states.  Very few member states adopted them, in part because of their inflexibility.  It is all coming from the one pot of money.  We could decide, for example, that we would take a slice of the single farm payment and use it to deal with volatility management but it would mean taking money out of the pot and using it for those purposes.  I am not sure how supportive farmers would be of that.</p><p> Deputy Cahill mentioned health and consumer concerns and Mercosur.  I have a feeling I will be in here in a fortnight's time to talk about Mercosur.  I can talk about it now but perhaps that would be a better time to do so.</p><p> Senator Mulherin mentioned simplification and I fully agree with her.  We spend &euro;1.8 billion of CAP funding every year.  In the next round of the CAP, the need to get value for money and public goods from that funding would be critical, as it is now.  There is a tension between a number of elements.  The simplest scheme we run is the basic payment scheme.  Once one gets into schemes that require specific actions of recipients to deliver public goods one is into measuring outcomes and outputs, which is a desirable activity but which can lead to complexity.  Similarly, as I said, we are very much in favour of more subsidiarity for member states but we have to try and avoid undue complexity if we do that.  Simplification is achievable but difficult, and one needs to see the detail of proposals to understand whether they are simpler or not.</p><p>Things can be simpler for the Commission or for the member state and not simpler for the farmer.  One has to make sure things are simpler for all of those pieces in the supply chain, that is, that it is simpler to operate for farmers, member states and the Commission.  The amalgamation of regulations might simplify things from a Commission point of view, but it might not change anything on the ground.  One has to be careful to try to achieve real simplification.  </p><p> In response to Senator Mulherin, we have talked a little about subsidiarity and the need to reflect the needs on the ground.  I absolutely agree with that.  </p><p> In regard to Deputy McConalogue's question, we have spoken a little about the Irish position and the extent to which we have published our position at the moment.  We have not published a document at this point.  We have not submitted a formal document.  We are right at the beginning of a discussion.  We certainly have tried to influence the shape of what has emerged and I think we have succeeded in doing that.  Another time for a good discussion on this would be after the publication of the formal proposal from the Commission at the end of November, if it happens then.  Then we will have to reflect in detail on what emerges.  It could be that what emerges then is much like what we have here, which is a set of principles.  To be perfectly frank, they are principles with which one could agree.  However, they are principles with which more than one policy could fit.  We need to see the specific legislative proposals that emerge and that will probably not happen until the middle of 2018.  That will be about the time when we expect to see proposals on the financial framework as well.  In the past, these things have moved in parallel.  We have had proposals on the modifications of the CAP and in parallel, proposals on the financial framework.  It will probably be mid-2018 before we will see a detailed proposal.  </p><p> Capping was referred to.  The last time around in the proposals, there was a requirement for degressivity once one got to &euro;150,000.  The payments had to diminish once one got to &euro;250,000.  We applied the full degressivity after &euro;150,000.  Applying that 100% degressivity effectively led to a cap.  A second part of our capping proposal was that we applied a cap of &euro;700 per hectare on direct payments as well.  That will be applied in full by 2019. </p><p> That is what is allowable for under the current regulations.  The next time around, and I have been asked for a view on whether we should look at this the next time around, the leaked document says we should reflect on whether to apply a cap of between &euro;60,000 and &euro;100,000.  For me to say what we should or should not do requires me to prejudge a policy issue that will be determined ultimately by the Minister.  However, I think the Minister has already said in public that he has no ideological problem with capping.  The detail will emerge when we consider whatever specific proposals arise at the time.  I cannot tie a Minister's hands here by answering that question.</p></speech>

We paid &euro;160 million to 75,000 farmers and that compares with &euro;140 million and 65,000 farmers in 2016.  We are making payment runs twice a week.  As of 6 November 2017, &euro;187 million has been paid to 87,000 farmers.  There was a question as to whether there would be an ANC provision in the next CAP.</p><p>I cannot imagine that there will not be.  While it does not refer to the term "ANC" in the leaked document, it does refer to support for rural areas and I think that necessarily means some kind of payment in recognition of disadvantage.  I cannot envisage a situation where we would not have some kind of payment for disadvantage.</p></speech>

I do not think that necessarily means the kind of installation aid we had the last time around but it means some kind of payment for installation.  This time around we have already done a number of things for young farmers based on the flexibility we had, including a 25% top-up on direct payments for young farmers.  We have a number of tax reliefs as well.  We have succession farm partnerships to encourage succession, because apart from the age profile, surveys indicate that many farmers do not have a successor in mind or do not have a successor.</p> <p>  We spoke about simplification a minute ago.  What is clear is that the simplest tool is the one we chose, which was the young farmers top-up.  The fewer schemes we have, the simpler it is.  It is easier to top up a basic payment than to create a rural development scheme with a lot of deliverables and criteria with which one must comply.  The idea behind young farmers schemes generally is to encourage people to start to deliver some change.  That is why we opted for the maximum young farmer payment the last time around. </p></speech>

If I was asked whether it will be possible to negotiate a significantly reformed CAP in the middle of all of that by 2020, I would say it would be a very significant challenge.  That is my own view, and I have a feeling that the Commissioner might have hinted slightly, more than once in public, that it is a very crowded agenda.</p></speech>

The possibility of rolling it over to 2023 is also referred to in the European Parliament report, with implementation of a new CAP starting in 2024 or 2025.

CAP from its outset was meant to provide cheap food to the European market.  It has changed its emphasis over the years and has now become more about providing a very high-quality product or high-quality food.  It is now more focused on that and on issues of environmental sustainability.  They are the two things that will be pushed more than anything else in any CAP reform.  The witness mentioned direct payments.  Direct payments are vital to farmers in Ireland. In that regard, while we know what we are looking for from an Irish perspective, do we have much indication as to the position of others?</p><p>I refer to our other European colleagues, particularly the big powerhouses such as Germany and France which may have a slightly different agenda.  How open are they to maintaining or expanding some of what Ireland is looking to do?</p><p> On the issue of greening, we have had GLAS and various schemes down the years.  While farmers find them difficult at times because there is so much red tape involved, at the same time they have provided a stable payment.  They know that money will come once they do the job right.  I wonder is it perceived that we will go more in that direction so that there will be a greater emphasis on the greening measures than on the direct payments in the future.  How comfortable would Ireland be with that?  The farming community would not be comfortable with it.  It needs the surety of the direct payment in place.</p><p> The other issue already mentioned was volatility, how to shore that up and whether some of the CAP moneys can be used for that.  Many in the farming community would fear that if that were to happen it would eat into what they consider to be their entitlements and that would be a dangerous track to go down.  However, from what we hear, that is the direction many of the other European countries want to go.</p><p> While much of it has already been discussed, I would like to know, while we know where we want to be and where we want to go in a broad sense, what obstacles will we meet and where are other countries in respect of all of these issues.</p></speech>

How will the Government advocate for us in terms of managing that shortfall?  There will have to be forward planning, which would have been going on, I suppose, over the past couple of years in any case.</p> <p> Is the Department taking the use of glyphosate into account in terms of the ongoing CAP negotiations?  As part of our report on the tillage sector, we heard from Science Foundation Ireland that it did not think it would be possible for farming to continue at the current level without the use of glyphosate.  What is the Department's position on that?</p> <p>  Food waste is a significant issue.  Whether it be waste in supermarkets or waste on farm, for example, if supermarkets reject produce because it is not at a particular standard, how can that be addressed during the CAP negotiations?</p> <p>  With regard to changing our practices to take into account the need for biomass for renewable energies, we heard that there seems to be a reluctance from the farming sector to use what it would see as good land for the growth of trees.  it would prefer to see it being used for food, yet we hear from the sector that wants to get biomass that it cannot get it here and has to import it.  Is the Department examining this in some way or how will it approach that as part of the CAP negotiations?  Is it an issue in other countries?</p></speech>

We started off with 300,000 farmers when we joined the EU.  We have 120,000 now and the number is falling.  There does not seem to be a policy to ensure that we protect the family farm.</p> <p>  At present, although Mr. Gleeson says now that there may be a roll-over of it, approximately 80% of the funding goes to a small percentage of farmers.  If one looks at the information that came out in Agriland last week, those in certain parts of the country get on average twice what farmers in another area get.  Will the Department ever realise that there are parts of the country where one will not be able to keep a youngster engaged in farming?</p><p>We talk about bringing in schemes to try to keep youngsters engaged.  Is it not recognised by Europe and the Department that there is no way we will keep youngsters in farming if they are only getting &euro;3,000, &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000 in the single farm payment.  The witness talked about &euro;150,000.  I have been in Europe.  Europe will tell us it is up to the member state to decide what it can give.  Why is there not an agenda in Ireland to increase the single farm payment to &euro;50,000?  Europe has said clearly to us that it is up to the member state to do what it wants.  Why was the maximum area for applications to the young farmers scheme put at 90 ha?  We were told Europe had said that but I found out that France, Wales and other countries had set it at 25 ha and 30 ha.  Why do we not bring in an average payment?  I was in Brussels and talked to people with responsibility for the scheme and that is exactly what they said to me.  If we roll this over, the reality is we will lose more and more farmers.  My understanding from the figures I have looked at is that Britain pulling out will cost Ireland &euro;100 million in CAP.  Is it not the case that we are under ferocious threat from the eastern bloc countries?  Will they take a bigger slice of the budget?  Is Britain actually our smallest fear in this situation?  </p><p> The witness mentioned the climate.  Is he saying we will be promoting renewable energy, whether wind or anaerobic, to farmers?  Will there be new types of payments for that?  How will environmental schemes be introduced?  I met some of the witnesses during negotiations for the programme for Government.  We were told there would be a review of the CAP payments in 2017, but that did not happen.  We understood the current imbalance, which results in some people getting &euro;150,000 and some getting &euro;2,000, would be sorted out.  That did not appear to happen.  The years 2010 to 2015 and 2008 to 2010 were looked at but there was a category of farmers before that who walked away from farming.  We talk about bringing in young farmers.  That group of forgotten farmers was never sorted and it does not look as though it will be sorted.  Is there any budget there for them?  The Department has said that as a result of elections or whatever political thing is going on it could be 2023 when it happens.  Many of these farmers will just throw their hands up in the air and we will see the demise of more farms.  Is the &euro;25 million that was agreed for the ANC going to hill areas or lowland areas?  Has a decision been made on that yet?</p></speech>

We all have our own aspirations and we know where we think CAP funding should or should not go.  What I am taking from the presentation today is that we are in a bit of a vacuum.  We are expecting a document in November but there is a rumour the whole thing could be rolled out in 2023.  Are we being side-tracked by Brexit?  Could something come down the line that we are not expecting?  The Department built its presentation around a document which it stressed is a leaked document and cannot be believed.  The witness gave the impression that if it was the real thing we would meet it with open arms.  Are we getting side-tracked?  Could something come down the line that none of us expected?  Are we being fed information about the possibility of it being pushed out and the implications of Brexit?  Is there more to this than meets the eye?</p></speech>

I do not believe we are getting side-tracked.  We stay in very close touch with the Commission, the Cabinet, the Commissioner and other member states.</p><p>It is absolutely true we are living in an environment in which there are a lot of uncertainties.  That is the reality.  I do not think there is any kind of an agenda to mislead anybody.  I am simply trying to present the facts we are aware of now.  The fact is there is a leaked document from the Commission.  I would be a little bit more cautious than to say we would greet it with open arms.  It sets out a set of principles with which we can work but it would only be the start of a discussion.  To greet something with open arms, we would need to see the detail.  We have not seen any detailed proposals.    </p><p> I did not answer one of Deputy McConalogue's questions about the position of farmers in the supply chain and the role that the CAP can play.  There are specific proposals being prepared at the moment on unfair trading practices outside of the CAP.  Our view has always been that if these things are to be effective, because we export 90% of what we produce, they need to be done on a pan-European level.  We have introduced legislation in Ireland but it is not enough to resolve that issue.  In terms of what the CAP can do, the focus of its interventions in this area has generally been on supporting collectivisation from farmers.  It has been on supporting producer groups.  We have launched a programme for developing food producer groups in the beef sector.  We will fund a facilitator who will help farmers to get together and provide them with guidance on governance and that sort of thing.  They will have the latitude under the current competition rules and the CAP to negotiate collectively.  That has been the kind of intervention the CAP has made available to deal with supply chain issues.  It is a difficult issue to deal with.  When one looks at public consultation and the responses from farmers and non-farmers, which are quite different in some areas, 100% of respondents favoured strengthening the position of farmers in the supply chain.  </p><p> Deputy Kenny asked about environmental sustainability and whether we see the CAP going in that direction.  The reality is that the CAP scheme was greened the last time around and that trend will continue.  Do we foresee a threat to direct payments?  There are those who feel there should be a shift in funding from direct payments to rural development and the departing member state was one of the major proponents of that.  It is not something we would necessarily support.  We had the option the last time around to move funding on the basis of national discretion from pillar one, direct payments, into pillar two, CAP, and we chose not to do that.  If one is looking at threats to the CAP and its shape and the proposals for modifying it, it is a proposal that could emerge.  The balance of funding could be shifted towards public good, RDP measures and away from direct payment.  That is something we would have to look at very carefully if we receive a proposal.  Our position has been unequivocally that the direct payment is the fundamental pillar of supporting farm families.  We remain in favour of that.</p><p> President Macron made a speech a while ago and perhaps that is what the Deputy was thinking about.  He talked about being unafraid to address the old taboos when it came to the CAP.  He made the point that even though farmers complain about the CAP, when we come to a point where we have the opportunity to fundamentally reform it, they tend to oppose that.  If one examines the detail of President Macron's speech, it is a bit similar to the leaked paper; it is a set of principles on which one could fit many policies.  He has allowed himself sufficient margin for movement in what he said.  At the time when he made the speech there was quite a violent reaction when he said we cannot be afraid to discuss the old taboos.  I am not sure it was matched by the substance of the speech.  </p><p> Deputy Corcoran Kennedy asked about the budget.  There are a number of elements to the budget.</p><p>We are not at the point where we will accept in any kind of a formal way a reduction in the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, budget.  We do not know what the financial arrangements will be when the UK leaves the European Union.  It is one of the largest net contributors to the budget, some &euro;10 billion a year.  If 38% of the overall EU budget is CAP funding, then that could be a cut on its own of &euro;3.8 billion.  That is the first piece of the jigsaw.</p><p> The second piece is that there are new political priorities in some member states, such as migration and security, for which they will be looking for funding.  The next piece is the eastern bloc countries looking for a bigger share of the budget.  We looked at a proposal for external convergence of payments per hectare across member states before and we are absolutely certain we have nothing to gain from it.  Would we lose from it?  We would have to see specific proposals to determine whether we would lose from it or not.  The last proposal from the then Commissioner, Dacian Ciolo, was to move everyone to the average payment per hectare across Europe.  When we looked at the specifics at the time, our payments per hectare were more or less bang on the average.  At that time, we would not have been significant losers from external convergence.</p><p> As for now, we would definitely not gain from external convergence.  At the same time, we cannot take it for granted that we would lose from it.  We would need to examine the proposal at the time, look specifically at our payments per hectare, compare them to the European average and assess the proposal.</p><p> The three threats to the budget are the UK's departure, the political imperative for funding other priorities and the desire of the eastern bloc member states to have what they view as a fairer share of the pot.</p><p> Regarding additional contributions, that is a little bit beyond my pay grade and is not even a question for our Minister to answer.  All I can say is if the budget remains the same and the size of the CAP reduces, Ireland will become a bigger net contributor.  Since 2014, Ireland has been a net budget contributor overall.  If one divides the budget on a proportionate basis, however, we are still a significant net beneficiary of the CAP.  The ratio is about 2:1.  If the budget remains the same and the CAP is diminished, then Ireland will become a larger net contributor.  If the CAP is to remain the same and if these additional priorities are to be funded, even if one discounts the loss of the UK money, then member states will have to pay more.  If the CAP is to remain the same, one takes into account a significant loss of funds from the UK and these additional priorities to be funded, then member states will have to pay more.</p><p> Ireland has never been found wanting when it comes to a willingness to support the CAP.  In the context of this discussion, people will assess matters on a logical basis and what is in the national interest.  That is as far as I am prepared to go in determining it.  I am an official and that is a question of policy to be answered by somebody else.</p><p>We based our position on glyphosate on the science.  The view from the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA, is that there is no public health risk from the use of glyphosate.  Based on that, the European Commission has proposed a five-year extension to the approval for glyphosate, which we support.</p><p>We are sensitive to the pressure on rural areas and the reality of farming.</p><p> Food waste is a real issue.  It goes back to public confidence in the system we have for funding farming.  I am not sure what the CAP can do in that regard.  It can fund information campaigns.  That might be the kind of initiative which could potentially emerge.  Again, it seems to me that it needs to be done on a pan-European rather than a national level.</p><p> I referred to family farms but Deputy Fitzmaurice might have felt not as often as I should have.  The position on capping is that we have gone as far as we can under the current legislative framework.  There is a specific reference in the leaked document to a reflection on whether we should cap between &euro;60,000 and &euro;100,000.  The Minister has said it is something he is prepared to consider but we do not have a specific proposal yet.  During the 2013 reform, we went some of the way towards flattening payments across farms.  The political and factual reality is that when one talks about shifting funding from person A to person B, it is difficult and divisive while people have strong views on it.  There was a view taken at the time that if we moved to a flat rate everywhere, it could be disruptive to farm incomes and productivity.  There was a balance.  By 2019, we will have shifted &euro;100 million from the highest paid farmers to the lower paid farmers.  Quite a few people view that as inadequate but that is what is being done.  Based on the leaked paper, it will be possible to continue on that journey in the next reform.</p></speech>

There are farmers who feel they have missed out and have low entitlements.  If they were to be funded, it would have to be through a linear cut in other direct payments.  We have contacted the Commission on this.  Based on its advice, it is not possible to apply a linear cut to deal with this issue.</p> <p>  There is an omnibus proposal, however, making its way through the system, which is an amendment to 15 EU regulations across a range of sectors, including some of the CAP regulations.  Part of the omnibus proposal would allow a linear cut to fund what would be termed as specific disadvantaged categories.  That is not defined in the omnibus regulation.  However, it might be possible under the omnibus regulation to apply a linear cut to fund categories of disadvantage.  It would have to be decided what the categories were.  The omnibus proposal could be applicable from 1 January but it is looking that it might be shoved out a bit.  If the proposal goes through as it stands now, it would be technically possible to apply a linear cut across all direct payments and fund a variety of areas of specific disadvantage.  However, that would be a linear cut in everyone else's payments.</p></speech>

I would not disagree with the Chairman.  It is possible to come up with a set of broad principles before having any idea as to what the budget will be but it is difficult, however, to get into specific legislative proposals, for example, until one has some sight of what is proposed in other areas.  All of that will depend on the outcome of the Brexit proposals, or at least a partial outcome, and at least the outcome of the exit negotiations at which the future financial dispensation will be decided.</p></speech>

Based on our Food Wise 2025 targets, we are to increase exports by 50% by 2025.  This must be balanced with our climate change targets.  We have read a lot about this in recent days, obviously.  Fitting all this into a new Common Agricultural Policy will be very challenging.  How will we balance the environmental and food production sides of the equation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-07a.56" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Gleeson" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017110700002#JJ00900"><p>What we have in Food Wise 2025 is a vision for the sector that was decided by industry and facilitated by the Government and the Department.  The target is to increase the value of exports.  There are several elements to that, including moving up the value chain and increasing production.</p> <p>  On the question of balancing the equation, the contribution that is made to the environmental discussion is underplayed significantly.  What is remarkable about agriculture is that, since 1990, we have succeeded in reducing carbon emissions significantly at the same time as increasing the output dramatically.  Therefore, farmers, the farming community and the agri-community generally have made a huge contribution in the climate debate.  More has to be done.  I do not believe one will find farmers disagreeing with that.  There is absolutely no doubt but that it is a challenge.  There will have to be a strong environmental and climate change component to the next Common Agricultural Policy.</p> <p>  In terms of what has been achieved through GLAS, examples include the conservation of some 280,000 hectares of permanent pasture, the protection of 16,000 km of watercourses, the preservation of 127,000 ha of habitat, the management of 120,000 ha of land in accordance with farmland bird actions, and 1,300 km of new hedges.  These are achievements of farmers based on the scheme.  We will need to do more. and we have targets now that we must meet.  We have moved on a little bit. and it is important to acknowledge the contribution that farming and agriculture have made in combating climate change.</p><p>That is not to deny that more has to be done.  As I said, farm bodies and farmers will not be found to be in any way resistant to the idea of making a contribution.  It is important, however, that they are remunerated for that contribution.  It must be recognised in any Common Agricultural Policy which we develop, because these things will not happen on their own.  They require active management by farmers.</p></speech>

This was a point of major debate during the previous negotiations four or five years ago, and it may need to be redefined again.  To follow on from Deputy Fitzmaurice's point, the productive farmer also needs to be protected and acknowledged into the future.  We need to have productive farming and we have to accept that some farmers are going to be more productive than others for one reason or another.  That also has to be acknowledged.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-07a.59" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Gleeson" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017110700002#KK00300"><p>The Chairman is absolutely right.  This is one of the most difficult areas across member states.  There were many efforts to define active farmer in 2013.  In the end, what was produced was a sort of negative list which member states could add to if they wished.  That is because it was difficult to produce a definition.  The phrase used in the leaked paper was something like farmers who are reliant to a significant extent on farming for their income.  What does that mean?  At its worst extreme, that could be interpreted as excluding part-time farmers.  That would exclude 60% of dry stock farmers in Ireland, so it is clearly not an acceptable definition.  I am not suggesting that is what is intended in the leaked document.  It is not.  I am simply trying to point out the complexity of coming up with a definition.  I believe everyone agrees in principle that CAP payments should be directed at farm families.  By and large the evidence given in the leaked paper suggests that will be the case.  Coming up with a definition of an active farmer is fraught and difficult.  If it was easy, we would have done it in 2013, but we did not.  We came up with this effort to resolve the issue, which I hesitate to call a fudge.  As I said, it was really a negative list and it meant that someone running an airport or a golf course or whatever was not an active farmer.</p> <p>  The other thing is that if the definition is too complicated, we end up with extraordinary administrative complexity.  People might say that is a problem for us, but if there is administrative complexity for the Department, it inevitably reflects back on farmers.  It makes schemes complicated and there would be various kinds of difficult assessments.  I do not have a simple answer for the Chairman but I would say that it is a complicated area and we have been talking about it for a long time.</p></speech>

Members and witnesses are requested to turn off their mobile phones or to switch them to flight mode; not that we are taking off anywhere fancy and in fact we have a few hours of hard work ahead of us.  Mobile phones interfere with the sound system and create difficulties for the parliamentary reporters, television coverage and web streaming, which may be adversely affected.</p><p>At this point in the meeting, we have come to our engagement on the home school community liaison scheme and the strengthening families programme, an evaluation of which I was very pleased to see in my own county of Kildare approximately six weeks ago.  I was very impressed and could really see the excellent co-operation between the home-school liaison scheme and the strengthening families programme.  As such, I thought it would be very useful in the context of the work of the joint committee to deal with this as one of our subject items.  We will engage with a number of stakeholders in respect of both the scheme and the programme.</p><p>On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome Mr. Noel Kelly, director of the national educational welfare service in Tusla, accompanied by Ms Maria Tobin, integrated services manager for Tusla.  I also welcome Ms Maeve McCafferty from the INTO.  We also will write to the ASTI and the TUI seeking written submissions and any recommendations they have and will incorporate those into our final report.  Also in attendance are Ms Aisling Browne and Ms Jenny Gannon, who are home school community liaison teachers in a junior and primary school on the same campus.  They are accompanied by Ms Mary Lenihan, a former home school community liaison teacher from whose positive experience and enthusiasm Ms Browne and Ms Gannon have learned a great deal.  From the Department of Education and Skills, I welcome Mr. Martin Shiel, assistant principal officer in the special education unit, and Ms Chris Kelly, assistant principal officer in the social inclusion unit.  I also welcome Mr. P&aacute;draig O'Donovan and Mr. Andy Leeson of For&oacute;ige, who will address the strengthening families programme.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite brief opening statements of approximately five minutes, which time can be shared if there are two witnesses from the same body, followed by an engagement with the members.  Witnesses will have an opportunity to come back and answer questions or make comments in response.</p><p>Before we begin, I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.</p><p>However, if they are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Any opening statements provided to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against persons outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I invite Mr. Kelly and Ms Tobin from Tusla to make their opening statements.</p></speech>

It propelled me on a different route in my career and I have not been back in a classroom since.  One could say that is probably for the good of children.</p> <p>  The scheme was set up in 1990 under the auspices of the Department of Education and Skills.  It is now a central component of Tusla's education welfare services and is used as a means of reaching out to and engaging families in the education of their children.  It has continued to expand and remains central to the Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools, DEIS, programme and is a main policy intervention from the Department of Education and Skills to address educational disadvantage.  Together with the school completion programme and the statutory educational welfare services, the home school community liaison scheme is working to deliver a fully integrated, streamlined and cost-effective service in schools serving designated areas of disadvantage.</p> <p>  The overall aim of the integrated services is to improve school attendance and participation, as well as the retention of children in education, thus improving their life chances.  The strategic goals of Tusla, namely, keeping children safe, enabling families to make good decisions about their health and lifestyles, helping children engage with education and develop as active citizens, capable of economic independence, imply that partnership with communities, agencies and families is central to its work.  This model of partnership working continues to be central to the home school community liaison scheme.  This approach is about building positive and trusting relationships with communities and families, particularly reaching out to the most marginalised families and developing and maintaining high levels of skills and motivation.</p> <p>  Together with social work and educational welfare services, the home school community liaison scheme is uniquely placed to deliver a comprehensive range of services, along a continuum of care to marginalised children and families, utilising international best practice and evidence-based interventions.  These are proportionate and effective in achieving improved outcomes.</p></speech>

The scheme is particularly close to my heart and I am delighted to present to the committee on it today.</p> <p>  The goals which underpin all work of the home school community liaison scheme are to maximise the active participation of children in the learning process, in particular, those who might be at risk of failure; and to promote active co-operation between home, school and relevant community agencies in promoting the educational interests of children.  Prior to the home school community liaison scheme, schools may not have been linking in as much as they do now with community networks.  The scheme aims to raise parents' awareness of their own capacity to enhance their children's progress and to assist them in developing relevant skills.</p><p>It aims to enhance children's uptake from education, their retention in the system and their continuation to post-compulsory education, as well as to enhance children's attitudes to life-long learning and to disseminate the positive outcomes from the scheme throughout the school system.</p><p> Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has responsibility for the operational management of the home school community liaison, HSCL, scheme through an integrated services strategy.  One national integrated services manager employed by Tusla and four senior managers, who are teachers seconded by the Department of Education and Skills to Tusla, have overall responsibility for the implementation and development of both DEIS policy and planning strategies with HSCL and for Tusla&rsquo;s strategic goals regarding educational welfare.  The 416 full-time HSCL co-ordinators are all teachers in the designated schools and are assigned for a five-year term to HSCL duties.  As teachers, they have a unique understanding of pedagogy and of strategies that help parents to support the education of their children.  At school level, there is a clear focus on targeting in a planned and cohesive manner, improved planning and evidence-based interventions and measurement of outcomes.  To this end, all HSCL co-ordinators are undergoing a comprehensive programme of continuous professional development, CPD, in order that they are better equipped to deliver a streamlined, coherent and consistent service.  As members of their school staffs, co-ordinators are to the forefront of promoting a school-wide approach to addressing issues of educational disadvantage, as well as of cultural change.</p><p> Home school community liaison co-ordinators run several initiatives to improve literacy and numeracy in line with national strategies.  They facilitate the active involvement of parents at curricular and policy level in schools and they train parents to become a resource to one other, to their school and above all, to their own children.  Furthermore, as part of their integrated work with the other two strands of the educational welfare service, namely, the school completion programme and statutory educational welfare service, Home school community liaison co-ordinators ensure that all possible supports and initiatives will have been attempted prior to formal referrals being made to the statutory arm of the service.  At local level, co-ordinators operate a cluster model of support where co-ordinators in a close geographical area come together to formulate action plans, share best practice, provide mutual support and develop effective interventions in their own schools.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-07a.76" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve McCafferty" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017110700002#H00300"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to be here.  The INTO recognises that the HSCL scheme has enhanced pupils' learning opportunities and promoted retention in the education system through a partnership approach between parents and teachers.  Often parents of pupils who attend DEIS schools have had a poor experience of education themselves and find it difficult to engage in parental involvement at school level.  The HSCL teacher works closely with parents to enable them to better support and encourage their own children in education.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding the success of the scheme, in recent years HSCL teachers have been over-stretched and under-resourced as a consequence of recessionary cutbacks.  The scheme needs continued commitment to investment and a renewed vision to ensure it responds to the increasing needs of pupils and families living in challenging contexts.  The INTO is hopeful that the educational welfare service within Tusla will offer a renewed commitment to safeguarding and progressing the very valuable HSCL scheme.</p> <p>  The ambitions set out for the HSCL scheme can only be realised when accompanied by targeted and sustainable funding.  The HSCL portion of the annual DEIS grant currently stands at 10% and is allocated for the implementation of activities that are consistent with the principles and practices of the HSCL scheme.</p><p>However, in order to provide meaningful and targeted supports, more funding should be assigned to DEIS schools to support such worthwhile initiatives.</p><p> Since the recessionary cutbacks, professional development opportunities for HSCL teachers have been minimal.  The preventative role of the HSCL encompasses a broad remit, including courses, transfer programmes, integration with community groups, policy formation at school level, literacy and numeracy development and staff development to name but a few.  Due to the broad and ever-evolving nature of the HSCL role, a commitment to ongoing professional development and opportunities for networking within clusters is required.  Professional induction support is also required for newly appointed HSCLs as there is increasing turnover due to the five-year limit on the deployment of HSCL teachers.  Adequate induction is important to ensure that consistency, experience and expertise are harnessed.  The INTO acknowledges and welcomes the recent commitment by the educational welfare services to a comprehensive CPD programme that is under way.  However, in light of the developing nature of the role and the staff turnover within HSCL, the INTO reiterates the need for professional development to be ongoing.  While there is some rationale for introducing a five-year limit on the deployment of HSCL teachers, a balance must be achieved to ensure the five-year limit does not result in schools losing experienced teachers who have invested time in establishing strong relationships with families.</p><p> While acknowledging the need to enable all teachers to experience the role of the HSCL, the INTO is of the view that schools should be granted the autonomy and flexibility at local level to deploy the best placed teacher to the role of HSCL rather than be confined by a five-year limit.  Staff deployment is a function of the school principal as set out in the Education Acts.</p><p> The cut to rural DEIS HSCL support is regrettable.  Rural DEIS schools have specific needs and would benefit from improved home school links.  Arguably, there is a role for HSCL support to build home school relations in all primary schools.  The HSCL scheme should be reassigned to all schools recognised as having educational disadvantage status and consideration should be given to extending the scheme to special schools who have particular needs in terms of home school relations.</p><p> The level of engagement required to support Travellers needs intervention beyond that which can be incorporated into the current remit of the HSCL role.  In an attempt to counteract the loss of resources to Travellers, the INTO proposes that consideration should be given to expanding the allocation of HSCL teachers in areas that have a high concentration of Traveller pupils, including non-DEIS schools.  Extending the capacity of HSCL to support Traveller pupils and their families would require specific CPD opportunities for HSCL teachers that would enhance their understanding of Traveller culture and the specific barriers faced by Travellers in education.</p><p> Home visitation is an integral part of the HSCL scheme.  The nature of home visits has evolved in recent years and HSCL teachers sometimes find it problematic fulfilling the requirement for home visits.  Some parents are reluctant to accommodate HSCL visits in the home and prefer school-based visits as the practice of home visits does not always align with their culture.  Interactions with parents should be about the contact irrespective of the context.  Schools and HSCL teachers need to be trusted with the flexibility and discretion to determine locally whether home or school interactions are most appropriate at any given time.</p><p> While the INTO supports the integrated, cross-agency approach to supporting children and their families, it is important to state that HSCL teachers are not social workers or welfare officers and do not want to take on roles for which they are not qualified.  Participation of HSCL teachers in Meitheal should not be obligatory.  In the event that teachers are involved, they should have the opportunity to do so with the relevant supports in place, such as substitution cover.  Any involvement in Meitheal or similar programmes should not involve excessive paperwork for teachers and schools.   The INTO is strongly of the view that the role of the HSCL teacher in building lasting relationships between the home and the school is essential in tackling educational disadvantage.  Parental involvement, especially in areas at risk of social exclusion, does not just benefit the child and the school; it is a crucial aspect of lifelong learning.</p><p>Parental involvement, especially in areas at risk of social exclusion, does not just benefit the children and the school, but is a crucial aspect of lifelong learning.</p></speech>

It is important that we get to hear of their real experience on the ground and for that to be as up-to-date as possible.  There could be no two better teachers to tell us about that than Ms Browne and Ms Gannon.</p></speech>

The HSCL scheme in schools is an extensive one that enhances the life of the school and the lives of families where HSCL is involved.  When children enrol in Scoil Mhuire S&oacute;isearach, HSCL is part of the admission team that identifies and refers families who may be in need of extra support.</p> <p>  Home visits help to break down existing barriers, offering supports to parents, and are crucial to bridging the gap between home and school.  Sitting at a kitchen table with a father or a mother hearing their deepest concerns and desires for their family is challenging work, but a privilege gifted to us in the role.  It is a privilege to be able to listen in a non-judgmental way and offer support.  We can offer educational guidance when helping parents accessing extra supports if their child has learning difficulties or behavioural needs.</p> <p>  The dedicated space of a parents' room enables us to chat informally with parents to further create and build open supportive relationships between home and school.  This space also lends a hand to creating communities, encouraging relationships between parents to grow so that they can then, as Ms Tobin mentioned, support each other.</p> <p>  Being a parent is a difficult job, especially being a parent who is at home all day as it can be extremely isolating.  Many times parents tell us that without the parents' room they would not speak to another adult all day and that their engagement in the parents' room has changed their lives and may have helped them make their first friend in many years.</p> <p>  We offer courses for parents from personal development to literacy and numeracy initiatives, and parenting programmes to increase parental confidence in supporting their child with homework.  Engagement in the parents' room has led to a new positive outlook on education.  It builds parents' confidence and many return to VTOS or the ETB for classes or courses.  This is very positive for parents and children alike.</p> <p>  We organise day trips with parents and they are always thoroughly enjoyable.  The Chairman kindly invited us to Leinster House last December.  Some of the parents commented that they never thought they would ever be in this building.  It is wonderful to be able to facilitate that.  In September of this year we brought a group of parents to the National Ploughing Championships.  Off we went with our wellies and everything, and we had a wonderful day.</p> <p>  Senator Ruane kindly accepted our invitation to visit us in Scoil Mhuire.  She sat for an hour and chatted with the parents, and shared her inspirational life story with them.  That was another wonderful opportunity for parents to engage.</p> <p>  Parental engagement with the HSCL increases motivation and encourages desire in parents to become part of their community, building self-confidence and self-esteem.  Ultimately all our interventions aim to promote and nurture positive mental health of the adults in our school family.  This, in turn, has a positive effect in the home.  Parents are the primary educators of their children and their own personal development impacts greatly on a household.</p><p>Parents are encouraged, through the HSCL scheme, to engage in classroom activities and initiatives in school: Maths for Fun, Science for Fun, Literacy Lift-off.</p><p> Regarding shared reading with the children, children delight in seeing their parents involved in school activities and in their education.  Parents engaging positively with school reiterates the benefit of education and encourages the children to engage more and to believe in the power of education.  Parents and teachers share a common goal, wanting what is best for our children.  Working side by side with parents strengthens our efforts to provide the best we can for them.  HSCL enables us to achieve our goals for each child, striving to break the cycle of educational disadvantage.  Working collaboratively in an integrated service with schools completion programme and educational welfare officer, we aim to ensure the child, parents and, ultimately, the family engage in a positive manner with education.  It remains of paramount importance that it is a qualified teacher who fulfils the role because of the complex nature of individual educational needs and the need to fully understand the curriculum methodologies, etc.</p><p> Working in this role in recent years has led me to a deeper understanding of children's situations and what they may have to deal with before they arrive in school at all.  I am certain that I will return to the classroom a very different teacher with more realistic aims, though continuing to challenge children to reach their full potential.  My time in HSCL has enriched my professional career, deepened my belief in the power of education as well as guiding me to do my best for others when I can.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-07a.82" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jenny Gannon" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017110700002#L00200"><p>Oftentimes, HSCL is the only support going into a house and sometimes for families who have been engaged in other support services, we are the only support that is left in a house.  Isolation is detrimental, and it is critical and crucial that we are all linked to our communities, so one of the great jobs of HSCL is to encourage that engagement and that openness to other community agencies, whether statutory or voluntary, whether it is their children becoming involved in the local family resource centre or taking part in the strengthening families programme or going through the process of the meitheal with Tusla or facilitating parenting courses and self-esteem programmes for children.  All of these encourage them to do what is ultimately the most difficult job in the world, and that is to parent children.  As a senior school, moving from primary to secondary school is one area of particular stress and difficulties for many families in our schools.  We run a transition programme that supports families through the entire process, from discussing which secondary school setting may suit their child best to enrolling in the school, attending the open nights.  In our local community college, St. Conleth's, we are lucky enough to have a HSCL teacher there who we liaise with to ensure a smooth transition.  We facilitate the stepping stones programme, which is run by the local Kildare youth project workers, which are also then informed by our SCP and HSCL teams to support the children's transitions through and on to secondary school.  My role in that is very much to support the parents to get their children to engage, to discuss how to set up good habits for secondary school and to investigate ways to help keep their children in school.  Because of the position of trust that we hold with families, we know their stories.  Their stories informs their children's stories, and their children's stories inform the stories of the classroom.  As a teacher, I know that helpful small snippets of information can support and be a huge support to a child within a classroom, so oftentimes it will be my job to share, with the permission of the parent, a story that is relevant specifically to the child in the room.  It is because of this shared information that behaviours will be sorted out, relationships will be built and children will ultimately positively engage in the classroom and in the school.  Ultimately, we are working on a cultural change, a long-term effect.  We need to do that, completing all of the paperwork and monitoring and everything else that is required of us, without impinging on the dignity of the families who are part of our service.  Having been in the school now for 18 years since the home school liaison was set up in the school, I now can see the long-lasting effect of that.</p><p>I can see the rewards because parents who initially engaged in the parent's room all the way back then now bring their children to school themselves.  They regularly stop me or Ms Browne in the yard and tell us they remember when their mother was in with us and did a course and that they cannot wait to start their course, or that they were involved in the classroom with Maths for Fun and ask whether it is still done and whether they can get involved.  For all of us who work and who want our children to progress through education positively, the HSCL scheme impacts very positively on everybody involved in the education process, including the parents, teachers, pupils, community and, at the end of the day, our whole society.</p></speech>

DEIS Plan 2017, published earlier this year, represents a renewal of the DEIS programme and sets out a vision for future intervention in the area of social inclusion in educational policy.  DEIS focuses on addressing and prioritising the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities, from pre-school through second level education, three to 18 years, through the school support programme, which includes a suite of interventions, comprising in school and out of school supports.</p> <p>  The HSCL scheme is a key support for DEIS urban primary and post-primary schools, which operates as part of the integrated educational welfare service of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  Tusla, which is the dedicated State agency responsible for improving well-being and outcomes for children, has responsibility for the management of the HSCL scheme, together with the school completion programme and the statutory educational welfare service.  Tusla's educational welfare service works collaboratively with our Department and schools to ensure that children&rsquo;s participation in the education system is maximised.  The HSCL scheme is in existence since 1990.  The underlying vision and thrust of the HSCL scheme is preventative; therefore, it seeks to promote and develop real partnership between parents, schools and communities, in order to enhance pupils' outcomes and learning opportunities, through improved attendance, participation and retention in the education system.</p> <p>  The role of the HSCL co-ordinator is to work primarily with the salient adults in the child's life, in order to empower them, so that they can better support their children to attend school, participate in education and develop positive attitudes to life-long learning.  Central to the HSCL initiative is the identification of educational needs and the provision of a tailored and proportionate response to those needs, through a range of interventions, which are evidence-based, focused and structured.</p> <p>  All DEIS urban primary and DEIS post-primary schools are included in the HSCL scheme, which serves 539 schools.  The scheme is delivered by 416 full-time HSCL co-ordinators, with 235 at primary and 181 at post-primary level, who are teachers in these schools and assigned to HSCL duties either in individual schools or clusters of schools, catering for approximately 156,000 pupils.  The current cost of this provision to our Department is &euro;25 million.  For DEIS schools included in the HSCL scheme, it is a requirement that at least 10% of the annual DEIS grant to each school should be allocated for use on HSCL activities and made available to the HSCL co-ordinator.  The total allocation for the DEIS grant from our Department is approximately &euro;16 million.</p> <p>  The post of HSCL co-ordinator is required to be rotated at least every five years in order to provide greater opportunities to gain experience for teachers in the area of educational disadvantage, and, in turn, to bring experience gained in the role back into the school to complement teaching and learning in the classroom.</p><p>This arrangement serves to develop experience and build capacity within the teaching staff in the important area of parental engagement and identification of the challenges in the home background of particular pupils.  HSCL co-ordinators, as agents of change in schools, work in an integrated way with all other support services, particularly school completion, SCP, staff and educational welfare officers, to implement a whole-school approach to improving attendance, participation and retention in education for the most marginalised and educationally disadvantaged pupils.  They also have a critical role in supporting the development, implementation, evaluation and review of the school&rsquo;s DEIS plan, particularly through parental involvement interventions that are designed to improve literacy, numeracy and positive engagement.</p><p> HSCL co-ordinators also play a key role in effecting successful transitions through the education continuum: from preschool to primary school; from primary school to second level; within second level from junior to senior cycle; and onwards through appropriate pathways to further and higher education.  The role of the HSCL coordinator is to empower parents to support their child&rsquo;s education and to ensure parents are linked in with the various stages of the education continuum by facilitating engagement between teaching and other staff and parents.</p><p> I thank the members for the opportunity to address the committee today.

For&oacute;ige provides a broad range of services and programmes to young people, families and communities across Ireland.  For&oacute;ige engages with young people aged from ten to18 to enable them to achieve their full potential regardless of their backgrounds or the challenges that they face.  We achieve this through the provision of universal and targeted youth services and education programmes that are proven to deliver positive outcomes for young people.  For&oacute;ige works with more than 50,000 young people, helping them to build the skills, resilience and belief in their own individual ability to reach their full potential.  For&oacute;ige&rsquo;s work is embedded in communities across Ireland and is a unique partnership between young people, parents, volunteers, and the community.</p> <p>  Involvement in youth work benefits all young people.  It is a strong preventative factor in delaying young people&rsquo;s experimentation with substances and also helps develop their skills to reduce the harms associated with alcohol and substance misuse.  For&oacute;ige operates a number of drug prevention and education projects around the country which work with young people, parents and families in delivering a range of evidence-based educational and awareness programmes along with providing support and training to schools and others in the community.  The aim of all of these programmes is to reduce or delay drug and alcohol use among young people.  This is achieved through the delivery of primary and secondary drug prevention programmes for young people as well as training and support for parents, schools and community-based organisations.</p> <p>  My colleague, Mr. P&aacute;draig O'Donovan, will now tell the committee more about the strengthening families programme.</p></speech>

This programme aims to reduce risk factors around alcohol and drug use, mental health challenges and criminal behaviour.  It does this by increasing family strengths, developing young people&rsquo;s social competencies and improving positive parenting skills.  The SFP has been identified as a programme that delivers a range of proven benefits for families and young people because of the unique way in which it engages parents and young people together.</p><p>The programme structure is that families enjoy a meal for the first hour of each weekly session and then separate into their respective groups - parents, teen or child - for the next hour for a skills based workshop.  The family are brought back together for the final hour to practise some of the skills they have learned.  Transport and child care for young people are provided where practicable and financially possible in order to reduce barriers and enable families to fully participate in the programme.</p><p> The strengthening famiilies programme was introduced to Ireland in 2007.  The National strengthening famiilies programme Council of Ireland was established to ensure adherence to the fidelity of the programme and best practice guidelines, to provide training and to bring together co-ordinators and trainers to share their knowledge and experience.  Since 2007, in excess of 1,500 families have graduated from the programme.  This is the number of families who have linked in with the council.  There are other programmes but these numbers are not recorded.  The council is not funded and exists only because a number of key agencies support it with staff and time.</p><p> The strengthening famiilies programme, SFP, has been delivered in County Kildare since 2008 and is co-ordinated by the For&oacute;ige drug prevention and education initiative.  Delivery involves a number of statutory, community and voluntary partners, including social work, drugs education, youth and probation services, family resource centres and the County Kildare Leader partnership.  This year, the first independent evaluation of SFP in Kildare was commissioned with a particular focus on 2014-2016.  The results of the evaluation highlighted significant improvements in family communication and relationships, child behaviour, parental competencies and confidence.  This also leads to reduced service utilisation by families.  Families reported being better able to deal with problems and to spend more time together as a family.  Some parents also reported increased trust, self-esteem and social skills among children.  Parents indicated an improvement in school attendance and behaviour in school.  The following is a quotation from one parent interviewed for the evaluation: "The teachers couldn't get over the change in him.  Before, he had to sit on his own.....but now he's interacting back in the class."</p><p> The strengthening famiilies programme has been identified as a fit for families in cases where schools are facing challenges with young people who have very little structure in their lives, which may be due to inconsistent parenting and family experiences.  SFP has the ability to bring about positive change for whole families rather than just focusing on the one identified problem child.  Parents relationships with schools also improves as they gain useful skills and confidence to engage better with teachers allowing for a unified approach to working with the young person.  Schools are very enthusiastic about the programme, which is highly regarded by principals and teaching staff who see first-hand the benefits to pupils and parents of engagement in the programme. </p></speech>

The success of the programme in Kildare is due to the inter-agency collaboration, which is a core part of its delivery.  It relies on the support and involvement of link workers and facilitators whose time is given by statutory and community agencies to support and implement the delivery of the programme. Co-ordination of the programme is a significant undertaking in terms of the time and resources required to oversee all of the elements of the programme from referrals and home visits to co-ordinating the steering group and weekly programme sessions.  Given the success of the model, the proven outcomes and the demand for places on the programme, our ambition for the programme in County Kildare and elsewhere is that a role be funded to oversee the delivery of the strengthening famiilies programme.</p> <p>  The strengthening famiilies programme has been shown to reduce risk factors and increase protective factors for families and for young people.  The programme works because it is a unique relationship building and community engagement piece by For&oacute;ige and its partners.  The evaluation report clearly demonstrates the benefits of the programme and outlines the need for a sustainable funding structure to be put in place.  There is a clear appetite to see this programme delivered more widely.  For&oacute;ige is committed to supporting the delivery of the strengthening famiilies programme in Kildare and elsewhere and to maintaining the crucial interagency relationships that help achieve the desired outcomes.</p></speech>

I commend the incredible work being done, as well as the strengthening of families.  The demand for participation is indicative of the success of the programmes for families in need.  I will open the meeting to members and will then come back to the witnesses for answers.</p></speech>

We were this small group of people who were not actually in a classroom teaching.  It was quite a challenge to convince colleagues that we were actually doing a real job because people had this impression that one was drinking tea with parents all the time.  It took a while to establish oneself.  Building a profile in the community I found was the first challenge.  One had to become known in the community, be visible around the community and be accepted in the community because back in the early 1990s, communities such as Darndale, which were quite new, were very suspicious of people in authority.  The initial assumption was that we were social workers and that we were there to spy on families and to interfere in the family home and get information.  Building comfort and assuring people that one was there to support them and not to obstruct or interfere was very important.</p> <p>  At present, the scheme is widely accepted because we now have 416 people.  Over 27 years, many people who have been through the scheme are now school principals or are back in the classroom, or, like myself and Ms Tobin, have gone on to do other things.  The scheme is very well received.  Recently, I attended a European Union seminar at which representatives of the European Union's countries were impressed with this concept where teachers were released from the classroom to work in the community.  We are unique in that.  The scheme has gone from strength to strength and is an extremely effective scheme.  It is also staffed by really positive people, as the committee has gathered from our colleagues here, who are enthused about the work and who bring energy to their work every day.  It is fantastic that we have the five-year rotation, even though there may be objections to it.  The more teachers who experience this, the more those teachers learn about what is happening for families and the more realistic they become in their expectations.  </p> <p>  Certainly, the first message I brought back to teachers in my school was to not start the day demanding homework from kids who come from really challenging homes because straightaway one is setting up conflict.  One should welcome in the children and do positive things to make them feel at home in school, rather than creating a problem before they even get in the door.  It is about enabling people to understand what is going on and enabling people to understand the reality of family life.  </p></speech>

I have one question on the For&oacute;ige scheme.  Mr. O'Donovan talked about inter-agency collaboration.  In theory that is a wonderful idea but, as we all know, it does not always work.  Do the representatives from For&oacute;ige find that it is working because, as Mr. O'Donovan said, collaboration and co-ordination of the programmes is important?</p></speech>

In Kildare we have four strategic partners, namely, For&oacute;ige ourselves, the south western regional drug and alcohol task force, the County Kildare Leader Partnership and Tusla.  These are the four key pillar organisations that support it.  We also have active involvement from a range of organisations, from the schools and the home school liaison officers to Kildare youth services, local drug addiction services, family resource centres and juvenile liaison officers in the Garda.  There is a steering group that Mr. O&rsquo;Donovan chairs, which oversees and co-ordinates the work both in terms of getting referrals into the programme and following up on those referrals.  Implementation of the programme requires all of those organisations to commit staff, time and resources to support the delivery of the programme.</p><p>It is very much reliant on that goodwill, but it is also very much a true inter-agency piece.</p></speech>

The kind of work that is done in this area and that is not necessarily seen is hugely important.  One of the big difficulties in areas where DEIS schools operate relates to parents engaging with those schools.  This is because many of them had bad experiences at school and they literally do not want to come in the door of the school.  In that regard, our guests' role is really important.</p><p>Following on from that, I want to ask whether those of our guests who have that experience have recommendations on how schools might engage with parents a bit more.  In my constituency, Corpus Christi primary school in Moyross<b></b>brings parents in by means of encouraging them - mothers and fathers - to attend cooking classes there.  In that way, they are made to feel comfortable in the school.  Ms Tobin will be familiar with this.  I know other schools do that sort of thing.  Is there something more that schools can do to bring the families into schools as well as bringing the schools to the families by means of the work our guests do?</p><p>The principals of primary and post-primary DEIS schools in Limerick have a really good clustering system whereby they meet and work together.  Perhaps the witnesses could comment on clustering.</p><p>Ms Tobin and Deputy Madigan referred to measuring outcomes.  Does this happen?  Perhaps that is a question for the officials from the Department.</p><p>Does Tusla engage with the area-based childhood, ABC, programmes, which also come under the remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and which involve zoning in on really deprived communities and working with families from the birth of children onwards.  Is there some involvement with the ABC programmes, which are really good?</p><p>I have a final question.  I apologise to the Chair for asking so many.  A previous speaker referred to Traveller children.  Obviously, not all Traveller children and not all homeless children attend DEIS schools.  Are there children who are falling through the cracks?  Again, perhaps this is more a question for the Department.  I know of Traveller children who attend schools in an area that would be considered quite well-off generally.  They are not in DEIS schools but they do come from a very needy family.  Children in homeless accommodation would sometimes find themselves in a similar situation.  That may not always be the case because they might be able to continue to go to school in their own communities even though they are currently living in hotels or hubs.  Perhaps one of the witnesses could comment on how we can get to those children who are often the most vulnerable - by definition, they are the most vulnerable in many cases - and not allow them to fall through the cracks.</p></speech>

We will now take answers to those questions.</p></speech>

What can be done in schools is all about leadership.  If the leadership in the school is open and welcomes and embraces parents, then all kinds of things are possible.  Unfortunately, the opposite can be the case and the leadership might be fearful of parents or reluctant to engage.  There are many schools that make it quite difficult for parents to actually enter their premises.  We put up all kinds of barriers and buzzers and that makes it quite challenging.  Obviously, schools have to operate and function but there is room for interaction.  It is about accessibility and creating a welcoming atmosphere whereby all the adults on the school staff, if they see a parent, will pop over, say hello, and ask how they are and who they are looking for.  It is about creating that positive atmosphere.  My colleagues might have more to say about that.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the ABC programmes.  I am fortunate enough to have come from there.  I have been managing an ABC programme for the past ten years.  When one has been around as long as I have, one can dip one's toe into lots of different things.  Certainly, we are now embracing some of the really good, evidence-based work that is happening there, particularly through our school completion programme.  We have the opportunity to embed some of the evidence-based approaches in that programme.  We have also worked very closely with the home school community liaison scheme and the school completion programme.  Educational welfare officers are involved in quite a few of the ABC programmes.   We would absolutely see the benefits in this regard, particularly in the context of early intervention.</p> <p>  Another really good development is that it is now part of the home school liaison's role to engage with the children in preschool.  While many people would have been doing that already, it is now a part of the role that they have to embrace and manage the transition and support families before the children even arrive in a school.</p><p>Regarding Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's question about Traveller children and homeless children, the reality is that we know that approximately 50% of children who come from DEIS primary schools migrate to non-DEIS post-primary schools, which is a real challenge.  From our point of view, the one aspect of our service that serves all schools is the statutory education welfare services.  Where we find the need for support or where families come to our attention, we will support them but, again, we are quite a thin service.  We have one welfare officer for every 50 schools, so it is not a very comprehensive service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-07a.109" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Tobin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017110700002#R00200"><p>The home school community liaison teachers might take the final question - we were chatting about it earlier - but I am happy to address the question about outcomes and their measurement.  Through our CPD programme we deliver training in logic modelling to home schools.  We are working very hard at present to develop a culture of being outcomes-focused - in other words, looking at the desired outcome around attendance, participation and retention and then working backwards, looking at the initiatives we can use to improve these outcomes for children.  As one home school co-ordinator said in one of our CPD sessions once: "I work with parents but my job is not to fill the school with parents, but with children."  While the home school community liaison programme focuses on the adults in the child's life, our CPD programme is all about improving educational outcomes for children.  The logic model looks at those educational outcomes and the initiatives that would best serve those outcomes in the short, medium and long term.  The process is reviewed, a baseline is taken and, at the end of a term, the question is asked whether this initiative improved outcomes.  For example, did more of the marginalised parents attend the parent-teacher meeting?  If so, this is something we can do again and build on.  If not, we need to look at another initiative and another way of reaching those families.  That is very much on the top of our agenda at present.  While it is very helpful to do the soft courses of cookery, sewing and so on, as well as the literacy and numeracy programmes, we need to ensure that these are achieving the desired outcome, which is to keep the child in school.</p></speech>

To come in on the point about bringing parents into the school, we have heard back from many of our HSCL teachers that the increased demands for Garda vetting within schools are becoming a real challenge.  They are becoming somewhat of a barrier for some parents, particularly in socio-economically disadvantaged areas.  It is about getting the balance right, without compromising child protection and so on, obviously, in order that parents are comfortable, are welcome to come into the school and are not met with that additional barrier.  Some of them may have had experience in prison and so on, which is obviously a challenge.</p> <p>  Regarding Travellers, I reiterate that we propose that there would be possibly even a shared HSCL teacher in areas of high concentration of Travellers.  This might be not just for DEIS schools, but also for non-DEIS schools.  Another big gap is in special schools, where there is a very vulnerable group of children as well and a real need to link up the home and the school.  Given it has been such a successful scheme, consideration should be given to its expansion to those parents in order that they could have more involvement in the school and more interaction.</p></speech>

We have been in a very good position; we have had a parents' room.  Actually, at present it is a building site as we are in the middle of a new build, but we will have a new parents' room, I hope, in September 2018.  Our parents' room is open first thing in the morning.  It is a welcoming space.  It is a space for parents.  We facilitate the activities in that parents' room.</p><p>Ms Gannon and I, like previous HSCL teachers, make sure the parents have ownership of that room.  Parents come into the room, they feel welcome there, they talk to one another, and there is a space where they can talk in private if they need to talk to one of the HSCL teachers, but it is their room, their space.  It is there that they can talk to one another, share ideas, share problems and find solutions, working together.</p><p> Facilitating and providing courses for parents is also of huge importance.  These courses can be very simple - Ms Tobin referred to classes in sewing and painting and so on - but we have experienced in Newbridge that many target parents have many talents.  We have run many parent-led classes.  A dad came to do cookery classes with a group of parents over a number of weeks.  A mum came to work on cooking with parents as well.  That kind of parental engagement is super.  One does not always get it, but it is a big success.</p><p> Another thing in HSCL is that it is so difficult to measure one's success.  However, I remember two years ago speaking with my principal, Brian O'Reilly, while looking out the window at a group of parents whom we had encouraged to paint the yard for the kids.  There were times we drove around town calling out the windows at them.  I looked out the school window with my principal, Brian, and said: "That is success."  There was a mum who had had a terrible time, had been in prison and so on and had defied all the odds.  Her child was in school that day, and she was kneeling down painting a snake or something in the junior infants' yard.  That is huge success.  If we can offer that to a family or to one person, we are reaching our goal and we are getting there.  It is also a matter of opportunities to work with the classroom teachers.  We involve parents in science week and maths week, and parents come to work with groups of children for maths trails.  To get the parents into the school, we want them to feel they are part of this too and that it is not just the children and not just those teachers up there.  They are as much a part of the school as their children are.  We want them to feel it is a safe space for them to come to.</p></speech>

Because we have the service in our school, there are a number of families to whom we can provide a short-term intervention if a family circumstance changes.  If there is a separation of if there has been a bereavement or even a diagnosis of a special educational need within a family, we can step in, support the family and then step back out again, whereas in other schools that do not have the HSCL service, what started out as a small problem can escalate and have a huge detrimental effect on the overall education of the children involved.  This is something we must look at, together with the opportunities, if they arise, to expand the service.  There are families in every school, not just those in marginalised, disadvantaged areas or those that fall under the DEIS scheme, that need extra supports and extra intervention.  The HSCL scheme, its longevity and the history that goes with it show that it really is having a hugely beneficial impact, and that impact could be expanded.</p></speech>

Regarding the measuring of outcomes, under the new DEIS plan we will develop a monitoring and evaluation framework.  The idea of this is to be able to look comprehensively at DEIS and all the various interventions that are there, inform future delivery of educational disadvantage policy and use it as a way of feeding back information to the system in order to ensure improved performance at the system level.</p><p>We have just established an advisory implementation group, which involves a range of stakeholders.  One of the first sub-committees to be organised under that group will look at the issue of monitoring and evaluation, how we approach it, how we define the kinds of indicators we need to be timing and so on.</p><p> With regard to Traveller children, the system currently still has an additional &euro;10 million being allocated for Traveller children.  This is by the way of additional teaching posts and capitation grants for them.  It is acknowledged that there is a need to be met.  Within the DEIS plan we have specific actions in relation to Traveller education.</p></speech>

I am a big advocate of that programme and I believe that it does not get enough recognition.  The programme takes in a lot of children who otherwise may not be deemed suitable to access other services, such as children with mild learning difficulties or those with anxiousness around school.  I know the programme has had many funding cuts over the last years and it has already been operating on a shoestring budget.  What plans, if any, has Tusla for expanding or enhancing that service or is there any way of increasing funding to that programme? What can this committee do to support it? I believe that the school completion programme does not get enough recognition and it does a lot of valuable work.</p> <p>  My next query is similar to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's question.  What role can schools play in helping children who suffer from anxiety, even at primary school level?  There is a huge increase in this and, with all due respect to teachers, I do not believe they understand the level of worry that some children have when coming in to school.  It could be considered a minor thing, but it is a major deal to the children.  The school where my own two children go, for example, does a lot of work on mindfulness.  The school has mindfulness Tuesdays when there is no homework and pupils have to do an activity that is not related to technology.  It is a small thing but those kinds of steps get children talking about it.  Do the witnesses have any experiences or examples of that?</p> <p>  I support Ms McCafferty's point on the home school community liaison, HSCL, teachers not being social workers and counsellors.  This is an excellent point.  They are already doing a very difficult job and they should not be asked to take on that role.</p></speech>

There are 124 school completion programmes around the State serving 700 schools.  These are predominantly DEIS schools but we also have some non-DEIS schools that feed in to DEIS schools.  This scheme has been in place since 2002.  It followed on from its predecessors the 8-15 early school leaver initiative and the stay in school initiative.  The school completion programme currently has funding of &euro;24.7 million per annum - and as the Deputy has correctly said, between 2010 and 2011 when the austerity cuts hit there was a 25% cutback in budget - so it has come from a budget of some &euro;32 million.  There has been stability and since it came in to Tusla we have managed to stop the gap so the funding has remained stable.</p> <p>  We are very fortunate that our parent department, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, has managed to generate a fairly significant funding increase for Tusla.  There are multiple demands on that funding, but as part of our budget bid this year one of our demands was for an increase of 5% of funding towards school completion.  The budget has arrived in Tusla now and we are working on it internally.  I am confident that we will get an increased allocation for next year.  We have to recognise that a commitment has been made to the new schools that have come in to the DEIS programme and that they must be included in the school completion programme from September 2018.  Some of the increase in our funding will have to go towards including those schools but I am certainly optimistic.  It is a very small increase in funding, but it is a start.  It is one of the matters we spoke about with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone.</p> <p>  There is significant reform underway in terms of school completion, such as a very significant continuing professional development programme, similar to the home school liaison programme CPD, because there had not been CPD within school completion for some time.</p><p>School completion staff had six days of continuing professional development, CPD, last year.  There are also some significant issues around governance that we must address.  That is under way at the moment and I am confident in that regard.  Tusla is 100% committed to the programme.  This sounds like a broken record, but I will say it again, I spent six years working in school completion and I can see the benefit of the programme.  All of the programmes working seamlessly together really do make a difference to children.  School completion is primarily targeted at children who are most at risk, or children who may have dropped out of the school system.  It makes a real difference to children who are right on the margins.  Our commitment is definitely to grow the scheme and, over the coming years, to try restore some of the funding that has been lost, especially as the State is now in a better economic situation.</p></speech>

This is something that comes up, and has come up more in the past, especially in Meitheal.  We are responsible for induction CPD to newly appointed home school community liaison, HSCL, co-ordinators.  As part of that induction we make it very clear to HSCL co-ordinators that they are experts in education.  This is why the Department of Education and Skills invests this money to ensure that teachers who are released from teaching duty can reach out to families to give them guidance and support, around the parents' own education and their child's education.  When Meitheal was set up as part of Tusla's partnership and family support network we saw this as an opportunity to support the community aspect of the HSCL co-ordinator role.  They have always had a role around linking parents to supports within the community.  In the CPD for newly appointed co-ordinators we say that their role is to refer, refer, refer - unless it is an educational issue.  Then the co-ordinator has the expertise to offer the support.</p> <p>  With regard to Meitheal, sometimes the school may be the first place where additional needs are identified.  With educational needs, be they behavioural or learning support, sometimes there are additional needs and particularly with behavioural issues in school or with school refusal.  Additional support may be needed in these cases and they need a wraparound support service within the community.  From this point of view, Meitheal is a vehicle for co-ordinators to actually access that support so that the group of professionals who can best support that family can be brought around the table.  This is with complete consultation with the parent because the parent must agree to this process.  It cannot happen without the permission of the parent.  The professionals can then engage.  The HSCL co-ordinator is part of that team, but only part of the team with regard to educational support.  If the primary need is an educational one, the HSCL co-ordinator may take the lead on the plan to support the family.  If the primary need is not an educational one they will be part of the Meitheal team but certainly not as social workers.  It is important the HSCL co-ordinators maintain their role as educators and experts in that area.  We support that and we would always fight to maintain it.  It is, however, very much a co-operative approach.  Meitheal is about co-operation, linking and engaging, with support from other family support services in the community.  I hope this clarifies the matter for the committee.</p></speech>

This is done through the curriculum subject of social, personal and health education, SPHE.  In DEIS schools there are two excellent programmes - the incredible years teaching management programme and the friends first volunteer programme - that focus on well-being and mental health.  In addition, teachers are doing yoga, mindfulness and meditation with their pupils in the classroom.  Deputy Funchion is correct that it is one of the key issues we hear about from all teachers, not just from HSCL teachers, around the increasing anxiety and mental health issues in very young children.  Together with that, test anxiety is a particular issue and it is not helped that there is an increasing emphasis on standardised testing, and that standardised tests are being used to determine resources.  It increases the stakes; it puts more pressure on parents, teachers and everybody.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is restructuring the primary school curriculum.</p><p>Submissions have come in and they strongly suggest that there needs to be more emphasis on well-being, which is one of the biggest topics at present.</p></speech>

We have more time than the class teacher or the principal, who have many other things to look after during their day.  We can liaise with classroom teachers and if a child gives a sign that they need to go outside for a moment, do their breathing technique or go to the "quieten down" space in a room we can intervene at an early point in their anxiety trip.  The existing programmes also help in this regard.  The HSCL also feeds into care teams within schools and into the overall school support structure and we can help inform on where anxiety is more likely.  Our relationship with parents also helps the process.</p></speech>

There are a number of goals in the DEIS plan around well-being and priority will be given to ensuring a year's training is provided to all DEIS schools at the beginning.</p></speech>

Can the officials from the Department indicate what is the maximum number?  Does it mean home-school liaison teachers share schools?  The education welfare officer is integrated into the system but what is the maximum number of schools of which an education welfare officer is in charge?  How does it work?  Is there an overload and, if there is, what are the plans to address it?</p> <p>  I commend the work on a successful transition from primary to second level but if a student breaks a generational cycle in their family, gets to leaving certificate and does well, what happens next?  Do we need to look at supports for the transition from second level to third level?  Do the witnesses agree that children are slipping through at this stage and, if so, are there any plans to address it?  The goal is to get children to benefit from a school education but with our one-size-fits-all curriculum it is hard to captivate a child.  Is this something we need to examine?  Do we need to look at the apprenticeship scheme in Germany as an option?</p> <p>  Is there any language barrier in this area?  We have very rich, diversified, international communities in our schools and this is something we must treasure and embrace.  Are there enough supports for teachers?  One might need to explain to a family that both the parents and children can benefit from this but what supports are provided where there is a language barrier?</p> <p>  What do the teachers feel about DEIS inspections?  Have they experienced them?  Has the Department gathered any data about what might be working well or what supports and resources may be lacking?</p></speech>

This service came into Tusla in 2014 when the National Educational Welfare Board ceased to exist.  The service struggled during the time of the National Educational Welfare Board because of the recruitment embargo and when staff left, they were not replaced.  When the service came into Tusla in January 2016, we had just over 60 educational welfare officers, EWOs.  By the end of 2017, we will have 90 - an increase of 50% - which is not massive but which is significant.  We have approximately 4,000 schools so members can do the maths themselves.  We were working at an average of 70 schools per EWO.  By the end of this year, however, it will be down to below 50 and our intention is to reduce it incrementally in the coming years.  By the end of 2018, I would like it to be, at most, 40 per EWO.</p> <p>  We work across a large expanse of schools and we are not meeting needs early enough.  We work through a referrals system but we are not able to get to referrals quickly enough.  We have to give priority to students who do not have places in schools, who have been expelled from school or who have special needs that prevent them from accessing places in schools.  I would like to get to children before the 20 days from when they are referred but, unfortunately, we do not have the capacity to do that.  There are 120 education welfare officers in Northern Ireland and, using that figure as a comparison, we would need 300 to really run the service.  I am pleased with the support within Tusla.  We are getting the support and the extra staff to grow the team incrementally.  We are gathering good data and are able to identify the areas in which new staff are needed.  In north Dublin, for example, particularly the area around Balbriggan, we are allocating extra staff because the population there is growing and there are different needs and, as the Acting Chairman noted, different cultures.</p> <p>  The Acting Chairman also asked about apprenticeships.  I attended school in the 1960s and 1970s.  When one finished primary school, one was guided to the academic school or the vocational school.  People made a choice at that stage and many of my friends went to vocational schools.  They have done a lot better than I have because they learned trades and have set up their own businesses.  We have to value different forms of education and there is too much emphasis on the academic element.  It has been said that the Irish workforce is overly qualified and that people with third-level degrees are working in McDonalds or Tesco.  This is not necessary so we have to value different approaches.  The FETAC scheme has been a fantastic development in that young people can now get into third-level education through multiple routes.  I refer, for example to plc courses, by means of which they work their way up to degree level.  We have to have multiple points of entry but if a young person wants to make a choice, the alternatives - as is the case in many other countries - should be available.</p></speech>

There are clustering arrangements between schools.  At a national level, we look at feeder primary schools for local post-primary schools.  If they exist, we would have one HSCL co-ordinator shared between two primary schools and these would link with the co-ordinator in the post-primary school.  These decisions are based on the level of disadvantage and the enrolment numbers for the schools in question.  The Department of Education and Skills looks at the deprivation index in determining the allocation of supports for schools.  Nevertheless, we would certainly welcome the allocation of additional HSCL co-ordinators because it would be wonderful to see, particularly if the funding permitted.  Not all children in DEIS primary schools will transition to a DEIS post-primary school.  As a result, there is every chance that a child who has been supported in primary school will go into a large school aged 12 and there will be no HSCL or support to follow the child and ensure that he or she makes a successful transition.  I am a former guidance counsellor and I believe that successful transition involves a full year, not just getting a child from one school to another.  It would involve giving continual support to the family and the child throughout the first year because children are very vulnerable at this time.</p><p>As Tusla education and welfare services, we have concerns about attendance and dropout in first year.  It can be the start of a very slippery slope and impact on retention going forward.</p></speech>

We have also heard back from our home school community liaison, HSCL, teachers that some non-national parents are not comfortable with the practice of somebody coming into their home.  It is just not something that would be in their own culture. In that event we would say it should be permitted to have the visitations at school.  Obviously we recognise the importance of going into the home, but where the need is there it should be all right to have them in the school.</p></speech>

It certainly is an issue, and it is something we come across almost on a daily basis when we are out and about working with parents.  As teachers, we are very creative by nature.  If we are trying to talk to or to explain something to a parent and there is a language barrier, we will try everything we can to get our message across.  I have been in homes where I have used Google to try to communicate something important.</p> <p>  However, there is no provision to employ interpreters.  In our school, interpreters are paid to be there.  For example, if there is an important meeting about a child's progress or if there is a concern, the school will pay for an interpreter in order that nothing is lost in translation and we are sure that the parent is fully informed and understands the key message.</p> <p>  Whatever language we speak, our role is to help and support all parents and another very important thing is that international parents feel that they are welcome in the school.  We are lucky in the junior school in that we have an English as an additional language, EAL, teacher.  That is Ms Mary Lenihan, who is here with us today.  In the senior school they do not but we run international days and work together to involve those parents in the school as well.  For the children, the important thing is understanding and accepting.  </p> <p>  However, it is a major issue and is definitely a barrier.  It concerns the funding, because the cost of an interpreter for even a 30-minute meeting is huge.  Schools will do it for the good of the child, because schools always do it, but it is something that definitely needs to be taken into consideration. </p></speech>

As Ms Tobin said, the allocation is based on the level of disadvantage in the school and the number of targeted students.  Consequently, in some schools where there are smaller enrolments, one will cluster the schools in order that they meet that level.  We would normally say 100 targeted pupils per HSCL.  At present, there is no plan to increase that but under the delivery of equal opportunity in schools, DEIS, action plan, various provisions, including the HSCL, are being looked at.  We are looking at re-clustering HSCL as well, for better alignment with the school completion programme, SCP, and other school clustering arrangements.</p> <p>  As for supporting transitions, a key goal under the DEIS plan is supporting transitions at every level, including from post-primary to third level and further education.  One of the actions in this regard is that there would be formal arrangements with HSCL, guidance counsellors, further education providers and access officers at third level to ensure that transfer programmes and transitioning are improved and streamlined for students who may not be able to do it on their own. </p> <p>  On the question of what is working well, as I said earlier the monitoring and evaluation framework we are trying to develop aims to look at all the individual components.  We know from research already on DEIS that it has had a very positive impact.  What we do not know is what individual pieces of DEIS are causing that, whether it is the suite of programmes or individual components of it.  We need to look at that.  However, we do know from the evaluation to date, conducted by the Educational Research Centre, ERC and by our own inspectorate, that DEIS is working overall. </p></speech>

From the engagement we have with the inspectorate at Tusla level, there has certainly been a fairly significant change from the way inspections would have been previously.  Previously, inspections were very much about fault-finding.  Inspections now have become much more about support.  They are about finding where the weaknesses are and enabling and supporting schools to intervene to address them.  The inspectorate is seen as a critical friend now rather than just a critic, as it would have been in the past.  The people who are in the schools might be better able to explain what it feels like, because it is still quite intimidating.  I know this because I have been chair of the board of a school, and it is quite a challenge.  It is a big issue for a school because we have to get everything ready.  All policies have to be ready, and one does not know who the inspectorate is going to call into or at what time, so teachers have to be fully ready and up to date.  Certainly, however, in my recent experience of it as chair of the board of a school, I found it to be very positive and encouraging.  The inspectorate picked up on areas of weakness in the school that need to be addressed and gave some very positive tips as to how to do that.</p></speech>

The State itself has invested &euro;190 million in DEIS.  The Department of Education and Skills has put in &euro;115 million of that sum.  That is an additional &euro;5 million for the remainder of this year.  Some of that goes to additional psychologists to address the issue that was raised a few minutes ago, as well as additional home school community liaison, HSCL, posts, which were assigned to the new schools that were announced in the programme earlier in the year.</p></speech>

Everything ran late in the Chamber although we were on time.</p> <p>  I will not go over old ground, because I am interested in looking back and reading the transcripts later to take in the debate and the engagement.  I have no doubt that some recommendations came from it.  That is what is really important from today's hearing with all of the witnesses and with comments from the members, that we have the opportunity to make recommendations on the scheme.  It is an absolutely excellent one, but there are always ways of strengthening, improving and promoting, particularly concerning resources that are needed.  </p> <p>  I am sure there was debate on the schools that do not have DEIS status but absolutely need to have the benefit of the HSCL scheme.  That is really a key issue, because often in the same town we have schools that have DEIS status and schools that do not, but they are both dealing with levels of disadvantage.  Moreover, we should not forget that in every single school there are levels of disadvantage, and there are children and families who really need those extra supports through the HSCL scheme and the strengthening families programme.  </p> <p>  That came out very clearly in the presentation that I saw with Mr. O'Donovan and Mr. Leeson, and among the teachers and schools that were involved.  One of the principals spoke about the needs of their own school, and I could not have agreed more in the case of that particular school.  Two thirds of the principal's time was taken up with issues that need to be addressed by the HSCL.  If there is an appeal or a recommendation that we could make, apart from all the other elements, it is that we absolutely need to have more of the schools that deserve it being given DEIS status.  It is important not to forget those schools that may never be in the DEIS programme, but still have children who are suffering.  They need all our help and support. </p> <p>  On behalf of all the committee, I thank all the representatives for attending and for their engagement.  It was very insightful and informative.  I know the members learned a lot, and I know I have more to learn when I read the transcripts later on.  If there is anything that they would like to add to the debate, please feel free to send it on to the members after the meeting.  It will be circulated to all the members, and we will do our best to include it in the final report where we will be making recommendations to the Minister.  We will have an extra session now with the competitors who presented at the WorldSkills competition, in which SOLAS were involved.</p><p>I understand they are going to the T&aacute;naiste's office.  They will probably be back with us soon, so I suggest we suspend for ten minutes.  Perhaps we might check with the T&aacute;naiste's office on the timing.  If we need to suspend for longer, we will.  It is very important that we have the opportunity to speak to the witnesses and congratulate them.  Seven gold medals is fantastic.  I suggest we go into private session now.</p></speech>

The purpose of this part of the meeting is to welcome the Irish team who represented Ireland at the WorldSkills competition in Abu Dhabi.  They won seven medallions for excellence which is fantastic and an excellent achievement.  Every one of the competitors should be very proud and I have no doubt that they and their colleges, families and workplaces are very proud.</p> <p>  We are very interested to hear about the witnesses' experiences as both apprentices and as competitors at the competition.  On behalf of the committee, I would like to welcome Paul O'Toole, CEO of Seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Oideachais Lean&uacute;naigh agus Scileanna, SOLAS, John Twohig, chairman of WorldSkills Ireland, and medallion winners, Eoin Shortall, Colum Farrelly, Gavin Lyne, Kevin Hough, Kathlyn Leahy and Aaron Ronan.  I also welcome the following people who are in Public Gallery: Ray English, Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, an official delegate to the WorldSkills and Donal Keys, chair of the DIT IrelandSkills organising committee, and Tim O'Halloran, Cork Institute of Technology, chair of CIT's IrelandSkills organising committee and WorldSkills expert in construction metalwork, and Michael Hourihan, head of the centre of craft studies.</p><p>Mr. Tim O'Halloran is the chair of the Cork Institute of Technology, CIT Ireland skills organising committee and WorldSkills expert in construction metalwork, and Mr. Michael Hourihan is the head of the Centre of Craft Studies at the CIT and skill completion manager for electrical installations at WorldSkills.  Mr. Hourihan was here as a witness before, when the committee addressed the issue of the importance of apprenticeships and skills in further education.<br/><br/>I also welcome Nikki Gallagher, the director of communications and secretariat at SOLAS.  We have engaged with Mr. Gallagher both as a witness and outside.  He is doing a wonderful job.  I also want to particularly welcome the other members of the Irish team which participated in the 2017 WorldSkills competition, namely David Donegan, Brendan Muldowney, Stephen Murray, Jane McSwiney, Sean Hogan, Gary Horgan, John Cassidy, Maria Walsh, Eimear Smith and Emma Kelly.  You are all very welcome.  I understand that you are going to have a reception with your family and friends afterwards.  Thank you very much for the invitation to the committee to attend.  I am sure one of us will be able to attend for a few minutes. <br/><br/>The format of this part of the meeting is as follows.  I will invite you to make a brief opening statement.  That will be followed by a short engagement with the members of the committee on any questions or comments that the members have.  You will get the opportunity to reply.<br/><br/>Before we begin, there are some formalities that I need to get out of the way.  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by myself as Chair to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <br/><br/>I wish to advise that any opening statements made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting, and I remind committee members of the same.<br/><br/>I now call on Mr. Paul O'Toole, who will make the opening statement on behalf of SOLAS.</p></speech>

On behalf of SOLAS I would like to thank the committee for the opportunity to attend today, and in particular for your support for the team over the past few months.  At the outset, I would like to congratulate the Chair of WorldSkills Ireland, Mr. John Twohig, the organising committee and in particular the team for their fantastic achievement at the WorldSkills Competition 2017 in Abu Dhabi.  I wish to add that Mr. Twohig and the support team from the Cork Institute of Technology and the Education and Training Board go above and beyond in their support for the team.  It is something very special to them, and they demonstrate that all of the time.<br/><br/>Mr. Twohig and the team members will speak to you in detail about the WorldSkills Competition itself.  I would like to concentrate on how the WorldSkills Competition and the great ambassadors we have here today are helping to promote the standing of apprenticeship and traineeship.  However, I would like to first mention the role of SOLAS and the relationship with the WorldSkills team. <br/><br/>SOLAS is a funder of the Irish WorldSkills team.  The other organisations that contributed to the 2017 WorldSkills budget are the Dublin Institute of Technology, the Cork Institute of Technology, the Technological Higher Education Association, the Higher Education Authority and the Education and Training Boards.  SOLAS is a member of the WorldSkills Ireland organising committee, and a member of SOLAS attended the competition as an official observer.  As the committee will be aware, SOLAS has also provided communications support to the team. <br/><br/>As members will recall, when we met earlier this year to discuss apprenticeship, this committee emphasised a number of areas that should be addressed to support the development of apprenticeship in Ireland.  These included running a promotional campaign through social media, expanding the range of apprenticeships and encouraging employers to participate in apprenticeship programmes.  It is important to acknowledge that the vast majority of the WorldSkills team are apprentices and therefore employed.  The team has received huge support from their respective employers throughout the competition.  Without this support, the team would not have achieved the level of success it did.<br/><br/>A number of promotional activities for apprenticeship are under way.  We have developed a central website called <i>apprenticeship.ie</i>which is a one-stop shop for information on apprenticeship.  This has been welcomed by career guidance councillors in particular.  We have been running a social media campaign across Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram.  Our WorldSkills team has featured extensively in this campaign.</p><p>The level of engagement has increased exponentially over recent months, particularly regarding any posts about the team.  For example, the post announcing the results reached almost 100,000 people on Facebook alone.</p><p> I believe that in Ireland we are beginning to recognise the valuable career options that apprenticeships, traineeships, and further education and training can offer young people.  It was encouraging to see these options feature prominently in discussions and commentary about the leaving certificate this year.  This was also reflected in the level of media coverage for the team across national and local print, broadcast and online platforms, including RT&Eacute; news.  This not only built a bank of support for the team and recognised their fantastic achievement, it also created an opportunity to showcase Irish skills and contribute to the national dialogue about apprenticeships.</p><p> I will now hand over to Mr. Twohig and the team.  I am sure the committee will find it fascinating and valuable to hear about their experience representing Ireland on the world stage.</p></speech>

I would like to provide a short overview of the steps that occur in Ireland ahead of every WorldSkills Competition and how our team is selected.  The Department of Education and Skills introduced national and international skills competitions to Ireland in 1957.  Ireland has participated in all competitions since, with approximately 20,000 apprentices and technicians participating.  Since 1957, Ireland has hosted the competition twice, in Dublin in 1963 and in Cork in 1971.</p> <p>  The competitions were originally known as the National Apprentice Competitions but are now called WorldSkills Competitions.  The WorldSkills Ireland Council runs 26 national competitions each year and the Irish WorldSkills team is selected from our national competitions.  Competitors who take part in the WorldSkills Ireland and WorldSkills competitions are selected from their respective skills and trades, based on their competence and ability to complete test projects to the highest international standards, under pressure from fixed time schedules and requirements for precise dimensions and control.  During the period from 1957 to 2017, 37 competitions have been held and we have sent a total of 698 competitors.  Some 193 medals have been won; 61 gold, 53 silver and 79 bronze.</p> <p>  Up to 1961, the competing countries were mainly European, with the exception of Morocco in 1953 and 1955, which at that time was a north African Spanish protectorate.  In 1962, Japan participated in the competition for the first time and the International Vocation Training Organisation, IVTO, now evolved into a world organisation.  The organisation has grown over the years, and is now known as WorldSkills International.  With a membership of 79 countries, it holds biennial skill competitions and is engaged in other skill promotion activities around the world.</p> <p>  Last year we were delighted to have 140 competitors from all over Ireland compete for the Department of Education and Skills silver medal in their respective skills.  Institutes of technology and education and training boards facilitated this competition, along with the highly skilled competitors who represent the very best in Irish industry and education.  A team of 14 competitors were chosen to compete in the 44th WorldSkills competition which was held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates from 14 to 19 October 2017.  The competitors were selected from the 2016 and 2017 National Skills finalists.  The selection process started in early 2017.</p> <p>  The team travelled to Abu Dhabi to showcase their skills and talents in the following areas: aircraft maintenance, automobile technology, beauty therapy, cabinetmaking, heavy vehicle maintenance, construction metal work, electrical installations, industrial control, joinery, plastering and dry wall systems, plastic die engineering, plumbing and heating, restaurant service, and welding.  Each member of the Irish team, all of whom are under 25 years of age, has proven expertise in their chosen field, having competed against their peers to secure their places at the competition. </p> <p>  We were very proud to have the team come home with a total of seven medallions for excellence and a Best of Nation award. Medallions for excellence are awarded to those competitors who achieve above-average scores in their contest areas and the Best of Nation is awarded to the competitor who gains the highest points or highest medal in the team of their country or region.</p></speech>

The whole competition was an incredible experience, even the training.  It was above industry-standard training for WorldSkills.  We are trained to a very high level at our training colleges but to do WorldSkills training is something else again.  It is going to be very beneficial in years to come.</p></speech>

I found the experience was really good also.  I thought that the training was good from the perspective that a lot of the skills that I had to train for are not used in industry anymore.  It is really hard to see them practiced.  It will always stand to me that I can demonstrate skills that many people cannot.</p></speech>

For me the highlight was the training, which was great.  I could never get it anywhere else.  I might never train like that again.

It is good to get the feedback in terms of your experiences and that it is an experience that will stay with you for the rest of their lives.  It is phenomenal to up one's skills and compete on a world stage.  I was reading the newspaper this morning and I saw that Aisling Rock from Galway Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, was named European Young Chef on Monday in Barcelona.  I think it is worth mentioning here.  This committee has put a great deal of emphasis on the whole area of skills and apprenticeships.  We are doing our best to encourage young people to take up those options.  We wish the witnesses very well.</p> <p>  I call Deputy Martin.</p></speech>

We are very fortunate to have such fine ambassadors like the witnesses show-casing their talents and skills on a world stage.  I think the witnesses are doing fantastic work promoting apprenticeships and traineeships.  I am curious to know whether the witnesses felt they got enough encouragement and support from career guidance counsellors in school in taking up apprenticeships.  I would like to ask Ms Leahy what can be done to get more women involved.  Perhaps the gentlemen might have something to say as well.</p><p>Mr O'Toole mention the need for social media promotion and I would like to congratulate him on the website <i>apprenticeship.ie </i>and the reach of 100,000 on Facebook.  Well done on that.  It is great to see the progress that is being made.</p></speech>

I will go home to my two sons and tell them all about the work done.  It is incredible to see.  I do not mind who answers this, but I would like to ask some questions on a personal level.  What do the witnesses think they could have done better?  What would they do differently?  What did they learn from their competitors?  The witnesses did incredibly well.  Seven medallions for excellence is really incredible.  From their personal experience, is there one thing they feel they could have thought of, or that they might have done differently?</p></speech>

It is a wonderful honour for them to represent their country and to have done so well.  I would like to ask a question and any one of the witnesses can answer.  The training in advance of the finals was mentioned.  How many other countries were the Irish team competing against?</p></speech>

It is enough that the witnesses are here and that we recognise what they did.  It is very important that they come to the Oireachtas.  They probably know that means that the State, the Government and the Parliament is extremely proud of all of them, their mentors and staff and the work that they have done.  The thing that we need to do as Members of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad is ensure we get a lot more people into apprenticeships and traineeships, and learning skills.  We must ensure that people see that as a viable opportunity, both in the types of craft skills our witnesses are involved in and in other types of apprenticeships that are coming on stream.  I know that good work is being done, and we are going to have to do a whole lot more about it.  The witnesses have demonstrated that we can be among the best in the world and that we can do these things not through the traditional educational system, but through the apprenticeship route.  Someone asked one of my colleagues on a doorstep where apprenticeships have gone.  People feel they are not as available.  Our witnesses are showing that apprenticeships are available, that they are a real option for people, that learning skills is real, and that we can beat and be with the best in the world, so comhghairdeas.  Sincere congratulations to all of the witnesses and I thank them for the example that they are setting.  I know that some of them will be back here when they are running companies, or in other capacities in the future.  They are not going to stay at the bottom rung; I am certain of that.  They will be right at the top.</p></speech>

I noted that Ireland hosted the WorldSkills Competition in 1963 and 1979.  I think it is about time that we hosted one again.  I wonder if there are any plans to do that because, as my colleagues have said, the ambassadors we have here set an example.  It is a great news story.  We do not always have the opportunity to have good news stories in the D&aacute;il or in this committee, so it is wonderful to be able to celebrate the witnesses' incredible achievements with them.</p> <p>  Regarding the questions that have been asked, I am happy to go back to any of the witnesses who may indicate.  I know there was one particular one to Ms Leahy.  We will not focus on her straightaway if she wants time to think about a response.  If witnesses want to respond to any of the queries, I will call on them if they raise their hand.  I call Mr. Farrelly.</p></speech>

In my personal experience, apprenticeships were not promoted enough and education was very college-focused.  However, many people do not get on so well in school, but they are very good with their hands.  It is quite hard to promote the fact that doing an apprenticeship, one can excel at a craft with one's hands, as opposed to going to college and potentially dropping out.  I did not even know the WorldSkills Competition existed until a couple of years ago, and I am not really a sporting person so I never thought I would be able to represent my country.  It is very important to promote the WorldSkills Competition and apprenticeships early on in schools.</p></speech>

It was all about nursing, teaching and so on.  When I was doing my leaving certificate, I spent a lot of time looking at the Central Applications Office form, because I knew exactly what I wanted to do.  I wanted to study hospitality management no matter where I had to do it.  I was going to do it and I was going to be good at it.  It is hard for young people to make a decision about what they want to do at that stage in life, but doing something like an apprenticeship buys time.  I am studying hospitality management, but I do not know what I am going to do when I finish college.  However, it is very good to get the experiences that I have gotten from it.  What one puts into it is what one gets out of it.  It is definitely important to promote skills in schools for girls.</p></speech>

It is like five minutes ago.  However, there was very little promotion in that sense.  If one asked guidance counsellors or teachers about apprenticeships, they would shrug.  I remember when a teacher went around the classroom asking what students were going to do, people mentioned courses and when it came to me, I said I was starting an apprenticeship in September.  It was assumed that I would go to college, not start an apprenticeship.</p></speech>

One of our female competitors had a bus to catch unfortunately; she was going back to Kerry.  There is female participation and we are working on getting more female participation.</p> <p>  In the new apprenticeship systems cooking is one of those and we brought out an expert in that to revive our interest in that competition.

If we recognise that people have different learning journeys and different capacities, and if we from the State side can recognise their potential and support them in the type of training or education that we offer, we will be doing a service to the young people.  I had the privilege of seeing them off as they were heading to Abu Dhabi and of the privilege of seeing them coming back here this evening.  Any time an Irish team goes abroad, we celebrate, and we have celebrated this time as well.

It is a very important message to give.  This committee has consistently recognised the important role that those who undertake apprenticeship training have in ensuring the stability and growth of the Irish economy for the future.  It is clear from the delegation before us that our apprentices are not only competing on a world stage but also succeeding.  It is reassuring to see that our future is in such safe hands.

These changes are a continuation of a process of progressively reducing the marginal tax rate on low and middle income earners in a manner that maintains the highly progressive nature of the Irish tax system.  My aim is to make it more attractive for people to return to work and stay in work while preserving a broad and stable income tax base to ensure our personal taxation system is both competitive and resilient.  The section reduces the 2.5% USC rate to 2% and increases the ceiling for this new rate from &euro;18,772 to &euro;19,372 to ensure that full-time workers on the increased national minimum wage of &euro;9.55 per hour do not pay the upper rates of USC.  The 5% rate of USC is being reduced to 4.75%.  This reduces the top marginal rate of tax on income up to &euro;70,044 to 48.75%.  This is the fourth budget in a row in which this marginal rate has decreased.  I have also extended for a further two years the relief from the higher rates of USC which is available to medical card holders with incomes up to &euro;60,000.  In the longer term, I noted in my budget speech that I am establishing a working group to plan over the coming year the process of amalgamating USC and PRSI in the medium term.  It is my intention that throughout this process the income threshold of &euro;13,000 will be maintained as the general point of entry to the new, amalgamated charge.</p></speech>

I am conscious that many people who might be seen by others to have a relatively high level of income might, for example, have a very expensive mortgage and a lot of outgoings because of children and so on.  The take-home pay obviously goes down but what they have left after they meet all their outgoings can in many cases be a moderate amount of money.</p></speech>

Surely middle income is a point.  We know, for example, that the average industrial wage is a certain figure; it is between &euro;36,000 and &euro;37,000.  We know that half the population have an income of about &euro;28,500.  There is surely a way of calculating this.  We can get a breakdown of how many people earn between &euro;10,000 and &euro;20,000, and &euro;20,000 and &euro;30,000.  Would the Minister not agree that when one is at the &euro;70,000 mark - and I agree with the point the Minister made that many of them have liabilities or other pressures - it does not take away from a statistical point of view that they are in receipt of nearly twice the average industrial wage?  In any jurisdiction, would the Minister agree that somebody on twice the average wage in a country is a middle income earner?</p></speech>

I am simply making the point alongside that that for a single-earner family of two parents and three children with a mortgage, an income of &euro;65,000 to &euro;70,000 is of course far higher than somebody who only has an income of &euro;25,000.  Statistically that is completely correct but if a one-income family has children in school and a mortgage and so on there can sometimes be a lot of pressure on what is left at the end of the week or at the end of the month.</p></speech>

Accordingly, when we decide to cut taxes for middle-income earners, are we actually cutting taxes for high income earners which the Government decided to brand as middle-income earners?  I am trying to understand the rationale behind how the Government has taken the &euro;70,000 mark as somebody on a middle income.  Of the 2.1 million taxpayer units in the State, what percentage of them earn above &euro;70,000?  That might be a way of figuring out if they are in the middle or upper end?</p></speech>

There are 2.6 million taxpayer units.  The total yield from income tax and USC, universal social charge, is approximately &euro;22 billion.  The top 0.1% of income earners in receipt of 4.9% of gross income pay 11.4% of total income tax and USC.  The top 25% of income earners in receipt of 60% gross income pay 83% of total income tax and USC.</p></speech>

If the Deputy gives me a moment, during the course of further questions, we will aggregate the figures and I will be able to answer his question.</p> <p>  For the sake of clarity, I said between &euro;30,000 and &euro;70,000.  I agree with the point made by the Deputy that somebody on &euro;30,000 is clearly on a significantly lower level of income than somebody on &euro;70,000.</p></speech>

We had a crash with the banks, primarily because of commercial property, and then we had a fiscal crash because our tax income and expenditure did not match.  I served on the banking inquiry and we saw that, in the Charlie McCreevy era, personal taxation was cut quite substantially and spending increased.  Obviously, stamp duty made up the shortfall.</p> <p>  I am concerned about the sustainability of the tax code.  We need to look at data, instead of talking about middle-income earners.  In the OECD, we have the 29th lowest tax wedge among the 35 member states.  How will the Minister convince me that we should actually reduce the tax wedge further?  For the average single worker, the tax wedge decreased by 1.8% from 28.9% to 27.1% between 2000 and 2016.  In the same period across the OECD, half of the reduction was recognised, almost 1%.  We have one of the lowest tax wedges in the OECD.  However, the Minister is asking us to endorse taking another &euro;350 million out of the tax net, forgetting all the good we could do in addressing problems with that.  He wants to mark Ireland out further as a very low tax economy.  Why?</p></speech>

I have outlined a specific agenda on this.  As I said on budget day, and reiterated at this committee, I do not want to put in place measures that remove people from the tax net entirely, whether that be on top of the people already out of the tax net.  In other words, I do not want to find myself embarked on a policy course that narrows our tax base in terms of income tax and USC.</p> <p>  That is why I have identified putting a particular focus on marginal rates of taxation.  Marginal rates of taxation for somebody on a middle income of in excess of 45% are high and are out of keeping with many of the economies with which we will compare ourselves.  In stark contrast to the period Deputy Pearse Doherty focused on, the tax measures in question involve &euro;300 million out of total tax take of &euro;58 billion to &euro;60 billion.  I am meeting the 2:1 requirement for expenditure and tax reduction to ensure it is done in an affordable and moderate way.  I am not looking to put in place any form of a tax decrease on personal taxation which we find we are not in a position to pay for in the future.  This is one of the reasons I made a change to stamp duty on commercial property where I am looking to broaden the tax base.</p></speech>

That is an arrangement between Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il which is not based on any empirical evidence or international comparisons.  It is based on how the Minister believes the budget should work.  I am concerned about the sustainability of the State's finances.  When one measures this State against the OECD, in 2106 we ranked at the 29th lowest tax wedge out of the 35 OECD countries.  We had the same position in 2015.  In 2016 the average single worker in Ireland faced a tax wedge of 27.1% when the OECD average was seven points higher at 36%.</p> <p>  That is not thinking fuzzily or about what we think are middle-income earners.  That is looking at the tax system in this State and comparing it with our peers across the globe.  The evidence is clear that we have one of the lowest tax wedges in the OECD and the Minister wants to drive that lower.</p></speech>

Workers enter the higher rate of income tax at a low level in the Irish tax code.  Over time, I want to change this.  The Deputy may take a different view, but I do not believe it is fair that somebody on an average wage is already paying the higher rate of income tax.  Over time, that is something I want to see changed.</p></speech>

The Minister is obviously using the marginal tax rate whereas in reality the effective tax rate is the best measure to compare internationally.  We can have a high marginal tax rate but there could also be tax credits not available in other jurisdictions.  The Government has consistently argued that the marginal tax rate is a drag on employment.  Does the Minister believe that?</p></speech>

Once they pay these high levels of marginal taxation, their additional efforts are not merited.</p> <p>  We are entitled to different political views on the matters.  The OECD and other analyses comparing our personal tax code to those of other countries point to a high marginal tax rate in Ireland and the fact we are an outlier in terms of how quickly one enters the higher rate of income tax.</p></speech>

It would boost their profits if they were able to pay less to their employees but what empirical evidence is there to suggest there is a drag on employment as a result of marginal tax rates as the Minister has suggested?  Let me read out a comment from a representative of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI:  </p><blockquote>[As] with all policies, where possible evidence should be used to assess proposals and alternative approaches to achieving the same goal should be considered.  I will use the USC [case] as an example [again].  It is sometimes argued that high tax rates are a disincentive to work.  At some point this is probably true but we can ask if is there evidence to suggest that the current tax rates are leading to widespread withdrawals from the labour market.  The most recent figures show that employment increased by 56,000 in the year ending quarter 2, 2016, or almost 3%.  Evidence on this issue should be gathered in a more sophisticated manner but even this simple approach raises the question of whether tax is acting as a significant disincentive to work.  It could be the case that child care is a [bigger] disincentive.  If this is true, then a greater effect on labour supply could be achieved through child care subsidies as opposed to income tax cuts, including USC cuts.</blockquote><p>We can have our ideological debate for as long as we want but this committee has to consider the evidence and the statistics.  The ESRI tells us there that we do not have evidence to suggest that, as a result of the job growth in the economy, marginal tax rates are a drag on employment.  The Minister should show me the report that says otherwise.  The ESRI is saying, and this is what I want to push the Minister on, that we need to assess proposals and consider them and that assessment needs to be evidence-based.  Despite all the problems in our society the Minister is saying middle-income earners earn twice the average wage and we need to reduce marginal tax rates because they are a drag on employment yet there is no evidence to suggest or support either of those proposals.  This is Fine Gael on a tax-cutting agenda despite the fact that in recent weeks, people died on the streets of our capital city because of the homelessness crisis. </p></speech>

I struggle to see how the Deputy can describe this as a tax-cutting budget overall, given that its total revenue-raising measures are in excess of &euro;700 million.  He is correct to say that I have tried to reduce marginal taxation.  I have outlined why.  This is because of our high rate of marginal taxation.  I can provide the reports that have been furnished to me to show how that tax code differs from those of other countries with which we compare ourselves.  I believe that we need to make steady progress on this but the total revenue-raising measures within this budget are in excess of the personal tax reduction package, as the Deputy knows.  He can certainly disagree with my assessment of the need to cut personal taxation but in its totality, this budget raises revenue.</p></speech>

We can all get those from the website of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, or other websites such as those of the international taxation institutes.  I am asking for evidence to support the theory that the current marginal tax rate is a drag on employment.  The ESRI came before this committee last year and told us there is no such evidence.  It is pointing us in the direction of investment in child care, which it says would do more for the labour market than cutting marginal tax rates.  Of course, if marginal tax rates are raised to a certain point they will be a drag on employment but there is no evidence to suggest this now.  If the Minister or his officials can tell us they have a report that says otherwise I am happy for them to send it to the committee.  There is no point, however, in the Minister's telling us that he will send us other reports that I am not asking for.</p> <p>  We need to start having statistical arguments here.  Tax is raised in the budget.  I acknowledge that and have argued for it in some areas.  Are they as sustainable as income tax?  The Minister is doing exactly what Charlie McCreevy and the Progressive Democrats did.  They reduced the income tax rate, which is one of the most stable forms of taxation and placed the tax burden on other transient taxes.  The Minister has raised tax on stamp duty and intangible assets and others.  Let us see how stable they will be in the next few years.  The Minister is paying for that by cutting income tax so that it is the lowest in the OECD countries. </p></speech>

The Deputy needs to consider the total amount of funding this budget has raised.  As he knows, most of the budget day package went into additional expenditure in many areas where the Deputy would welcome it, whether in social welfare or the maintenance and steady growth of a universal child care model to try to tackle the issues surrounding the quality and affordability of child care.  That has happened.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is in the second year of putting that scheme in place.</p> <p>  In respect of the resilience of the tax-raising measures I have put in place, I reacted to the Deputy's inaccurate assertion that this is a tax-cutting budget.  It has reduced personal taxation but it has increased tax in other areas.  If the Deputy considers the changes we have made in stamp duty on non-residential commercial property, the total yield of such measures to our tax revenue is less than half of what it was in the pre-crash period.  Beside that, we have a rate of expenditure growth which is significantly lower, as the Deputy knows, than the expenditure growth in the pre-crash period.  We have broadened our tax base and we have increased expenditure at a rate that is below, from a current point of view, how I expect the economy to grow next year and that is a fraction of the expenditure growth in the period leading up to our economy's crash. </p></speech>

During the McCreevy era, he was recording surpluses which means the economy was growing at a faster rate than expenditure.  What the Minister has done today is exactly from McCreevy's script.  He has talked about stamp duty increases on the one hand to fund personal tax decreases on the other.  Stamp duty increases and some of his other tax-raising measures, while welcome, are not things on which the Minister should be banking for the long term.  Cutting tax to a point where the Minister wants to bring it to the lowest in the OECD at a time when we have all these different pressures is not a prudent fiscal stance.</p></speech>

As we get into this Bill I have no doubt we will thrash this out in detail and frequently.  I never made any reference to what the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, did with his surplus.  As the Deputy knows, I pointed to a fact that is correct, which is that at a time when the economy was growing and approaching full employment - I think it is possible this economy will do the same again - there was a rate of current expenditure growth between 8% and 12%.  The rate of planned current expenditure growth for this budget next year is 3.4%.</p> <p>  The Deputy has called many times for the tax base to be broadened, for our tax code to be made more resilient.  He has disagreed with how I have done that and thinks that in some areas I should have done more.  We will get into that.  When I have broadened the tax base, as I have done in several areas, most of the revenue that is being raised is going into expenditure, not tax reduction.  The contribution those tax heads is making to our total tax collection is, as the Deputy knows, a fraction of where it was in the past.  I reject entirely any assertion here that the budgetary policy I am putting in place is reminiscent of what caused such difficulty in the past, because the figures show it is not. </p></speech>

It is not statistically accurate to suggest that people on those relatively high incomes are middle-income earners.

Much has been made of the budget being another fiver budget - that phrase has been used.  Is the Minister not embarrassed at the idea that a single-income earner on &euro;20,000 or &euro;25,000 a year gets a total benefit from all the tax changes of &euro;1 a week, or a change in net income of 0.3%, whereas someone earning &euro;75,000 would get a weekly increase of &euro;6 and a change in net income of 0.7%?  Therefore sections of higher-income earners benefit more from the tax changes, both USC and income tax, than relatively low-paid earners, who make up quite a substantial portion of taxpayers in this economy.</p></speech>

I should have responded to the Deputy's earlier question.  I entirely take his point and it might surprise him that I agree with him that the income interests of people on very low income are of course entirely different from those on very high incomes.  This is why I have tried to prioritise resources that are available to me on the standard-rate cut-off point as opposed to what we would do with the percentage reduction in the higher rate of income tax.  It gives me the opportunity to be able to concentrate resources on particular income cohorts and bands.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's second question, I accept the income tax or personal tax gain is quite low for people on low income.  As he will know, when people are paying very little personal taxation in the first place, it is very difficult for me to reduce it further without taking them out of the tax net entirely.  Because of the changes that have been made to the entry point for liability for USC and income tax, the aggregate amount of personal taxation that people on low income are paying is now at a relatively low level.  The only way I can reduce it further is by taking those people entirely out of the tax net and I do not believe that is a path we should take.  We are getting to a point - it is a policy background to the point I just made - that personal income tax and USC changes will be tools of increasingly less significance for income distribution for people who are on low income because the total amount of USC or personal tax they are paying in the first place is quite low in comparison with what it was in the past.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-07a.241" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110700002#E01100"><p>The Government often likes to make much of the fact that Ireland has a progressive income tax system.  I think the argument is that it is one of the most progressive income tax systems in Europe.  Obviously, that misses something, which is that the Government is shifting away from income - direct - taxation towards indirect taxation, which is inherently far more regressive.  Considering the overall percentage of income spent on taxation by different deciles of income we can see it is not a very progressive system at all with the bottom 10% paying almost as much as the top 10% as a total percentage of their income.</p> <p>  My second point is that if the Government claims to have a progressive income tax system, it is contradicting that in the moves it is making in this budget whereby while the extremely low-income earners are getting relatively speaking a percentage gain, it is from a very small base, but the big numbers of income earners on &euro;20,000, &euro;25,000 or &euro;30,000 get very little from the budget and the big benefits go to those earning &euro;55,000, &euro;75,000, &euro;100,000 and upwards.  That is also the case with percentage change of net income.</p></speech>

Those who are on low levels of income already pay lower rates of tax than they have paid in the past.  Let me give some figures on that.  Somebody earning &euro;15,000 will have an effective tax rate next year of 0.8%.  By comparison, somebody earning &euro;55,000 will have an effective tax rate of 28.9%.  As the Deputy knows, the income gains in nominal terms are higher for people who are at the top than people who are on middle and low incomes because they are paying more tax and their effective tax rates are higher.  A person earning &euro;18,000 will have an effective tax rate in 2018 of 4.2%.  A person earning &euro;75,000 will have an effective tax rate in 2018 of 34.4%.  Therefore the more people earn, the higher the contribution they make in personal taxation and the higher their effective tax rate is.  That is progressive personal taxation.</p></speech>

We can all pick examples from the tables to suit our arguments.  Let us consider a single-income earner on &euro;25,000 which is probably not far off the median earnings in the State.  It may be &euro;2,000, &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000 off the median earnings.  It is not far from representing a middle-income earner in the State.  Such people gain &euro;1 a week and their change as a percentage of net income is 0.3%, versus an income earner on &euro;75,000 who gets &euro;6 a week - six times more in euro terms. which is 0.7% in percentage terms.</p><p>That is not a progressive change relative to the &euro;25,000 earner, which is not far off the average in reality, versus the &euro;75,000 earner.  That is a regressive change in their relationship.  Does the Minister accept that as a matter of statistical fact? </p></speech>

It is not a case of me trying to pick figures to illustrate a particular argument.  I am just trying to give an overall view of where our tax code is at the moment.  I go back to a point I have emphasised a number of times here.  If a person is on low levels of income in our society, his or her effective tax rate is substantially lower than someone who is a middle or high-income earner.  In addition, because the amount of tax one is paying at present is far lower than in the past, income tax changes do not offer the kind of income growth that they did in the past as we took people out of the tax net.  That is not a path I am going to go down again.  What the Deputy is also missing in his analysis, if he is looking at the same table as me, is that for earlier income levels that table also takes account of the change in the minimum wage.  </p></speech>

The only way in which I can undo the kind of effect that the Deputy is referring to is by taking more and more people out of our personal tax space, which will go right back to the policies that caused us such difficulty in the past.</p></speech>

As I am giving that figure, I now have some of the figures that were asked for earlier on in the session.  I gave the figure overall that we have 400,000 taxpaying units between &euro;20,000 and &euro;30,000.  We have 217,000 between &euro;20,000 and &euro;25,000, another 61,000 between &euro;25,000 and &euro;27,000 and 122,000 between &euro;27,000 and &euro;30,000.

Will the Minister define what he regards as medium term?  What are the Government's plans for the amalgamation of USC and PRSI?  Can the Minister give members any detail of how this will work in practice?  In the PRSI code, for example, there is a link between contributions made and the benefits derived as a result of those contributions.  Is the Minister saying that after an amalgamation, there no longer will be any separate identity between USC and PRSI?  Will it be a full merger?  Pensioners of course pay USC but they do not pay PRSI.</p> <p>  As for the State pension, the Government's plan is to move to a total contributions approach in 2020.  If USC and PRSI are being amalgamated, how is that going to work?  The Minister may not be able to answer those detailed questions but in terms of the overall plan and timeframe, when will the Minister set up the working group and when does he hope to make the first tangible steps towards amalgamation?  When does the Minister expect it to be completed?</p></speech>

My ambition is that I will get an update or a report from the working group in advance of budget 2019.  As for how long it will take to do, it is a very significant piece of work that will take between three and five budgets.  I am going to proceed with great care.  The object of the approach is actually to strengthen the contributory principle that the Deputy is referring to and not in any way to dilute it.</p> <p>  One of the things that I am struck by in dealing with how people see personal taxation overall, is that they see the social insurance element of their contributions in a different light to how they see their personal taxation contributions or even USC contributions.  They feel that at a point in the future, they will get a benefit back from their social insurance.  I would like to see how we could move more of our tax collection code into that space.  </p> <p>  In terms of the difficulties that I would have to deal with, which is why I am being careful about saying how long it would take, the most significant ones of which I am aware are how and to where the revenues would accrue.  As the Deputy will know, from a tax point of view revenue that is generated through tax accrues to the Exchequer and revenue that is generated through PRSI accrues to the Social Insurance Fund.  On operational matters, such as a pensioner not being liable to PRSI but being liable to USC, we collect them in a very different way.  PRSI is done on a week-by-week basis while USC is done on a cumulative basis.  </p></speech>

At the moment, even though our social insurance system has a deficit within it, people will still get benefits to which they are entitled.  That is because we use general taxation at times to complement where we are in the Social Insurance Fund to make sure that people get benefits to which they feel they are entitled or to which they have been told they are entitled, more particularly.  One of the matters I want to be careful with is that if we do move to a purely contributory system - I do not have my mind made up on this - we would not in any way undermine the ability of taxpayers and citizens to be able to access a certain number of core benefits.</p></speech>

Many people face circumstances during their lives and we are aware of one of them at the moment in which social insurance contributions lapse and so on.

A taxpayer unit is either an individual or a couple jointly assessed.  It includes anyone with taxable income, including people who do not have employment income such as pensioners.  Is the Revenue working on any project whereby one could provide corresponding information in respect of people with employment income?  It would make the analysis much more meaningful in my view if the Minister could provide us with all of those data in respect of employment income only, in addition to what is already there.  The taxpayer unit model is not the best model for some of the analysis we should be trying to do in respect of employment-based income.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-07a.262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110700002#G00100"><p>My question concerns the Minister's ambitions to bring the PRSI and USC systems together to some extent.  When the ESRI first produced papers on the USC back before the crash, it was intended that it would become contributory, that is, a universal social contribution.  When it was brought in by the then Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government during the first years of the collapse, however, it then became a charge.  It was, in fact, a very effective form of taxation.  If the Minister is agreeing to merge or blend the two systems, will whatever portion of the USC that is transferred to be joined with PRSI then count as a contribution for those who have paid it?  As the Minister mentioned himself, it is clear from the data we have on life expectancy, population growth and so forth that unless workers and their employers have adequate contributions - many employers nowadays do not provide private pensions-  people could themselves wholly reliant on a retirement pension when they reach retirement age.  If that funding is to be augmented by transferring USC to it over a period, I assume that whatever remains of the USC will then become a contribution as opposed to a tax.  This means, in other words, that it will move into the category of PRSI.</p> <p>  There are certain things that worry people as they approach pensionable age that may not have bothered them when they were much younger.  The first of these is the issue of medical expenses.  Does the Minister have a model that includes, for instance, the hypothecation of some of the joint PRSI-USC contribution so as to be targeted to provide people with certain levels of medical cover?  This would amount, in other words, to a contribution towards people's medical expenses based on an insurance model that would bring us closer to a universal medical system provision or some element thereof.  What does the Minister think about these issues?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-07a.263" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110700002#G00200"><p>As I said to Deputy Michael McGrath, my early thinking on this is that it is a very complicated project and that I have yet to get to the point of even determining the terms of reference that would eventually lead to the paper I mentioned earlier.  I want to deepen the contributory principle.  From my experience of these systems in other jurisdictions, however, I want to evaluate whether such a system should be entirely contributory.  I do not want to get to a point where we put in place a system that deepens some of our present difficulties whereby people are aware of benefits to which they believe they are entitled, only to subsequently find out that their contributions are simply nowhere near enough to allow them to get access to those benefits.  I want to think through this issue carefully if we are looking to have a broader, more resilient form of social insurance.  I aim to do this through setting the terms of reference for this paper and then having the work completed across next year.</p> <p>  On Deputy Burton's point about medical expenses, I think that system could possibly include such a provision.  At this early point, however, I am looking more at services and at benefits that we could deliver to people.  Looking at some of the changes that we are beginning to make to dental and optical benefits for the self-employed, for example, I am aware that people have been articulating similar needs for invalidity and sickness benefits for such people.  This, then, is also one of the areas that I want my Department to work through for me.  </p></speech>

We also have people who might take one college course but who then go on to retrain, as primary teachers perhaps.  This, again, means that these people may enter the workforce relatively late in life.  There are others who go abroad for a period and then come back.  One element absent from our current system as it recovers is the facility to allow people to purchase contributions, as is also possible in some pension systems.  This might apply where somebody, due to force of circumstance, has missed out on relatively small numbers of contributions.  Would the Minister include this in the template?  Looking at how life patterns are changing, this facility might be particularly necessary for people who stay in education for a prolonged period of time, which is of course what we want them to do.  Under a total contributions approach - which does of course have much in its favour - I believe that we have to include provisions for people, particularly younger people, in this situation.  By and large people do not think about pensions in their 20s and 30s.  If they have in fact spent a prolonged period in full-time education or in non-remunerated training of some kind, they will not have contributions for this period and will not be entitled to credits.  It is necessary that we provide for them.</p> <p>  The Minister also mentioned the self-employed.  I do not know if the Minister intends to take this into account but one of the problems here is that we have vast additional numbers of self-employed in the economy at present.  What is very obvious is that quite a large number of those self-employed are in fact only designated as such because in order to gain employment they have to agree to identify as self-employed.  This applies both to contractors in sectors like construction and IT, who may in some instances be very well-paid, but also to a large number of people in very low-paid jobs.  Notwithstanding the Minister's proposal to expand benefits for the self-employed, it will be a long time, if ever, before the system can provide the same level of cover for self-employed people of any category, but particularly those on low incomes, as it does for employees because the employer's contribution of 10.5% does not apply to the self-employed.  The Minister should comment on this issue.</p> <p>  My final question concerns the Minister's working group.  What is the format of that group?  Is it an internal Civil Service working group based on co-operation between the Departments of Finance and Employment and Social Protection, for example?  Is it a commission?  If so, which groups are likely to be represented on that commission?  A commission-type structure would obviously include broad groups of society.  I assume that both employers and workers' representatives - such as trade unions - would be part of such a structure because both groups have extensive practical experience of the system.  If the working group is entirely drawn from the public service, however, public service experience of PRSI is rather different to that of either employers or employees in the private sector.</p><p>If the employers are no longer funding private pensions in the way they used to, those people could be left extremely exposed with their particular interests not being addressed.  I would like to know if the Minister will consult with the D&aacute;il on the composition of this working group.  It is absolutely essential that it includes people from different kinds of employment and in different types of situation, as well as employers who employ people in different ways and for different times.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-07a.266" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110700002#H00200"><p>What I am thinking at the moment is that it would be a working group rather than a commission and would consist of the Departments and Government bodies that will be affected by this such as the Revenue Commissioners and the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Finance.  It would be a working group that would have to instigate a period of public consultation in which all bodies would be able to participate, including the different stakeholders to which the Deputy has referred.</p> <p>  In response to her question about the self-employed, on which the Deputy also questioned me during Priority Questions in the Chamber recently, I am looking forward to seeing the paper on this matter.  I am looking forward to receiving it and then seeing it published.  She also put a point to me regarding the fact that the benefits somebody who is self-employed can get are very different to those who are employed for the key reason that the employer's rate of PRSI is missing.  That is why I am careful about saying, even at an early stage, that this system should move to a purely contributory system.  If it moves to a purely contributory system, I will exercise great caution to make sure we do not, at a time in which we are trying to perhaps expand benefits in a number of areas, deepen the inability of people actually to access them.  This is one of the things we want to work through.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-07a.267" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110700002#H00300"><p>I strongly advise caution on the Minister's proposal to have the working group receive submissions from workers and employers who are actually in the system, rather than having those people represented within the group.  I will tell the Minister why.  In 1992, in a previous Government, I was a Minister of State at the then Department of Social Welfare.  At that point, it was on the menu to try to have more integration and interface between PRSI and taxation.  The Minister is at risk of just taking into account public service employees in terms of how the system operates, and not fully including people who are operating on the other side of the system.  The system is so varied because of employment and self-employment situations nowadays.</p> <p>  I look forward to that report being published.  Neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection indicated today that it was going to be any time soon.  I think it is an awful pity.  It is one area of the system where a lot of the people in this room, particularly those on the official and the tax side, know that we are being taken to the cleaners by employers who are creating structures where people have to opt in to self-employment.  No matter how much the Government expands benefits for the self-employed, on a cost basis it will not be able to expand them to the point where somebody gets the same level of benefits as if they were in employment, particularly if that employment turns out to be sporadic, maybe for three or five years, and there are breaks in it because of ups and downs in the economy and so on.</p> <p>  In terms of the working group, might the Minister agree down the line, when the Finance Bill has been passed, to publish a paper laying out his thoughts on that?  This kind of change is very important.  I am conscious of the fact that quite a number of countries have moved from what was in effect a contributory system with a lot of benefits which are relatively clear - although they are not always clear.  We might follow other jurisdictions and actually move to a much more means tested system, which would mean that a lot of people would not get the contributions for the principal retirement pension to which they felt they had contributed.</p></speech>

It is exactly for the kind of risk the Deputy has identified, of which I am well aware.  I believe we have an opportunity to put in place a structure that allows it to be clearer to citizens how we can pay for the maintenance of existing benefits and, hopefully, the creation and expansion of new ones in the future.  The other issue is that when people look at their wage bill, we have three different ways of collecting income from people at the moment.  I want to identify whether there is a simpler way of doing that while at the same time linking it to the maintenance of benefits in the future and the creation and expansion of new ones.</p> <p>  To go back to a point the Deputy made earlier about the changing demographics, there will be significant changes in people's working lives, when they go into education and when they go back to work, as well as the frequency at which all that happens.  I want to see if we can better cater for these changes in the future.</p></speech>

I think these two points can coexist beside each other.  There can be people who are on an income of &euro;70,000, which is a very high level of income in comparison with somebody who is on &euro;25,000 or &euro;30,000.  They are at the higher end of the income ladder in our State as defined by the statistics that I am sure will be available to us.  However, their actual discretionary income at the end of that can still be low.</p></speech>

My view is that there has been a deliberate classification of "middle income" in this State which bears no relationship with the reality of the levels at which incomes are actually earned.  For example, the Minister gave a figure of &euro;30,000 but more than 50% of people have an income of less than &euro;30,000.  If I asked my 11 year-old son P&aacute;draig where was the middle, he would say somewhere around 50%, yet the Minister's middle starts above that mark and goes right up to 85%.  That is done deliberately.  When the Government then says it is reducing taxes for the middle-income earners, it is a different message.  I am sure Leo's strategic communications unit would not be too happy if it was going out saying, "We are reducing taxes for the top 15% of income earners."  Indeed, it is probably actually worse.  We will come to that later in respect of another amendment, when I will talk about the way Revenue is collecting statistics.  What we do know is that someone on &euro;70,000 at present is in the top 15%, but that is taxpayer units.  Such a unit might comprise a husband and wife, where one individual has an income of &euro;40,000 and the other an income of &euro;30,000.</p><p>However, that is taxpayer units.  As such, those individual units may consist of a husband and wife of &euro;40,000 and &euro;30,000.  If we have individual incomes, it is likely that they are closer to the top 10% of income earners in the State.  I do not take away from the fact that someone on &euro;70,000 finds it difficult to put a child through college, meet mortgage payments or deal with high child care fees or as to the pressure in their lives, but let us have an honest debate on finances.  The Minister cannot square the circle where he said somebody on &euro;70,000 is on the higher end while still believing that is somebody who is on a middle income.  A middle income must be somewhere in the middle.  The Minister cannot redefine the middle; it is not possible.  The middle is the middle and it cannot be the other end.</p></speech>

I take the Deputy's point that in terms of the income distribution, someone on &euro;70,000 is clearly at the higher end.  I accept that point.  I think the Deputy can see my side of the coin also in terms of the pressure that person might face.  However, it is because of my recognition also that if I change the standard rate cut-off point, as I have done, those income benefits are concentrated in a particular cohort of income earners.  That will miss people who are earning less than &euro;34,500 if I only focus on the standard rate cut-off point.  That is why the move in the standard rate cut-off point was accompanied by a move to reduce the 2.5% rate of USC to 2%.  I was trying to ensure the income growth benefit was also made available to people on incomes below &euro;35,000 or &euro;70,000.</p></speech>

We cannot, however, as such an amendment would be ruled out of order.  What we have instead, then, is this amendment calling for a report on the costs and the implications of such a move.  The argument in favour of an abolition is that the USC is a tax hated by workers.  It was introduced as an emergency tax during the economic crisis but has instead become a permanent feature of our tax landscape.  It hits ordinary workers, including low and middle-income earners, as well as high earners.  Our figures suggest that approximately 7% of tax units earn more than &euro;90,000 a year.  In the Solidarity-People Before Profit budget statement, we proposed the abolition of the USC for those earning under &euro;90,000 per annum and the conversion of the USC into a high-income social charge for those earning more than that sum.  Part of the reason for this proposal is to counter the notion that the left stands for increased taxation on ordinary workers.  We do not, in fact, as we think that there would be sufficient potential tax revenue from the wealth and profits held by the top 7% earners at the very top of society.  Rather than hitting ordinary workers, this is the section of society that should be targeted.  It is not a choice between tax increases and ongoing high taxes for ordinary workers on the one hand and public services on the other.  Public services should be paid for instead through increased taxation on very high earners and particularly through a significant increase in corporation tax and the introduction of a millionaires' tax.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-07a.282" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017110700002#M00300"><p>I understand that it is the Deputy's intention to propose a tax system under which all of those earning up to &euro;1,731 per week would be exempt from USC entirely.  The current exemption threshold for USC stands at &euro;13,000 per annum and it is now estimated that from next year, 29% of all income earners will no longer be liable for USC.  To further increase this entry threshold to &euro;90,000 would exempt 95% of income earners from USC and increase the number of taxpayers exempt from personal tax entirely to 37%.  This would therefore considerably narrow the income tax base and expose our economy to significant risk in the event of a future economic downturn.</p> <p>  Deputies will recall that during the economic crisis, we reached a point where 45% of all income earners were exempt from income tax.  That was unsustainable as it placed an unfair burden on those earners who were contributing to the income tax base, and exposed the vulnerability of our income tax system to economic shocks.  It is my view that a broad-based, progressive income tax system, where the majority of income earners make some contribution according to their means, is the fairest and most sustainable income tax system in the long term.  The Deputies will be aware that in this budget I have retained the current USC threshold of &euro;13,000 to maintain the existing USC base, and that I have also expressed my commitment to retaining that figure as the entry point to taxation in future.  </p> <p>  I also note that the abolition of the USC for those earning less than &euro;90,000, assuming that those earning above &euro;90,000 would pay USC on all their income at the new 2018 rates, would have an Exchequer cost in the region of &euro;2 billion on a full-year basis.  Significant expenditure cuts or alternative tax raising measures would therefore be required in conjunction with such a measure.  Taking these considerations into account, I am not minded to support the precise terms of the amendment put forward by the Deputy and cannot accept the amendment.</p><p>I can, however, agree to the proposition that a report should be prepared which presents the analysis relating to the amalgamation of the USC and PRSI, and it is my intention that this report will be made available to the D&aacute;il in advance of budget 2019.</p></speech>

It is fair enough that the Minister agrees to that different report but he does not agree to this one.  The wording is not entirely clear and there was some confusion when we were submitting parliamentary questions in advance of the budget.  We were talking about the USC, renamed effectively as a high income social charge applying to marginal income exceeding &euro;90,000, of which we understood the yearly cost would be &euro;2.8 billion.  In our budget statement, we also outlined a series of new bands for high income earners that would raise in excess of &euro;2 billion.  We will come to this later in the context of our amendments.  That would significantly reduce the cost of those changes.  The Minister is not going to agree and that is understandable.</p></speech>

I am not sure if the Minister has seen the budgetary committee's report on the budget.  This is one of the proposals the committee agreed to include in that report.  It is something I argued for and am thankful it was included.  In the present scenario, we do not have a clear breakdown of individual incomes in terms of taxpayers.  We are dealing with taxpayer units.  That is the point I made earlier today about those earning &euro;70,000.  Are they in the top 15%?  Yes and no.  Some of them are combined incomes.  There is no way of knowing how many people in the State are paying tax on a single income of &euro;70,000 because we use taxpayer units.  For USC, we use a different method because it is individualised.  We are a good bit of the way there with USC, yet we are using taxpayer units in terms of income tax.</p><p>The other issue was referred to earlier by Deputy Michael McGrath when he alluded to the fact that there are 2.6 million taxpayer units in the State.  In terms of employees and self-employed people, the number is a lot less than that.  That is because some of those incomes are pensions and so on.  They are taxable and are therefore counted by Revenue.</p><p>We need far more granular detail in how we collect data.  I have huge regard for the Revenue Commissioners.  I think their systems are very good.  The Revenue online service, ROS, is among the best that is out there.  It is very easily usable and so on.  The Revenue Commissioners collect a great amount of data.  Like other members of the committee, I submit a lot of parliamentary questions and we get great, valuable data from Revenue.  However, still in 2017 we do not have very simple data on individual incomes.</p><p>This throws up problems in terms of policy development.  I will talk about a proposal that is in the Government's own papers, about tapering out tax credits.  This is something we examined and for which we have argued for some time.  We cannot progress it because it cannot be costed.  It cannot be costed because we are dealing with taxpayer units.  For this reason, it is decided to taper tax credits out at a starting point of &euro;80,000.  We do not know if we are hitting a couple with two incomes of &euro;40,000 or an individual on &euro;80,000.  Obviously, if the Government is doing the tapering out of tax credits - a possibility it is proposing - it needs that type of data.</p><p>The proposed amendment provides that within six months of the enactment of this Bill, the Minister will prepare and lay before the D&aacute;il an analysis of individual taxpayers in the State in light of the current reporting deficit.  I think it is time that we moved on this and got the detail.  I hope it is not a huge amount of work for the Revenue Commissioners.  They do have all of this detail.  They just do not have it in such a form that the model or programme they are using can spit out the information we are looking for in terms of individual income.  We are talking about 2.6 million taxpayer units.  In respect of each taxpayer unit, Revenue knows that Mr. A is on &euro;30,000 and Mrs B is on &euro;50,000 but it cannot give us that detail.</p></speech>

This is an inevitable consequence of a tax system which allows for the assessment of married couples and civil partners based on the joint income of the couple.  It is not possible at the moment for Revenue to provide an analysis on an individual basis as the tax liability of these individuals is not separately recorded, assessed or determined.</p> <p>  Under the Irish tax system there are three options for assessment of married couples or civil partners which form the basis of assessment for tax purposes: joint assessment, separate assessment and separate treatment.  Under joint assessment, one spouse or partner is chargeable to tax on the total income of both members of the couple and can avail of the allowances, credits and reliefs available to both partners.  Jointly assessed spouses can transfer certain tax credits, standard rate bands, losses and tax reliefs between them.  Under separate assessment, each spouse is assessed separately but where one spouse&rsquo;s allowances, reliefs or rate bands are not fully used they may be transferred over.  These tax units cannot be disaggregated into two separate individuals for reporting purposes as it is likely that, in many cases, the taxable income and tax payable by the tax unit is not equivalent to the sum of the income and tax figures for the two spouses had they been assessed to tax on an individualised basis.  In 2015, jointly assessed and separately assessed taxpayer units accounted for approximately 34% of all taxpayer units &ndash; that is, approximately 787,000 taxpayer units, comprising 1.57 million individuals, amounting in total to over half of the individuals in the tax system.</p> <p>  I would, however, note that my officials also have an interest in obtaining data, to the extent possible, on an individualised basis, and are working with colleagues in Revenue to investigate how we can do it.  If robust aggregate data can be produced on an individualised basis, this data will be made available to Members of the Oireachtas.  However I must note that the scope for individualised analysis will always be subject to limitations while joint assessment is a feature of our tax system.  Taking these technical limitations into account, I cannot accept the amendment proposed by the Deputy.</p></speech>

I think this is crucial.   Unless we can get sight of this type of data, it will be very difficult to develop policy and costings for policy.  There are a lot of guesstimates at work.  I know if the Minister were to come forward with a proposal on tax tapering, for example, Revenue would give him its best guesstimate on the costs and effects of that.  As Members of the Opposition, Revenue will not give us those guesstimates, and I understand why it will not.  The Government is going to enact it in legislation whereas we are using it as an alternative, as such.</p> <p>  In today's world, there must be a way to look deeper into joint and separate assessment.  With everything we have and all the data we are looking at, in terms of the number of income earners in the State, a certain proportion of that information is false.  We are misreading the data, given the fact that 34% are taxpayer units made up of two individuals with two incomes.  It is a completely false read of where income distribution is in the State.</p><p>It is impossible to develop good tax policy without sight of the details.  I take the Minister's point that the Department also wants the data and that it is working with Revenue on that but I would like something more substantial and concrete.  For example, I have previously asked for a report to be prepared, looking at the analysis of individual taxpayers.  Will the Minister, at least, agree to the Department and Revenue examining how information on the breakdown of income components of jointly assessed and separately assessed taxpayer units could be garnered?</p></speech>

Given the value I place on maintaining the breadth of the tax base, I want this information too.  Prior to the Deputy raising this issue with me, I had a number of discussions within the Department on how best to gather this information.  I am unable to accept the amendment because there are two issues at the heart of this matter, namely, the manner in which the information is provided, which I have touched on in my response to the Deputy, and the way the information is tracked and captured within the Revenue Commissioner systems.  It is possible that the Revenue Commissioners will respond to the effect that it cannot give me the information in the way I or the Deputy want it.  If I can get the information, I will be happy to share it with the Deputy and the committee.  If the Revenue Commissioners come back to me to conclusively on why they cannot provide the information, I will share that with the Deputy too.</p> <p>  In regard to the Deputy's point about tapering, he is correct that the Revenue Commissioners cannot provide that information directly to him.  Were the Deputy to ask me for my judgment on these figures, I would give it to him with all kinds of caveats, including that we have to use judgments because of the system limitations I touched on earlier.  The figures were shared with me.  I do not have them with me today but I am happy to share them with the Deputy.  I cannot accept the amendment because it is possible that I will not be able to do what the Deputy asks.  If I can get the information, I will share it with the Deputy and if I cannot do so, I will explain why.</p></speech>

I have been dealing with this issue for a couple of years with Department of Finance officials in the context of obtaining costings and so on.  I want to extend my appreciation to them in that regard, and also to the Revenue officials in terms of their assistance in trying to drill down into this data.  There must be a way of collecting this data.  I heard what the Minister said.  The Revenue Commissioners will be before the Committee on Budgetary Oversight in December and this is one of the issues we will be discussing with them.  I take it at face value that the Minister is going to pursue this and that he will update us at a later date on where he is at in this regard.

While I take the Minister's point that this is quite technical, I think it is a systems issue.  The raw data exists but it is aggregated because, in terms of the taxation system, the Revenue view a couple who are jointly assessed as one person.  The raw data is available so it is primarily a systems issue.  If additional investment is needed it should be made available.  I would also welcome a separate analysis based on employment income only.  I think that would be extremely useful as well because we currently do not have accurate data on the various bands in terms of employment income only.</p></speech>

This concept was given life in the middle of the Taoiseach's election campaign, which is never a good time to develop policy, particularly in terms of tax that in the next number of years will bring in approximately &euro;5 billion.

It is an idea-concept that we need to be careful with it.  We should not be limping from Finance Bill to Finance Bill in terms of chipping away at the USC and providing for some of it to go to the Social Insurance Fund without a clear roadmap as to where we are going.  I am open to ideas.  Looking to international standards, we fall short here in terms of employee and employers' PRSI.  That said, if we move a &euro;4 billion - soon to be &euro;5 billion - tax head into the Social Insurance Fund we will have a &euro;5 billion hole in terms of the tax take required to fund different services, unless the social insurance contributions are to be used to fund existing services.  We need a detailed roadmap.  I do not expect that this would be completed within six months.</p><p>The social insurance system is complex enough without having it merged with the USC.  However, I believe that within six months, which will be a year after the Government announced this proposal, we should have a paper setting out options.  We need options set out on paper.  I note what the Minister had to say about a working group and terms of reference to be drawn up.  This is too big a measure not to have it properly scrutinised.  We cannot wait for further announcements on the floor of the D&aacute;il in terms of next year's Finance Bill.  That would be wrong.  We need proper legislative scrutiny of this measure.  This is not about cutting taxes or increasing taxes, rather, it is about the different ways taxes are paid and the services they provide for.  I hope the Minister is open to the preparation of the report sought given as he outlined earlier he proposes to establishment a working group and so on.  I am asking for a commitment that within six months we would have some options for consideration by the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, which is the appropriate committee for the working group to feed into in terms of its work and where it is at.  </p></speech>

I am clear on the role which this integration could play.  Following the passage of the Finance Bill 2017,  I propose to establish a working group, with terms of reference, which will lead to a paper, which when completed I will publish and make available to the Deputy.  The main reason for my not being able to accept the amendment is the six months requirement.  Given the amount of work involved, it is possible that work on the report may continue into next summer.  I do not want find myself in the situation whereby having made provision for something in the Finance Bill I would be infringing it because I am trying to get a complicated piece of work done.  The report will be produced and published.</p></speech>

A Finance Bill is not the appropriate place for these types of measures.  What I am seeking from the Minister is a commitment that as in the case of the local property tax report, this report will not be published on budget day and an announcement made that this tax is to be retained.  This is too important a measure to be dealt with in that way.  I can understand that it is hard to know if the working group will produce proposals in six or eight months' time but publishing a report at the start of October and announcing measures thereafter would be the wrong thing to do.</p><p>If we are going to pay any respect to the new budgetary process, the budgetary committee should be looking at these options.  That means they have to be published before the budget in order to give the committee an opportunity to express its opinions and issue feedback.  Rather than publishing something and announcing it within a window of a week or two, the Minister should give the committee the respect it deserves.</p></speech>

I am happy to give a commitment that well in advance of any significant change that is made as part of the merger, I will publish a report on the options that are open to us.

My decision on when that work should start will be informed by the issues that are generated.

As Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, I am intimately aware of how the health of the social insurance fund - whether it is in surplus or deficit - makes a big difference to the figures at budget time.

Is it the case that all possible options, including partial merger and complete merger, will be considered?  My concern is that this will not add up unless the services that are currently being provided through general taxation are funded from the social insurance fund.  One cannot cut between &euro;4 billion and &euro;5 billion of tax, put it into a fund which cannot be used for general taxation and think we are going to be okay.</p></speech>

I have a very clear view on where I want this to go.  I want to find a way in which, at a minimum, either some or all of the USC, as it is currently structured, can make a contribution to the firm maintenance of the benefits we have at the moment.  I do not have a view on where we are in that continuum.  I want to look at ensuring the new benefits for which there is a demand in our society are funded through the social insurance fund, as they should be and as they are in other jurisdictions.  We need to see whether we can use a piece of work like this to fund such benefits.  That is my long-term objective for this work.  The terms of reference will outline some of the thinking about how the group will be able to help me in this regard.</p></speech>

I made the point during discussion on last year's Finance Act that we should have gone further than we did and that it should have been done over a three-year period.  It was decided to go to &euro;950 last year and the Government is proposing an increase of &euro;200 to &euro;1,150 this year.  The amendment proposes an increase to &euro;1,400 and full equalisation in the next finance Bill.  The policy has taken a number of years to bring about the equalisation and there is no reason not to go beyond the increase to &euro;1,150 upon which the Minister has decided this year.  The amendment proposes an increase to &euro;1,400.</p></speech>

The &euro;200 increase provides a significant benefit to small business owners across the country, including small retailers, publicans, farmers and tradesmen.  It is estimated that the credit will be of benefit to approximately 151,600 individuals and business interests in 2018.  In view of the limited resources available to me in budget 2018 and in light of the competing demands for amendments to the tax system, it is not possible to increase the earned income credit by &euro;450 to &euro;1,400 as proposed by Deputy Pearse Doherty.  Such an increase would cost over &euro;37 million in 2018 as compared to the &euro;17 million first-year cost of the &euro;200 increase, which was achievable within the resources available to me.  It would have given a disproportionate benefit from the budget to the self-employed as compared to all other individuals, including PAYE workers, pensioners and welfare recipients.</p> <p>  I accept that differences remain between the taxation of employees and the self-employed.  However it must be acknowledged that some of the differences are to the benefit of the self-employed.  For example, the self-employed continue to benefit from a broader expense deduction regime than that available to employees and there are significant timing benefits regarding the payment of tax liabilities which are available to the self-assessed but which are not available to PAYE workers, depending on the accounting period used by the taxpayer.  Deputies will also be aware that the overall contribution to the Social Insurance Fund by the self-employed is significantly less than that of employees because, as Deputy Burton pointed out earlier, no equivalent to the employer PRSI contribution is payable.  However, Deputies will be aware that A Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to increase the earned income credit to &euro;1,650.  The budget 2018 increase of &euro;200 is a significant further step in that direction and it is my intention to make further progress on increasing this credit in budget 2019, subject to the available resources.</p> <p>  For the reasons outlined, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

It is now November and I am sure the Minister's officials are having a close look at the self-employed tax returns.</p> <p>  To go back to a point I made earlier, it is important to understand that the current number of self-employed and the extraordinary growth in self-employment figures in the economy are both somewhat false in a certain sense because, particularly at lower income levels and in large parts of the construction sector, people on relatively low incomes are being forced into self-employment.  Their choice and that of those who administer the tax system would be for them to be employees.  However, as evidenced by the Paradise Papers, there will always be those who play the system and that is what is being done in this case.</p><p>The Minister's Cabinet colleagues have been holding back in addressing what is an abuse of the tax system.  The logic of it is that if people are being abused and being forced into self-employment, then some of the anomalies, such as the self-employed tax credit, should be of equal status with the tax credit for people on PAYE.  Looking at the figures, there would probably be a surge of up to &euro;400 million to &euro;500 million because of the extraordinary growth in self-employment.</p><p> There is a view of the self-employed as being somehow or other well-off.  The trades where people are effectively forced into self-employment can range from the building industry to labour-intensive areas such as personal services of different kinds.  Their take-home pay is relatively small, however.  Giving them the same tax breaks as PAYE workers makes a lot of sense in fairness and in economic terms.</p><p> I understand the die is cast for this year.  However, it is a wrong decision but, clearly, the Government decided it had a particular framework for spending.  I noted a confidence survey published last weekend stated people did not feel anything from the budget.  I am sure the Minister's officials brought it to his attention.  The reason for this is simple.  If the Minister had just indexed the bands and the allowances at whatever level - certainly for inflation - people would have done better than the notional &euro;5 a week, as previous speakers have suggested.  I am disappointed he has failed to give self-employed people parity, when so many of them are in forced self-employment.  I do not know what economic sense it makes.  The Minister can talk about balancing the books but when he is close to eliminating the deficit, this kind of balance does not really say much.</p><p> Will the Minister share with us how the returns from the self-employed are actually going?  I am sure the Department is looking at it constantly.  Are they up to expectations or, as I expect, exceeding expectations?  Unless, somehow or other, there has been a flight of self-employed people out of the country, it is hard not to see there being a surge, particularly as the big return to employment and self-employment started four years ago.</p></speech>

While there is much focus from the Deputy and others as to where we will end up in November, it has to be seen in the context of a year in which, up until October, we were behind profile.  While we were ahead of where we were a year ago, we were behind the targets set.  Anything that happens in November will be seen by me in that context.</p> <p>  On the point on how people felt after the budget, we went through several budgets where people felt significantly better the day after.  However, we saw the cumulative cost of those budgets.  I was clear in the run-up to budget 2018 that I wanted to make steady progress.  If we end up in a situation where people feel dramatically better off the day after the budget, it is a sign to me that we are going down a path which will bring us back to where we were in the past.  That is not a journey on which I intend to go.</p> <p>  The cost of indexing our income tax system for a full year would be &euro;550 million, money which is not available to me.  That is why I had to make choices with the smaller amount of funding available.</p> <p>  If I had made the choice to move to full parity in a single budget, it would have meant a move to &euro;1,650, which would mean an increase of &euro;700.  This would have meant that a single self-employed individual earning &euro;25,000 would have gained &euro;15 per week, while a PAYE employee on the same income would have gained &euro;1 per week.  That is why I am looking to do it over several budgets.  I am looking to make a bigger move on it next year than this year.</p> <p>  I do not believe anybody should be forced into self-employment.  That is not to say there are issues which will have to be addressed.  I am aware of the Deputy's point and wider concerns about the nature of employment contracts in different occupations.  It is a matter on which I have indirect experience.  I want to see the Minister for Employment and Social Protection's work on this conclude and report.  It is a matter about which I have questions.  If the questions are answered in a bad way, I would have potential concerns.</p></speech>

I hope he will pass on that thought to his colleague, the Minister for Employment and Social Protection.</p> <p>  The Revenue Commissioners know there is a significant loss to the Exchequer through what is happening with bogus self-employment.  Much of that may be contained in the report whenever it is published.  Essentially, we are getting 4.5% as opposed to 14.75% plus from next year through the increase for certain employers in the training levy.  It is a loss of 10.5% in PRSI which could be utilised both to make the system fairer, but also to improve it.  I accept the Minister's bona fides in that he cares about people's cover for when circumstances change and how they may require social protection.  It makes no sense, however, from the point of view of the overall economy to allow what is effectively a fraudulent system of bogus self-employment to grow.</p> <p>  People are devising more and more ways in which to push people into the path of self-employment.  The consequence for the Social Insurance Fund and for the Revenue Commissioners, the collectors of income tax, PRSI and USC, is a significant loss of income.  It particularly affects many young self-employed people who are struggling on lower salaries and wages and reduced terms and conditions than their employed colleagues.  It is fundamentally unfair and destructive in terms of social justice.</p> <p>  The report in question has been ready for quite some time.  I have no idea whether it is being revisited in some way or redacted because there are problems with some sectors or companies.  However, it is unfair to those working, many working extremely hard, and this is what they get.</p><p>They are comparing their situation to that of their brother, sister or spouse who is an employee and has an income tax credit.  Notwithstanding promises this could and would be done within a three year period, it does not seem that it will be looked after next year because the Minister has said the bar is so high.  How was it that at a time when the economy was in a very early stage of recovery it was possible to increase the credit by a third?  That was possible because a choice was made to give it to those who required it.  There is a need to start eliminating some of the phoney stuff in the system in regard to self employment that does not play to people's advantage but, rather, to that of certain employers.</p></speech>

I reiterate that I do not believe people should be forced into self employment.  As we move into November there will be a focus on the level of self-employed returns.  It is inconsistent to say the growth in the self-employment sector is undermining our self-employed tax receipts because those tax receipts could potentially increase in November.  We should wait to see what happens in that regard.</p></speech>

There is an enormous surge in the number of self-employed, in particular at lower levels of pay.  That is evident from statistics.  Many people are in their third or fourth year of self employment.  As the Minister knows, the pattern for the self employed is that by the third year and once the start-up costs and so on of whatever it is they are doing have been accommodated, the income of those people is then hopefully likely to finally rise to a significant point close to the average industrial wage.  Unless such increases occur, how will such people pay for rent or, better still, put a deposit down on a house, get a mortgage and be able to become financially independent?</p></speech>

That is why I anticipate the report to which I have referred the Deputy on a number of occasions will be brought to Cabinet and published soon and should provide an evidence base for examining the issue.  In the context of our earlier discussion on the future of the USC, I have very strong views that in light of all the challenges people face we have to look at ways in which we can renew a social contract.   One way a social contract will be fractured and undermined is through the potential growth of employment practices that would deny people benefits in the future.  I aim to make the report on this matter available soon to provide an evidence base on the issue.</p></speech>

If for some unknown reason the report is further delayed, would the Minister assist members by publishing the submissions that were made to the report?  Submissions were made by various interested parties with views on the issue.  Perhaps the Minister could arrange with his Cabinet colleagues to have that information published in order that members can get a sense of who the lobby and interest groups are that, for whatever reason, seem determined to resist very necessary change.  I am sure the Minister's officials in the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners have told him the kind of loss this is to our PRSI system.</p></speech>

I know we have  strayed a little from the topic but my point is in respect of the self-employed.  There is guidance and a checklist on the Revenue website to determine the employment status of an individual and whether they have a contract of employment or a contract for service.  What the Deputy said is correct and it does not just apply to those at the lower levels.  There are some very high profile people in this country who are apparently self employed.  The Revenue checklist to determine if one is an employee states that, &quot;While all of the following factors may not apply, an individual is normally your employee if: you control how, when and where the work is carried out; they supply labour only;&quot; they are on a fixed payment; they cannot sub-contract their work, etc.  The report will make for interesting reading.  What work is the Revenue doing on this issue and the differentiation between those who are in a contract of employment and a contract for service?  It seems to me that there are many instances where the<i>de facto</i>employer determines all of the issues such as the place and time of work and the payment, yet those working for them are deemed to be self employed.  There is a real issue there and it needs to be examined.</p></speech>

During all of the discussion on the tracker mortgages, what struck me is how the Revenue would deal with redress payments by the banks.

The Minister must ensure that people in this situation are not disadvantaged.</p></speech>

I am sure people are approaching the Minister as well as every other Member as to whether they should have been put on a tracker mortgage.  People may have negotiated a tracker mortgage and at a certain point the bank indicated that the tracker option which had been part of the deal was no longer available.  Will there be a better public information system for people?  The success rate of people who are trying to access the documentation on the details of their deal is variable.  I would like to know about the information system that is in place and whether it will be improved.</p><p>I know some of this is perhaps the responsibility of the consumer information section of the Central Bank but it is important because for many people the sums involved are significant and a number of families have been through a lot.  As the Minister is aware, some financial institutions have been much more recalcitrant than others in addressing the issues.</p></speech>

It goes straight from Revenue to the financial institution.  In light of the revelations we have seen in the past 48 hours, in particular with the State-owned bank, that bank which would receive the mortgage interest relief on behalf of its customers and which failed to provide the Revenue with details of potential tax evasion, is the Minister satisfied that the bank which is predominantly owned by him, given that he is the main shareholder, has at this stage provided to the Revenue officials all of the relevant data that were required from its subsidiary in the Isle of Man?  Is the Minister also satisfied that neither his predecessor nor anybody else in the Department was aware that the bank was targeting Irish individuals for tax avoidance measures?  Has he investigated whether the public interest director who was appointed by his predecessor to the bank was aware of that happening during that period?</p></speech>

I appreciate that.  I think the Minister put that on the record earlier today, or at least the Taoiseach did.  On the matter of the bank, however, the Minister is the main shareholder in AIB.  What the Paradise Papers tell us is that a subsidiary of AIB, at a time when it was State owned, refused access to information that the Revenue Commissioners required.  We were also told that as a banking strategy, at a time when the bank was State owned and the Minister for Finance held 99.8% of the shareholdings in the bank, it targeted Irish individuals for tax evasion purposes to boost the deposits of that subsidiary which would benefit the overall AIB group.  Has the Minister lifted the phone to contact the CEO of AIB or the former public interest director?  Has he asked the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, whether he was aware of any of that at the time?  Were any reports ever given to the Minister by anybody within the Department?  This is a very serious issue.  We are discussing a measure that will see Revenue transfer funds to the same financial institution and it is appropriate that we know that these issues are not just brushed under the carpet.  The Revenue Commissioners will do their job, but as the majority shareholder of AIB, the Minister has a responsibility also to be satisfied on the issue.</p></speech>

They will not comment on any individual case, because it is up to them to do their work in that area.  I spoke to the chairman yesterday morning.  To use Deputy Doherty's phrase, I lifted the phone to him to say that I was obviously very concerned about the information that was contained in those papers and I wanted an update from him.  I asked him for an update on work that was done.  He informed me yesterday that in terms of general avoidance of people's tax obligations through being involved in offshore activity, the Revenue Commissioners in recent years have generated an additional &euro;1 billion in revenue.  He assured me that this matter on any company or individual was and is taken very seriously by him.  No doubt in my future engagement with the chairman on this matter he will give me an update on this issue.</p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners will pursue tax evasion with rigour.  I hope they have the resources to go through those papers and make sure that no stone is left unturned on looking at areas of tax evasion.  On tax avoidance, which is perfectly legal, but completely unethical, it is bad enough from the high flyers in society but when it is a bank that the Irish public bailed out to the tune of &euro;21 billion, sticking up two fingers to us and basically saying that as part of its strategy it would target Irish individuals for tax avoidance, surely the Minister has a responsibility to ask the public interest director &ndash; I think at the time Mr. Dick Spring was appointed to the board &ndash; whether he was aware of that.  Was he aware that a subsidiary was doing this as part of its business plan?  Was the board aware of that?  Was the Minister aware of that?  There cannot be a stand-off approach to this.</p></speech>

In relation to the issue of electric vehicles, there was an opportunity for the Minister to go further in promoting them.  At present, the measure is only directed at employees who get a car through work.  In our alternative budget, Sinn F&eacute;in argued that the bands would be increased by &euro;1,000 and this would encourage more people to take up electric vehicles.  I am asking the Minister to consider the proposal.  There are numerous reasons we should do that.  I understand the Government has moved in certain areas but in terms of the affordability of electric vehicles, I believe we need to continue to subsidise and make it more attractive.  The best way to do that is by looking at the different bands in terms of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, grant and increasing those levels appropriately.  We argue they should be &euro;1,000 per band.</p></speech>

That was because of the resources available to me in this budget.  It does contain two measures, which the Deputy is acknowledging, in respect of the zero rate for benefit-in-kind, BIK, for employer-provided vehicles and an exemption for benefit-in-kind charges for charging stations the employer would provide.  I cannot go any further than that at this point because I do not have the funding available to me to do it.</p></speech>

It is fine.  I am for promoting electric cars.  However, if there is any idea in the Department or the Government that the answer to reducing the amount of greenhouse gases produced by the transport sector is electric cars, then it is missing the point.  Transport is the second biggest producer of greenhouse gases in Ireland.  The way to reduce greenhouse emissions by the transport sector is to change the entire mode of transport and to get people from individual vehicles into public transport.  That is the way that there will be a serious impact on the problem as opposed to just incentivising and pushing electric cars in particular.  The problem is that the Government's approach on public transport is to slash and burn.  The subvention has been drastically reduced by &euro;67 million since 2008.  That is a cut of 70%.  We can see the results at present in the attacks on wages and conditions and the necessary strike by Irish Rail workers.  Does the Minister agree that while electric cars and vehicles are positive, they are not the main answer to dealing with the problem of the transport contribution to greenhouse gas emissions?</p></speech>

It is a modest step but a welcome one.  Why is the exemption limited to one year?  The Minister stated an overall review of benefit-in-kind vehicles will inform decisions in the next budget but it is not great certainty to be giving a company that might be considering providing an electric vehicle to an employee that the exemption has a commitment for one year only.  I am not sure what impact that will have.</p></speech>

However, I do believe it is more of a part of it than Deputy Paul Murphy suggests.  It needs to be accompanied by further improvements in public transport.  Did Deputy Murphy say the public service obligation, PSO, was slashed by 70%?</p></speech>

The subvention going into the CIE group for this year is approximately &euro;265 million.  I think that is the figure, though I stand to be corrected on it.  It is at least flat on where it was a year ago, if not an increase.  Deputy Murphy's approach of describing the Government's attitude to public transport as being slash and burn would come as a bit of a surprise to all those commuters I am looking forward to seeing getting on Luas cross-city in the second week of December, which is an investment in public transport of many hundreds of millions of euro.  Investment is under way in respect of how we improve public transport both at a capital and current level.  It needs to be accompanied, however, by encouraging the roll-out of electric vehicles.  This is on top of what we have at the moment.  We have VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000 per vehicle.  We have an SEAI grant of &euro;5,000 for individuals and &euro;3,800 for businesses.</p> <p>  On Deputy Michael McGrath's point, it is my ultimate intention to have the 0% benefit-in-kind in place for the medium term between three and five years.  I did say that in my budget speech.  I also stated, which pertains to the Deputy's point, that I would look to review it after a year.  The reason for that is I expect to have the review of benefit-in-kind for vehicles back with me by then.  However, I take the Deputy's point that it is important to give medium-term certainty, particularly to employers who will be providing these cars.  It is my intention that it will be in place for a minimum of three years.  </p></speech>

It was meant to be 67% and that has been rounded up on the other thing.  However, the figures that repeatedly come across in various discussions in the D&aacute;il, both in the committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport and in the D&aacute;il as a whole, refer to a total subvention to the CIE group of &euro;321 million in 2008.  That is down - certainly in 2015 it was down to &euro;188 million - and I would say it has come down since then further to around &euro;150 or &euro;160 million, and that does take us into the ballpark of close to a 70% cut.</p></speech>

This may be a debate for another committee on another day.  However, with regard to investment in public transport in general, the figures of which I am aware show a different story compared with that of Deputy Murphy.  On Deputy McGrath's question about the medium-term objective in respect of benefit-in-kind, I made that point in my Second Stage speech on the Finance Bill and not in my budget day speech.</p></speech>

I understand it is not that uncommon in some of these companies for an individual's partner and child to be included in the insurance policy.  If a policy costing &euro;3,000 is provided by the company, that &euro;3,000 is seen as benefit-in-kind and therefore taxable at a rate of approximately 48% when USC etc. is included.  Is that correct?  This individual will have an additional tax burden of &euro;1,400 or &euro;1,500.  How will that be paid?  Will it be paid weekly or at the end of the year?

For example, I am not familiar with how the contracts of employment are working in VHI.  I am not sure if the people answering telephones and looking after front-office desks are being provided with free health insurance as part of their remuneration package.  Many of them would not be on substantial incomes and may now face a substantial tax bill.  The package they signed up to may be reduced by a &euro;1,000 liability.  VHI operates in my parish in Gaoth Dobhair.  I am not familiar with the details of those packages, but many people work in desk jobs and I cannot imagine that their salaries are massive.  Obviously it is a State-owned company as well.  Has the Department considered the impact on employees as a result of people who would have taken up employment at a certain level of remuneration but were offered a health insurance package as part of that remuneration which was untaxed and was therefore worth a certain amount of money but is now only worth half what they expected it to be worth?</p></speech>

Of course, the converse applies.  Somebody working in another company located beside the office the Deputy mentioned, who is provided with a health insurance policy, is paying tax on it.  In the interest of a level playing field in our tax code, the employees of both companies should be paying tax on the benefit of that policy to them.</p></speech>

In developing the proposal, is the Department familiar with a State-owned company which may be paying certain staff - I am not certain because I am not familiar with this - minimum wage but in addition provided a health policy which was worth &euro;3,000 for them and their family, but is now only worth &euro;1,500 as a result of this measure?  If that were the case I am not arguing we should not do this measure, but obviously employees deserve fairness in this regard.</p></speech>

The Minister explained why the existing BIK legislation does not already apply.  In other employment sectors where the employer provides an advantage to an employee, a benefit-in-kind, which is intrinsic to the nature of that business, for example, a bank providing a lower interest rate, a wholesaler providing goods at cost, a motor dealer selling a car at cost, are all of those already captured by BIK legislation?  If they are, I do not understand why a health insurer providing a health insurance policy to employees is not already captured.</p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners are broadly confident that the BIK policy, as currently defined, is being implemented consistently across the economy.  During their review of it, though, they identified this gap, which is what we are looking to address.  We have no evidence of there being significant comparable issues in other sectors.  Were that to change in any way, no doubt the Revenue Commissioners would revert to me and make a request, and I would make a legislative change in that area.</p></speech>

I just Googled it and it seems that it is standard practice for VHI to offer all of its employees a tax-free health package.  That is stated on its website.  For low-income earners, this is a take home pay cut.  It is a tax, so it should be monitored where we have the power to do so.</p></speech>

The effect of section 458 is to ensure that the value of a tax credit cannot exceed the tax due, as such a scenario would result in a refund to the taxpayer from Revenue.  These two tax credits should have been previously included in the table in this section; this was an error.  There is no change in policy.</p></speech>

This amendment calls for a report on the introduction of a different series of higher bands of income tax.  They are listed in the amendment, although the rate for earnings over &euro;250,000 should be 65%.  This forms part of our overall tax proposal, including the abolition of USC for income under &euro;90,000, shifting the tax burden onto very high-income earners and making income tax more progressive.</p><p>In Spain, for example, there is an income tax band from &euro;175,000 to &euro;300,000 and another band over &euro;300,000.  Germany's highest tax band is over &euro;250,000.  Statistically speaking, the more bands a state has, the greater the possibility of making income tax more progressive.  The Government makes much of the income tax system being progressive.</p></speech>

This would be in addition to a USC system with five separate rates and a PRSI system with further distinct features.  It is my view that our current three-part system of personal taxation is already complex and can be difficult for taxpayers and employers to understand.  If further tax bands were introduced, it would lead to an even more complicated system of taxation.  It would also significantly increase the marginal rate of tax.</p> <p>  It is not clear from the text of the amendment what rate the Deputy would propose to apply on earnings above &euro;250,000, but the rate of 60% proposed for the preceding band would result in a marginal tax rate of 72% for employees and 75% for the self-employed.  Marginal tax rates of this level would have consequences.  My intention is to focus on encouraging work.</p> <p>  For the Deputy's information, I have been informed by Revenue that the estimated annual yield from the increased tax rates that he proposes, on a tax unit basis, would be &euro;1.9 billion if a rate of 60% were to apply on income over &euro;250,000 and &euro;2.2 billion if an increased rate of 65% were contemplated.</p> <p>  For the policy reasons that I have outlined in the course of this debate, I am not inclined to commit further resources to the analysis of the proposal outlined by the Deputy.  For this reason, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

If this amendment were combined with our proposal to abolish the USC on income under &euro;90,000, the effective rate of tax paid by even relatively high earners would still be approximately 50% or lower as opposed to the high figures that the Minister has referenced.  The amendment is meant to read "65 per cent", so &euro;2.2 billion would be raised by our approach of taxing high-income earners in our society.</p></speech>

This is an SME-focused share option programme intended to help small, growing companies to attract and retain key staff.  It operates by providing that any gain realised on the exercise of qualifying KEEP share options will not be subject to income tax, PRSI or USC at the date of exercise.  The gain will, however, be subject to capital gains tax on a future disposal of the shares.</p><p>The relief, therefore, has a twofold benefit.  First, it reduces the tax payable from income tax to capital gains tax rates.  Second, and possibly more important, from the perspective of small unquoted companies, it provides that the tax will become payable on disposal of the shares when the sales proceeds would be available to pay the tax due.</p><p>These amendments make a number of technical changes to the KEEP legislation in order to ensure that it operates as intended and is in compliance with EU requirements.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 amend the definition of &quot;qualifying company&quot; to ensure that it is compliant with the EU freedoms.  It expands the definition of &quot;qualifying company&quot; to include a company resident in Ireland and incorporated in an EEA state other than Ireland.  It also allows for companies with a listing on similar or comparable markets to the enterprise securities market in an EEA state or a tax treaty country.</p><p>Amendment No. 12 ensures that a double relief cannot be claimed by providing that relief under the employment and investment incentive, EII, cannot also be claimed where relief applies under KEEP.  I commend these amendments to the committee.</p><p>I would also note that my officials are continuing to engage with small business representatives following the publication of the KEEP legislation to ensure that the technical legislative provisions are operable in practice and that the scheme is effective in meeting its policy objective.  I therefore wish to inform the committee that I may introduce further amendments to the legislation on Report Stage if necessary in order to ensure that the relief can operate as intended.</p><p>However I would also caution that any further amendments must be compatible with State aid approval and as such a balance may have to be struck between what is desirable and what is feasible.</p></speech>

T&aacute; m&eacute; anseo inniu, dar nd&oacute;igh, le labhairt faoi cheannteidil Bhille na dteangacha oifigi&uacute;la (leas&uacute;) 2017.  D&eacute;arfainn go dtuigeann an coiste an c&uacute;lra maidir leis an athbhreithni&uacute; ar an Acht teanga.  Foils&iacute;odh tortha&iacute; an athbhreithnithe i m&iacute; Aibre&aacute;n 2014.  Mar at&aacute; a fhios ag an gcoiste, bh&iacute; go leor m&iacute;sh&aacute;stacht le cuid de na leasuithe a bh&iacute; molta sa ch&eacute;ad leagan den Bhille leasaithe a d'eascair &oacute;n athbhreithni&uacute; sin agus n&iacute;or foils&iacute;odh riamh &eacute; d&aacute; bharr.  D'iarr an t-iarAire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Se&aacute;n Kyne, athbhreithni&uacute; eile a dh&eacute;anamh ar an mBille nuair a cheapadh &eacute; don aireacht anuraidh.  Tar &eacute;is thr&eacute;imhse comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in i m&iacute; Mheithimh na bliana seo, foils&iacute;odh ceannteidil an Bhille nua.  Is d&oacute;igh go bhfuil cur amach maith ag an gcoiste ar an bpointe seo ar c&eacute;ard at&aacute; sna ceannteidil.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; i gceist agam mar sin dul tr&iacute;d na ceannteidil ceann i ndiaidh cheann ach tabharfaidh m&eacute; l&eacute;argas ar na spriocanna at&aacute; againn leis an mBille.</p> <p>  Ba ch&oacute;ir a r&aacute; i dtosach gurb &eacute; an bunfhadhb at&aacute; againn leis an mBille nua seo n&aacute; cinnti&uacute; go leanann an tAcht do bheith ina thaca&iacute;ocht &eacute;ifeachtach do gach duine ar mhian leo seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; d'ardchaighde&aacute;n i nGaeilge a fh&aacute;il &oacute;n St&aacute;it.  &Oacute; mo thaith&iacute; f&eacute;in agus taith&iacute; na Roinne de agus &oacute;n bhfianaise at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il &oacute; thaighde &oacute; Oifig an Choimisin&eacute;ara Teanga agus &oacute; na heagrais Ghaeilge agus gr&uacute;pa&iacute; eile, creidim go bhfuil &eacute;ileamh ann i measc an phobail ar sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a bheith ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge.

T&aacute; m&eacute; cinnte go bhfuil cur amach ag comhalta&iacute; an choiste air sin &oacute;na dtaith&iacute; f&eacute;in.

Mar at&aacute; a fhios ag an gcoiste, cuireadh c&oacute;ras na sc&eacute;imeanna ar bun chun cur le l&iacute;on agus caighde&aacute;n na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge a bheadh &aacute; gcur ar f&aacute;il ag na comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; don phobal.

Ag an am c&eacute;anna, t&aacute; s&eacute; aitheanta againn go raibh agus go bhfuil go leor deacrachta&iacute; leis an gc&oacute;ras.  Ina thr&aacute;chtaireacht n&iacute;os t&uacute;isce i mbliana, chuala muid &oacute;n gCoimisin&eacute;ir Teanga faoi na laigeachta&iacute; a bhaineann le c&oacute;ras na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga.

Mar sin, mar chuid den Bhille nua, t&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist c&oacute;ras na gcaighde&aacute;in a thabhairt isteach anseo in &Eacute;irinn.  Faoin gc&oacute;ras seo, beidh rang&uacute; le d&eacute;anamh ar chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; ag baint &uacute;s&aacute;id as rialach&aacute;in chun caighde&aacute;n a leagan s&iacute;os do na comhlachta&iacute; seo.

M&aacute; t&aacute; an c&oacute;ras nua seo chun a bheith &eacute;ifeachtach, beidh orainn d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; earca&iacute;ochta.

M&aacute; t&aacute;imid chun feabhas a chur ar seo, caithfidh an St&aacute;t l&iacute;on na bhfostaithe St&aacute;it at&aacute; in ann seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge a mh&eacute;ad&uacute; agus a chinnti&uacute; go bhfuil Gaeilge ar a dtoil ag oifigigh St&aacute;it at&aacute; ag feidhmi&uacute; i gceantair Ghaeltachta.</p> <p>  Chun an cheist seo a fhiosr&uacute;, labhair muid le Ranna St&aacute;it &eacute;ags&uacute;la le linn dr&eacute;acht&uacute; na gceannteideal agus t&aacute; pl&eacute; lean&uacute;nach ar bun leis an Roinn Caiteachais Phoibl&iacute; agus Athch&oacute;irithe agus leis an tSeirbh&iacute;s um Cheapach&aacute;in Phoibl&iacute; maidir le ceist na hearca&iacute;ochta.</p><p>Beidh s&eacute; mar chusp&oacute;ir sa Bhille go mbeidh 50% de na daoine nua a earca&iacute;tear don tseirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute; ina gcainteoir&iacute; Gaeilge, go mbeidh gach oifig phoibl&iacute; at&aacute; lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht ag feidhmi&uacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge agus go mbeidh na comhlachta&iacute; in ann freastal ar an &eacute;ileamh &oacute;n bpobal ar sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  N&iacute; tharl&oacute;idh s&eacute; seo thar o&iacute;che.  Tuigimid sin.  Creidim gurb &iacute; an earca&iacute;ocht cro&iacute;l&aacute;r na ceiste agus t&aacute;im d&oacute;chasach gur f&eacute;idir t&oacute;g&aacute;il, ar bhonn c&eacute;imni&uacute;il, ar l&iacute;on na bhfostaithe le Gaeilge agus, ag eascairt as sin, go mbeidh muid in ann feabhas a chur ar shol&aacute;thar seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge mar is c&oacute;ir.</p><p> Is iad sin na m&oacute;rphoint&iacute; &oacute; na ceannteidil.

T&aacute;imid ag iarraidh cinnti&uacute; go n-&eacute;asc&oacute;idh comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; &uacute;s&aacute;id ainmneacha agus seolta&iacute; sa d&aacute; theanga oifigi&uacute;la.  Is rud bun&uacute;sach &eacute; seo ach is rud f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; freisin.  T&aacute;imid ag iarraidh cinnti&uacute; go mbeidh ainmneacha Gaeilge agus l&oacute;g&oacute;nna i nGaeilge ag gach comhlacht St&aacute;it mar go bhfuil siombalachas l&aacute;idir ag baint leis na nithe seo.  T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh an St&aacute;it ag l&eacute;iri&uacute; meas ar &aacute;r gc&eacute;ad teanga n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta agus is modh d&iacute;reach agus simpl&iacute; &eacute; seo chun &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.</p><p> C&aacute; bhfuil muid anois leis an mBille?  Faoi l&aacute;thair t&aacute;imid ag obair i gcomhr&eacute;ir le dr&eacute;acht&oacute;ir in Oifig an Ard-Aighne chun an Bille a dhr&eacute;acht&uacute;.  Ag an am c&eacute;anna agus muid ag foilsi&uacute; na ceannteidil, t&aacute;imid i mbun comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in leis na Ranna St&aacute;it &aacute;bhartha, gr&uacute;pa&iacute; Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta, an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga agus p&aacute;irtithe leasmhara eile le cinnti&uacute; go mbeidh an Bille is fearr, is &eacute;ifeachta&iacute; agus is l&aacute;idre gur f&eacute;idir a bheith againn le tabhairt &oacute;s comhair an Oireachtais.  T&aacute; na ceannteidil curtha faoi bhr&aacute;id an chomhchoiste ar mhaithe le scr&uacute;d&uacute; r&eacute;amhreachtach a dh&eacute;anamh orthu.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il againn go mbeidh an Bille ar chl&aacute;r reachta&iacute;ochta an Rialtais ag t&uacute;s 2018.  Creidim go l&aacute;idir gur ag obair i gcomhar lena ch&eacute;ile is fearr a bhainfimid t&oacute;rtha&iacute; dearfacha amach don teanga agus do phobal na Gaeilge.  Ag deireadh an lae t&aacute; na cusp&oacute;ir&iacute; c&eacute;anna againn ar fad.

Bh&iacute; smaointe ag an gCoimisin&eacute;ir Teanga faoi sin agus phl&eacute;igh muid leis iad.  S&iacute;lim go gcaithfimid breathn&uacute; n&iacute;os g&eacute;ire air sin, go h&aacute;irithe ar ruda&iacute; ar n&oacute;s an c&aacute;s sin a tharla ar maidin.  Bh&iacute; go leor ceisteanna ag an Seanad&oacute;ir.  Maidir leis an gceann faoin Roinn Caiteachais Phoibl&iacute; agus Athch&oacute;irithe, bh&iacute; c&uacute;pla cruinni&uacute; againn leis an Roinn agus bh&iacute; na hoifigigh thar a bheith cabhrach agus dearfach i rith na comhr&aacute;ite uilig a bh&iacute; againn.  D'aithin siad go raibh fadhb ann leis an earca&iacute;ocht agus le l&iacute;on na ndaoine le Gaeilge sa St&aacute;tch&oacute;ras agus go bhfuil deacracht ann maidir le postanna le Gaeilge.  Nuair a ceapadh m&eacute; f&eacute;in agus mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an tUasal &Oacute; Conaire, in&aacute;r bpostanna ag deireadh na bliana seo caite, ghabh muid timpeall na Ranna St&aacute;it uilig ag caint leis na hoifigigh pearsanra.  Fuair muid taca&iacute;ocht don rud a bh&iacute; muid ag d&iacute;ol leo - seachas i Roinn n&oacute; d&oacute; - is &eacute; sin go raibh g&aacute; le n&iacute;os m&oacute; daoine le Gaeilge a fh&aacute;il isteach sa St&aacute;tch&oacute;ras.  Luaigh siad c&uacute;is na deacrachta agus bh&iacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith simpl&iacute;.  Bh&iacute; orthu daoine a fh&aacute;il le scil ar leith ar chostas neodrach do na Ranna seo.  D&aacute; mbeadh siad in ann teacht ar thuilleadh daoine le Gaeilge, cuirfid&iacute;s fa&iacute;lte m&oacute;r rompu.</p><p>T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil s&eacute; aitheanta ag an Seirbh&iacute;s um Cheapach&aacute;in Phoibl&iacute; go bhfuil fadhb ann i dtaobh an bhealach ina l&aacute;imhse&aacute;ladh na com&oacute;rtais.  T&aacute; s&iacute; tar &eacute;is breathn&uacute; ar na c&oacute;rais agus, go bhfios d&uacute;inn agus m&aacute; t&aacute; an ceart agam, t&aacute; roinnt tweaking d&eacute;anta aici ar an gc&oacute;ras a &uacute;s&aacute;idtear.  T&aacute; s&iacute; ag dul sa treo agus go mbeidh toradh n&iacute;os fearr ar na com&oacute;rtais at&aacute; aici le haghaidh tuilleadh daoine le Gaeilge a shol&aacute;thar don St&aacute;tch&oacute;ras.  Is fadhb m&oacute;r &eacute;.  Chuaigh muid ag go leor Ranna agus d&uacute;irt siad nach raibh siad in ann daoine le Gaeilge a fh&aacute;il.  Is &eacute; sin ceann de na deacrachta&iacute;.  Chun dul ar ais go buncheist an Seanad&oacute;ra, go ginear&aacute;lta t&aacute; na daoine a bhfuil muid ag pl&eacute; leo sa Roinn Caiteachais Phoibl&iacute; agus Athch&oacute;irithe thar a bheith cabhrach.  Aithn&iacute;onn siad go bhfuil fadhb ann agus b&iacute;onn siad ag iarraidh tac&uacute; le r&eacute;iteach na faidhbe a aimsi&uacute;.</p><p> Ar cheist na rialach&aacute;n agus rang&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar na comhlachta&iacute;, t&aacute; roinnt mhachnaimh d&eacute;anta againn air seo.  I dtaobh an rangaithe, t&aacute; roinnt ruda&iacute; a sheasann amach.  F&eacute;adfa&iacute; a r&aacute; gur f&eacute;idir leis na Ranna St&aacute;it, go h&aacute;irithe d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d a bhfuil interface m&oacute;r acu leis an bpobal, a chur isteach i rang&uacute; amh&aacute;in.  Bheadh rang&uacute; eile ann i leith na hearn&aacute;la tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al.  Bheadh ceann eile do na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is &aacute;iti&uacute;la.  T&aacute; a l&aacute;n ruda&iacute; a tharl&oacute;idh anseo go nad&uacute;rtha agus a bheadh &eacute;asca.  Is &eacute; an &aacute;it ina bheidh an deacracht n&aacute; nuair a tagtar s&iacute;os go dt&iacute; cuid de na comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; - comhlachta&iacute; leath-St&aacute;it.  Beidh cinneadh le d&eacute;anamh maidir le conas a dh&eacute;ile&aacute;lann na comhlachta&iacute; seo leis an bpobal.  Is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil dreamanna ar n&oacute;s an HSE a bhfuil interface m&oacute;r acu leis an bpobal.  Nuair a tagtar s&iacute;os go dt&iacute; comhlachta&iacute; ina bhfuil c&uacute;pla duine ag obair ag pl&eacute; le h&aacute;bhair nimhneach n&oacute; whatever, anseo caithfear a r&aacute; c&eacute;n s&oacute;rt catag&oacute;ir inar ch&oacute;ir iad a chur.  Is &eacute; sin an &aacute;it ina mbeidh na deacrachta&iacute;.  N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go mbeidh deacrachta&iacute; leis na pr&iacute;omhchomhlachta&iacute;.  T&aacute; go leor machnaimh &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh againn air seo agus t&aacute;imid ag breathn&uacute; air.  Chas muid le Rialtas na Breataine Bige freisin agus chuaigh a ionadaithe tr&iacute;d na deacrachta&iacute; a bh&iacute; acu.  T&aacute; siadsan ag feidhmi&uacute; c&oacute;ras na caighde&aacute;n le roinnt blianta.  Ag pointe amh&aacute;in th&aacute;inig an c&oacute;ras beagnach go dt&iacute; l&aacute;n stad mar gheall ar chomh casta a bh&iacute; na caighde&aacute;in a leagadh s&iacute;os.  Is rud amh&aacute;in nach bhfuil muid ag iarraidh &eacute; sin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; s&aacute;ch deacair bheith ag pl&eacute; le sc&eacute;imeanna teanga.  N&iacute;l muid ag iarraidh cr&iacute;ochn&uacute; suas le c&oacute;ras eile at&aacute; chomh casta leis agus lena thagann an t-uaf&aacute;s riarach&aacute;in.  T&aacute;imid ag iarraidh go mbeidh na caighde&aacute;in a leagfaidh muid amach chomh simpl&iacute; agus is f&eacute;idir.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il againn go mbeidh muid in ann dr&eacute;achtchaighde&aacute;in n&oacute; dr&eacute;achtrialach&aacute;in a chur le ch&eacute;ile mar phl&eacute;ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is nuair a bheidh an Bille r&eacute;idh le dul tr&iacute;d an Oireachtas.</p></speech>

B&iacute;mid ag s&uacute;il go bhfaighimid daoine le hardchaighde&aacute;n scileanna teanga idir labhartha agus scr&iacute;ofa isteach ansin.  Is beith&iacute;och ar leith &eacute; sin.

Is ceann de spriocanna na gceannteideal &eacute; go mbeidh na hoifig&iacute; Gaeltachta uilig ag feidhmi&uacute; tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge amach anseo.  Caithfimid bheith ar an airdeall faoi sin.  Nuair a bhfaighfimid daoine isteach sna hoifig&iacute; sin, caithfimid bheith cinnte go bhfuil na scileanna ar ardchaighde&aacute;n acu.  T&aacute; s&eacute; difri&uacute;il ansin nuair a tagtar go dt&iacute; Ranna St&aacute;it at&aacute; lonnaithe ar Shr&aacute;id Chill Dara, mar shampla.  B'fh&eacute;idir go dteasta&iacute;onn leibh&eacute;al difri&uacute;il Gaeilge ansin.  Braitheann s&eacute; go leor ar an bpost agus ar an ngr&aacute;d at&aacute; i gceist.

B'fh&eacute;idir go mbeidh am ann le haghaidh oili&uacute;int a chur ar dhaoine i gcuid de na gr&aacute;danna eile.
