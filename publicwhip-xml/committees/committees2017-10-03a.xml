I will first talk briefly about the trends in the sector and current performance, go on to look at some opportunities and, finally, document for the committee the Teagasc response to the situation in which the tillage sector finds itself.</p><p>I start with an arresting chart on which we show average family farm income across the main Irish enterprises for the period 2013 to 2016.  The most recent data available from the national farm survey is from 2016.  This is the chart to which I come back time and time again because it points to the huge challenge faced by the tillage sector, albeit not only by that sector.  That said, the contrast between an average family farm income, which includes direct payments, of &euro;55,000 for dairying and &euro;30,000 for tillage highlights the gap that exists now but which, traditionally, was much narrower.  On top of that, members will of course be aware that the single farm payment has become increasingly important to the incomes of tillage farmers.  On average over the period, it came to approximately 75%.  As such, that graph is the one which is of most concern to us and, I am sure, to tillage farmers.</p><p> I move on to some other facts about the sector.  It is a relatively small sector, accounting for approximately 9% of farm land.  The area under tillage has been decreasing over the last five years as members will see from the chart setting out the trend at the bottom of page 2 of the slides document.  It has declined by just over 14% over the last five years.  We estimate that there are currently 3,000 specialised tillage farmers.  Production is between 2.2 million to 2.5 million tonnes per annum and the product is used predominantly for animal feed but also for malting for brewing, some food grade oats and oils and some milling wheat.  From the point of the view of the agronomics of the sector, it is classified very much as high input, high output.  One of the paradoxes to some extent and something which often interests people from outside the country in particular is the fact that we have some of the highest yields in the world.  As against that, however, we have very high costs of production.  Of course, the other distinguishing feature of the sector, which has given rise to some difficulty in recent years with the competition for land, is the large area which is leased.  It is of the order of 50% of the area sown.</p><p> Overleaf on page 3, our document provides some favour of what has been happening at county level.  Members will see that between 2007 and 2016 most counties experienced significant declines in area, notably Cork, Kilkenny and Wexford, albeit with some exceptions on the other side of the graph, in particular in County Meath.  The diagram at the bottom of page 3 emphasises the point that we are substantial net importers of product.  Members will see that the gap set out in the final bar for 2015 is between a use of approximately 6 million tonnes and a production level of between 2 million and 2.5 million tonnes.  The graph at the top of page 4 shows that we are price takers when it comes to cereals.  The world market dictates the price situation, especially having regard to the issue of stocks, which have been on the increase.  That has put tremendous price pressure on an already tight world demand and supply situation.</p><p> As far as the current harvest is concerned, Teagasc advisors have kept a constant watch over the season.  This year, we consider that yields have been relatively good, but not exceptional.  The cereal harvest is, we are happy to say, almost complete.  There is approximately 5% left to be harvested.  In some parts of the country, however, there are significant areas which still face difficulties, in particular Donegal, the west and some parts of the midlands.</p><p>Trafficability and crop breakdown are emerging issues.  We estimate about 30% of beans are left to be harvested and 20% of straw is still to be baled nationally.  Of course, we are all aware of the price of straw, and some quality issues have also been reported.</p><p> In summary, while this sector has faced and is facing severe challenges, there are also opportunities.  I would emphasise that these opportunities are largely emerging in niche areas and we are endeavouring to identify premium markets.  For example, there may well be a development around &ldquo;Irish only&rdquo; product, which is something Teagasc has been looking at.  In the drink sector, there are opportunities in distilling, although that gives raise to particular technical challenges for the producer, and also around craft beers.  Increasingly, as the committee is aware, in markets for some of our main export products, for example, the German market, consumers are looking for genetic modification-free, GM-free products, which presents an opportunity for the grain sector.  I am happy to say there are opportunities emerging around human food grade markets, such as oats and cold-pressed oils.  We include the potato sector within the overall tillage sector and opportunities are emerging around chipping and salad potatoes.  Certified seed crops also present opportunities.</p><p> Looking to the future, there are certainly opportunities around organic products.  We consider this to be a niche area but there is definitely a market for some crops.  Unfortunately, we are all too aware that when price pressure emerges, in particular during economic downturns, there tends to be a convergence between the organic and the conventionally produced.  I have mentioned the issue around genetically modified, GM, crops.  As the committee is aware, imported GM products continue to be fed to animals but no GM crops are grown in Ireland.  As I said, a consumer issue is emerging in some of our main markets regarding GM-free produce.  We certainly foresee that the dairy sector will have to respond to this demand for GM-free.</p><p> The Teagasc response is to work with partners in the industry, particularly with our producer clients and the processing sector.  From a research perspective, we are of course looking at yield and sustainability of cereal crops in all their dimensions, not just economic or environmental.  We are looking at the opportunities that might exist for alternative crops for import substitution and higher value markets.  We are looking to develop higher value end uses for cereals, and I have already mentioned the opportunities that exist for distilling.  Of course, we are always striving to produce better and more robust varieties, and there are some very exciting approaches in the molecular sciences that will assist this process.  Of course, one can have the best research in the world, but without good advice it will not be effective.  Again, the emphasis is continuously on increasing adoption of best technology to reduce costs, to produce more sustainably and to produce product that the market requires.  We are working closely with industry to target programmes around areas that are emerging and growing in importance, such as malting barley, potatoes and distilling.</p><p> We would emphasise the importance of training our young farmers.  It is a very demanding sector and education is essential.  We want to develop the role of new technologies.  Again, I want to emphasise the great potential we see for improving the breeding of new varieties through marker assisted and genomic selection, which is now being used to increase the rate of varietal improvement.</p><p>There is huge interest among scientists all over the world in the potential that the novel technology of gene editing offers, and we believe it has the potential to increase significantly the rate of varietal improvement.  The role of GIS technology is being investigated.  We have produced the so-called nutrient management planning online tool, which is allowing us to focus on the extraordinary variability that exists in yields and in the application of nutrients at field level.  That will enable us not only to improve average yields but also to improve the costs in terms of chemical application of fertilisers.  We are going to see much more precision in the application of nutrients, which will have positive environmental and economic effects.  We are even seeing the use of handheld devices to detect unseen diseases to target early responses better.</p><p> We think it is important to emphasise the potential for the bio-economy, although this will depend hugely on the appropriate incentives being in place.  After a number of years when this sector was somewhat in the doldrums, we hope the impending renewable heat incentive will provide a new fillip to the opportunities that exist.  There is no doubt that, without support, the industry will continue to stagnate due to a lack of investment and the opportunities that exist in this important sector may not be fully realised.</p><p> That is a summary of our presentation.  My two colleagues will answer all the hard questions.</p></speech>

As he knows, this is a challenging area and that is why we decided to start the work programme with it.  We had a number of delegations in last week and there are more in today.  What we intend to do is get the ball rolling on a discussion about the tillage sector, which I think needed to be done, and we intend to produce a report in due course on this matter.  We move to questions.  I call Deputy Cahill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-03a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017100300002#P00300"><p>I thank Professor Boyle for a comprehensive presentation.  I have a number of questions.  First, with regard to the single farm payment, we are going into another review of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  Has any analysis been done of, say, the Irish experience with a 10% or 15% reduction in premia and the impact this would have on the future of the sector?  We had a number of groups in here last week and they were extremely pessimistic about where the whole industry is going.  We talked about niche markets, Jameson and all the different craft beers that we are now producing, but the tonnage that is needed for that is probably very low in the overall context.  How much would that industry need in terms of market share to have a significant impact on the tonnage we are producing?  Flahavan's are paying a serious premium price for oats.  What kind of tonnage can that market absorb?</p> <p>  While it might not be fair to ask Teagasc about this, I have a question about barley.  When I was young, to have a malting contract was a prized possession but the value of that seems to have gone out the window, as it were.  To link malting barley with feed barley as regards price seems a contradiction in terms because they are going to different markets.  Surely the price mechanism for calculating what malting barley is worth should not have any synchronisation with feed barley.</p> <p>  Biomass is increasingly becoming a topic for us.  We have our targets to meet by 2021 and if we do not meet them, we are going to suffer significant penalties.</p><p>We have not even started to go the way we should with regard to biomass.  Our stocking rate is probably at 50% of capacity in terms of the utilisation or our land.  It is 80 kg per hectare, and with a derogation it is 170 kg.  If we devoted 20% of our land to the production of biomass, how much could it do for the whole cereal and tillage sector?  We could grow sugar beet or break crops such as elephant grass, or miscanthus, but it would be very hard to get a conventional tillage farmer to buy into them.  Anyone who did so in the past couple of years was badly bitten but conventional tillage crops can have a role to play in meeting our climate change targets.  There was a good conference in Gurteen recently but we need a far greater emphasis on the potential of biomass.</p><p> My next question is on the potential for us to produce GM-free dairy products for the market place.  I have worries over our ability to go down that route and maintain a competitive production base with other countries but can we produce enough protein to be independent?  If we go the GM-free route, will be able to produce enough feed for our dairy and beef industry?  Organics give a premium but when a market gets saturated that premium goes out the window.  We would be competing with countries that were not on the same thoroughfare so would we be able to keep our competitive advantage?  At the moment the price is in a relatively good place but slumps will come.  Consumers are starting to push us down the GM-free route but price is the common denominator and I wonder if we might leave ourselves in a very vulnerable position in terms of our cost base.</p><p> I welcome the presentation.  This industry is at a serious crossroads and what has worked in the past is not going to work in the future.  When the report comes out I would love to hear grain men or tillage men say they can see light at the end of the tunnel, perhaps a five-year or ten-year roadmap to a decent market for our products at a reasonable price.  The graph of world markets shown in the presentation does not look like it can give a lifeline to our tillage sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-03a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1383" speakername="Paul Daly" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017100300002#Q00200"><p>I welcome the delegation from Teagasc.  I agree with the policy on food but does it have a GM policy in the area of energy crops?  There is a difference in the end user in this case.  Grain growers and farmers' organisations were before the committee last week.  I am from the midlands and some of my neighbours, as well as people in the west and north west, have been badly affected.  While not necessarily losing their full crop, they have lost straw and by the time they got around to cutting their grain it was probably not worth cutting.  If they were to knock on the witnesses' doors for advice, based on what has happened in the past two years when they have lost their harvest, in what direction would they send them?  What advice would the witnesses give them in the area of diversification?  There might be five good years of weather but we cannot say that as we cannot predict the weather.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-03a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1341" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017100300002#R00100"><p>I thank the witnesses and welcome the presentation.  There is a huge discrepancy in single farm payments across the country, from &euro;150,000 to &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000.  Do they think they need to be sorted out to keep family farms more buoyant?  Being realistic, conditions in some parts of the country are such that a lot of people are going to pull out of the grain sector.  Professor Boyle spoke about the RHI and new ways of creating energy.  Does he agree that marginal land is not fit to grow willow, or some of the crops about which people are dreaming?  Does he think the RHI should only be paid for what is produced, reared or sown in Ireland?  What is his view on tillage sector incomes, which are going down?  What is his view on biogas from silage?  I know Teagasc is doing research on this but would it be more viable for some people than others?</p> <p>  What research is Teagasc doing into craft beers?  I was at a few events in Dublin and it is clear that people in the sector are making a lot of effort to get their beers known and exported.  In either New Zealand or Australia they have developed a type of grain which is unique but costs &euro;1,200 because it is wanted everywhere.  What work has Teagasc done into this type of thing, where the farmer would not be the price taker and the sector would benefit?</p> <p>  The witnesses spoke of large fines coming down the line.  Do they agree we are in a bit of trouble with biomass?  A lot of it appears not to be efficient to grow.  I feel that the guy in the suit or the guy with the biro gets more from tillage sector knowledge transfer, whether in respect of beef or sheep, than the farmer who gets &euro;400 or &euro;500.  It has not been a great scheme from the point of view of attracting farmers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-03a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerry Boyle" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017100300002#R00200"><p>There may be a bit of confusion about the knowledge transfer scheme and long-standing activity.  Teagasc originated the term "knowledge transfer" a long time ago.  The advisory service gives advice and is nothing to do with the scheme.  The knowledge group schemes are a different matter and I am well aware of the issues that have arisen but I am talking about the relationship advisers have with farmers on a day-to-day basis.</p> <p>  Deputies Fitzmaurice and Cahill raised the difficulties around the single farm payment.  We carried out analysis of reform of the Common Agricultural Policy a couple of years ago, and will do more when the scenarios firm up a bit more.  It is not fully appreciated but the tillage sector was revealed to have, proportionately, the single greatest negative impact.  Some 75% of family farm income is accounted for by the single farm payment.  Any cut in that, such as has been mooted in the event of a hard Brexit, would reflect this.</p><p>If a hard Brexit were to occur, there would be approximately the same or a little less negative impact on family farm income.  Family farm income is essentially the net margin, having substracted from revenue all variable and fixed costs and added the single farm payment.</p><p> Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice asked a question about the distribution of payments that I am reluctant to answer directly because it involves a political issue.  I am well aware of the debate in that regard and the discussions taking place on capping and so on which is at the core of the Deputy's question.  We can analyse the impact of different caps, but it is not really our business to comment on where the cap should be or if there should be one.  In particular, we would be concerned about the impact of any reform on the productive commercial sector of Irish agriculture.  That was a point of debate on the last occasion and will be on the next.</p><p> There were many detailed remarks that, with the permission of the Chairman, I will ask my colleagues to address as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice also mentioned craft beers and high value grains.  The value of grain in Ireland is linked with commodity markets which are largely driven by maize in terms of grain or soy in terms of proteins and horse feed.  It is worth remembering that on a worldwide basis they are both predominantly genetically-modified, GM, crops; therefore, Irish producers of conventional crops are competing in markets that are set by GM crops.  As Professor Boyle said, we are trying to identify premium markets, in particular when the product is marketed as having been made only from Irish ingredients, which means that it has to be sourced in Ireland, not on world commodity markets.  Therefore, the value of the grain or tillage product used to make the product is linked with its end value.  Tonnages in some high value markets are currently very small, but because we have a small tillage sector, if we find suitable export markets, we could export large quantities of our produce to high value markets and make very little impact on global markets.  A big increase in our oat crop exports would have very little impact on a global scale, but it would add a lot more value here.  We are considering such measures.</p> <p>  We have not developed a variety of grain worth &euro;1,200 per tonne, but I wish we had.  A reason we have an interest in the drinks sector is that the alcohol yield of a grain is inversely related to its protein content.  Our niche in Ireland is producing high-starch, low-protein grains and, therefore, higher alcohol yields than one would get from most grains.  That is one reason we are particularly interested in that sector.  If we could get a price of &euro;1,200 per tonne, we would be delighted.</p> <p>  In relation to GM-free dairy products, we want to be competitive and need to consider whether we can produce enough feed and be competitive on price.  A group within Teagasc is examining this issue.  We could not produce enough protein to replace all of what we import.  The analysis is ongoing.  At current prices, one could formulate a ration of oilseed rape meal and beans, for example, for a slightly higher price than an all-GM ration, but if demand for dairy and meat products from non-GM-fed animals was to increase, the cost of these commodities would also increase.  Currently it is a relatively small increase, but the analysis is ongoing and the price could change if there was more demand for animal produce from animals fed on non-GM crops.</p></speech>

It is tricky enough because there are several rules, including greening rules and so on, that have forced some such farmers to grow crops that might not be as good as they would like or would ordinarily pick.  Certain crops stand better.  When a farmer has a poor year, he or she has a much longer period to harvest the crop.  There are good and bad farmers in all sectors and Teagasc could bring the Senator to meet many farmers in the west who have managed to get their crops in on time because of the crop mix they use.  There may be a mix of winter and spring crops that suit the relevant land.  What crop suits a particular piece of land has to be considered on a farm to farm basis.  Some such farmers have the necessary machinery, expertise and knowledge, but weather was the big thing that was against them.  However, in a normal year they tend to get on reasonably well.  There is much we can do, but we cannot do a lot about the weather.</p> <p>  Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice asked about land that was fit to grow willow.  No matter what land is in question, good land will produce a good crop, whether it be grass, willow or grain.  The better the land, the better the crop that will be produced from it.  That is universal for all crops.  Willow is capable of being grown on wetter land, but the wetter the land, the poorer the yields one will get.  Willow is very much on the conventional side of the house in terms of GM crops.  Programmes in Scandinavia, in particular, have shown that willow is outclassed in yield over a period of time; after about 15 years it will be outclassed and will have to be replanted.</p></speech>

The preliminary indications are that they are not significant at current prices, but it would be a big assumption to rely on this because prices will change, as Mr Spink said.  If consumers demand such a product and competitor products are labelled as such, we may not have a choice, which is why it is a matter of urgency for Teagasc to identify what alternatives are available to dry stock and, in particular, dairy farmers.</p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly asked an interesting question about our position on GM crops and the growing of energy crops.  We have no position other than a desire to comply with the law and current departmental policy.  Irrespective of use, the growing of GM crops is not permitted in Ireland.  There are risks of contamination with non-GM strains and so on and they would cross over to crops that could be fed to both animals and humans.</p> <p>  Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice asked whether the RHI should be limited to Irish-grown crops.  That is a matter for policymakers to determine.</p><p>In my view, given our limited resources, for any such scheme we should look to promote our own sector.  There was an interesting question about the production of biogas from silage.  We are about to commission an anaerobic digester for research purposes at our Grange site.  It is a system that operates on both slurry and grass silage.  The best alternative for grass is to use it in the production of livestock products but for an individual farmer with less livestock than is optimal, it may be an opportunity.  We will research how exactly it might function over the next number of years.</p></speech>

We have not formally quantified it but it would be very easy to do as we have all the data.  Deputy Fitzmaurice suggested we could not produce biomass efficiently but we can produce some of the highest biomass yields in the world in our drought-free climate, with our long summers and neither very high nor very low temperatures.  We can produce large quantities of any crop, be it grass or crops, and this is why we have the highest wheat yields in the world.</p></speech>

I am not talking about grass but willow and miscanthus, which we have done and on which there are reports.  I am talking about using average and good land.  Everyone wants the good land because they can grow barley, wheat or biomass and milk a lot of cows or fatten a lot of calves.  On average, throughout the country, we are not as capable as other countries.</p></speech>

We now have the evidence that we have extraordinary potential.  Grass has to be produced for some economic outlet and there is no point in producing grass without the animals to utilise it because, in such a case, it will not be efficient and will create problems.  There is a limited possibility in anaerobic digestion and we are going to research it.  This is also relevant to tillage people because of the utilisation of the digestate, the end product that emerges from the process.</p></speech>

Does he have a breakdown of the average cost of the leased land?  What is his opinion on the viability of leasing land for tillage?</p> <p>  Professor Boyle also mentioned alternative crops.  In my part of the country there has been talk of the abolition of beef quotas in Europe.  How viable does he think sugar beet could be if it was started again?  Since the abolition of the sugar industry there has been, ironically, a continuous decline in the tillage sector and it is clear that the two go hand in hand.  The eucalyptus crop is mentioned in some of the papers with which we have been presented.  Has there been much research in that area?</p><p>Finally, one of the big things in the last round of CAP was greening.  Has that had a negative effect on the tillage sector?

As the Chairman said, some 50% of land is leased in one form or another.  There has been a big change in the past five years, on the back of the change in the taxation status of rented land.  A tax-free allowance is available for a long-term lease, that is, anything over five years and up to 20 years.  For a husband and wife, the maximum is &euro;80,000 so it is very significant.  It has brought good and bad things for the tillage farmer.  Much more conacre land, with one-year rentals, has been converted into long-term leases.  This is probably no more than 20% of the total but it has increased quite a lot.  It has brought disadvantages too, including the fact that the dairy sector has the option of longer-term leases and they now offer 15-year leases, which are attractive to farmers converting from tillage or on grassland.  However, they are competing with the tillage farmer for access to land and the latter cannot increase his profits or output unless he gets more land so the price has crept up steadily.  In real terms, it has probably gone up by between &euro;30 and &euro;50 over the past four or five years.  It is also because of competition from young farmers who are looking for a way into farming along with entitlements, both of which go hand in hand and require a longer-term lease.</p> <p>  I was asked about viability.  Teagasc is worn out telling farmers not to do certain things for the past 35 years but the farmers have continued to do them nonetheless.  Some have made a good success of it but others have certainly not.  The pool of land is now getting smaller, however, and the level of tillage land is getting smaller, which is putting more pressure on the system.  Mr. Spink will answer the question on beet.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-03a.39" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Hennessey" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017100300002#V00500"><p>What sort of living would he like?  It depends on whether the land is owned or leased.  Some would argue that a dairy farmer can run a farm with 80 cows, others would suggest it needs 120 but it depends on where it is.  For a tillage farmer on his own, one could argue it would be 600 or 700 acres but it depends on how much he owns and how much he does not own.  A farmer who wants to make a very good living and to have a big single farm payment would probably need closer to 1,000 acres than 500.</p> <p>  Another question was on the negative effects of greening.  When it came out, there were a lot of rules and regulations stating what farmers had to and could not do.  Compliance on the part of farmers on the ground has been extremely high, however, and there have been fewer than 100 breaches of the greening rules.  It has, however, made a bit of a difference to a number of different farmers.  They used to block land for winter wheat for one year and for another crop in following years, but they now have to subdivide it into different sections for the number of crops in a particular year.</p><p>That is adding costs.  How many farmers is this happening to?  The smaller farmers - those with fewer than 30 acres - are losing out while the bigger guys have more than three crops anyway.  The big guys have more than enough environmentally-friendly areas, EFAs.  They need 5%.  The average is approximately 7.5% and most have more than 12% so it is not a big issue for them.  I do not think it is has had a big negative impact generally but it has had an impact on individual farmers.</p></speech>

If we could re-establish a viable beet industry we, as an organisation, would very much welcome it as it is a very good break crop and has benefits for cereals and rotation.  We have done some work over the past couple of years with Beet Ireland and looked at the yield potential of new sugar beet varieties since the industry stopped ten or more years ago and there has been a big increase in the yield potential of beet in that time, with improved varieties, etc.  That is certainly a positive but the world price of sugar is currently relatively low, at some &euro;350 per tonne.  A lot of the predictions of four years ago envisaged between &euro;500 and &euro;600.  We would welcome the return of the beet industry if there were defined markets for Irish beet as this would reduce volatility but re-establishing an industry while exposed to the fluctuations of world prices would make any of us a bit nervous.</p> <p>  I was also asked about eucalyptus.  I do not know of any work done recently on eucalyptus but some was done a good few years ago and there was a biomass programme at Oak Park for many years.  Professor Boyle reminded me that research from a number of years ago found that it was susceptible to low temperatures and some of it was lost during very cold winters.  This is less the case with willow or miscanthus and these are the biomass crops that have been looked at in recent years.</p></speech>

Are we running a risk of food shortages?

On behalf of the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, I thank the Chairman and committee members for giving us the opportunity to come and speak today.</p> <p>  The complete land area under organic production in Ireland is 73,000 ha, which equates to just under 2% of agricultural land.  Of that 2%, 94% is in permanent grassland and 2.2% is in cereal production.  This is a very low ratio compared to organic livestock production and other processing requirements.  We have a high dependency on imported cereals in order to meet specific market demands.</p> <p>  There are obvious opportunities for Irish tillage farmers to consider converting to organic production and we will highlight some of those to the committee this evening.  Last year, the land area under organic tillage was just over 2,200 ha.  Even though this is an increase of 650 ha on the previous year, it is not sufficiently large to keep up with demand.  No tranche of the organic farming scheme has been opened since 2015 as, apparently, there is no funding available in the RDP but Ireland has an existing policy target of 5% organic production, although we only allocate sufficient funds to support 2% of production.</p><p>Even with the limited funding - we fully understand we need to work within budgets - the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, IOFGA, firmly believes that a targeted scheme, which incidentally is 75% co-funded by the EU, needs to be reopened, especially if we are to supply the current deficit with home-grown product.  Otherwise we rely on importing cereals that can be grown here, which is simply not economically sensible or sustainable.</p><p> Oats represent the largest organic cereal crop in Ireland, not barley, as is the case in the conventional sector.  Oats account for 60% of organic cereal production, barley 13%, wheat 9% and protein crops 6%.  Oats are a valuable cash crop, with over 50% going directly into porridge oatlets for a growing domestic and international market.  The leading industry manufacturer has already stated it has at the very least a 2,000-tonne deficit every year to meet the current supply and requires much more product.  There are also valuable industries using grain such as milling, brewing and distilling, all of which have a massive and growing demand for organic cereals.  There is also a demand for organic protein crops.  The protein aid scheme has boosted the production of protein crops.  However, organic systems find it very difficult to grow a single protein crop.  They tend to opt for a combi-crop whereby there is a mix of 40% to 50% protein.  Nevertheless, it is once again an important source of protein to reduce dependence on imports.</p><p> IOFGA prepared a submission for the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, which was very well received, requesting that organic farmers growing protein via combi-crops be paid a proportional support from the protein aid scheme as many fall outside the protein aid criteria.  We look forward to seeing this introduced before the next growing season.  Organic tillage production does not have the same high cost base associated with conventional tillage, naturally enough, as chemical inputs are not allowed.  That said, the yields are lower in organic production, with an average yield of around 2.5 tonnes per acre - that is 5 tonnes per hectare - but with most organic crops returning a gross margin of between &euro;700 and &euro;1,000 per hectare, that is a profitable enterprise.  In 2015 the organic farming scheme saw just over 500 new entrants to the sector, over 90% of whom were livestock farmers, increasing the feed demand significantly.  We estimate that approximately 6,000 tonnes of organic grain are being produced in Ireland at present but we need an extra 10,000 ha of land to convert to organic farming even to begin to supply the current Irish demand, and that is not including future needs for farmers or processors.  Therefore, the lack of supply is certainly a barrier to the expansion of the sector and one which has been identified in the national organic action plan.</p><p> Regarding future organic regulations, albeit not yet finalised, there will be more onus for feedstock to be sourced regionally, giving some market opportunities for home-grown organic grains.  This, combined with compliance with high-level policy targets such as pesticide regulations and the Water Framework Directive - we will not even get into the impact of Brexit on trade - makes organic an attractive option for many tillage farmers.  While there are economically sound opportunities to increase organic cereal production to meet the deficit in supply, a new targeted scheme is needed to respond to the rapidly increasing market and there is certainly a very clear indication that this issue will not go away.</p></speech>

The Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland, ABFI, is an umbrella organisation encompassing our category associations such as the Irish Whiskey Association, the Irish Spirits Association, of which William Lavelle, who is here with me today, is the head, the Irish Brewers Association, the Irish Cider Association and the Irish Wine Association.</p> <p>  Obviously, the reason we in the drinks sector have been invited here today is that we are viewed as a growing sector.  In terms of our economic exports, the growth has been phenomenal.  Bord Bia states that last year we increased exports by 4% to &euro;1.4 billion.  According to the CSO data already available for this year, we have seen an increase of 18.5% in exports of Irish whiskey, which is now the fastest-growing spirits category in the world.  We are therefore very much of the perspective that this is a very big cake.</p><p>Irish whiskey comprises only 5% of the overall whiskey market and there is plenty of opportunity for growth into the future, given the right conditions.  We are committed to working with the Minister and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on Food Wise 2025.  In this regard we have agreed to try to increase exports by 85% but we think we will actually almost double that within the timeframe if, again, conditions are right.</p><p> Regarding the economic benefits, an unusual aspect of our sector is that we are dotted right around the island of Ireland.  As far as new production is concerned, four years ago we had four distilleries but now we have 18 in operation and 16 more in planning, and they are right around the island of Ireland.  ABFI as an organisation is all-island because our geographical indicators which protect Irish whiskey, Irish cream and Irish poteen are all-island, so we operate on that basis.</p><p> As for our strategy regarding delivery on our vision for Irish whiskey, we estimate that we will bring 1,500 new jobs into the sector.  This story also benefits Irish farmers when it comes to both the breweries and the distilleries.  There is a huge demand for Irish agricultural suppliers to source malted barley and unmalted grains, as well as fresh Irish cream, used in Irish cream liqueurs, and apples, which are used in cider.  We purchase 60% of our raw materials in Ireland and create a major multiplier effect as a result, much more than, for example, the multinational sector.  It is estimated that for every job created in the drinks manufacturing sector, four additional jobs are created.</p><p> Specifically regarding tillage, the drinks industry purchases about 10% of Ireland's annual harvest and the vast majority of Irish brewers and distillers are committed to purchasing their barley and malt locally.  At present, we purchase more than 200,000 tonnes of barley every year.  The current growth is leading to an increase in demand for both unmalted grain and malted barley, and more of this demand will be met from domestic sources.  I will give the committee just three examples from three of our largest drink producers.  Diageo uses more than 130,000 tonnes of barley each year at St. James's Gate, and 300 tonnes every day just to brew Guinness.  Diageo buys approximately 13% of Ireland's total annual domestic production of barley.  Heineken Ireland sources all of its malted barley from 750 Irish farmers.  Irish Distillers seeks to purchase all its malted and unmalted barley from Ireland, much of which comes from a very local radius of about 100 miles of the Midleton distillery.  It is, however, necessary at times for Irish whiskey producers to source maize from further afield as Ireland does not have the climate to produce maize in the quantities needed for our production process.  The three producers I have listed are just some of many now.  We have a burgeoning membership and a burgeoning industry.  For example, Walsh Whiskey and O'Hara Brewery in Carlow, the Shed Distillery in Drumshanbo, Teelings Whiskey in Dublin's Liberties, Tullamore D.E.W. and many more have signed up to Bord Bia's Origin Green scheme.  Under this scheme, the producers have specifically made commitments to source more grain and raw material locally.  For example, the Shed Distillery has committed to sourcing 100% of its grain from Origin Green suppliers.  We think it is a fantastic initiative.</p><p> Irish drinks producers are trying to innovate and produce new products, which means they must work closely with growers and merchants to improve quality, efficiency and sustainability.  What is key is reliable, secure production.  In the context of trying to innovate, we are looking at different things.  For example, Irish Distillers has recently launched a project experimenting with rye blends grown locally.  I think we will see more such examples follow through.  As more and more people bring new product, there is more opportunity to look at recipe, whereas with traditional recipes it is harder to diversify the grain mix.</p><p> Last week, ABFI had a general meeting with the Minister, Deputy Creed, at which we briefly discussed this issue.  We have already requested a further meeting with the Department to examine what additional opportunities there are for the Irish drinks industry to collaborate.  We are very interested in innovation and research proposals regarding Irish grain usage in brewing and distilling.  We are very positive about it.  I think the members are willing to look at funding of research and innovation and we look forward to exploring that further with the Department, Teagasc and anyone else who may be interested.</p><p> We are conscious of the difficulties the committee has heard from other witnesses before us that face Irish grain farmers and we are supportive of calls from farm organisations for a Government plan to revitalise the tillage sector.  At the same time as I have given the committee our good news story, we are aware there are threats on the horizon.  Brexit is an obvious one but we have two specific threats to the drinks sector in Ireland which I would like to touch on briefly.</p><p>The basic message is that if our industry is growing, so will that of tillage farmers because we will need more supply.  However, anything that could damage our overall growth and projections will be problematic.  Growth should not be taken for granted in any industry and certainly not in ours.</p><p> We have an issue with the Government's Public Health (Alcohol) Bill that will shortly be before the Legislature in terms of it providing for a blanket ban on the marketing and advertisement of drinks products.  That would be particularly damaging for start-ups as they would never be able to build brands in the Irish market, although it would be essential to do so before they could go on to export their products.  The Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland, ABFI, would like to see workable legislation.  As was mentioned in reference to barley farmers, our current advertisements might show an orchard or a farmer in a field.  That would be banned by the Bill and we would not be able to show a person or a location other than the production process.  Breaking that link to our heritage and rural supply chain would be damaging for us.  I flag that to members and ask for their assistance in getting legislation that businesses can work with and that will deliver the public health objectives.</p><p> The budget will be announced next week and many others are probably more involved in it than we are, but Ireland has the second highest excise duty in the EU on alcohol and that is very damaging to our industry, especially so in the context of Brexit and the North-South divide.  The devaluation of sterling has already put strain on our exports.</p><p> Those are the impending threats to the drinks industry.  The broad vision for the sector is very positive, but if companies' ability to compete is hampered and there is not a supportive home market, there will be less investment in spite of the contribution of the many start-up businesses because a significant portion of them have foreign investment backing.</p></speech>

This is the committee's second week hearing submissions on the future of the tillage sector, and the importance of grain has been a prominent feature.  The two presentations today have highlighted the massive success story of the end user and the plight of the producer.  I ask the ABFI where between the two extremes is the cookie crumbling?  It wants an Irish grain product, and to be using Irish-sourced grain must be an advantage for it, but the committee has heard over the past two weeks about people leaving the tillage sector.  Is the alcohol industry not paying a fair price?  The committee was told last week that 5 cent of the average price of a pint of Guinness in a pub goes to the farmer and that a 0.1% increase in the price of a pint could be worth &euro;40 per tonne to farmers.  There must be a problem if the drinks industry is as successful as it portrays and yet conventional grain growers last week and organic farmers today have highlighted the plight of their industry.  I may be stating the obvious but I would like to hear the opinion of the ABFI on that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-03a.54" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017100300002#AA00300"><p>I welcome the witnesses to the committee.  I am interested in the 5 tonne per hectare yield in the organic sector and the gross margin for organic crops, which seem to be quite high.  There is a problem getting enough people to join the sector, but what is the solution to that and what needs to be done?  There was mention of the reopening of the scheme for tillage farmers and so on, and that could be done, but there must also be a demand-led element.  Ms Westbrook said there is very high demand, particularly in the oats sector, and yet not enough people are prepared to produce it.  Is that because organic farming involves more difficult husbandry such that farmers are afraid of it and do not want to go down that road or is the price, which seems high, not high enough to compensate for those difficulties?</p><p>In regard to the drinks sector, I know the Shed Distillery very well as it is beside where I live in Leitrim.  It is a great success story and is doing great work there.</p><p> Members would expect the drinks industry to aim to source all its grain in Ireland.  If a drinks company that wanted to label its product as Irish had to use Irish ingredients, would that cause a problem due to insufficient raw material being produced here?  Most people would think it logical that if one were to say a product is Irish water, that water would have to come from Ireland, or if one were to call a product Irish whiskey, at least a fair proportion of its raw materials would have to be sourced in Ireland.  However, the question is whether sufficient materials can be produced here.  If that is not the case, it comes back to the point made by Senator Daly as to whether farmers are not being offered a good enough price to produce them.  I do not drink very much but what little I do is very dear.  That is the same for everyone.  The vast majority of people would not begrudge the farmer an extra 0.1% on the price of a pint.  If one goes into a bar after 12 midnight the price goes up and then a little later the price goes up again because publicans have to pay staff extra.  There needs to be joined-up thinking to come up with a solution. There has to be one if there is a sector as successful and with such potential as the Irish drinks industry and also a farming sector that has the potential to provide for that but cannot do so because it is not being adequately compensated.  I want to get the witnesses' views on where a solution may lie.  Does somebody need to put their hand deeper into their pocket?</p></speech>

My questions will focus on similar issues to those addressed by Senator Daly and Deputy Kenny.  In view of some of the presentations given to the committee last week that portrayed a sector in dire financial straits with acreage dropping by 14% over the past couple of years, it is hard to comprehend why the lifeline for a certain number of producers who could produce grain organically and get a viable commercial price for it is not being taken.  Very good commercial prices were quoted by Flahavan's for oats and yet there is a deficit in the production of oats.  What roadblock is stopping farmers?  They are usually very good at making good economic decisions.  What is stopping farmers changing to organic farming from conventional tillage farming which everyone agrees is not paying?  The witness said there is a severe shortfall or deficit in every sector, so what is the roadblock or what needs to be done in order that a sector of tillage farmers would be able to make a viable income?</p> <p>  It was said that 60% of raw materials used by the drinks industry is purchased in Ireland.  That seems a very low figure for an industry that portrays itself as wholly Irish.  Kerrygold butter is 100% produced in this country and marketed as such.  However, it is disingenuous if whiskeys and craft beers are being marketed as Irish but only 60% of their ingredients come from Ireland.  That figure seems extremely low for a product to be labelled as completely Irish.</p> <p>  A point was made by Senator Daly and Deputy Kenny regarding the end product and how one will pay over &euro;5 for a pint of Guinness but the person producing the grain will only get 4 cent or 5 cent of that.  If there were a graph before the committee showing the relative division of the final consumer price of a pint, as one often sees, one would hardly be able to see the section showing the portion for the tillage farmer because it would be so small.  The ABFI gave figures showing the drinks industry has expanded rapidly in recent years and said that distilleries and breweries have been springing up all over the country, and that is welcome.  However, if it is serious about developing the industry in the future, the person producing the raw material has to see a future in it for him or her.</p><p>If we are to create a niche market for Irish whiskey and niche Irish craft beers, we need to source the raw material as far as practically possible in Ireland.  </p><p> We must take action to rectify what is happening at present, as evidenced from the graph.  The man producing the raw material is not being paid a viable return for his produce.  I would like the industry to focus on the percentage of the raw material that is produced in Ireland and whether the current level of 60% will be increased to a figure in the high nineties, let us say above 95%.</p></speech>

Do the representatives think that many small farmers - those with ten to 16 ha - left organic farming because it was more attractive to participate in the GLAS scheme?  This has happened all over the country and I see in my area the farmers have walked away from organic farming.  There was also the differential between the prices being charged by the licensing authorities compared to the cost of drawing up a GLAS plan.  When the farmers did the sums they would find that they would be better off by &euro;2,000 to &euro;2,500 per year by being in GLAS as opposed to farming organically.  Is that the major problem face by IOFGA?</p> <p> The Department was asked to reduce the acreage needed to farm organically to try to retain the smaller operators, but it did not accede to the request because the Department said it wanted to meet the targets.  It is clear from the figures supplied that we are not meeting the targets we set ourselves.</p> <p>  When one looks at the different sectors of agriculture it appears that farmers prefer to have livestock.  Why is that?  Most of the farmers I know bring their cattle to the commercial marts rather than to special sales because they get the same price.  Why is the organic producer not getting a premium price?  Are we not marketing our product sufficiently?</p> <p>  When farmers supply to the drinks industry, they are price takers.  If one keeps telling a producer that they are a price taker, they will get fed up of taking the price because they will go out of business.  The industry needs the raw material.  I concur with every other member that if one is selling Irish whiskey, all the raw materials should be Irish and should not be mixed with crops from other countries.  Why does the drinks industry not do a five or ten year plan to guarantee security of product?  We have the figures that the raw materials cost in the region of 5 cent in the pint.  It does not matter whether it would be 6 cent or 7 cent, but that additional 2 cent would give a premium price to the farmer and buy in to doing a deal with the industry down the road.  Why does the industry not do that rather than every year bantering over a few pounds with people walking away from supplying the raw material?  The industry could ensure the security of supply of the raw materials.</p> <p>  It is great to see that in County Roscommon an announcement was made that planning permission  is being sought for a new whiskey distillery.  This is happening around the country.  However, we must remember that if we keeping pulling a dog's tail, he will bite.   What is happening is that if the industry wrangles every year and farmers have to take a low price, the industry will lose them. </p> <p>  The industry is portraying the product as Irish, grown in a clean environment and everything is done in Ireland, but in fact the company is bringing in most of the organic produce from Poland and other countries that are the bread basin of the world.  Why will the industry not do a deal with Irish producers instead of engaging in a ding-dong every year?  That is not helping the industry.  If the different pieces of the jigsaw are not in place, that will not help the industry.</p></speech>

We will start with the representatives from the organic group.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-03a.60" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Gillian Westbrook" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017100300002#DD00200"><p>I will answer some of the questions and I will then pass questions to my colleagues who have more experience in the practical every day implications of organic cereal production.</p> <p>  In response to Senator Paul Daly's question on the tillage challenge, we have a shortage of supply.  The cost of malting barley is around &euro;180 a tonne.  There is a demand for the raw material, but it is about getting enough people to come in for conversion.  That ties up with Deputy Cahill's question about why more people are not coming in to supply the raw material.  For a start, there is a 60 ha cap, and if one wants more tillage farmers to enter the market, one must raise the cap higher than 60 ha.  For example, the limit in Wales is 300 ha.  That is not for tillage - it is more sheep production - but the size is significantly bigger.  Very few EC countries put a cap on the amount of land that will gain support under the scheme.  Granted under the organic farming scheme one will get a less support for bringing more land into the scheme, but it would be a big boost for the tillage farmer to remove that cap.</p> <p>  In response to questions from Senator Daly and Deputy Cahill, there is also a two year conversion, which puts quite a few farmers off as well, which is a regulatory requirement and must happen.  Taking account of the two year conversion period, one would only produce for three years of the five year period.  One would have to measure the return over a ten year period.</p> <p>  Organic farming is very much demand led.  Half of the land area would be in rotation to build up fertility in the soil, so the product will not necessarily be giving back a yield year in year out.  Therefore, pretty much half of the land will be in rotation.  The really successful organic tillage farmers, all of whom give me examples of land that is stockless, generally speaking have farms that are mixed enterprises, with beef and tillage in order to build up the fertility allowing them to use the land that is not in cereal production for those periods.</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill raised the issue of the road block.  We do not have a coherent strategy for organic production and I would say that is the cause of the block.  We tend to get merged in with Origin Green and different organisations such as that, which is fine up to a point, but we need a coherent marketing and promotion plan specifically for organic production.</p> <p>  To put it bluntly, sometimes there is a them and us division which can come from the organic side and which is not helpful.  The product must be seen as an Irish produce for which there is a significant export market.  There is a &euro;30 billion export market sitting in Europe, which we are not taking seriously.  Whether it is a result of remnants from the past, we should not be competing for the same space, we should be looking for different markets  That can be gained from having a coherent strategy on the approach to marketing organic produce.</p> <p>  We do not target the scheme.  I appreciate there may be criteria restrictions with which I am not as familiar as the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and I will leave that question for it.  Ideally, organic production should be market led, because if one opens the doors and lets everybody into the scheme, it basically pushes down prices elsewhere.  Some processors might think that is a good idea but I think that is part of Deputy Fitzmaurice's point on the reason that farming are bringing their produce to the commercial mart, because they are not getting in to supply their beef.  There is a limited number of processors, but in order for organic produce to be really successful - I am referring to countries that can demonstrate this - it is a multi-layered product.  If one has all of one product, one does not tend to be as successful as somebody with many different commodities, such as livestock, dairy, cheese production, added value, beers.  In such instances the whole sector lifts as opposed to having 90% in one sector.  That also echoes a point made by Deputy Fitzmaurice.</p><p>The double-funding issue with GLAS is something we have asked about tirelessly.  We agree completely on that.  Clarification may be needed as to what actually constitutes and defines double funding as we were under the impression, and measure 11 of the rural development programme makes it perfectly clear, that the organic farmer is being paid to produce food for the organic food supply whereas GLAS is an environmental scheme.  It is in response to the public demand for organic produce that the organic farming scheme was given a separate measure and supported as such.  We agree with Deputy Fitzmaurice that it is not double funding and we agree that there has been quite a barrier as such for certain people.  Having much of one product in there raises the question of what is actually being supported if this is not market led.  Is it that one is just going to give it to people where there is no market?  The counter argument to that is that one is paying people to be environmentally-friendly in their farming systems.  However, the scheme is market led because it has to go through a value reporting process.  As it is queried and audited as to its significant value and the returns to the Exchequer, it is market led.  Perhaps we need to be clearer about the market.  If we cannot be clearer about targeting it, we certainly need to support it with a full marketing scheme.</p><p> The front-loading aspect is again a question for the Department.  As far as I am aware, and we have looked into it, it is not actually allowed.  I do not think it is possible to front-load a per hectare payment, however I am not clear on it.  We looked at it only briefly.  Certainly, it is a question for the Department.</p><p> There are more processes coming online.  Many of them represent a kind of chicken-and-egg situation.  Farmers do not want to come on board with more product because they do not have the continuity of supply.  They are concerned about coming on board with more product lines if that continuity is not there.  Again, that is something the focus group on organic production, which is due to be opened quite soon, needs to sit down and think about.  It is a huge market in the EU and there is a great deal of opportunity which we cannot help but feel we are missing out on to a great extent.  It is a shame.  My colleagues will address some of the other issues.</p></speech>

As Ms Westbrook outlined, one issue is the support system.  With no tranche of the organic farming scheme, OFS, open, farmers simply cannot make the commitment because it is a huge change.  The Deputy addressed the issue of husbandry, which Ms Lynch or Mr. Mooney will elaborate on.  It is certainly a different system of production and it involves much change, including a change of mindset, for farmers to convert to organic tillage.  It is not the same model as the conventional sector because one cannot put all of one's land in.  One has to build fertility on some parts of the land while producing crops on the balance.  It is quite difficult.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-03a.63" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Lynch" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017100300002#EE00300"><p>I will elaborate on the barriers for tillage farmers coming into organic tillage.  As an adviser, the biggest issue I note is that conventional tillage has become very high-input, which means that for a farmer to change to a system with very low inputs is a major step, even simply of mindset.  On foot of the way the tillage sector has developed in Ireland, we are talking about many farms which are 100% tillage.  For them to convert to organic requires putting a fertility building phase into their systems.  As part of the previous OFS, there was a double payment during that period, which definitely helped many farmers to get through two-year conversion time when they could produce cereals on only 50% of their land.  The &euro;220 per hectacre payment was not enough to compensate them for doing that.</p> <p>  There are many technical issues also.  If they have been 100% tillage, they do not have any fencing or water.  This is a challenge if they switch to having livestock grazing, even if it is another farmer's livestock where they can co-operate with other organic producers.  The fertility building phase usually involves a grass-clover mix.  If one had a mixed farm, one would let one's cattle out to graze it.  We need farmers to co-operate with other organic farmers who could use that part of the rotation to provide an economic return.  Currently, there is no economic return from perhaps half of one's farm.  If the &euro;220 per hectacre conversion payment is not enough to compensate one, one is not going to convert.</p><p>There is a whole psychological aspect to moving from a high chemical input system to the belief that a system with no chemical inputs will work.  For many farmers, that is very difficult.  The best way to get over that is to bring farmers to organic farms and show them that the crops grow, they are good and that yields are achieved.  That really helps but we have probably not had enough of it.</p><p> In many cases, the reality is that by having a small scheme which closed quickly, the Department did not show confidence in the system.  If the Department is not willing to fund the farmers coming in, that is very hard.  It appears to be saying the long-term future of the sector does not look good.  Having a system where the target is so low that it is all used up in year one does not provide any confidence to the sector that there will be funding for tillage into the future.  That said, I have received many more calls in the last 12 months from conventional tillage farmers who are looking at going organic.  Some of them have actually made the jump already even without having an organic farming scheme in the hope that it will come.  They can see that what they are doing has no long-term future as they are losing money.  If they can at least make sure they do not lose money, they will be better off.  If they can go back to a system with very low inputs and if any yield is at all profitable, it is better in some cases than what they have been doing.  We need to get much information out there, however, to convince conventional tillage farmers that organic is a viable option.  They need to see more successful organic tillage farmers to give them the confidence to make the change also.</p></speech>

The conventional tillage sector in Ireland has become very specialised, the acreage has got very big and farmers are leasing land.  Without a shadow of a doubt, all that is compounding the difficulties of getting into organic production.  There is also the fact, to which Ms Lynch alluded, of the loss of infrastructure on those farms, including sheds to house cattle, roadways, water systems and fencing.  Even stockmanship skills are disappearing fast on the conventional tillage side.  The farmer is a machinery man, basically.  That is his pride and joy.  He is good at it and at maintaining machines.  That is the biggest stumbling block.  There is also the fact that it requires a great leap of faith to change from conventional to organic production.  A farmer will say, "I am going out five, six or eight times with my sprayer or my fertiliser spreader and I will have nothing if I do not".  It is not that he is not interested, but it is a huge jump for him to get his mindset back to more traditional rotational systems.  It is the biggest stumbling block.</p></speech>

I am an organic tillage farmer and I went into it because of pounds, shillings and pence.  I am not saying I had great foresight, but I saw the direction in which the conventional tillage system was going.  To me, it was doom and gloom and I am delighted I made the change.  I think I am more environmentally friendly and I am definitely producing a product people want.  I am happier at it-----</p></speech>

On the price question and, as I said earlier, we are very proud supporters and purchasers of Irish grain.  However, we are only 10% of the national grain output.  Even within our sector, there is only a limited amount.  As such, the 90% focus and problem is still going to be there.  For example, we are sourcing almost 100% of malted barley in Ireland which is because there has been innovation in the sector.  We have seen over a period of time that we have successfully displaced imported product.  By looking at innovation, we can certainly go down that route.</p><p>Irish Distillers is experimenting with rye blends on more than 140 acres in Enniscorthy.  It planted the rye in the autumn of 2016 with the intention of harvesting it in the late summer of 2017 for use in the distilling process.  More opportunities will arise from that pilot if it is successful.</p><p> The Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland is a trade organisation.  Under competition law, if I got involved in price fixing, I would find myself in jail.  There is absolutely no role for us in price negotiations.  Indeed, the brewers and distillers do not buy directly.  They buy through the malting companies.  This is a matter for them to deal with.  Unfortunately, we cannot get involved in that.</p><p> I would like to go back to the issue of Irish whiskey as a protected product.  Under a technical file on geographical indications that the Government has agreed with the EU, the drink must be distilled and matured in a very precise and technical way on the island of Ireland.  That is great because it means that this industry, unlike other industries, will never be moved offshore.  It has to happen here.  As an organisation, we have a role in protecting that internationally.  We pursue fraudulent products in other markets as an important part of our remit.  Under the geographical indications file I have mentioned, it is not necessary to source raw materials from Ireland.  There are two reasons for that.  First, many of the raw materials are not available here and will never be available here.  Second and more important, such a requirement would be in breach of the EU treaties.  It would be viewed as protectionist under Articles 107, 108 and 110 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union because it would hamper the freedom of movement of goods and would protect domestic producers, both of which are outlawed.  That is why such a requirement cannot be in place.</p><p> We are absolutely committed to increasing our use of Irish producers.  The industry has been keen to have this conversation in previous dialogues, including the Department's tillage forum, as part of the effort to extend the innovation agenda to a broader range of products.  Approximately 60% of raw material inputs in this sector come from the island of Ireland.  This is very high in comparison with other sectors, including some that are more lauded.  I will come back to the committee with more detail in this regard.  I emphasise that many other raw materials in addition to grain are used in the process of making whiskey and beer.</p><p> I would like to mention Bord Bia's Origin Green initiative in the context of the five-year to ten-year plan.  We are increasingly calling on our members to be part of all the great work that Bord Bia is doing with marketplace initiatives and buyers.  One of the criteria now being implemented is that producers have to be in Origin Green, a key part of which involves doing between 90% and 100% of sourcing at local level.  I think that plan is actually in place.  We are certainly working towards that.</p></speech>

We are suggesting that if the industry offered a premium price, farmers could buy into that or sign into it.  A similar approach is taken at the moment in respect of the price of milk.  A certain amount of it is offered.  Why is this industry not being similarly innovative?</p> <p>  Ms Westbrook said we need larger farms to get involved in organic farming.  I have gone through the figures for every county on my iPad.  The average single farm payment is made in respect of a farm of 32 ha.  The county with the largest average farm size, according to the figures for the single farm payment scheme, has an average farm size of 47 ha.  I do not know how Ms Westbrook expects bigger farms to solve this problem.  The smaller farms have walked away from organic farming for the reasons on which we agreed earlier.  This is a problem.  One thing I mentioned earlier has not been addressed.  Farmers have spoken to me about the pricing of the licensing bodies in the organic sector.  It seems to be a big problem.</p></speech>

As he was talking about plans, I assumed he meant those who draw up the plans.  We do not perform that role.  We are involved in certification.  We are aware that complaints have previously been made about certification costs.  The Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association is a not a profit-making company.  We have submitted our costs to the Department, which has gone through them all rigorously.  We are quite content.

I agree with the Deputy that some people are getting &euro;2,000.  In such cases, the double funding of GLAS is a big issue.  I appreciate that some people have argued that GLAS is a very good scheme because they can get priority access into it.  However, certain aspects of it, such as the premium payments, mean that the organic farmer will be better off in GLAS.  The organic farming sector comprises hundreds of thousands of small farmers.  It is important that organic farmers are not omitted from environmental schemes.  I know many small farmers are very insulted by the fact that even though they are farming in an environmentally friendly way to produce food for an organic food chain, they cannot get involved in an environmental scheme.  I would have to agree with them.  The Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association made a submission under the GLAS programme saying that these were additional measures that would not attract double funding.  We called it GLAS+.  I do not know if that was a mistake.  If so, I apologise.  It is not easy to come up with measures that would not attract double funding.  We agree that this is a major barrier.  We would love to see it removed.</p></speech>

The Shed Distillery in Drumshanbo is part of the Origin Green programme.  Any Origin Green producer that is sourcing its grain in Ireland has an additional asset.  I wonder whether this way of sourcing the raw material is competitive from a pricing perspective.  Does the importation of raw materials, as opposed to the use of Irish materials, come with a price benefit?</p></speech>

There has been a welcome increase in the amount of barley and malted barley that is being sourced locally.</p><p>The percentage of barley and malted barley we in the whiskey industry source in Ireland is in the high 90s.  This compares favourably with Scotland, where the latest figures from the Scotch Whiskey Association show that the percentage of their barley that is sourced domestically is only in the 80s.  It is an issue of supply.  As for other grains, we know there is a demand and a need for maize in the development of grain whiskey, which is one of the forms of whiskey which is in turn an important part of blended whiskeys.  Some of the major whiskey brands in Ireland are blended.  Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the supply of appropriate grain in Ireland.  This is why we are seeing maize being imported but, again, we are no different from Scotland in this regard.  In fact, the percentage of wheat used in scotch whisky production that Scotland imports is very high - about 50% - so we are probably doing better than Scotland in domestic sourcing.  The example my colleague gave of the Irish distillers developing new rye strains in Wexford, which they are innovating and trying to develop as a sustainable new source, should mean that reliance on imported grains other than barley will decrease over time, particularly in line with the commitments that members have made under Origin Green.</p><p> Finally, I know there has been debate earlier and at previous hearings as to whether there should be some sort of regulation or requirement that Irish produce such as Irish whiskey comprise 100% locally sourced raw materials.  This would be a very serious constraint on production.  The Irish whiskey renaissance would die a death because we would not be able to develop the capacity as we would not be able to import the maize.  It would also put us at a severe competitive disadvantage against Scotland, particularly at a time of Brexit.  At a time when Irish whiskey is the fastest-growing spirits category in the world, it would set us back substantially.  We are committed to using as near as possible to 100% Irish barley.  We are increasing the percentage of other grain we are using domestically, and I think over coming years the increased demand, coupled with the commitments for increased sourcing under Origin Green, will mean a significant return for Irish farmers.</p></speech>

We have not had concerns expressed to us yet from any of our members that our projections for growth cannot be met locally as far as barley is concerned.  We see increased demand for barley going forward.

As the Order of the D&aacute;il states the committee must report back to the House no later than 5 October, it is intended to conclude consideration of the motions today.  The meeting must conclude by 3.30 p.m.  In the event that consideration of the motions has not been completed, it is proposed to reconvene at 7.15 p.m.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Finance and his officials for attending and for assisting our consideration of the motions.  Briefing notes were provided by the Department.  I would be grateful if we could adhere to a reasonably strict schedule, the Minister of State will address the committee, following which each of the Opposition spokespersons can respond.  We can then have an open discussion.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-03a.113" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017100300002#B00100"><p>I am pleased to be here to bring before the committee two draft Government orders giving force of law in Ireland to a new double taxation agreement with Kazakhstan and a new tax information exchange agreement with Macao.  The double taxation agreement with Kazakhstan was signed by the ambassador of Ireland to the Russian Federation, Mr. Adrian McDaid, on 26 April 2017.  The tax information exchange agreement with Macao was signed on 12 September 2016 by the ambassador of Ireland to the People's Republic of China, Mr. Paul Kavanagh.</p> <p>  Double taxation agreements are essential in order to allow Ireland to develop greater opportunities for international trade and investment by reducing the number of tax impediments that may inhibit cross-border activity.  Ireland has signed 73 double taxation agreements, of which 72 are in effect.  Ireland is a small country which is highly reliant on trade and investment with other countries, and our large network of tax agreements is very important in facilitating this.  Double taxation agreements facilitate trade and investment in a number of ways.  They provide greater predictability and fairness for taxpayers regarding their tax obligations in foreign jurisdictions and are key to the prevention of double taxation.  This is achieved through the formal allocation of clear taxing rights to one of the countries or, if both countries hold taxing rights, by providing that the authority in the country in which the taxpayer is resident grants a tax credit for the tax paid in the other jurisdiction.  Double taxation agreements reduce the risk of excessive taxation that may arise because of high withholding taxes and ensure that taxpayers are not subject to discriminatory taxation in other jurisdictions.  They also facilitate mutual agreement procedures which allow the tax authorities of both countries to consult with each other in taxation matters affecting the agreement and include provisions that allow for the exchange of information for the purpose of preventing tax evasion.  Double taxation agreements cover direct taxes - in our case, income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax - and apply to the taxation of both companies and individuals.  The double taxation agreement with Kazakhstan is comprehensive in scope and generally follows the OECD model convention.  It provides that certain income arising in one contracting state and paid to a resident of the other contracting state is exempt from tax in the source state.  Where income or gains remain taxable in both countries, the agreement provides that Ireland will grant a credit against its own tax for tax payable in Kazakhstan.  The agreement similarly provides that Kazakhstan will allow a deduction against tax paid by a resident in Kazakhstan of an amount equal to the tax paid in Ireland.</p> <p>  To date Ireland has signed 26 tax information exchange agreements, of which 25 are in effect.  These agreements require parties to exchange information where the information requested is "foreseeably relevant" to a tax investigation in the other state.  The tax information exchange agreements concluded by Ireland are all based on the OECD model tax information exchange agreements.  This model grew out of the work undertaken by the OECD to address harmful tax practices globally and now represents the gold standard.  The agreements cover all taxes imposed by each state at the time of the agreement together with any identical or substantially similar taxes imposed at a later date.  In the case of Ireland, this is income tax, including the universal social charge, corporation tax, capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax and value added tax.  The tax information exchange agreements are limited to exchange upon request; they do not provide for automatic exchange of information between states.  Following ratification, discussions are expected to take place with Macao on how the agreement will be adapted to allow for automatic exchange.  The automatic exchange of information between jurisdictions is now being provided for through the new OECD common reporting standard to which more than 100 other countries, including Ireland, have committed.  The automatic exchange of information between tax authorities is a valuable tool in the fight against tax fraud and evasion and we look forward to its further implementation at an EU and global level.  In August, the OECD-led Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes awarded Ireland the highest international rating of "fully compliant" with international best practices on tax transparency and exchange of information.  The OECD's global forum is a multilateral framework for tax transparency and information-sharing, within which more than 140 jurisdictions participate on an equal footing.</p><p>The outcome of the forum's review is a recognition of Ireland's continued commitment to the highest international standards in tax transparency.</p><p> Earlier this year, Ireland was among the first countries to sign the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting.  This important international agreement is commonly known as the BEPS multilateral instrument, MLI, and will bring Ireland's existing tax treaties into line with the OECD BEPS recommendations and ensure that they cannot be used for aggressive tax planning arrangements.</p><p> It is expected that the majority of Ireland's treaties will be modified by the MLI.  However, Ireland is also implementing the anti-BEPS recommendations on a bilateral basis with a small number of treaty partners.  As to treaty partners that are not signatories to the MLI, Ireland has written to them to discuss options for implementing the BEPS recommendations.</p><p> It is the Minister for Finance's intention to bring an order relating to the BEPS MLI to this committee as part of its ratification process sometime next year.  In addition, there is a strong pipeline of new tax agreements coming down the tracks.  Negotiations for agreements with Azerbaijan, Ghana and Turkmenistan have concluded and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is working towards arranging the signature of these new agreements.  Negotiations with a couple of countries have also concluded and permission to allow for their signature is in the process of being obtained.  The renegotiation of the treaty with the Netherlands has also concluded.  Ireland is negotiating new treaties with a number of countries while renegotiations are under way in respect of existing treaties in other cases, including that with the USA.</p><p> The Minister for Finance and I, as well as officials from the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, will continue to seek to maintain and enhance our tax treaty network.  We continue to engage with stakeholders in identifying other jurisdictions where tax agreements would be beneficial for Irish business.  We are also continuing in our efforts to open negotiations with other jurisdictions that we have, as yet, been unable to secure.  These agreements will play a pivotal role in the strengthening of our economic recovery.</p><p> The committee's consideration of these international agreements is an important step in their ratification process.  Draft Government orders confirming and giving effect in Ireland to the agreements were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 19 September in accordance with the provisions of section 826 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  A resolution by the D&aacute;il approving the draft orders is required before the Government can make them.  The proposal that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approve the draft orders has been referred to this committee for consideration and, after that consideration, the draft orders will be referred back to the D&aacute;il for approval.  After that, the Government may make the orders and the agreements will then be included in a schedule to the taxes Acts by means of a section in the forthcoming Finance Bill.  At that stage, the Irish ratification procedures will be concluded.  Once both countries have completed their procedures, the agreements will take effect in accordance with their entry-into-force provisions.</p><p> I commend these draft orders to the committee and, if required, I will be happy to answer whatever questions members may have.</p></speech>

My first question relates to the process.  I have raised this matter previously with the Minister of State's predecessor and the Minister for Finance.  When agreeing new tax treaties with non-OECD countries, why are we using the OECD template?  This question is probably more relevant for countries that are less developed than Kazakhstan, but I wanted to put on record again my disappointment that we are still not using the UN model for these agreements.  Does the Government propose to adopt the UN model for future agreements, particularly with non-OECD countries?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-03a.117" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017100300002#C00400"><p>Ireland is a developed country and a member of the OECD and has always used this model as a basis for negotiations, adapting it to cater for Ireland's interests.  When the UN model convention was published in 1980, it sought to assist developing countries.  Ireland already had a well-established policy and model tailored to best represent the country's interests, so there was no need to change from our OECD model.</p><p>There have been three treaties in the past 12 months: Pakistan, Ethiopia and Zambia.  These contained elements of both the OECD and UN models.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-03a.119" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017100300002#D00200"><p>Yes.  We discussed them when we dealt with the UN model at this committee.  That was an element of progress as the UN model takes on board the underdeveloped countries in particular and is more suited to their needs.  Will there be a shift?  It had seemed as though there was going to be a shift in the UN model.  Has that now stalled or are we looking at engaging with the UN model again rather than with the OECD model?  That is what the Minister is following here - namely a double tax agreement with a non-OECD country.</p></speech>

I can only assume that Pakistan, Ethiopia and Zambia were potentially not as well developed as Kazakhstan.  There is a tier of development and my assessment may not be 100% correct.  I will try to get a more detailed note on why there was a tiered structure between the UN and OECD models for those three countries, and why we are only using the OECD model for Kazakhstan.</p></speech>

This is something that I will continue to pursue.</p> <p>  Macao, meanwhile, is known as the casino of Asia and is something of a tax haven because of its advantageous personal and corporate tax structure.  Residents and non-residents both benefit from ultra-low taxes levied against professional and business income.  How did making a tax exchange agreement with this region as opposed to any other region become a priority for the Department?  How is this agreement not covered by the Chinese agreement?  </p></speech>

If a country comes to us and is prepared to establish an arrangement, it is our policy to put that arrangement in place.  As the committee will have seen from the previous note, there are 25 countries with whom we have exchanges of taxation information in place.  Macao will be the 26th such country.  They came to us.  As Macao is a special administrative region of China we are entitled to make a deal with them in their own right.</p></speech>

It has agreements with approximately 130 countries while we are at 73.  Can the Minister of State put this in context for us?  Can he explain if there are historical reasons the UK has a much more extensive network than us?</p></speech>

I refer to how the agreement has been used internally in Kazakhstan.  It has been linked to Ireland's vote for Kazakhstan's membership of the UN Security Council as a way to suggest that Kazakhstan enjoys a forward moving, democratising and improving situation and thus improve its image, internally and externally.  Let me put my comments in context.  I had a particular interest in Kazakhstan because, as a member of the European Parliament, I was part of a delegation that travelled to Central Asia.  I visited a group of workers in Kazakhstan who were subsequently massacred in December 2011 in a really brutal situation with mining workers in Zhanaozen.  I was subsequently blocked from visiting after raising concerns about human rights, workers' freedom and a lack of press freedom.  A dictatorship is in power.  How is the agreement used in Kazakhstan?</p></speech>

As I have pointed out, an improvement in trade gives people an opportunity to improve their standard of living.  When one improves the standard of living one certainly hopes and expects there will be more  economic freedom.  Countries that remain in abject poverty, and I am not saying that applies to Kazakhstan, tend to be poorly ruled.  If one gives people the opportunity to trade, improve their economy, receive an education and advance then that is something that can only be welcomed.</p></speech>

I am for trade that is linked to real sustainable economic development with human rights playing an important part.  It is a fact that authoritarian regimes use international relationships to bolster themselves, internally and internationally.  I am not opposed to double taxation agreements in principle, not even, necessarily, with countries that have authoritarian regimes.   I do not think it is a question of principle.  Has the Department or Minister conducted concrete analysis on this matter?  Is the Minister of State open to having a discussion on human rights?</p></speech>

In accordance with D&aacute;il Standing Order 84(A)(4)(k) and Seanad Standing Order 71(3)(k), the Sectoral Employment Order (Construction Sector) 2017 in draft was referred to the committee by orders of both Houses on 26 September 2017.

The court advertised its intention to undertake an examination of the CIF request and it invited submissions.  Four submissions were received, from the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Unite the union and the trustees of the construction workers' pension scheme.  All submissions supported the application by the CIF before the court.  Subsequently, the court convened a hearing on the matter and the parties that had made written submissions also made oral submissions.  Following this, and being satisfied that making a recommendation would promote harmonious relations between workers and employers and assist in the avoidance of industrial unrest in the construction sector, the Labour Court submitted a recommendation to the Minister on 13 July 2017.</p><p> The recommendation has been considered by the Minister in line with the terms of the legislation and the court was notified in August that the Minister was accepting the recommendation.  In making the recommendation the Labour Court must consider the factors under section 16(2) of the Act.  These include the potential impact of the making of an order on the levels of employment and unemployment in the identified economic sector, the impact it might have on competitiveness in the economic sector concerned and that the sectoral employment order would be binding on all workers and employers in that economic sector.  The 2015 Act requires the Minister, within six weeks of receipt of the Labour Court recommendation, either to accept or reject the recommendation and to make an order to give legal effect to the terms of the recommendation.  The Act provides that the order must come to this committee and to the Houses for the approval of both Houses before it can be made.</p><p> A draft of the order was laid before the Houses on 22 August 2017, as required by section 17(4) of the Act, but due to the summer recess the approval of the Houses could not be obtained at that time.  However, a commitment was given that the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas would be sought at the earliest opportunity.  I thank the committee in this regard.  Clearly, we are anxious to maintain stability in employment terms and conditions in the construction sector.  I hope the committee will refer the order back to both Houses for approval so that we can bring the order into effect as soon as possible.  It is desirable and hugely in the interests of harmonious industrial relations in the construction sector to have the order confirmed at the earliest possible date.  When the order comes into effect, its terms will be binding across the sector and enforceable by the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.</p></speech>

We should note that the new unemployment figure is down to 6.1%.  I urge the Department to continue its work.  Obviously, there will be challenges ahead in this regard and in respect of a tightening jobs market.  Overall, given where we have come from, it is good to have the unemployment rate down to 6.1%.  I realise that when it gets down to 5%, it is considered full employment and that will entail challenges, but I believe it is important to note that figure today.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, who has responsibility for innovation, research and development.  We have given the committee a briefing and I hope it will give members a clear understanding of what we are delivering for the money voted by the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  To summarise briefly, the 2017 total gross allocation for my Department and its offices and agencies is &euro;858.42 million, an increase of approximately 6% on last year's allocation of &euro;810.47 million as per the published Revised Estimates Volume.  The Department's allocation is divided between &euro;303.4 million in current expenditure and &euro;555 million in capital expenditure.  The current expenditure allocation includes an additional &euro;3 million in Brexit-specific pay moneys provided in budget 2017 to support the recruitment of an additional 40 to 50 staff across the Department's Vote.  I will confine my remarks to jobs and enterprise development and the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, will provide details on the Department's innovation programme.  If it suits the committee I will speak again when we move to section C with regard to regulation.</p> <p>  The total gross capital and current expenditure by the Department in the first six months of 2017 was &euro;333.96 million.  At that point it was &euro;26.5 million behind the expected expenditure position as profiled at the start of the year, or just under 8%.  In terms of current expenditure, the end of June position shows that gross expenditure was &euro;135.9 million, which is approximately &euro;6 million behind the original profile.  The main reason for this relates to variances in pay and non-pay expenditure.  These were due to a number of factors, including delays in relocating a number of departmental units, delays in filling vacancies in varying areas, timing delays and so forth.</p><p>Gross capital expenditure to the end of June was just over &euro;198 million, which is &euro;20.5 million behind the original profile.  As the committee will be well aware, variances in capital expenditure can arise for a number of reasons, including timing of demands for grant offerings, timing of expenditure reports being submitted by agency clients, agencies own-resource income, which is a feature here, property-related issues and the quality of grant applications being made to an agency.  Notwithstanding the capital expenditure variance at the end of June, it is my expectation that there will be a full spend of the Department's capital allocation in 2017.  As advised, my Department secured additional capital by way of a Supplementary Estimate in 2015 and 2016.  These moneys enabled it to meet some existing commitments and thereby enhanced the new business capacity of a number of its agencies for future years.  In the event that capital savings arise elsewhere across the Exchequer by year-end, my Department will explore, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, the possibility of seeking another Supplementary Estimate in late 2017.<br/><br/>I will briefly outline some of the aspects of the work of the Department in the jobs and enterprise area.  At the end of 2016, more than 435,000 people were working in client companies being supported directly by the Department's enterprise agencies.  That is an all-time record level of employment across the agencies.  Allowing for the multiplier effect, I think it is safe to say a similar number of people were being indirectly supported in services and sub-supply.  This means that in excess of 850,000 people - or two out of every five of those in employment - throughout the country are being supported through the enterprise agencies.  Furthermore, it is interesting to note that approximately 90% of the Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland directly-supported jobs are full-time in nature.<br/><br/>During 2016, the enterprise development programmes of the Department's enterprise agencies also continued to make a significant contribution to growing employment in the regions with 52% of new jobs created by IDA Ireland clients and 61% of jobs created by Enterprise Ireland clients in 2016 being based outside of Dublin.  IDA Ireland client companies created a total of 11,842 net new jobs across a range of sectors last year, with every region posting net gains.  Total employment in overseas companies at the end of 2016 was 199,877, the highest figure ever recorded.  I am pleased to state that progress has continued in 2017.  IDA Ireland <font color="#2F2F2F">job approvals are up 22% in 2017 compared with the first half of 2016.  Investments approved by IDA Ireland in the first half of 2017 will lead to the creation of more than 11,000 jobs as companies roll out their plans in the coming months and years.</font><br/><br/>The increased allocation made to the IDA Ireland's capital base in 2017 has allowed it to continue to further progress its regional property programme.  In the first half of 2017, advanced facilities have already been constructed and completed in Sligo, Castlebar and Tralee.  Preparations in respect of delivering advanced facilities and buildings at other regional locations also continues, with a further six expected to be completed in 2018.<br/><br/>More than 201,000 people are now directly employed by Enterprise Ireland-supported companies, the highest in the history of the agency<b>. </b>Significantly, 65% or 130,000 of those jobs are located outside Dublin.  Enterprise Ireland clients also recorded export sales of &euro;21.6 billion in 2016, an increase of 6% on 2015.  This is a good news story in terms of job creation generally, regional job creation in particular and exports.<br/><br/>In May 2017 Enterprise Ireland launched a new regional enterprise development fund to the value of &euro;60 million over a number of years.  The fund is a competitive one and it will support the regional Action Plan for Jobs and the Action Plan for Rural Development as they are rolled out.  There will be many collaborative initiatives in respect of that fund building on industry strengths and driving job creation across the regions.<br/><br/>The local enterprise offices, LEOs, play a key role in supporting employment.  LEO-supported clients created 7,883 gross new jobs across all regions.  That resulted in a net gain of an extra 3,679<b></b>new jobs.  At the end of 2016, the number employed across LEO client companies reached 34,000 jobs<b></b>in total.  This year the LEOs have targeted the approval of 920 projects for grant support, with an associated full-time equivalent of more than 2,300 new jobs.  They have set ambitious targets in terms of mentoring and participation.  They appear to be on course to deliver their targets for 2017 with the approval of 461 projects around the country in the first six months of 2017, which are projected to deliver more than 1,100 new jobs.<br/><br/>The big issue facing the country - not least businesses and the enterprise sector - is Brexit.  It is a generational challenge for all member states of the EU, not least Ireland.  Clearly, there are threats and opportunities posed by the challenge of Brexit and that is a primary focus of Departments.  We are central to the diplomatic effort that is ongoing, in addition to my colleagues across the Government.  We are engaging with our EU partners, including the European Commission, individual member states and the European Parliament, as we saw today.  We very much want to get across to them the uniqueness of Ireland's relationship with the UK and the potential impact of Brexit on Ireland.  We are also engaging with counterparts in the UK at ministerial level.  Members have a detailed briefing on that so I will not go into it in any greater depth.<br/><br/>The Action Plan for Jobs has a particular focus on Brexit and we are also carrying out a review of Enterprise 2025 in the context of Brexit.  Every item of policy and work in other areas has to be Brexit-proofed in order that we might ensure that we have both the right policies and the specific policy responses in place.  We are looking at a number of policy responses to help business as well.  I could go into detail on those.  My Department also has a number of initiatives in place to allow it - across the board - to have a better response to Brexit.  I could go into detail on those if members would like me to do so.</p></speech>

What is the position in that regard?  I presume that when the moneys were voted, sanction was granted to fill the posts.  I would be pleased to hear what is the position on that.  Could the T&aacute;naiste also update us on the work of IDA Ireland in terms of the review of the Succeed in Ireland initiative and ConnectIreland?</p></speech>

That allowed IDA Ireland to increase its staff cohort for specific posts.  Seven of the posts have been filled to date and the process relating to the remaining three is well under way.  In addition, we recently secured sanction from the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to sustain a further 35 posts to assist IDA Ireland to continue its Winning Abroad programme beyond the initially sanctioned three-year term.  Those 35 people have already been recruited and are working and they will be able to continue their work.  That will be reflected in our new Estimate.  I have been keen to track that to make sure the people were in place.</p> <p>  Of the 39 sanctioned Brexit-related posts for Enterprise Ireland, 28 have been filled to date and recruitment is ongoing for the remaining 11.  It is expected that four of those staff will be recruited by the end of October and seven by the end of the year.  I had a discussion with both organisations.  They have a very active process to fill the jobs but it can be difficult sometimes to recruit.  They have the funding and they expect to have the vacancies filled by the end of the year.</p></speech>

I will get that figure for the Deputy and forward it to him.</p> <p>  On Succeed in Ireland, we have said previously that the Department will be commissioning an independent review of the Succeed in Ireland programme.  That review will be carried out after the details of the initiative's full and final costs are available.  That will equip us with a full understanding of the programme's results and its contribution to employment generation in the State.  This is in the interests of good governance and ensuring value for money for the taxpayer.  I hope the terms of reference can be finalised shortly.  We are examining the responses to the public consultation and that will help to shape the final text.  As the Deputy is aware, there was a public consultation that looked for observations on the draft terms of references.  It received 17 different submissions from a broad range of stakeholders, including public representatives and the public.  The review cannot begin until the full costs of the programme are clear and the full costs will not be clear until the ConnectIreland dispute with IDA Ireland is finalised, one way or another.  I hope that this issue can be brought to a conclusion and we can move on to evaluate the programme and look to the future.</p></speech>

I am disappointed with the T&aacute;naiste's response on the Succeed in Ireland programme.  I was going to ask the same question.  It has taken so long for the terms of reference even to be agreed.  This is a major issue.  I have met with IDA Ireland and with ConnectIreland people in recent weeks and I find it inexplicable as to why we have not sorted out this situation.  I understand what the T&aacute;naiste has just said but I find it inexplicable.  The idea of the Succeed in Ireland project was very good and it had the potential to bring jobs to small rural parts of the State where IDA Ireland probably would not be able to go, or would not have the resources to chase up three or four jobs here and five or six jobs there.  I am very disappointed that we have not had any progress on this issue.  The T&aacute;naiste is aware that the matter was raised with the previous Taoiseach by a number of Deputies who expressed their concerns at the time.  The delay on the subject is unacceptable.</p></speech>

I have met with IDA Ireland and with ConnectIreland.  I have had a very long and good meeting with ConnectIreland.  I would really like to see an end point to this in trying to determine what the final costs are and to move on to the review.  I agree with the Deputy that if there is the possibility of more job creation and if somebody feels that they have a contribution to make on regional jobs, then let us look as soon as we can at how the programme has worked to see what is the precise mechanism we could consider going forward.</p> <p>  I am equally keen and I hope that arbitration or mediation can be agreed by both sides so we can get to an end point on the issue between IDA Ireland and Succeed in Ireland, so we can examine this type of initiative and look to the future with regard to the kind of structure that will work.  I have no doubt there were many positives.  We must welcome anybody who can create the extra jobs but we must get the precise structure right going forward.  It is hypothetical until the costs are clear in the current situation.  We need to review the project and I am always conscious that it is public money.  I assure the Deputy that I have not shut the door on it at all.  I have met with both sides, had a discussion and tried to get some movement forward, which is what I would really like to see as soon as possible.</p></speech>

To be honest, prior to the T&aacute;naiste becoming the Minister for this Department, the committee had spent quite a lot of time debating this issue.  The committee feels that there was a lot of contacts and links made abroad.  We are worried that, in light of Brexit, we might lose those substantial contacts while all this is going on.  Obviously if something is going to court it must be dealt with but at the same time many people felt that some good work was achieved.  A lot of contacts and good progress were made, and members would hate to see that lost.  I am very happy to hear that the T&aacute;naiste has not closed the door on it and that we can expect something in the future from it.</p></speech>

I am certainly happy to pursue this.  I agree with the Chairman's comments and anyone would be happy to pursue jobs from whatever source.  IDA Ireland is doing a very good job.  It has more foreign direct investment in the pipeline.  Recently I have seen at first hand the trade missions and so on, as has the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, and connections being made with firms.  There is huge interest in Ireland, particularly in the post-Brexit situation.  Many firms who have headquartered in London are very keen to examine the possibility of relocating to various parts of Ireland, cities and regional areas, especially when it comes to manufacturing.</p></speech>

I am concerned because we are facing the greatest economic challenge for decades and it is worrying that, notwithstanding the increase in employment that has been achieved in Enterprise Ireland, we seem to have significantly less people employed in the key State sector than we did five years ago.  This does not seem right to me.</p></speech>

Of course it is very regrettable that there was downsizing due to the economic crisis we faced, but once we had the ability to invest we have been building up again.  It is a priority, as the Senator saw in the budget last year, and it will be a priority again, to continue to build the staff of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.</p><p>The Senator is aware that the Taoiseach recently announced an exercise that is now under way that will be helpful in examining the global footprint of all our agencies in particular.  There has recently been more investment in Bord Bia and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the roles of Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and our embassies are being examined in the context of the substantial increase the Taoiseach wants to see in the coming years.  The Senator is correct that now that the economy is recovering we need to invest in those agencies and particularly so in view of the challenges posed by Brexit.  We will not be found wanting in terms of supporting the agencies to have appropriate staff in place.</p></speech>

I shared some of my experiences of the agency when living in Australia during the height of the economic crisis with the former Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor.  It was said that we are going to face the biggest economic crisis in decades.  The biggest economic crisis we have had was nine years ago, not decades in the past.  While Brexit will be a huge challenge, the unemployment rate is now down to 6.1%, which indicates that the agencies have been performing.  In the interest of balance, perhaps the T&aacute;naiste could furnish the committee with more or simpler specifics about the return from those agencies over the past three to four years and their achievements since the Action Plan for Jobs was put in place.  More investment will be needed, which I would welcome, in particular in regard to the Asia Pacific region.  I welcome the contribution of ConnectIreland in terms of its provision of opportunities of referrals through social meetings, in particular for emigrants who were not at board of management level or similar, and it was very much on the tip of emigrants' tongues because of that.  One could often find out about jobs through social and personal interactions.  A departmental official said that one of the biggest referrals to him through ConnectIreland resulted in several new jobs in the regions and that is to be welcomed.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to furnish the committee with specific statistics on efficiencies.  It is all very well having several personnel in an agency but increased efficiency and the consideration of that must be targeted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-03a.230" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017100300002#F00500"><p>I take the Deputy's point.  It is interesting to note that Enterprise Ireland has supported the highest level of jobs ever.  It has added more than 10,000 jobs per annum since 2012.  As Senator Gavan pointed out, that was done with reduced staff resources.  It has become more expert.  I was on a trade mission last week with Enterprise Ireland representatives and I saw it reaching out to businesses, the initiatives it is taking and the way it is working.  The level of expertise within the agency has grown and the return on that can be seen in terms of jobs.  Its target is 60,000 extra jobs and &euro;56 billion in exports by 2020.  We are seeing a return on investment in it.  There was a constant series of new job announcements from January to August of this year in the food and aviation sectors and so on.  There were announcements of 150 new jobs in Dawn Farm Foods in February, 200 new jobs in Fenergo in Dublin, two new jobs in Coolmore Foods, 80 new jobs in Parc Aviation in Shannon, new jobs in Cork and other parts of the country and that list goes on.  The return is there.  It is a very expert agency.  There is a high level of praise from companies in Ireland and abroad for the expertise that has been developed in Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  Businesses are comparing them with other such agencies worldwide and say the level of service from Enterprise Ireland and the IDA is second to none, which is absolutely true and we are seeing the return on that.  I take the point that there is no room for complacency in the context of our very challenging situation, as Senator Gavan said.  We need to keep the effort up to ensure we can deal with the challenges posed by Brexit.</p></speech>

I was on a trade mission to South Korea and Japan and the level of expertise shown by Enterprise Ireland in such countries and the recognition of that by the Governments there and the agencies that work in conjunction with Irish agencies was really superb.  For agencies from a small country, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland in particular punch well above their weight across and outside Europe under very difficult circumstances.  There is evidence not only from Europe but from around the world that they are doing exceptionally well under difficult circumstances that might become more difficult because of Brexit.  Enterprise Ireland is highly regarded in countries I have been such as Brazil and so on.</p></speech>

That points to efficiencies being made and a better value return being obtained at a cheaper cost, which is very positive.</p></speech>

In regard to Deputy Neville's comments, I have to put on my regional hat.  It is very welcome that national unemployment is down to 6.1%.  Unfortunately, in Waterford and the south east the unemployment rate stubbornly remains approximately 3% above the national average and is currently at approximately 9%.  The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, will support me on that.  Although there have been many good news stories in recent years, I ask the T&aacute;naiste to keep up her renewed emphasis on the regions because while it is welcome for new jobs to be created there, they must be well-paying jobs that will allow people to get mortgages and buy houses.  Particular emphasis has been put on the regions in recent years but it does not seem possible for the unemployment rate in Waterford to come within 1% or 2% of the national average and any renewed emphasis on the region would be welcomed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-03a.234" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1351" speakername="John Halligan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017100300002#F00900"><p>It is important to note that the south east had one of the highest levels of unemployment and that has significantly dropped, albeit that the employment rate has not increased to the same level as the rest of the country.  However, unemployment has dropped significantly and employment has risen significantly.  I met the directors of the IDA last week.  The T&aacute;naiste has been in contact with me on several occasions on this issue and has been to Waterford to visit Enterprise Ireland local enterprise offices and so on and there is a recognition that a lot more needs to be done.  I do not like to only mention Waterford.  As the Chairman knows, the situation pertains to the entire south-eastern area.  There is a recognition of the needs of the area and only last week, a new greenfield site was opened with the IDA, which will be announced in the coming days and hopefully will attract another big company to Waterford.  It is important to note that the south east has historically had higher unemployment rates than most parts of the country but it has significantly dropped in recent years.  However, the Chairman is correct that the rate in the area is 2% or 3% behind that of many other regions.</p></speech>

We need to see the regions booming again.  The situation I described applies to the entire south-eastern area because the five counties therein have similar unemployment figures.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-03a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1421" speakername="James Reilly" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017100300002#F01100"><p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister of State and their departmental officials.  Brexit is a huge challenge but, as Deputy Neville said, the financial crash we experienced a number of years ago was also a huge challenge and many people wrote the country off and said it could not succeed in getting out of it.  We were laughed out of court when it was said that we would create 100,000 jobs but that has been done and surpassed.</p><p>I congratulate the Ministers on the ongoing success in reducing unemployment and increasing the number of people at work.  I welcome the approach regarding ConnectIreland, which made a strong presentation to the committee.  It has a role in creating more jobs and, given the challenges that we face, we need to avail of every strand of job creation.</p><p> As opposed to their numbers, I acknowledge the quality of people working in Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and elsewhere.  It is important.  It is probably a good sign of the economy being so strong that all of the quality people are already gainfully employed and we must tease them back to the Department and Enterprise Ireland to help us attract more jobs.</p><p> The figures for the cost of job creation that the T&aacute;naiste mentioned do not just reflect what she alluded to, but also the attractiveness of Ireland as a country in which to live and work.  That is due to societal change and an approach to the value of work.  The Government is right to discuss increasing the threshold for the marginal rate to make work more valuable for people instead of increasing the base cost for prospective employers.  Let people take more money home in their pockets and give them more disposable pay.  People will argue that we need more money for services, which we do.  Thanks to the approach that has been taken, though, we actually have more money now.  In every sector, more money is being invested in many services.</p><p> I wish to raise with the T&aacute;naiste an issue that has significant potential to create further jobs in tourism, namely, greenways.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Chairman will be aware of the greenway in Waterford.  The classic one is in Mayo and cost &euro;12 million to put in place but returned that amount in one year.  Greenways present opportunities for coastal routes in north County Dublin, particularly given the train stations.  People could cycle out from the city.  The 27 million people arriving at the airport would have somewhere to go.  Cafes, restaurants and other businesses would spring up along the route.  It is a stunning, coastal route.  This is a no-brainer.  I hope that the T&aacute;naiste will use her undoubted powers of persuasion on the Minister for Finance to ensure that extra money is invested in greenways.  I do not just mean for north Dublin, but for a pot of money.  Previously, I called for &euro;200 million to develop greenways.</p><p> From the Global Economic Forum of a number of years ago, we know that there is an ever-increasing population of people between the ages of 60 and 80 years who are relatively wealthy, well and healthy, and are looking for entertainment and things to do.  Walking and cycling are the sorts of thing that interest them.  Flipping it over to the younger population of Dublin, for people to be able to go for a cycle with their families in safety is difficult to do now.  Rural roads are not safe for that type of cycling and the city is not inviting in that regard.  A safe cycleway along the coast of north County Dublin or all the way back to the south county - that would not bother me - would have societal gains from the point of view of families being outside and exercising together.  All of that is positive.  I did not want to let the opportunity pass without mentioning it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-03a.238" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1351" speakername="John Halligan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017100300002#G00200"><p>In terms of the development of greenways, the economic indicators in Scotland, Switzerland, Austria and so on for the past ten or 15 years have shown their economic value.  They attract proficient cyclists, walkers and so on from other countries.  SMEs also set up along their greenways.  As the Chairman knows, 37 or 40 small businesses - pubs and restaurants - have been reinvigorated and redeveloped along the Waterford-Dungarvan greenway.  Senator Reilly is correct.</p> <p>  In recent years, F&aacute;ilte Ireland started promoting greenways, particularly in countries like France and the Netherlands where people are big into their cycling, parts of northern England and so on.  This summer, we saw people from those countries travelling to Ireland specifically to cycle on our greenways and stay in the hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation along them.  It will probably take another year or two, but I am positive that the economic benefits will be profound in the coming years.  I agree with the Senator that we should continue investing in greenways, given that those that we have invested in have been good for the economy.</p></speech>

It is 46 km long from Waterford to Dungarvan and takes in a tunnel, viaducts and an overhead bridge.  We are between the sea and the mountains, so if people would like to visit Waterford's greenway, they would be more than welcome.</p></speech>

Attracting industry also entails issues of lifestyle, the facilities that are available in an area, atmosphere and diversity.  Having met companies, all of these factors are considered together before a company makes a decision.</p> <p>  I will put some job numbers on the record that the Chairman will appreciate.  Last year, 4,429 new jobs were delivered by Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and LEOs in the south east, or 12 new jobs per day.  The overall number of jobs created in the south east from the first quarter of 2015, which is the baseline year, to the second quarter of this year is 13,000.  That represents good progress.</p> <p>  I recognise the challenges facing some areas.  The south east was mentioned.  More initiatives are probably needed.  I met the regional committee when I was in Waterford and had a good discussion about its plans.  If all of the initiatives are viewed together, one will begin to see employment increasing, but some areas face more challenges than others.  I take that point while recognising that we are also moving in the right direction.</p></speech>

I support the comments on greenways, which have considerable potential.  However, I will revert on my previous point.  It has been shared with me that, in 2012, Enterprise Ireland employed 742 staff as opposed to 570 this year.  That is a drop of 172.  Notwithstanding the point that Deputy Neville rightly makes about ensuring that the organisation operates efficiently, I will point to the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan.  We all accept that these people do a wonderful job, so it is shocking to find that, as we face into Brexit, Enterprise Ireland - a key agency - is 172 staff down on where it was.</p> <p>  I raise this matter because a key member of that organisation has told me that morale among staff in this country is extremely low due to the deficits in skills and numbers and the pressure they are under.  I call on the Minister to address this issue seriously.  We are discussing a 22% reduction in staff numbers at a time when we need to find new marketplaces for our businesses.  It is not good enough to be operating with that level of employment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-03a.245" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017100300002#G00900"><p>The Government has shown its commitment to increasing resources.  The Senator must remember that, at the time, it was a merger of three agencies.  Obviously, we will always listen to Enterprise Ireland.  In terms of the global footprint and putting more people on the ground, both in Ireland and globally, there is a high-level plan to achieve that.  The Senator's comments must be taken in the context of the merger and the economic situation.  It is important that we consider the quality of the output.  Although many factors impacted on the unemployment rate reducing from 15.5% to 6.1%, it is clear from the figures that I have given that the work being done by the agencies has become efficient and less costly per job.  These are good signs.</p> <p>  I see great enthusiasm from Enterprise Ireland staff.  The feedback from everyone who comes into contact with them, businesses nationally and internationally, is striking in how positive it is about the work that Enterprise Ireland and, indeed, the IDA are doing on the front line.</p><p>I can give the committee my direct experience since I took up this job.  That is genuinely what it is.</p></speech>

I am pleased that by comparison with the position at the start of 2016, an additional &euro;65 million has been invested in research and innovation through my Department.  This includes a supplementary allocation in late 2016.  Since I took up this portfolio, it has been clear to me that innovation has a key function in driving productivity growth, which is the most sustainable basis for improving Ireland's economic growth and overall living standards.  Innovation is central to Ireland's competitiveness and the ability of companies based in Ireland to compete internationally.</p> <p>  Key economic indicators show that firms which were not RDI-active suffered the greatest job losses during the recession, while innovation-active firms displayed higher resilience and growth in terms of rates of employment, exports and added value.  Pay levels in RDI-active firms are 10% ahead of the average.  Since 2006, the number of researchers working in the enterprise base has increased by 67% to over 17,800.  This indicates that there has been a major increase in knowledge transfer from public research to the private sector, which represents significant progress on a central innovation policy objective.</p> <p>  The strong science and innovation base we have built up over the past decade and a half has yielded results in terms of economic and societal impact.  When the European innovation scoreboard was published last June, I was pleased to note that Ireland was ranked first in the EU for SMEs innovating in-house and second for SMEs with product or process innovations.  We must continue to ensure, therefore, Ireland has the capabilities it needs to develop, grow and attract innovative enterprises.  Our investment in research and development and our highly-educated workforce is crucial to the development of an ecosystem from which success can emerge.</p> <p>  Investment in research and innovation through my Department is all about delivering tangible economic impacts.  In 2017, under programme B expenditure, approximately &euro;323 million will be invested in RDI programmes by my Department through its enterprise agencies, primarily Science Foundation Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  Further investments are being made through the Tyndall National Institute, the European Space Agency and the programme for research in third level institutions.  I will highlight a few key achievements in the year to date.</p> <p>  Last month, we announced that &euro;72 million will be invested over the next six years in four new world-class Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, research centres.  Importantly, the new centres will be supported by 80 industry partners, which will provide &euro;38 million to support cutting-edge basic and applied research with strong industry engagement, economic and social impact.  This is an example of the collaboration between innovation, SFI, research and development and multinational companies, particularly in areas like pharmaceuticals and IT.  The four new centres will focus their research work on important areas like advanced manufacturing; identifying alternatives to finite fossil fuel resources and the treatment of chronic and rare neurological diseases.  The need to do research in these four important areas has been recognised across the world.  We are doing it here in Ireland.  Last month also saw the beginning of a &euro;43 million five-year investment in the SFI investigator programme, which sees funding go directly to leading researchers and their teams.  Projects receiving funding include work to develop new types of antibiotics and the development of magnetic materials for next-generation data processing.</p> <p>  We spoke earlier about Enterprise Ireland, which this year has continued to support research, development and innovation across our indigenous enterprise base.  Over 30 commercialisation fund projects have been approved already this year.  Equity investments have been made in 37 innovative high-potential start-ups.  Over 600 collaborative projects between Irish-based companies and Irish higher education institutes are supported through a range of initiatives such as innovation vouchers, innovation partnerships and technology gateway projects at our institutes of technology.</p> <p>  A new meat technology centre was established by Enterprise Ireland in conjunction with Teagasc earlier this year to create a strategic research and innovation base in beef and sheep meat processing for this country.  It brings to 14 the total number of technology centres that are supported by Enterprise Ireland or IDA Ireland.  I am pleased to note that over 600 companies are working within these technology centres.  This is phenomenal when taken as a percentage of the population.  Our extremely high level of investment in other countries is one of the highest across Europe.</p> <p>  The value of European Space Agency contracts secured by industry has reached &euro;5.47 million and is on track to reach its &euro;12 million target for this year.  Every &euro;1 we invest in the European Space Agency leads to a return of between &euro;6 and &euro;8.  The research and development work being done by the 62 companies across Ireland that are working within the agency are recognised across the world.  I refer to the work being done by scientists and people with PhDs.  Approximately &euro;424 million of Horizon 2020 funding has been won by our researchers, companies and research organisations to date.  While this positions us well to achieve our target of &euro;1.25 billion, we must not be complacent about that.  I am particularly pleased to note that over &euro;94 million of this funding has been awarded to small and medium-sized enterprises through the Horizon 2020 SME instrument.</p> <p>  The Tyndall National Institute, which is recognised all over the world, is one of our greatest research institutes.  It is the country's largest dedicated research centre.  It operates in the ICT sector which, as we know, is of huge economic importance.  At this point in the year, the institute is on track to deliver on its targets of &euro;6 million in income through engagement with industry, collaboration with over 200 companies and Horizon 2020 drawdown of &euro;7 million with 20 new projects funded.</p> <p>  Ireland has become a global innovation leader.  We must continue to invest in research, development and innovation if we are to secure a vibrant and strong economy over the next ten, 15 or 20 years.  We need a strong innovative enterprise base and growing employment, sales and exports.  We have to be internationally competitive.  I say that because as technology advances and drives industrial and economic growth in countries across Europe and the world over the next ten, 15 or 20 years, our scientists and researchers will have to be at the top in developing innovative projects.  I think we are there.  I will give a couple of examples in the area of research and development.  Ireland is ranked third in the world in agricultural science, which is phenomenal.  We are ranked first in the world in nanotechnology.  We are in the top ten in the world for innovative scientific projects and research.</p><p>Our record in research and development is recognised by countries such as Japan, Korea, right across Europe and by bodies from the European Space Agency to NASA in the US.  I think we are doing exceptionally well, really hitting above the belt.  It is important that we continue to invest in innovative projects and in research and development.</p></speech>

May I put on record my thanks for all the briefing sessions that were organised for members in the Department?  The session with Science Foundation Ireland was excellent.</p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in launches its pre-budget submission this morning and under the heading of enterprise, I have a section on Ireland's application to join CERN.  Will the Minister of State confirm whether it is the Government's intention to apply for either associate or full membership of CERN?  I am aware that in 2014, the then Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation conducted a study on proposed membership of CERN and it concluded that the case for joining CERN would be very strong, if satisfactory membership conditions could be achieved at around the same cost of associate membership.  Obviously the full membership fee is approximately &euro;10 million but associate membership is &euro;1.5 million a year.  Has provision been made in the budget to cover the cost of membership or associate membership of CERN?  Is it the Government's intention to apply to join CERN? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-03a.258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1351" speakername="John Halligan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017100300002#J00400"><p>I thank Deputy Quinlivan for his incisive questions at the many meetings he attended in the Department.  In regard to Irish membership of CERN, Innovation 2020 contains an action in this regard and we are already negotiating Ireland's membership options.  In January 2016, the then Minister of State with responsibility for skills, Deputy Damien English wrote to CERN in order to commence the process.  There have been ongoing discussions between my Department and CERN at both official and ministerial level throughout 2016 and 2017.  Officials from the Department, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland visited CERN in 2016.  The Director General of CERN visited Dublin and met my predecessor.</p> <p>  The information that has been gathered has provided my officials and me with a comprehensive understanding of the potential benefits of CERN, however, the cost of membership is also significant. </p> <p>  The cost of Ireland becoming a full member of CERN is in the region of &euro;15 million per annum.  Alternatively, Ireland could become an associate member for 10% of that cost, that is &euro;1.5 million per annum.  An associate member enjoys reduced benefits, and reduced access to contracts and enterprise.  Based on the significant cost of joining CERN, and the European Southern Observatory, which I know that Sinn Fein and Fianna Fail Party are interested in, we are assessing the money that can be spent on this investment.  In my view, if it is possible, I think we should join CERN for the benefits that could accrue.  At present, the Department, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland are in discussions.  It would be wrong for me to say that we will have the financial wherewithal to do this straight away and join.  I know that Deputy Quinlivan has a great interest in Ireland joining CERN and I give him my word that when a decision will be made I will tell him.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-03a.261" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017100300002#J00700"><p>Obviously the regulatory offices and agencies play a key role in ensuring that markets, including the labour market, work efficiently through smart regulation, which encourages innovation, competition and high standards of compliance and protection of consumers but without unnecessary regulatory cost.</p> <p>  I will outline briefly some of the key activities of a number of the agencies under the Department.  Since its establishment the Workplace Relations Commission through the new adjudication service has reduced the number of legacy employment rights industrial relations complaints.  The numbers have reduced from 2,397 in November 2015 to fewer than 50 at the end of June 2017.  That is a very striking reduction.  The number of equal status legacy cases has also been reduced from 1,298 to 482 cases.  I think that is really important.  In terms of handling current complaints the adjudication service received more than 6,000 specific complaints in the six months to the end of June 2017, but decisions in respect of complaints now issue within eight months, with the majority being issued within a shorter timeframe.  The service is responding in a faster way and in a much better timeframe than what users of the previous structures experienced.  Some 2,671 inspections have been completed to date this year, with a total of 1,000 employers found to have been in breach of the regulations.  </p> <p>  The figures for the Companies Registration Office Ireland, CRO, reflect the present economic situation.  The first half of 2017 was very busy for the CRO.  The number of Irish companies on the companies register is 211,110.  There were 2,713 external company registrations, and one can imagine the significant level of documentation, which was well over 250,000 documents, and some 74% were processed through e-filing but in excess of 11,000 new companies were incorporated, an average of 1,875 each month, and more than 13,000 new business names were registered with the CRO in the first half of this year.  That is a reflection of the economic activity that is going on in terms of businesses and companies.  It is very encouraging.  This level of new businesses being formed is to be welcomed.</p> <p>  The Low Pay Commission comes under my Department.  Deputies and Senators will be aware that in July 2017, the Low Pay Commission recommended a further increase in the national minimum wage of 30 cent, bringing the minimum wage up to &euro;9.55 per hour.  Responsibility was recently transferred to the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection for that part of the work of my Department.</p> <p>  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, obviously plays a very central role in facilitating compliance with and enforcement of company law.  Again, let me put some statistics on the record, because I think they are very interesting, between 2012 and 2016, investigations by the ODCE have resulted in 977 company directors being restricted and 65 company directors disqualified by the High Court, with directors' loans infringements totalling &euro;221 million rectified on foot of action by the ODCE.  That is quite a volume of work.  However, following the outcome of the ODCE's prosecution of a number of persons, and Judge Alymer's decision in May 2017 to acquit Mr. Sean FitzPatrick, the then Minister at the time requested the Director of Corporate Enforcement to submit a report on the issues highlighted by Judge Aylmer in his ruling.  That report was furnished to me on 23 June 2017 under section 955 of the Companies Act 2014.  I have referred the report to the Attorney General for advice and specifically as to whether there are any legal impediments to publishing the report and discussing its contents in the Oireachtas.  Of course, I would like to publish the report and will do so as soon as I get legal clearance.</p> <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC is the other regulatory body charged with enforcing competition and consumer protection law.  They have done a great deal of work this year.  The first conviction in Ireland for bid rigging, resulted from an investigation into a cartel in the flooring sector.  The first custodial sentence was also handed down against a trader for misleading a consumer in the sale of a clocked car.  I think many will be interested to learn that the commission has been looking at misleading practices in the sale of clocked or crashed cars.  The CCPC continues an investigation into potential price signalling in the motor insurance sector as well.  The CCPC has held some 27 witness summons hearings and obtained more than 1.24 million emails and documents from parties under investigation into potential price signalling.  That is clearly a very serious and detailed investigation that is currently under way.</p><p>They are looking at anti-competitive conduct in the ticketing sector.  Some 99 files into potential car clocking in the motor industry were opened in the first half of the year and unannounced inspections commenced in car garages across the country to ensure compliance with consumer protection legislation.  In the year to date, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, has received 44 merger notifications, 41 of which were cleared within 30 working days.  That is a phase 1 assessment.  As at 30 June, in another important area on which it spends a lot of time, there were 114 live investigations into unsafe products on the market, which could include anything from dangerous toys to products that could cause harm in the home.  It is very centrally involved in that work as well.</p><p> I hope that gives a flavour of some of the agencies under the aegis of the Department at present.</p></speech>

I was very impressed by him.  He is showing a lot of energy and dedication to the job.  In advance of the Anglo trial, which we all know about, there was a series of engagements between the ODCE, the T&aacute;naiste's Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of the sanctioning of posts.  Is there any issue today between the ODCE and those two Departments in terms of sanctioning posts and resourcing?  I have read that the report on the Anglo trial, which was furnished to the T&aacute;naiste and which she sent to Attorney General, referred to resourcing issues which are ongoing within the office.  It is obviously a hugely important office.  Can the T&aacute;naiste provide an overview of what additional resourcing requests are before her today and what requests for personnel or additional resources remain to be sanctioned and fulfilled?</p></speech>

That has been in the public arena.  I understand people have been recruited to some of those specialist posts and there is no issue in terms of sanction for them or in moving forward in respect of recruitment, either between ODCE and my Department or between ourselves and DPER.</p> <p>  The five forensic accountants were appointed and were provided with specialist software in the first half of 2017 to enable them to present the findings of their investigations visually.  Following the appointment of the initial forensic specialist in May, work has commenced to create a forensic laboratory, with specialist hardware and software having also been procured.  All of these developments will enhance the ability of the office to progress its investigations.  Those issues in terms of getting the financial support for the ODCE to approve people have been dealt with.</p></speech>

I will begin with a brief quote from an RTE report, which stated that "the country's workplace safety agency says it currently does not have sufficient resources to perform all of its duties to the highest standard."  Speaking on RTE's "This Week" programme, Martin O'Halloran, CEO of the HSA, said he has written to the Government looking for additional personnel to meet the demands of a growing national workforce.</p> <p>  Over the past decade, 200 people have died on Irish farms yet the number of farm inspections carried out by the HSA has fallen from 3,112 to just over 2,000 between 2012 and last year.  Those are very concerning statistics.  How many additional personnel has the HSA requested?  Has it requested additional funding for 2017?  Have other agencies or offices under the T&aacute;naiste's remit requested additional staff or funding?  If so, which agency and how many staff?</p> <p>   I also want to ask about the Workplace Relations Commission, if I may.  We had its officials in recently in respect of the fishing industry.  It was concerning to hear that they are going to have to step back on their inspection programme even though there are now charges of people trafficking, because they simply do not have the resources to cope.  How many labour inspectors are currently employed?  Would the T&aacute;naiste consider the case for increasing the number?  Sinn F&eacute;in carried out a survey of the hospitality industry which showed huge non-compliance with basic terms of employment and conditions.  We know there are major problems out there and that there has been a constant shortage of inspectors.  I would like to know how the T&aacute;naiste intends to address the issue.  I thank her for her patience as I have asked quite a few questions.</p></speech>

That was just received on 20 September as a draft plan.  I have not had an opportunity to study it in detail yet.  The topic under discussion on Sunday was farm safety.  There were two very tragic accidents at the time of the ploughing championships, as we know.  I visited the HSA stand at the ploughing championships and thought they were doing extraordinary work and getting huge attendances in terms of raising awareness and focusing on farm safety.  I would want to support that work in every way possible so that we can improve safety on farms.  We do not want to see those tragedies being repeated.  One death is obviously one too many.</p></speech>

I met some of the families that are working with the HSA and have lost loved ones through farm accidents when I was at the ploughing.  They are doing excellent work in trying to increase awareness and I think we would all want to support that.</p> <p>  None of the new posts identified in the draft workforce plan relates to the farm safety inspectors, actually.  In respect of the farming sector, the draft workforce plan states that farming inspectors are resource-intensive and that the authority has actually developed new ways of engaging with farmers, such as the various farm walks and knowledge transfer groups.  They are approaching some of the work around farm safety in a different way, other than through straight inspection.  It is about engaging in these kind of events as well.  They have reported that this kind of engagement - I accept that inspections have a role - has the potential for a long-term impact with farmers, along with more targeted inspection campaigns.  </p> <p>  Senior officials from my Department are meeting Mr. O'Halloran tomorrow to discuss the HSA draft workforce plan.  The number of inspections did fall in recent years due to staff reductions and changes in the character of inspection activity, notably in the farm sector.  They have engaged in smarter work practices in order to ensure the message of improving workplace health and safety continues to reach the largest possible audiences.  The kind of initiatives they are taking include the development of the BeSMART online risk assessment tool, the publishing of e-learning courses in the agricultural area and the introduction of a programme of informative farm walks.  They have also updated the HSA's inspection data management system to increase the ease and efficiency of data entry through a simplified system and a new smartphone-based field inspection data app.</p> <p>  It is a bit like what we were saying about Enterprise Ireland.  They are finding new and sometimes more effective ways of working.  Most inspections are targeted at the high-risk sectors such as construction, agriculture, forestry, manufacturing, mines, quarries, the transport of dangerous goods by road and the chemical sector.</p><p> Following the end of the moratorium on public service recruitment, my Department has given the HSA sanction to replace the number of inspection staff who left the HSA in 2016 and 2017.  The organisation is currently in the latter stages of recruiting 11 inspectors who, subject to the acceptance of contracts, etc. should be able to start work in quarter 4 of this year.  The organisation is changing some of the ways it works but it is also recruiting extra inspectors. </p></speech>

Obviously any initiative that can be brought forward to increase farm safety is very welcome.  A lot of the solution rests with education and a change of culture.  The initial research shows that there are different demographics of farmers and different risk categories.</p> <p>  The point made about inspections is very valid.  Let us remember that farm inspections cover a range of issues, including the environment and the rural environment protection scheme, REPS.  I urge that a co-ordinated approach is adopted for inspections.  There have been times, not in terms of farm safety, where farms are visited by a Department inspector and separately an inspector from the council where they contradict each other's findings.  That situation should be borne in mind in terms of more inspections.  I say that without detracting from the work of the HSA.  I support the call for greater health and safety but urge that inspections are co-ordinated to make it easier for farmers to carry on with their business.  Nowadays farming is a very demanding profession and often times farmers work in a solitary environment.  They do not have the amalgamation of a team around them yet they must manage all of the demands placed on them.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-03a.277" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017100300002#L00500"><p>I was asked one other question that I did not answer.  In the WRC there are 50 plus inspectors serving out of 165 staff of the WRC.  I think there has also been a recent internal competition and it is expected that between three and five more inspectors will be appointed shortly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-03a.278" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1389" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017100300002#L00600"><p>I acknowledge what the T&aacute;naiste has said.  To be frank, as someone who has worked as a trade union officer for over a decade, that number of inspectors is inadequate given the increase in precarious work in recent years and the shocking abuses in the fishing and the hotel industries, in particular.  The number of inspectors needs to be addressed.  In fairness to the T&aacute;naiste's staff and the Workplace Relations Commission, they are completely understaffed in terms of tackling the abuses that are quite widespread and rampant in some sectors of our economy, and I stress the words "some sectors of our economy".  We know, from first-hand knowledge, that the bodies do not have the resources they need to tackle the problem, and employers also know.  The situation sends out the wrong signal entirely.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-03a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017100300002#L00700"><p>I think the WRC is doing extremely good work.  From the information that I have given the committee one can see the amount of progress it has made in dealing with complaints in a more timely way, conducting inspections out of the 2,000 plus inspections that are conducted in the workplace.  As a result, 1,000 employers have been found to be in breach.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the fishing sector.  Let us consider what the WRC has done in that area.  Since it published its report in 2017, it has signed a memorandum of understanding, MOU, with other areas to support co-operation in terms of enforcement and information sharing.  I think that is very good.  It has also conducted an information and education campaign in the whitefish sector.  It has engaged with industry stakeholders to enhance compliance, training ten WRC inspectors at the National Fisheries Training College for deployment on fisheries inspection.  It has undertaken more than 200 inspections on the whitefish fleet involving 176 whitefish vessels over 15 m in length.  It has detected almost 200 contraventions relating to 110 vessels to the end of June 2017 and initiated five prosecutions where compliance by other means was not secured.  One can see very active work by the WRC in an area.  I agree with the Senator that what emerged was absolutely unacceptable but action has been taken.  The Department of Justice and Equality has also taken various actions in terms of some of the abuses.  As the Senator will know, visa criteria were changed in terms of the fishing industry.  The WRC is very actively involved in the particular area mentioned by the Senator.  </p></speech>

I do not dispute the good work that has been done.  The committee was quite impressed with what the WRC had to say when it came here.  What worried me, and I think a number of others, was the WRC admitted that it would have to step back and cannot continue the number of inspections that it wants to conduct because of the resource issue.  That is a concern.</p></speech>

The backdrop to my queries is the rising cost of insurance in terms of personal insurance, motor insurance, home insurance and business insurance.  As part of the debate an issue has been flagged to me by some members of the legal community.  They feel that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board could and should be quicker to deal with claims.  I do not know whether I believe such a claim.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to comment on the resourcing of the PIAB.  Similar to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, has the board requested additional resourcing in terms of manpower or any other resources to deal with its workload?</p></speech>

The general reaction to its work is that such work has led to a more efficient management of injury claims.  The board appears to be very efficient in the way it carries out its work.  Maybe the Deputy can supply me with the details and I can come back to him.  I do not really have further information.  Perhaps, Deputy, I would link with him directly.</p></speech>
