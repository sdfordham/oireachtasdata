Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Can I ask members and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off.  We begin today's hearings with Mr. Alan Merriman, who is former finance director at EBS.  In doing so I would like to welcome everyone to the public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Today, much of the focus of the inquiry is on EBS.  At this morning's session we will hear from Mr. Alan Merriman, former director of finance at EBS.  And Alan Merriman joined EBS in July 2005 where he was finance director until March 2009.  Previously he worked with PricewaterhouseCoopers, where he was a partner.  Mr. Merriman is now the chief executive at Elkstone Private.  Mr. Merriman you are very welcome before the committee this morning.</p></speech>

I very much appreciate the opportunity of being here today.  Rather than repeating my witness statement verbatim, in the interest of time I plan to give a brief introduction to my responsibilities and time with EBS, explain why I believe EBS was more of a casualty rather than a cause of this crisis and briefly comment on a number of very select topics which I guess would be of particular interest to the committee.</p> <p>  I joined EBS in the summer of 2005 as finance director.  Prior to this I had been with PwC for a little over 17 years.</p><p>I was on the audit and advisory team of the firm and I was the partner responsible for leading the firm's banking, audit and advisory practice.  I was privileged to have practically all the Irish banks amongst my client base, including the Central Bank of Ireland and Bank of Ireland.  I was very happy in PwC.  Nevertheless, having been courted by EBS, I was eventually convinced to leave, attracted by the opportunity of testing myself in industry and by the wider challenge of ongoing professionalisation of the society and, of course, championing mutuality.</p><p> I ultimately ended up spending only a little over three and a half years with EBS and yet this very short period crossed both the tail-end of a long boom period that this country had enjoyed and the beginnings of what I would describe as two devastating crashes: the first being the global liquidity crisis which triggered the second, being our own catastrophic banking and property market crash.  During the short, three and a half year period, I served under and diligently worked alongside, in very challenging circumstances, three different chief executives.  I was given a wider role than might be considered the norm for a traditional finance director and, broadly speaking, this role might be best characterised as, in effect, being more like that of a COO, a chief operating officer.  For instance, finance, treasury, commercial lending, operations, IT, internal audit, investor relations and risk, amongst others, all came under my areas of responsibility.  I would emphasise that each of these important areas had their own head of finance, head of function - all well very well qualified and experienced in their subject matter fields and clearly responsible for the day-to-day runnings of their functions and/or departments.  I had a very loyal, hard-working and talented team and strong support throughout this period from both our head office and the network, which I was, and continue to be, very grateful for.</p><p> As you may know, I stepped down - and reluctantly so - in early 2009.  This was voluntary, in that I agreed that, as a mutual, it was important to show accountability to our members and other stakeholders for what had transpired in EBS and, in addition to the chairman resigning, I was the obvious choice at executive level to accompany him at that time.  Similar to others, I would have preferred to have stayed and helped but we felt that, on balance, the right thing was that I should exit along with the chairman.</p><p> Let me emphasise that EBS was different.  I think it's a very, very important point to acknowledge.  It was a member-owned, non-profit organisation.  It was the last remaining true building society in Ireland.  It was established for teachers, was strongly supported amongst the public sector - guards and nurses, amongst others - and its people, whether at branch level or at head office, root and branch had a DNA and a culture of being community based and member focused.  It was not focused on profit.  It was about people, it was about trying to serve members better through superior service, real trust and competitive pricing compared to the banks, and to be relevant.  It was a very democratic organisation, with a diverse board and true member representation.  It was an alternative to the commercially-driven banks.  It had a good culture and spirit, but neither was it perfect.  The fact pattern, whether it was well understood or not, EBS was fighting for survival and relevance, not only in 2009 or 2010 but also back in 2005 and, indeed, before that.  Had it not competed in the market, EBS, as Ireland's last true building society, would have ended up gone like the 20 other building societies that this country once had.</p><p> Running down the balance sheet realistically was not an alternative, so EBS continued doing what the board collectively thought best to preserve mutuality.  This meant defending its natural mortgage market share and growing its non-member businesses to aid the member business.  This strategy of running both a member and a non-member business in parallel had been successfully deployed by others in the UK and various international studies have shown that having a mutual is good for the market as a whole.  However, as we all know now, regardless, the society was lost.</p><p> Let me comment on some specific matters that I think would be of particular interest to the committee.  Risk appetite: I want to bring some clarity on this topic and, in particular, commercial property and development lending by EBS.  Quite a number of commentators have questioned why a building society would be in those markets at all.</p><p>Firstly, just to emphasise that my understanding is that the building society legislation was explicitly changed to allow for this.  The Oireachtas must have felt it appropriate and justified and it was against this backdrop that EBS first entered commercial lending in 1991, and not, I might emphasise, 2005.  And I note that as part of its then approved board strategy, EBS embarked on development lending as a sub-strategy of commercial lending business in 2001 and, again, I would emphasise, not in 2005.  The commercial business was circa &euro;1.5 billion and the development lending book was circa &euro;100 million by the time I joined in July 2005.  From the information I've been able to glean in preparation for today, the development lending book, which was built up to circa &euro;500 million by the end of 2008, gave rise to about &euro;300 million of crystalised losses.  For clarity of understanding, I'd like to highlight that whilst undoubtedly the development finance losses were shocking and a very severe blow to EBS, they did not bring about its demise.  Rather, the facts clearly show that given the magnitude of the total capital ultimately needed for EBS, which was a multiple of this number, clearly a multitude of factors - which evolved over a very considerable length of time - lead to its business model failure and not just development and/or commercial lending.  And I'll be happy to elaborate on this in questioning.<br/><br/>Whilst of little comfort, I would also note that risk management and best practices always evolve.  And whilst EBS made mistakes - and, for example, the controls we put in place such as the 3% cap on development finance, were inadequate - by late 2007 and early 2008 we were actually ahead of the curve and this is evident by firstly two clear facts: we were the first to exit these businesses; and, secondly, our loan-loss provisioning at the end of 2008 was more realistic than the banks'.  During my time with EBS,  capital funding and liquidity were always key agenda items for the EBS board and the risk committees.  There was good MIS and intelligence continuously available and there was definitely a sophistication and a depth in the society management team of these critical areas.  For a small financial institution, we had the benefit of both a head of treasury and a head of capital markets, both with deep treasury experience, who, alongside risk, finance and strategy personnel, also had a strong appreciation of these important pillars of banking.  Actions were taken continuously by the board of management to mitigate these risks, including widening and lengthening our funding programmes, improving our collateral position markedly over this period, investing in the infrastructure necessary to establish our covered bond bank - which, amongst other things, brought further emergency liquidity protection - and raising of PIBS, permanent interest-bearing shares, to improve capital ratios and lost absorption, etc.  However, in truth, these were remedies which created breathing space for the <i>status quo</i>to be maintained, rather than being sufficiently, materially corrective.  Consequently, when the crisis did arrive, EBS was, whilst relatively better placed than others, still poorly positioned to withstand the overwhelming stresses it brought.<br/><br/>In wrapping up, let me say a couple of things.  Many hard-working people and families all over Ireland, through no fault of their own, were just trying to get on with normal life and do the right thing.  They continue to suffer today from this global financial crisis.  In truth, for them, certainly in the wrong place at the wrong time.  This, in my view, arose in particular because of how, in Ireland, the property and banking market was allowed evolve here.  And hindsight clearly shows us that Ireland's comparably greater systemic vulnerability in this disaster evolved unchecked by those who ought to have been able to genuinely make a difference or at least provide some meaningful shelter.  EBS is not without fault but the hard truth, if you want my considered insight, is that successive Governments and the authorities, local and European, have much to answer for and more so than EBS.  EBS was different - it was very much more of a casualty of this one-in-100-year crash than a cause.  As the only real building society we had left, it fought a good fight.  Yes, it failed but not for the want of trying.  It was definitely not a root cause of this crisis locally, never mind internationally.  Of course it made mistakes and we had failings and these are regretted.  But EBS was essentially a small fish in a big pond in an even bigger world, where we were takers and not makers of how banking funding worked.</p><p>Within that system, EBS was trying to make a positive difference.  It didn't give up on mutuality.  Maybe that was a mistake; maybe it wasn't.  I hope this somewhat panoramic and very personal perspective is of help, Chairman, and I'm happy to take questions.</p></speech>

Can you tell me what was your assessment of the liquidity and the solvency of the society on the night of the guarantee in September 2008?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-29a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Alan Merriman" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072900002#H00400"><p>I think at that particular point, I mean, clearly the market was under strain, EBS was having its challenges, but its own liquidity position was relatively well-positioned as a home lender with a very substantial residential book.  We had a lot of collateral available to secure funding.  And on the solvency side, well, clearly again, there were stresses and strains, the capital ratios were very strong at that particular point.  So we were more concerned about the market as a whole as distinct to our own individual position at that point.</p></speech>

Together with corporate deposits, about 50% of the entire balance sheet was supported by what would be referred to as customer deposits.  So both retail members and corporates.  The other 50%, broadly speaking, would have come from what one would loosely describe as the wholesale markets.  That would have been a mix and a variety of different funding, both short-term and long-term.</p></speech>

Can you tell us what input, if any, your society and you did in any of the discussions that took place at that time?</p></speech>

I think the society practically had no involvement either.  And I think that really reflects back to my opening comments to your first question, that at that point in time we weren't seen to be a major factor one way or the other.</p></speech>

I think the wider context would be that at that point in time, five years from, you know, a Fergus Murphy perspective was seen as being more prudent and more in sync with some other markets and would allow for a greater period of stability.

I, personally, would have attended quite a lot of meetings down in the Central Bank and the regulator discussing what was happening in the markets, discussing the strains, sharing intelligence, etc., etc.  So, clearly, this was all done very much in a context and, clearly, there was sense in the markets - all the treasury departments would be very well interconnected - that there was a real strain.  So was it a shock when we heard what had happened and the proposed solution?  No, it wasn't a shock, but it wasn't something that we were party to in any central way.</p></speech>

I mean, this was extraordinary times and we were meeting very much in that context and that was absolutely understood at that point in time.  These were not routine meetings, these were meetings in the context of, you know, what was happening in the marketplace, real concern in the Central Bank, real concern across individual banks in terms of what was happening and how this was going to be worked through.

So, EBS would have been quite good at what I'd call being proactive and sharing with the regulator our strategy.  So there definitely would have been, I would guess, at least annual meetings, where we would've updated on, you know, "Here's how the performance was this year.  Here's where we've made progress.  Here's what the strategy is.  Here's what our challenges are."  So those type of meetings certainly did happen in normal times as well as in stressed times.  Discussions with a Pat Neary or a Con Horan would have happened on, I don't know, maybe on a twice-yearly basis there might be meetings where, again, at a strategic level, observations would be exchanged, etc.</p></speech>

That's my recollection.  My recollection was that the meetings were more about what I would call the ebbs and flows of liquidity in the market, concerns around how this was going to be resolved, concerns about ECB.  And it did clearly progress to EBS's position itself and what solutions there might be for EBS from a more M and A-type perspective.</p></speech>

And just as a result of these ongoing meetings that were going on over that six-month period, can you identify any specific tangibles that either ... that the Central Bank and regulator, acting together, prescribed for you to take, suggested you should take or that they suggested they themselves to try and mitigate against the difficulties of tightening liquidity positions?</p></speech>

They were clearly very interested in what we were doing ourselves to resolve strains and, and find ... additional means of getting collateral and access to funding, so there was intense interest in that.  And when it came to the latter stages and what was going to happen to EBS and the realisation that EBS was very unlikely to be able to stay stand-alone, we would have been, I'd say, encouraged is the word I would use, to go and talk to particular banks about EBS potentially becoming part of those banks.</p></speech>

I, you know, I would probably use it as, you know, loosely intelligence exchange.  It was, you know, the Central Bank, I think would have articulated it as being ... it was helpful to them to hear from those at the coalface what we were seeing and what our experiences were in terms of what was happening in the market, to reconcile that to, I guess, what was their more overarching perspective.</p></speech>

So, and again, I'm just going to finish on this, this train now in a second but, so ... you would be telling them perhaps, or would you, "We're getting some of our funding from X but it's getting more expensive, or it's more difficult to get anything from Y."  Was that the kind of thing that was going on?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-29a.82" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Alan Merriman" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072900002#K01500"><p>Yes.  It was ...we ... "Look, we have &euro;200 million of local authority money from the UK maturing in two weeks' time, we're in daily interaction with those local authorities to ensure that we can retain those moneys or here's what we've got in terms of feedback, in terms of &euro;50 million of the &euro;200 million, is definitely going to be withdrawn.  We're on our programme of our covered bank, we're four weeks away from having it fully implemented, at that stage that will accommodate another &euro;2 billion of funding that can be tapped with the ECB, which we'll have by way of emergency cover."  So it was very much that type of meeting.</p></speech>

So, what we've just been talking about was clearly at the, you know, early stages of what was then the crisis and the discussion with the Central Bank and the regulator were very much in that context where ... clear EBS was very unlikely to remain stand-alone and was going to need to end up in a bigger bank.</p></speech>

Eugene Sheehy made the approach to Ted McGovern.</p><p>It was a very clear approach.  The type of conditions they were prepared to sign up to were to make it more attractive to the EBS board to agree to that deal.  And I, personally, at the time - despite having joined EBS for a number of reasons including believing in mutuality - I at that time had a personal view that I felt it was the better option for EBS at that point and would have advocated to both the chief executive and the chairman that we should proceed on that basis.</p></speech>

I could see many challenges.  The society was always very well-intentioned, it had very good people, it was doing well in certain areas.  But, big picture: it had a capital issue and it had a funding challenge.  They weren't day-to-day challenges but it was pretty clear that in the longer term there was a sustainability question.</p></speech>

And given what was going on in the market, that it was much more likely than not, that EBS wasn't going to be able to sustain itself, and therefore an exit at that point in time would be prudent and sensible.</p></speech>

If you can't lend out to your members what are you in a member business for?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-29a.98" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1149" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072900002#L00800"><p>So there was obviously intense competition, there was other banks in, there was, you know, prices were going down, as you said margins were razor thin so, you know, was there a sense that other people were eating your lunch?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-29a.99" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Alan Merriman" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072900002#L00900"><p>I mean it was black and white, and black and white from two different contexts.  Again, you will know well, but if I paint the broader scene, if we go back quite some time, if you wanted a mortgage in Ireland, building societies were the traditional place you would go to get a mortgage - the banks weren't interested.  Times clearly changed.  You had the Irish banks coming into the mortgage market and competing very aggressively and it became a core part of their business.  And then, over and above that, you had the foreign banks came in ... encouraged to come into the market because at the time before their arrival there was a concern about oligopolies and cartels and pricing and competition.  So the foreign banks came in and they were incredibly aggressive at two levels.  You had certain banks like Danske Bank who targeted the refinance market, very low LTVs, but, effectively, practically no margin.  And you had the likes of Ulster Bank who very aggressively went after the first-time buyer market.  So EBS as a traditional building society, having in an environment where it was one of the few players in a normal mortgage market, now found itself in a market where both ends were being very aggressively competed for.</p></speech>

I definitely had a concern about the long-term sustainability of the society from a capital perspective and a funding perspective.  I had a concern later, mid '07, about market and house prices and so forth, but nowhere near to what ultimately transpired.  But capital and funding at an earlier date, yes I had concerns.</p></speech>

Do you feel ... all of them said, "No," by the way; all of them said, "Not at all; we expect people to come to work and do their job and there's no targets at all".  I'm sure we all have views on that.  But can I get your view on that?  Were there targets?  Was there a competitive environment where staff were expected to cross-sell their products, to take every opportunity and to drive things on?</p></speech>

Let me give you just what I might call a very layman explanation within EBS.  EBS had a branch network. Within that network it was made up of both what I'd call branches where the management was employees of EBS, and I had tied branch agents where, effectively, the branch manager was running his own business as an entrepreneur.  That was a relatively unique model to EBS in the Irish market.  If you're a TBA and you're running your own branch, you don't need head office to be giving you additional incentives.</p></speech>

They managed it in a context.  The controls were there.  All credit underwriting was centralised.  No branch manager, no person at the front, could write a loan.  It had to be underwritten at head office level.  But did a branch manager have an incentive to develop business, to do business development?  Absolutely.</p></speech>

EBS, as I said, while it wasn't profit-orientated, EBS needed capital.  Without capital, you can't have a building society, you can't have a bank.  So EBS had to generate capital.  Where does capital come for ... come from?  Well, for a building society, it can only come from retained profits, broadly speaking.  So, you know, this is somewhat of a contradiction, focus not on profit, but without profit, you can't have capital, and without capital, you can't have lending.  So EBS wouldn't have had a scenario where it had enough capital, where I'm sharing with you, as a finance director, that as early as 2006, 2007, my view, well-known around the board, and ... sorry, not just my own personal view, treasury, strategy, finance people would have had the same view ... we didn't have enough capital, we wanted to be improving our capital.</p></speech>

He said:</p> <blockquote> 	I don't think the financial reporting of the losses was linked to the presence of the underlying causes of the crisis [He's clearly absolutely right].  The losses reported, whether in any particular period, are a consequence of the factors that caused the crisis, they didn't cause the crisis and I think that's a very important point. </blockquote> <p>So let me just put it very simply.  IAS 39 was about how much loan loss provision you could recognise on your balance sheet or in your profit and loss account.  It is has no impact on, &quot;Do you have a bad loan or do you not have a bad loan?&quot;  The bad loans were written.  They were there regardless of what the accounting standard would say.  If management in any bank or any building society felt that the loan loss provisions under IAS were shy or weren't appropriate, it was open to management to share that through voluntary disclosure or other data.  So, tables giving statistics on loan defaults, tables giving insights about future expected losses, they were all open to banks, regulators, everybody, to try and get that type of information.  IAS is a red herring.</p></speech>

We can all look to the future.  This accounting standard over here that says, "You must do it this way, you must do that way in your books", that doesn't stop me as a manager being able to say, "Okay, I understand the accounting standard but this is the reality of what I'm dealing with, Mr. Regulator, or this is the reality of what I'm dealing with, Mr. Rating Agency, or this is the reality I'm dealing with, so I'm going to roll up my sleeves and hire a whole load of people who are going to help with credit recovery."  The accounting standards are a complete red herring.  Yes, they were unhelpful and, yes, there might have been a lag before the losses came through, and yes, that might have helped banks think they'd a better capital position than maybe they had.

The regulator could have come along, just by way of example, and said, "Do you know what?  We understand the accounting standard.  We don't like it", and they didn't like it and I think that, to be fair to them, they made that very clear back then, never mind since.  But they could have come along and said, "Despite the accounting standard, what we're going to do is we're going to require you, the Irish banks, to have an additional capital buffer", and force us to take capital in that, as you say, in that, kind of, anti-cycle perspective.</p></speech>

So, EBS come down and we share ... we're going to have our accounts, these are our provisioning levels and we're sharing with the market, not only these provisioning levels, but we're sharing with the market our expectations that there's going to be greater loan losses to come.  We can't put them in our accounts but we're telling the market that we believe the loan losses will be higher-----</p></speech>

The Central Bank, as I interpret it, their perspective .... and remember, I was only having to deal with EBS.  The Central Bank has a much wider responsibility.  So there's the Central Bank say, "Okay, here's little EBS coming along" and they're saying, "God, look, all these problems in development finance.  Shit, what's the market going to read into that?  Will they read across from that into the other banks?  The other banks haven't being telling us that they got this extent of a problem.  This could actually be another escalation in the Irish crisis.  Now, Alan, and I'm just being clear, Alan, just be very sure you need those provisions because this could cause wider difficulty."

I had a responsibility as the finance director to call it as I saw it within the rules.  I had a responsibility to our members and our stakeholders to give as a true an account as I could of what we understood at that point in time.  The Central Bank has a different remit.  It has a much wider responsibility and part of their responsibility was making sure that we were taking due and proper care.  So I would put it in that context.  But I answered the question you asked of me in coming here about the integrity of the accounts and I'm just being very clear.

I might have some numbers here but just to give a context.  Look, I can't find it.  Broadly speaking, I think, by 2002 the commercial lending book was in the order of &euro;800 million; by 2005 it was &euro;1.5 billion; development finance lending was clearly, for us, done around this point in time, you can see it from the records here yourself.  So, this was a clearly an embedded strategy within EBS, well before I arrived.</p></speech>

So, there it outlines two approaches for development finance.  Go for broke or the toe in the water.</p></speech>

So when you arrived in 2005, would you still describe its involvement with development finance as toe in the water as it moved on from there?</p></speech>

I would say that, you know, in terms of moving from 2001, 2002 to 2005, they had clearly gone from what I'd call "zero" to where they had a book in the order of &euro;100 million.  So, I don't think I could describe the book of &euro;100 million, even in the context of an EBS as being "a toe in the water".</p></speech>

No, look, I'm not ... I'm not ... well, let me answer the question in two ways.  One, I'm not explicitly aware of the board being used by commercial lending in what I might call a develop ... in a business development capacity.  So I'm not familiar with that.  But to answer your earlier question, do I see it as appropriate?  Look, I think in, you know, what is the duty of a director?  The duty of a director is, you know, a multitude of things but clearly it's for ... to act in the benefit of the society, of the company.  So using a non-executive or any other director as a means as an introduction, I think is acceptable.</p></speech>

I think it's appropriate for a non-executive or a director to make an introduction to a potential customer, whether it's a retail customer or whether it's a commercial customer.  That is very different from saying do I think it's appropriate to go to somebody and say, "I've a bag of money here do you want to take it away and do something with it?"  They are two very, very different things-----</p></speech>

This plan would have been developed and prepared by the then head of commercial lending.

I mean it notes that commercial is an area that has more than tripled in scale to about &euro;1.6 billion of the loan book.  But the problem as it outlines in 2005 is that the lenders are lower risk, meaning good asset quality but low margins so the desire then is to go for higher-risk businesses.  Now when Fergus Murphy was before us, he said on page 61 that ... of the transcript, that "the society entered into [the] marketplace [late and] at times [it] tended to do business  ... with secondary ... developers and ... investors" in secondary locations and that the society wasn't "getting the better business, maybe none of the business was good".</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-29a.205" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Alan Merriman" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072900002#O02700"><p>You know, look, I ... and I think Fergus said this himself that, you know, because we were exiting the commercial business shortly after he joined, he wouldn't have had what I might call as granular an understanding of the commercial business as perhaps Brian Healy would have had or, indeed, myself.  I mean I'll be very clear that ... and let me explain.  First of all, the low risk versus high risk.  The commercial business EBS had at that point in time wasn't generating a sufficiently attractive return for the risk that was there.  And what I mean by that is that if you have a limited amount of funding to allocate, if you are going to allocate it to a non-member business, so it's not going to your members - you are taking it away from your members to give it somewhere else - you have to ensure you are getting an adequate return.  So that was the motivation for looking to move the needle on the risk curve.  Fergus's comment, I would say to you very clearly: commercial was built up from 1991.  I would say that if you look at the analysis when it was done on the development of ... the development of finance book of &euro;500 million, 70% of that business was done to established developers and builders.  So I am clearly and again, just bear in mind the context here ... the total book is &euro;500 million.  So, the maximum loan we might have had, and, again, I am not going to remember the exact numbers, but broadly speaking, I think, it would have been &euro;50 million.  If you could lend at most &euro;50 million to a single relationship, EBS wasn't going to be in a position that it was going to be banking the Glass Bottle site or Ballsbridge.  So clearly, by definition, we were lending our money out in the areas that could accommodate that type of lending.</p></speech>

They weren't getting the better business, none of the business was good?</p></speech>

Yes, it was competing in a very, very tough market place.  Yes, it was having to establish and build relationships.  Therefore, you wouldn't ordinarily expect to have the business that would be the best business - for obvious reasons.  Developers themselves want to build relationships, they want to have the confidence that somebody is going to be able to bank them etc., etc.  However, having said all of that, so it was a tough environment for EBS to build up that business but it was mandated to do it.  It was a strategy to do it.  Now, best way of being objective in terms of answering your question, let's talk about the discounts that were applied to the books across all the banks that went into NAMA and the subsequent deleveraging that was done.  Fergus himself explained that the EBS discount was, I think, 57%.  Big picture, that's within the goalposts of the other banks.

But, equally, in EBS's case, the other banks only transferred loans that were greater than &euro;5 million.  There was a special case for EBS.  The entire books were transferred.  So you are not comparing apples with apples.  And if you look at the &euro;2.5 billion that Fergus himself testified about; where he talked about that they had to deleverage &euro;2.5 billion and it ended up with a write-off of, I think he said, &euro;500 million.  The aggregate discount of those two taken together is less than 30%.  So I would say that objectively, the facts demonstrate that the EBS business wasn't any worse than what was being done in the market.</p></speech>

It was the first year that EBS was going to be reporting losses.  Clearly, it was very evident that the development finance book in particular was causing significant damage.  We had an AGM that was coming up in April and there was a very strong view amongst the board that as a mutual it was absolutely appropriate that we should be showing accountability.</p><p>The chairman was going to resign and we felt that it wasn't fair, if I can put it that way, that solely a non-executive would bear responsibility.  We didn't think it made sense for wider board changes.  We thought the chairman going was a clear indication of and acknowledgement of the mistakes that were made.  But we also felt that an executive should go as well.  This led up to that but this is more of a nuance because this is solely dealing with the board.  And Bank of Ireland adopted the same approach.  Their executive directors were not put up for re-election to their board but they stayed in their current positions.</p></speech>

You've heard Richie Boucher from Bank of Ireland talk about that's what he wanted to do and he was allowed do that.  There's a natural desire to stay when one is in trouble and sort things out.  But the wider context - and I was part of the board and I very much agreed with this - we were a mutual, mistakes had been made, we wanted to be different, we believed we were different and we wanted to demonstrate that.  So it was absolutely part of the EBS to show accountability.  And I was definitely the right person to go at executive level.</p></speech>

The board came up with a very considered view.  It went through the detailed analysis and it came up with a very considered view, "No,  we're not selling out, we want to stay mutual, we're going to make it work.  Management, we want you to make this work.  You've a mandate to go and make it work."  So we put ... we'd had that debate.  I wasn't the bad loser.  I accepted the board's decision.  And what the strategy then was about was trying to preserve mutuality as best we could.  So there weren't battles going on in the boardroom in '08.</p></speech>

I just want to look at two other areas then, if I may, in the time I have left.  One is this reliance on wholesale funding.  Because in 1998 100% of funding for the society came from retail deposits.  In 2001 it's down to 70%.  By 2008 it's 47%.  Was this shift intentional?  Did the board see it as a risk at the time?  Did they understand the potential risks at the time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-29a.240" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Alan Merriman" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072900002#P01500"><p>Look, I think the start of it clearly was that wholesale funding became available to the market here.  You know, EU, euro would have all been part, would have been a catalyst for that.  Why did the society start seeking wholesale funding?  Because it needed it to support the lending it was doing to its members.  And then it just gradually grew over time.  I think that's evident from all the papers and from the history.  It grew over the course of time, bit by bit by bit.  Was the board conscious of the risks around wholesale?  It was conscious that there was a dependency on wholesaling ... on wholesale funding.  It was very conscious of the need to diversify it.  But it probably didn't anticipate - and I think this is true right across our own market, but globally - that a liquidity crisis of the type that came was as possible as it clearly was.</p></speech>

The interbank market disappearing pretty much overnight would be a very clear example of that.  Did the board have a view ... did it really understand those possibilities and did it really believe those could happen?  They would have seen that as being more doomsday than being in the probable.</p></speech>

I have to move on, I'm afraid, because I am limited on time.  Just the last thing I want to look at is Haven, the broker market business that EBS went into, which was a significant change for the  society.  Do you think the board had a sufficient understanding of what it was getting into?  And how important was this move to the society, given that the CEO of Haven was also not invited to be re-elected to the board in 2008?</p></speech>

If I can maybe just move then to the period subsequently after the guarantee, Mr. Merriman.  And in November 2008 the treasury department looked for an increase in the lending lines to the other covered banks in order to invest in their unsecured debt and to have them reciprocate the same.  This is the, kind of, green jersey thing.  And on the screen there in the first two chapters, what we have there, this is an e-mail to the board from Mr. Gerry Murray, 17 November 2008 &quot;<b>Subject: Proposal to Increase Credit Limits [to] Irish Bank[s]</b>&quot;.  And the first two paragraphs kind of give a summary of the situation:</p> <blockquote> 	On September 30th, 2008 the Irish Government announced that it would guarantee Irish Banks / Building Societies until September 2010 under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 (the &quot;Scheme&quot;) [as it's known].  Subsequently, Moody's and [Standard and Poor] announced that they would rate any debt issued under the Scheme and maturing prior to September 2010 as AAA-backed.  </blockquote> <p>That's top of the range, isn't it?  It doesn't come any higher than that, yes? </p></speech>

Integral to the success of the debt offering [...] is support from the domestic market. i.e. the banks will need to purchase significant quantities of each others bonds. </blockquote> <p>So this is ... this is a direction that Irish banks will start borrowing money from one another after the guarantee and securing bonds or borrowing bonds and everything else ... &quot;Consequently, EBS Building Society will need to purchase debt issued by the [...] Irish institutions in order to get sufficient support to successfully issue a benchmark transaction of [its] own.&quot;  So the suggestion there ... you start buying from other banks, that allows other banks to start buying from you.  I'm correct there, yes?</p></speech>

Can I just bring up there, a slide here, okay?  The next document coming up, Mr. Merriman, relates to its EBS Building Society minutes of the board meeting held on 17 November 2008.  So, it's the minute relating to the same date of the earlier transaction.  And if I can just bring you to the second column to the right and just take you down some of the language here:</p> <blockquote> 	Fidelma Clarke outlined the basis of two proposals in relation to Treasury limits and programmes arising from the implementation of the Government Guarantee Scheme.  Papers had been circulated prior to the meeting. </blockquote> <p>And then talks about the counterparty limits of the institutions that EBS now would engage with as part of this cross transactions:</p> <blockquote> 	The Board resolved to<br /><br />(a) increase the counterparty credit limits for AIB, Anglo, Bank of Ireland, IL&amp;amp;P and INBS to &euro;200m, with the quantum increase above credit limits exclusively available for issuance covered under the terms and period of the government guarantee scheme. </blockquote> <p>I just want to refer to two institutions there.  We have it on record here that the NTMA had such concerns with regard to Irish Nationwide ... INBS, that they wouldn't put a brass farthing into them and wouldn't do so for years.  And at Anglo Irish Bank, that the NTMA had similar concerns about and wouldn't ... would only put money in there when they actually received direction from the Minister for Finance in writing to do so.  Had you any concerns with putting money into INBS or Anglo?</p></speech>

So, again, if I'm very precise on dates, this board minute is clearly, clearly in the context of the Government guarantee regime and therefore the reality is that while we're lending to those institutions, it's covered by the sovereign.  And as an Irish building society operating in a stressed Irish banking context, it would have been very questionable had EBS not been supportive of this programme at that point in time.  In other words, not being prepared to take risk on our own sovereign when our own sovereign was supporting the Irish banks and supporting EBS directly.  So I think the context is very clear.</p></speech>

These programmes are short-term programmes and we would have taken the comfort ... and again, look, you know, I say this in the context of what's happened, you know, all senior ... this was senior debt.

However, it has reinforced in me an understanding of and a commitment to the need to implement the Corporate Governance Standards set out in the Combined Code in the [EBS] Building Society. </blockquote> <p>And then he goes on to talk about the society &quot;slowly and painfully emerging from a legacy Building Society governance culture&quot;.  What was Mr. Magee talking about there being &quot;corporately bullied&quot; to use his term?</p></speech>

So this was about relations around the board, so all non-executives and a number of executives.  So how would those executives dealing ... between each other in relation to these matters, that's what Cathal is drawing out.  So look, maybe to help I would say to you there is a very clear distinction between corporate governance and structures and systems on one hand and on the other hand, conduct of individuals around the board table.  You can have very strong corporate governance, you can have good systems, good processes - as E and Y attested here that EBS had in their opinion - and, separately, you can have conduct and conduct can be different.  It is personality driven, etc., etc.  So the conduct around the board amongst certain individuals was considered to be not appropriate and that's what Cathal is drawing out here.</p></speech>

In Vol. 3 of the core documents on page 59 is the statement, the witness statement of Ms Ethna Tinney.  She talks here about ... on page 59 at the bottom of paragraph 1, and she is talking about the appropriateness of property relating lending strategies and risk appetite, and she says "There was a sort of feeding-frenzy as the banks clambered over one another to get a piece of the action, especially as new foreign banks had entered the market as competitors."  At the beginning of that paragraph she says "Lending large sums to developers was new to the society." and she said "The senior management in EBS, as in most of the lending institutions, were taken in by Ireland's so-called developers and also by their professional and other advisors."  Mr. Murphy said in evidence last week "there was a ... reasonable chance of the organisation making it through, had they not been involved in all of that" and by "all of that", he meant commercial property and land and development.  So what was going on?  I mean, Ms Tinney's observation is that this was new to the society and it was a kind of a frenzy as banks clambered over each other and she goes on to discuss how the senior management were asked to review credit applications and so on, and I'll come to that, but I wonder what your first observation is of that?</p></speech>

In relation to Ethna's - and I understand she is here later this morning and, therefore, you can ask her directly - but I am guessing that ...  she started with EBS I think in the year 2000, so five years prior to my own joining the society.  So I would suggest that perhaps she is talking about the step up into development finance in 2001 ... was new at that point in time and that was recently after her joining the society.  And, you know, as I said, the development finance book in EBS started in 2001 and was stepped up to &euro;500 million by the end of 2008 so that is an eight-year period.  In relation to Mr. Murphy's comment-----</p></speech>

She does go on in the next paragraph to say:</p> <blockquote> 	In the period from December 2006 to April 2007 I was inundated via email by proposals from EBS senior management on behalf of &quot;developers&quot; for quantities of cash in the tens of millions which appeared to be asset-backed and also to contain personal guarantees.  [So, typically] as a member of the credit committee, your approval or lack of it had to be sent ... by email to EBS by close of business the same day or the next day.  The rationale was that if EBS did not facilitate the &quot;developer&quot; another bank would and we would simply be losing out on the business. </blockquote></speech>

You were also a member of the board, I am asking do you share that view of what happened in EBS at that time?</p></speech>

So, I have explained that Ethna joined, I believe in 2000, she can confirm that later, development finance started in 2001, that explains why she said it was new to society.  In terms of the specific question that you are asking me, my recollection is that Ethna moved on to the board advances committee, which is the committee of the board that approves loans beyond a certain size.  I am guessing that was perhaps in this time period December 2006 to April 2007 and that's the committee amongst the board members that gets individual loan documents to approve if the society wishes to do it.  So that would have been new to Ethna at that point, not new to the society but new to Ethna at that particular point in time.  And in terms of her being inundated, look, that's a subjective comment.</p></speech>

It is the end of a long process of working through a loan application.  It is the ultimate safeguard.  It is beyond a certain &euro;10 million level.  We are not going to allow the executive to give this loan out without a further check coming from the board of non-executive directors as an additional precaution.  And in doing that, the society understands if it is going to compete in this market, it needs to be able to provide the type of service that is expected.  So therefore, we need to give a 24-hour period.  Those members who sat on that committee fully understood that requirement and the need for them to be able to be available to give the consideration that would be needed within that timeframe and they would have got very detailed documents to help them support their agreeing or not agreeing to make those individual loans.</p></speech>

Could you bring up book 1, page 125 to 128 please?  Mr. Merriman, was consideration given to the fact that during the period of substantial growth, '04 to '08, that other banks in the Irish market were seeing double-digit growth?  And was it possible that all banks could achieve the same level of double-digit growth within the jurisdiction?  Could every bank be having those levels of growth and would the market not be destabilised by that quantity of growth?</p></speech>

My simple answer to your question would be, you know, of course you can have high-teen growth or mid-twenty growth across the market and all participants can enjoy that if the market itself is growing in sync with that.  If the market is not growing and people are trying to get 5%, 10%, 15% growth, there is going to be winners and losers.  But if the market as a whole is growing then that can be accommodated and it is very driven by where you are in the cycle and what is going on in the market at that point in time.</p></speech>

It would suggest or would it suggest that the level of lending was carefully planned and that each institution had an objective to achieve its market share?  Can I ask the question: was that a risky strategy by all of the banks, all of the financial institutions?</p></speech>

And as I have testified in my witness statement - and I think many people have testified here - the very, very broad consensus was that the market was going to continue to be growing, albeit slowing, and that the demographics and the economics of the country as a whole were going to be supported.</p></speech>

I think he very clearly articulated, and I think it's true, tone is very much set at the top and, therefore, has a cascading-down impact.  But I also think - and this is probably the most important point - the circumstances were very different, so the strategy and the changes were being driven by what was happening in the market and our read of the market at that point in time.  And as I've clearly articulated and explained earlier, EBS as a whole in the management team, at a much earlier point, had concerns and was already beginning to address the strategy and change things accordingly.  Fergus's arrival certainly helped in that regard and it did accelerate because it was a new chief executive, and that helped, but it certainly ... enabled by him, but not exclusive to him.</p></speech>

Well, it was full employment, as we all understand what we mean by full employment.  The economy was booming.  House completions were going up.  We had a lot of immigration into the country because of the job flow here.  PwC were literally scouring the world, trying to find people to come into this market, to service the business and the business that we had at that point in time.  It was a very, very strong economy and the immediate outlook in 2005 continued to be good.  I would articulate that it was late '06-early '07 before there were strong indicators that there could be trouble ahead and, again, I'll be very clear that, even post the crisis, in late 2009 and 2010, many commentators believed that the worst was over and the truth was things got substantially worse in 2010 and 2011.</p></speech>

I'd be interested in knowing, but, clearly, it grew substantially and, to answer your earlier question in this context, I would say ... you know, if you have a ... let me use very simple numbers ... if you have a &euro;20 billion balance sheet and &euro;10 billion of it is funded by wholesale funding, that is not something you deal with or change overnight.  You've a &euro;20 billion balance sheet of assets; &euro;10 billion of it is coming from wholesale markets; it takes many, many, many years to try and change that needle.</p></speech>

"accommodative" would be the word.  And I think the market, as a whole, totally understood that.  Why did those changes happening?  I'll give you a very simple example.  We go back to what I call traditional building society lending.  People would get 20-year mortgages.  Well, 20-year mortgages became 25-year mortgages.  Then they became 30-year mortgages.

Why was that done?  It was done, in part, because demand; people wanted to be able to access greater funding so they could get their houses.  And it was accommodated because there was a rationale too, "Well, if you're 20 years of age, why shouldn't you be able to borrow for 35 years?"  It clearly ended up, at a macro level, being bad because all it did was inflate house prices etc., etc., but they're the type of changes that were accommodated during that period.</p></speech>

From a process perspective, from a talent perspective, from a control perspective, I brought in numerous changes to strengthen the processes and the governance and so forth, but from a credit perspective, if a credit policy was approved at EBS board level, I personally would have been satisfied that it was supported and it was appropriate at that point in time.</p></speech>

But ... and, again ... no, look, you know, EBS got lots of things of wrong, it got lots of things right as well.  The whole area of pricing of mortgages ... if you look at our book as an ... in aggregate, proportionally, compared to the other banks, we had very, very little by way of tracker mortgages.  We had a lot of people in fixed rate and we had them in fixed rate because we felt that was the prudent thing to do.  Typically, around five-year ... it affected stress testing as well but it gave them certainty.  A bit like my own arrival into EBS and my own package, having visibility about what your expenses would be ... very, very helpful in terms of assessing credit.  So we steered people more towards fixed rate and the standard variable rate for those reasons.</p></speech>

I would go as far to say we were encouraged to expand and become more commercial."  In fact, at the start of that statement you'd referenced the regulator and Fitch and Moody's and a number of other bodies.  Who was encouraging you?  Because you seem to be indicating there that it's an external encouragement rather than an internal encouragement.</p></speech>

So obvious candidates being the rating agencies, obvious candidates being the people who are lending you money, obvious candidates being the ... the regulator.  So, you know, in sharing our strategies and sharing our business plans with all those parties, what was the reaction?  What feedback were we getting?  I'm being very clear, nobody - and I will say nobody - ever said, "Do you know what?  Ted, Alan, Mark, Fergus, we really think that's not very clever.'  In fact, I'm saying the opposite.  I'm saying, "Do you know what guys?  That makes very good sense.  Yes, that doesn't give us a problem from a rating perspective and our particular A rating.  Yes, we see the sense of you diversifying away from your mortgage book.  Yes, we can see that the margins are under strain and, yes, of course it makes sense that you would diversify your business and have your non-member business.  Yes, it makes sense to have a member business and a non-member business because we can see how it's circular."  That's what I'm trying to explain.</p></speech>

I want refer to core document 2 ... Vol. 2, sorry, page 37, which is a letter from the Financial Regulator to Mr. Murphy, managing director, on 3 March 2008.  It should be up on the screen, I'd say, momentarily.  It says "Copy to Emer, Brian, Fidelma, Alan [who, I presume, is yourself] [and] Grant."  It's a result of an inspection process.  There's an interesting comment on the third paragraph where it says "The Financial Regulator's inspection process is a high level review and does not constitute a detailed examination or audit.", which, perhaps, may well have been the case.  I want to specifically reference page number 43 ... it's a review of a number of files - loans, effectively - and issues that have been spotted by the regulator and a number of comments by them on those issues.  The last comment at the bottom of page 43, should be up in a second.  Is it?  You have it anyway, yes?</p></speech>

Over the page, page 44, second box, point No. 3, "The purpose of the &euro;4m loan changed after approval - it is not clear to inspectors how the &euro;3m funds advanced will be utilised (&euro;1m being used to acquire US Property)."

I want to be very clear ... very plain language - "The Financial Regulator's inspection process is a high level review and does not constitute a detailed examination or audit."

And that was clearly done to the satisfaction of the regulator because there was no subsequent correspondence on the matter.  The third thing I'd say is - and I think it's an important point in terms of giving you some personal insights - when we talk about the regulator, and in this case we're talking about the Financial Regulator here, there's many different components of the regulator.  So there's the Pat Neary level, there's the head of the banking division level, there's teams that might do a thematic review of "know your customer", or there's an inspector who's doing a very detailed review, regardless of the wording, of the loan files.  So my broad insight to you would be ... look, I can completely understand that somebody reads this cold and they go "Jesus, what's going on here?"  Completely get that.  What I will say to you, candidly, is that unfortunately the practice amongst the regulator was they'd come in and they would do these reviews, they wouldn't engage properly in terms of getting clarity while on site and then they would then send very detailed questions to have clarification.  But, much more importantly, I'd be standing back and I'd be saying "Okay, look, this level of inspection was going on but where were the dots being joined up so that, at a higher level, the regulator would be coming in saying "Do you know what?  I get it, that there's a passport where the photograph isn't legible.  And that's not great.  But do you know what?  I don't need to talk about that.  What I want to talk about is your development finance.  And what I want to talk about is that you've got 33% of your book is funded only by retail deposits.".''  That's what was needed in terms of macro-regulatory intervention.  That's where the regulator needed to be.  When we talk about 100% mortgages, it's not about on an individual case whether an institution was doing it or not or why it was doing it-----</p></speech>

And, again, just be very stark: all of these findings, as extensive as they are, not one of them is rated a high priority.  And even the ones that are there are rated a medium priority.

And, Mr. Merriman, just to clarify, from the board minute meetings in March 2007, the regulator expressed concern that you were responsible for both the commercial business and the risk function.  Why did ... why did the regulator express that concern and what was the reaction from the board then?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-29a.454" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Alan Merriman" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072900002#U00100"><p>Okay.  And I think this deserves a full response.  First of all, when I joined EBS, it wasn't intended that risk would be under my remit.  At that point in time, there was a director who had that responsibility at board level.  They resigned shortly after my arrival and after, you know, consideration, the chief executive and the board asked whether I would take on the responsibility of risk along with my other responsibilities.  So that's how it evolved, and that was pre-cleared with the regulator at that point.  So we had an explicit discussion with the regulator.</p></speech>

We would have written to them.  They would have written back to us confirming their acceptance of the appropriateness at that time of my taking on that responsibility.  Now, I just want to be very clear because, you know, there's this observation by others that EBS didn't have a chief risk officer and it didn't have a chief risk officer on a stand-alone basis reporting to the board or the chief executive.  And in somehow or some way, that has contributed, in a meaningful way, to what transpired.  Now, again, let me deal with the facts.  Yes, it didn't have a stand-alone chief risk officer, but it had a head of risk, and you'll be meeting them later today.  And that head of risk reported to me but they also had visibility at board level and they had their arms completely around risk but in an EBS context.  So what I'm trying to say is that the question of there being a layer between the head of risk and the chief executive or a layer between the head of risk and the board, in my view, was unhelpful in terms of a post mortem, because, clearly, it would have been better to have a single individual at board level solely responsible for risk, but I actually don't think it made a meaningful difference.  And, again, just to give that some objective analysis, two things I'd say - look at all the other banks who did happen to have a stand-alone chief risk officer reporting to the board, and I don't think they ended up in a different position.  And, ultimately, I'd say - and I think again it's a corporate governance matter - ultimately, the chief risk officer of any organisation is not the head of risk, is not the head of finance; it's the chief executive and the board collectively.</p></speech>

I'm sorry about that; that's where that came from.  Time is up.  I don't know where that came from, Deputy.  I'm going to wrap things up.  Something that struck me this morning when you were talking, Mr. Merriman, and as you go along the journey, you sometimes forget the obvious, and that the EBS was set up to assist teachers to buy homes and that's the start of the journey of the EBS's establishment. That was its <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>, that was its client base, and it grew out of that.  I'm correct in that regard?  And at the very end of the story, the affordability for the teacher to be able to buy a home was possibly gone beyond their affordability, certainly as a teacher.</p></speech>

It had a lot of engagement with members, it did a lot of surveys, and the feedback was still very strong that the members wanted EBS to preserve.  They wanted EBS to continue and the client ... you know, the satisfaction surveys and all that ... and, ultimately, at the end of the day, EBS was still able to provide mortgages to its members at competitive rates during those times.  So EBS evolved but it still was serving members.  It still was fulfilling a need.</p></speech>

Today we continue our hearings with Ms Ethna Tinney, former independent non-executive director EBS.  Ms Tinney was appointed non-executive director in December 2000.  She was a member of the board audit and compliance committee from 2001 to 2005, she was transferred to the board credit committee in mid-2005.  In 2007 she was voted off the board by members of the EBS at the AGM.  In 2008 she was voted back on the board by the members and was a member of the board risk committee until May 2011.  Ms Tinney, you are very welcome before the committee.</p></speech>

If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room and to assist the smooth running of the inquiry we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.</p><p>The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee and will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  So with that said, if I can now ask the clerk to administer the affirmation to Ms Tinney please.</p></speech>

To quality of the business model setting process, there was no such process as the business model had been set prior to my joining the board.  In 1985, when I wanted to buy a house, the rules of EBS were clear.  Ninety percent of the purchase price was the maximum you could borrow and two and a half times your salary.  If you had a spouse or overtime, half of what each of these brought in annually could be added.  Documentation had to be produced to verify applications.  All Irish banks had similar rules.  By the time I joined the board of the society 15 years later, in December 2000, those rules had been abandoned, not just by EBS but by most, if not all, lending institutions.  Mortgage applicants&rsquo; declared incomes were sometimes well in excess of reality and up to six times the applicant salary was approved.</p> <p>  This happened gradually as the price of houses went out of the financial reach of most people, had the old rules still applied.  I paid up to 14% per annum on the mortgage I held from 1985 to 1996 but, in the new euro scenario, interest rates had plunged which seemed to even out the risk.  The risk of jobs being lost was not factored in, largely due to the country&rsquo;s booming economy.</p><p>The induction to my new role as an EBS non-executive director was pleasant.  The staff were delightful and the managers who explained their processes to me, equally so.  However, I was uneasy when I was introduced to the idea of securitisation.  In simple terms this is a way of packaging up mortgages into an asset and selling them on to a new layer of investors, who agree to pay a percentage of the nominal value of the loans in return for an agreed interest so that their money can be lent on again for new mortgages.  It is ingenious in its way, as it is a system that seems to offer limitless working capital for a lending institution.  But there is nothing to stop the new investors selling on their asset at a profit, and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>.  Viewed that way, it has the look of a pyramid scheme and all depends on the original mortgages continuing to be serviced and becoming more expensive for the mortgagees.  I could not get the image out of my head of a shark eating its own entrails.  As time went by I became ever more doubtful of the fundamental banking concept of loans as assets and indeed of debts in any business as assets.  The only asset that reassures me is something I can control and I cannot control the repayment of debt owed to me.<br/><br/>To adequacy of board oversight over internal controls, managed and monitored: unfortunately, this proved inadequate, which became apparent when the board of EBS was finally advised that an employee in the treasury department had illicitly engaged in proprietary trading strictly against the rules of the society.  Strangely, this same employee had been previously present with his manager at a board meeting when non-executive directors had probed the possibility of just such an illicit trade being made.  The board was reassured at the time by the executive directors that such a thing could not happen because of so-called &ldquo;back-room controls&rdquo;.  These evidently failed and EBS sustained a significant loss.  Similar scenarios unfold in other banks all over the world from time to time.  But far more damaging was the decision by the board to sell the headquarters in Westmoreland Street owned by the society in order to transfer to a rented premises in Burlington Road.  Over time it became apparent that this was a catastrophe and the full board did not have oversight of the implications of the decision.<br/><br/>To appropriateness of property-related lending strategies and risk appetite: lending large sums to developers was new to the society.  The senior management in EBS, as in most of the lending institutions, were taken in by Ireland&rsquo;s so-called developers and also by their professional and other advisers.  So were the members of the board, including me.  The belief that there were substantial profits to be made for the society from these developments led us to emulate our peers, although we had been cautious about joining the bandwagon.  There was a sort of feeding frenzy as the banks clambered over one another to get a piece of the action, especially as new foreign banks had entered the market as competitors.<br/><br/>To appropriateness of credit policies, delegated authorities and exception management: and here there is an anomaly, Chairman, which I just want to clarify.  In your opening introduction, you correctly said that it was actually in mid-2005 that I was put on the credit committee.  My memory was faulty there and this affects what I have to say.  I was actually taken off the BAC in mid-2005 and put on to the credit committee instead.</p></speech>

Thank you very much Ms Tinney.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-29a.521" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ethna Tinney" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072900002#Y00300"><p>In the period from mid-2005 to April 2007, I was inundated via e-mail by proposals from EBS senior management on behalf of developers for quantities of cash in the tens of millions which appeared to be asset-backed and also to contain personal guarantees.  Typically, as a member of the credit committee, your approval or lack of it had to be sent also by e-mail to EBS by close of business the same day or the next day.  The rationale was that if EBS did not facilitate the developer, another bank would and we would simply be losing out on the business.  All these proposals seemed fail-safe.  It did occur to me many times that the EBS credit committee should be meeting about each of these large proposals but my colleagues on the committee seemed happy to do the business this way, and as I had clashed with the majority of the board over several matters at this stage I had no appetite for further confrontation.<br/><br/>To adequacy of the incentive and remuneration arrangements to promote sound risk governance: the bonus system in banks is crazy.  You get a bonus for lending money out.  There is no incentive to get it back in.  Such a system encourages greed and recklessness.  It is no wonder that banks go bust from time to time.<br/><br/>To appropriateness of the bank guarantee decision: probably until the last syllable of recorded time, this will be argued by politicians, economists and journalists.  My personal view as a citizen of the Republic of Ireland, perhaps to some extent influenced by hindsight, is that it was indefensible for the Government in September 2008 to in effect yield the sovereignty of this country in order to shore up a banking system that is entirely of and for itself and will never change.  I do accept, however, that many grave problems would have arisen if one or more banks had failed and that the full extent of the bad debts were not known at the time.<br/><br/>To analysis and consideration of the response to contrarian views: I incorporate below in italics a letter I insisted on sending to the members of EBS in advance of the annual general meeting in 2007, 29 March that year:</p> <blockquote> 	<i>Dear Member,</i><br /><br /><i>Your EBS 2006 Summary Statement contains on the Notice of Annual General Meeting the following words:</i><br /><br /><i>&ldquo;Ethna Tinney retires in accordance with the Society&rsquo;s Rules and offers herself for re-election. </i><i>(Members should be aware that the Society&rsquo;s Board of Directors does not support Ms Tinney&rsquo;s re-election as a Director)&rdquo;</i><br /><br /><i>There are three reasons why the Board does not support my re-election.</i><br /><br /><i>In the years 2003 and 2004 the Board was intent on pursuing a deal with a foreign bank.  This deal was characterised by the executive as a bold transformational play.  I saw it as selling the family silver without giving the money to the family -  you, the members.  I opposed the deal from first to last.  Ultimately the deal collapsed, but not before millions of euro of your money had been spent pursuing it.</i><br /><br /><i>In 2005 the Society advertised for new non-executive directors.  I was a member of the Nominations Committee.  Ten candidates were shortlisted through an external recruitment process.  All ten were vetoed without any reference to me.  I objected in the strongest possible terms.  Last December I was removed from the Nominations Committee.</i><br /><br /><i>In 2006 the Board fractured over corporate governance.  Three members, including me, became unhappy about aspects of senior executive remuneration and the payment of a multi-million euro sum into the </i><i>Senior Manager&rsquo;s Pension Fund without reference to the Board.</i><br /><br /><i>Am I right or wrong to oppose matters which appear to me to be against the interests of you, the members?  If you believe that independent judgement exercised without fear or favour is a good thing on your Board then come to the AGM on April 16th or send your proxy to arrive not later than April 9th at EBS Building Burlington Road Dublin 4 and re-elect me.</i> </blockquote> <p>This letter does not mention that I had repeatedly raised concerns about the size of mortgages we were lending to people.  Nor does it detail my explosive response at a meeting in early 2007 to a proposal by the executive to get involved in sub-prime lending.  A non-executive director colleague told me in front of the board that my response was &ldquo;intemperate&rdquo;, although the sub-prime industry in the US was already beginning to implode.  Contrarian views were not tolerated on the board of the society.<br/><br/>To appropriateness of the relationships between Government, the Oireachtas, the banking sector and the property sector: I have never had a relationship with any member of the Government nor the Oireachtas nor the property sector.  I do not golf, do not visit tents at racecourses and am not invited to dinners.  But my sense, as a citizen of Ireland and as a director of EBS for nine years, is that there is a deeply unhealthy relationship between all four.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I wish to emphasise that this witness statement refers specifically to my time as a non-executive director on the board of EBS in the period December 2000 to April 2007 when I was removed from it.  By the time I was re-elected onto it in 2008 there had been many changes to its composition and a new chief executive officer had been appointed.  Sadly, it emerged during the next three years that EBS was irrecoverable.  I retired from the board at the end of my third three-year term in May 2011.</p></speech>

And when I decided to do that, I was not particularly concerned with the founding ethos of EBS.  I had had my mortgage with them from '85 to '96 so, therefore, I was familiar with how they liked to do things but I didn't delve into the history of EBS, to be honest with you.</p></speech>

And there was a sense that we were getting left behind as a lending institution, particularly with a view to INBS, which was the Irish Nationwide Building Society which was referenced quite frequently at board meetings by management.  There was a sense that we were becoming a minnow as INBS expanded its lending and started to post profits that were up to five times the profits we were posting.  And I think it wasn't so much strategic but a competitive urge, a wish to compete and I'm not sure that there was ... I don't recall any heart searching about why we would move from being what you might call, an old-fashioned small building society/bank, into trying to compete with ... in a more voracious arena of-----</p></speech>

Would that be a similar situation?</p></speech>

These would contain a lot of power presentations printed out that management were going to then take the board through during the meeting.  So what would ensue was that you would have read these papers and yet the relevant manager would spend maybe an hour and a quarter actually taking you through all the frames again.  And the net result of this was that if you had two or three presentations like that, the board meeting was over.  So I began to realise that we were not talking to each other in the absence of management about the thrust of where these proposals were going.  These proposals were managerial proposals-----</p></speech>

They seem to be high levels of profits in a mature market.

There were other people on the board who had a much deeper understanding of the financials, in the sense that they were part of the financial industry, okay?  And, therefore, yes, of course, you know, I would look at these figures and it didn't happen just in, say, 2005 for three years.  Every year, we would be presented by the chief executive with the most seductive, is the word I would use again, seductive suggestions about profitability and growth.</p></speech>

So, basically by, I think it's 2005, it's in Alan Merriman's statement, 75% of our funding was coming from what they like to call "wholesale funding" and only 25% from retail deposits.  So, I mean, that is a colossal change, an absolute, you know, a colossal change and the problem about it was was that this absolutely fuelled what happened with the housing boom and the prices of houses because there was unlimited funds available to the banks to lend out you know.  You package your mortgages, you sell that as an asset, you know, you get money in, you make more mortgages, you package them and so on.</p></speech>

And I'm thinking about, say, 2001, 2002 when this really started to rock and roll that the ... we were assured by treasury that anybody whose mortgage was in the pool - they were called, "Emerald", in EBS so Emerald 3, Emerald 4, Emerald 5 - would be notified that this is what was going to happen to their mortgage and if they had an objection, to object.</p></speech>

But it would affect the decision that EBS would make about the variable rates that it was going to impose because the relationship between let's say, the vulture funds - they weren't all vulture funds - that would invest in these things was not directly with the mortgage holders.  As far as the mortgage holders were concerned, their relationship was still with EBS.</p></speech>

We owned Westmoreland Street, okay?  We had owned it for years and years and years and not only was it our headquarters, but it was our most important branch because of the footfall, the number of people who would use it and all that kind of thing.  It was a real asset for EBS.  Now the rationale for selling it, which didn't happen by the way, for years.  It lay empty for years.  That was one of the things that we hadn't thought through as a board was that we were now doing the very opposite of what EBS had been set up in the first place to do.  We were selling our home to move into rented accommodation.  The rented accommodation was a very, very fancy building in Burlington Road, which never had a branch, okay?  Although it was mooted to open a branch in the early stages.  Again, one of the seductive processes of getting the board to agree to this 25-year lease, by the way 25-year lease on this building, state-of-the-art building.  We were involved with the builder.  I am not going to say who it is because I-----</p></speech>

We were involved in that we were lending the money to build the building but we were also going to become the tenant.  So it was wheels within wheels and a deal within a deal and an awful lot of the implications of this didn't become apparent.  I also recall a long-standing difficulty where the board had said, ''We don't need all this accommodation.  We don't need it all'', and in order to seduce us - I keep using that word, but it was a seductive technique -  to agree to it, we were told that the 4th floor would be leased out and we would make so much money, you know, on the leasing of that, subleasing, to some other tenant.  That never happened and I doubt that management ever intended that to happen, yes.</p></speech>

I think that the bank ... private banking system is unbridled capitalism and, to that extent, because ... and because it's become so enormous and because the waves go out around it with more and more financial institutions trying to take little nibbles - and that's what I mean about the shark eating its own entrails - so that the end products are that much more expensive for those of us who have to pay for it, that this is actually leading to the situation that we all know of, you know, inequality stretching, stretching, stretching.

I think people were just so busy.  I think that that was a driver of that, you know.  Very often young people, they would both be working, you know, and had they endeavoured to get a home they nearly, you know, always were.  And, therefore, it was much easier to go to a broker who would facilitate getting your mortgage, take a lot of the paperwork off the hands of the applicants-----</p></speech>

And I felt that this was not right.  Because I felt that this ... if this was what the chief executive officer ... chief executive, CEO, we'll just say CEO ... if this was what he wanted, he should come forward and say so clearly.  So, once again, when this suggestion was put by one of the senior managers at the board meeting ... and I always remember what that person said, "There's money to be made in sub-prime."  And that's when I exploded.  And I said, "And there's an awful lot of money to be lost [right] in sub-prime."  And then I turned to the CEO and I said, "And if this goes up in flames, it's you who I am going to blame and not your senior manager who's proposed this."</p></speech>

What I ... what happened was - and I've tried to find this document but I can't - that, it was indicated to me that my re-election ... not so much that my re-election wouldn't be supported, but just, "Would you please stand down?".  I was required by the chairman to stand down, and I said I wouldn't.  And because I had the right, as a sitting director, to nominate myself, I didn't have to get any support.  And, at that stage, I think either the chairman suggested to me or I suggested to him, I said, "Can I put my case to the board?  I would like to do that".  And that happened shortly afterwards, so it was during January.</p></speech>

It would ... yes, it was just after that that I was informed that I was, maybe, surplus to requirements.  So, I asked if I could address the board.  And, naturally, I put a lot of effort into the address that I made, which was about ten minutes or 15 minutes, to try to explain my position, my contrarian position, if you like, on various items.  I was listened to attentively but everybody's eyes were down, which is ... you know, I knew what was going to happen.  And then I was asked to leave the room so that they ... the board could discuss it.  And it was ... and I went home.  And, minutes are a very interesting thing about ... on boards, but we won't get sidetracked or we could talk about that forever.  But it was minuted, and it turned out that one member of the board had voted that my election should be supported, or my nomination should be supported.  Just one, yes.</p></speech>

And, again, without, really, any backup from anybody, because I was the only person who resented it.  And I resented it purely because there was never any member proposition, let alone that the members weren't going to be given any money, but that there was no proposition ever tabled for them.  So, you know, we were just talking about money and what would happen between Rabo and EBS.</p></speech>

I was clear about it, but the general sense was shared by several members of the board that this was all happening too fast.  There were far ... it was far too much changing, far too quickly, and we can see that in the reality that, you know, the loan book grew from &euro;5 billion in 2002, well, just under &euro;6 billion, to just under &euro;16 billion.</p></speech>

That is what I meant by saying the banks are of and for themselves.  Can I put it like this - and this is the last colourful thing I will give you - it always seemed to me that the management in the bank and the non-executive directors were like cats and dogs.  The managers were the cats and the unfortunate non-executive directors were the dogs.  Natural enemies but the cats always outsmarted the dogs.  You can look at that paradigm for anything whether it's a regulator, a politician, a banker.  The fact of the matter is if people want to misbehave there is no way you can stop them - no way - and that is what worries me about the current scenario.  The only way you can change what is happening is if there is a change of sentiment and that's why I said earlier on in answer to Deputy Higgins that, yes, I really do have a difficulty with the capitalist system and I have a difficulty with our political system because it depends on ... well, you say funding, yes?  So I can't say that I have a methodology for saving the world but I think we all need to think about what is happening, that's all I can say.</p></speech>

In April 2011, Ms Tinney, when the Government decided to sell your society to AIB for &euro;1, did you agree with this move and did you or the board put any alternative suggestions to the authorities?</p></speech>

Was any consideration given to the fact that, during this period - this is the review plan from 2004 to 2008 now, this is - that a ... that other banks in the Irish market were also seeking double-digit growth?  In your own documentation, it was shown that the bank was going to have double-digit growth in its plan for that period and was it possible that all the banks could achieve their target growth?  In summary, what I'm asking, Ms Tinney, it's ... everybody had a plan to win the cup.</p></speech>

If you look at page 45 and page 47, they're actually identical, aren't they?  They're a reproduction of nominations committee meetings that were held first on 24 January and then on Thursday, 8 February when they had decided to, you know, whatever, get rid of me.  And the verbiage is this: "Ethna's performance as a Director has been formally independently adjudged to be well below average in the two formal board evaluations to date."  Now, will you go back to page 43?  And this adverts to January 2004, three years before.  And if you look at the re-election of Ethna Tinney, you will see these words: "Brian Joyce, chairman of the Board, reported on the outcome of his discussion with Ethna Tinney following receipt of the individual director evaluation (based on the evaluation forms completed by the other 10 directors and collated by Jim Bruce)."  So, the change in the verbiage is so significant, even though the two processes were exactly the same.  In other words, in 2004, the minutes are accurate.  Our evaluation consisted of being given a page and we had to fill in boxes, from one to five, of how we rated our colleagues under certain headings - attendance; punctuality; collegiality; business knowledge; you name it, it was in there - and of course the gas thing was, since you couldn't mark yourself, it was apparent long before it was collated by Jim Bruce, for anybody who wanted to study this information, who was writing what about whom.</p> <p>  The other corollary was that since it was done, to that extent, anomaly, you know, anybody could write any figure they liked about anybody else.  Now, I can accept that, provided you tell the truth, but fast-forward to 2007, to be well ... to be adjudged formally, independently adjudged to be well below average, that is simply a lie.</p></speech>

Oh yes, I had a look at them in retrospect, you know.  What I found ... no, no, these are quite familiar.  They would certainly have been passed by the board or by the remuneration committee as a board and then presented to the board.  The board didn't generally argue with the remuneration committee, but they are familiar.  I think what's odd about them is the variability of them, in a sense.  You know, why one year for Ted McGovern &euro;448,000 of a bonus and then the next year &euro;120,000 of a bonus?  It's interesting, particularly since the business was grown exponentially as we've just discussed.  So ... but yes, these are familiar.</p></speech>

So the actual length of time that the non-executives had together was limited.  I would also make the point that, although the executive directors withdrew, the chairman remained.  So in terms of a conversation that could become uncomfortable, let's say,  in terms of making a genuine, kind of, investigation between the non-execs into what they felt was going on and whether it was excessive or whatever, was impeded by the chairman.</p></speech>

And, therefore, I do think it's a fundamental weakness in business that there is this intimacy between a chairman and a chief executive.  And you can see very clearly from the documents in Vol. 1 about you know, the arguments between Ron Bolger, Cathal McGee and Brian Joyce, that Brian expresses his belief that there is no other way of working than, you know, close liaison with the chief executive officer.  But it does weaken the ability of non-executives to influence the board.</p></speech>

If we look at the board minutes of July 2005, which is on book 1, page 126.  The question that arises from them for me is: were you away of the extent of the tracker mortgage interest rate risk?

This is where the minutes show that the increase on tracker mortgages would account for an increase in proportion of business rising from 5%-----</p></speech>

And the volumes of tracker mortgages that, therefore, that we were attracting blinded us to the dangers of what would happen in terms of depressing the margin and so on and the final outcome, which meant that once again, we can't afford the tracker mortgages - well, not me, because I'm not involved anymore.</p><p>But the standard variable rate is now actually shoring up the trackers, which is most unfair on the people on the standard variable rate.  No, it is surprising that it didn't strike any of the good brains on the board that this was actually dangerous.</p></speech>

So, in other words, "You say your income is 48 grand, that's okay.  Yes, we'll accept ... show us a P60 or a ... [more likely] just a slip of your ... of your ... of your income but we'll take it on faith that you're actually earning this extra money that you say that you are."  Yes.</p></speech>

And the reason that we did it ... not that anybody would have ever verbalised that, but the reasons that we did it was that if ... if we actually said, "Look, show me your money", that the person wouldn't qualify for a mortgage for whatever house he or she wanted to buy and that, therefore, you know, our business would be, once again, eroded.  In other words, because of the fuel that was burning, the house boom and the bubble, as it turned out to be, there was acquiescence all round.  There was collusion, if you like.  Yes, unspoken collusion that we wanted to assist people to have homes.  So we're not going to ask too many hard questions.</p></speech>

And one final wee supplementary, because the Chair will cut me off, you also mention that you - through e-mail - rejected some of the loan applications.

To your earlier question about, you know, when is a personal guarantee not a personal guarantee?  Well, look, I ask you this question: how come all these bankrupt developers are rolling in money?  They all gave personal guarantees, not just to us but to other banks.  The banks didn't get money back, but they still have loads and loads of money.  Now, riddle me that.  I don't understand it.  I never saw the legal documentation on which these proposals were founded.  What I do know is that because the answers had to be made so fast was that ... I have absolutely no doubt that the proper lien was not perfected on many of these agreements.</p></speech>

And there's some more information on the following pages, 107-111.  So essentially this was a decision by the board to increase the lending lines to the other covered banks and it's in the aftermath of the Government decision on the bank guarantee.  And it seems to be to facilitate lending to each other, as such, you could buy bonds back and forth.  So to what extent in your opinion did the board consider at this time that it was appropriate to, in a sense, pull on the green jersey and invest in such assets from other banks?  What was the thinking behind it?</p></speech>

Obviously, the fact that the Government had decided to guarantee every smidgen of money that was in all the banks gave us the courage, you know, to do this, to change our view of what was safe.</p></speech>

Can I take you to, just on page 2 of your statement so on the system - it's 004, if that could be opened?  It's under the heading of the "Adequacy of board oversight over internal controls, managed and monitored".  And you refer to an instance where an employee in the treasury department of EBS had illicitly engaged in proprietary trading, strictly against the rules of the society.  And at the end of that paragraph you refer to EBS sustaining a significant loss.  Can you recall what the loss was from that event?</p></speech>

In other words, you can't take a gamble.  You can't decide you're going to take a gamble on currency or anything else or stocks and shares.  And this particular individual did that.  Now, as I said in my statement, it was supposed to be impossible because of the checks that went on.  But it wasn't impossible and he did it.  And he was a very smart guy and he wasn't doing it for himself.  So it's hard to understand why he actually took the risk.  Now, two of his colleagues knew what he had done but he managed to hide it for two years.  And eventually they couldn't stick the notion that this was going on any more.  He persuaded them that if he was given time, his position would come right and all would be well.  So after two years they told his boss and that's how it came out.  And one of the interesting things is, as well, that our auditors never spotted the hole in treasury.</p></speech>

So those were the three issues that you raised.  But you didn't raise any issues or concerns about the strategy, the commercial strategy of the building society at the time and the rapidly growing loan book in terms of commercial property, the land and development book.  You didn't raise any issues about that or the issue of the growing dependence on wholesale funding, for example, as opposed to deposits.  So can you just elaborate on that, given that you were undertaking a major exercise writing to all the members directly?  If you had these grave concerns about the direction of the society and its strategy, why didn't you take that opportunity to set those out to the members directly?</p></speech>

If you want to gain people's attention, you've got to tell them a story.  If I had written in vague terms about my anxieties about funding, about the size of mortgages and all that kind of thing, I didn't think I'd gain any traction whatsoever.  What I wanted to say was, "This is what I've done and this is what's happened to me as a result.  Therefore, all is not well in EBS".  And that's why I chose to do it anecdotally, rather than as a dissertation on the state of EBS.</p></speech>

I hope that your valuable work will add to the store of knowledge on this subject contained in the Regling and Nyberg reports and that lessons can be learned.  Chairman, I became leader of the Green Party in 2007 following the resignation of Trevor Sargent.  While we were the only party that based our 2007 election manifesto on a forecast of reduced growth, I don't think anybody in the party could have predicted that our term in government would coincide with the worst economic crisis that this country has ever had to endure.  The Green Party did not create the housing bubble but, in government, we had a duty to extricate our country from the crisis.  This involved making the most difficult political decisions that any small party in this State has ever had to make.  It is a fact that two thirds of what is known euphemistically as the &quot;fiscal adjustment&quot;, which led to the recovery, was made by the Green Party in government.  The Green Party TDs and Senators voted for these cutbacks and tax increases, convinced that this was the correct course of action, while also knowing that it would lead inevitably to electoral annihilation.  I&rsquo;m proud of the dignified way that the Greens conducted themselves during this time of adversity.  I&rsquo;m also proud of the fact that the Green Party insisted that every one of those austerity budgets was progressive.  In other words, each budget hit the wealthier members of our community proportionately harder than the less well-off.  This has been confirmed by subsequent studies of the various budgets by the ESRI.  This is not to imply that the cutbacks were painless; they were not.  Large sections of the Irish people suffered hugely because of the austerity measures and I regret that we were forced to make these decisions.  I believe our economic and financial problems were caused by a combination of factors, which include banking deregulation and poor oversight of the financial institutions, a property bubble fuelled by reckless lending practices and irresponsible land rezoning, huge increases in public spending, over-reliance on property and construction-related taxation, alongside inappropriate reductions in some taxes.  The globalisation of banking and interbank lending also led to a global domino effect.<br/><br/>I&rsquo;d like now to concentrate on one of the above subjects and one which is close to my own heart: the role of poor planning in our economic crisis.  Some of the inquiry members may be aware of the report published in July 2010 by NUI Maynooth titled, A Haunted Landscape: Housing and Ghost Estates in Post-Celtic Tiger Ireland.  It is a report that deserves the full attention of this committee.  Let me quote from the executive summary:</p> <blockquote> 	Government has two principle levers through which it can ... regulate property development.  The first is through fiscal policy with respect to regulating access to credit and determining taxation rates.  The second is through planning policy and the zoning of land and the granting of planning permissions.  Explanations of the Irish property bubble have focused almost exclusively on the former, and the role of the banks, tax incentive schemes, and the failures of financial regulators.  <b>To date, the role of the planning system in creating the property bubble has [not been] considered.</b> </blockquote> <p>The fact is, Chairman, that corrupt and irresponsible zoning practices did play a significant role in our economic crisis.  The above report asked that a commission of inquiry would look specifically at this matter.  That may not happen but you have the opportunity to examine it as part of your own inquiry.  During the so-called boom years, the Green Party representatives on local councils and in the D&aacute;il tried at every turn to highlight the problems of poor planning.  On entering Government, we resolved to introduce a more evidence-based and sustainable planning system.  As Minister, I enacted new planning legislation and intervened at local level in a number of cases of poor planning practice.  I also initiated a number of reviews of local planning following complaints and allegations by members of the public.  The Green Party also insisted on a windfall tax on the unearned benefit to landowners of rezoning land.  All of these measures were designed to counteract the poor practices which had led to the crisis and I am convinced that had they been in place earlier, the property bubble would not have inflated to such an extent and the severity of the economic crisis would have been much reduced.<br/><br/>On the question of banking, the Green Party was to the fore in directly criticising the lending practices of the banks.  Our then Finance spokesperson, Dan Boyle, recalls in a book he published on our time in government, a meeting with the Irish Banking Federation in 2006.  He attended this meeting, along with the current leader of the party, Eamon Ryan and I'd like to quote directly:</p> <blockquote> 	We brought up the question of the efficacy and economic sanity of issuing 110% mortgages, and the general lack of sustainability that seemed to exist in [the] property market; a market the banks seemed intent on inflating further.  The response to our concerns was both arrogant and condescending.  We didn&rsquo;t understand banking, we were told, besides which the market would correct itself in a relatively painless manner. </blockquote> <p>Early in our term in government, I recall, at a pre-Cabinet meeting in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office at the time of the Northern Rock collapse, asking the Finance Minister, Brian Cowen, if our banks were sound.  He told me that there was no problem with our banks and that they well capitalised.  I had no hard evidence to suggest otherwise but a nagging doubt did persist.  It was clear that the Lehman's collapse would have knock-on effects and I asked Minister Lenihan if there were contingency plans here.  He told me that matters were in hand.  I got the impression that Finance were working on a plan but I had no idea that they had been working on it for an extensive period of time, as indicated in the evidence of Kevin Cardiff.<br/><br/>I became aware that week from a comment made to me by Minister Lenihan that he had also been in contact with David McWilliams.  I did not know the extent of that contact until David McWilliams published details in a subsequent book.  I phoned David McWilliams on his mobile, while I was in Brussels on 26 September.  We had a long and detailed conversation on what could and should be done on the banking crisis.  In his evidence, David McWilliams seemed to indicate that we had no further contact on the matter.  In fact, there was an important exchange of e-mails, which are included in the appendix, at the request of the Chairman.  When I raised the possibility of nationalisation of the banks during our telephone conversation, he dismissed the idea out of hand.  He did so again in his subsequent e-mail to me.  I told him that I would raise the matter with the Taoiseach and the Minister at a pre-Cabinet meeting on the Sunday, that was 28 September.  I met the Taoiseach and Minister Lenihan in the ante-room opposite the Cabinet room.  I passed Mr. Lenihan the article written by David McWilliams and mentioned his proposals.  There was a cursory acknowledgement of the points but neither of them indicated that there was to be a meeting with bankers the next day.<br/><br/>The first indication I had of such a meeting was when I got a phone call from Minister Lenihan at about two o'clock on the morning of the 30th.  I had a brief conversation with Minister Lenihan.  He explained to me the urgency of the situation.  He said that this was an incorporeal Cabinet meeting but that I was welcome to come into Government Buildings, if I wished.  I told him that it would not be necessary if we were going with the &quot;David McWilliams option&quot;.  He confirmed that that what was being proposed.  As this had been the basis of our previous discussions, I was satisfied to give my consent to a Government decision to publish legislation to give effect to the guarantee.  Early that morning, I e-mailed David McWilliams with the news.  When he replied later on that day, he was particularly pleased that the markets had reacted so positively to the guarantee.  Chairman, I would like it noted that I was grateful for David McWilliams's input.  He did not know, nor did I, that we were dealing with an insolvency problem.  Even on the day of 30 September, Minister Lenihan told us that the guarantee was the best way to deal with the liquidity problem.<br/><br/>Following the guarantee decision of September 2008, the Green Party maintained a close involvement in the Government banking and budget strategy.  Responsibility for dealing with these matters in government was assumed by my colleague, Eamon Ryan.  That part of my official statement is based on contemporaneous notes taken by Eamon Ryan and I believe it would be in the interest of the committee to interview him separately, as he had a more direct involvement in these matters.</p><p> Before concluding, Chairman, I'd like to draw your attention to three small corrections to my official statement.  I already notified the inquiry team that I was attending a meeting of the European Environment Bureau on 26 September 2008 in Brussels and not a European Council meeting.  Secondly, the sentence relating to the National Economic and Social Council should read as follows: "In answering their question as to whether we were more Northern or Southern European in our current circumstances, it was clear that the former was the case", and I emphasise "the former" there; I think it read "the latter".  Also in the official statement, references made to the level of emergency liquidity coming from the European Central Bank and it states that it "had reached some &euro;130 million".  That should, of course, read "&euro;130 billion".  Finally, Chairman, I have noticed in preparing for this hearing that the record-keeping in the Oireachtas and the various Departments needs to be improved.  I'm referring now to Ministers' diary records, phone and text and e-mail and visiting records.  All of this, I believe, should be in digital format, searchable and readily available and, right now, it isn't.  I'd like to thank the inquiry team and the staff for their unfailing courtesy and I'd like to wish you, Chairman, and the members of the committee every success in completing this important report.</p></speech>

And your report will build on the analysis we've had already from Honohan, Regling-Watson, Peter Nyberg and so on.  I have submitted a detailed statement to the committee in response to the lines of inquiry sought of me and I am assuming that that statement has been read so I, therefore, am not intending to read that statement this afternoon.  But I just do want to highlight a small number of issues.<br/><br/>You have asked me to deal with the policies in the 28th, 29th and 30th D&aacute;il.  And, broadly, the macroeconomic policy was consistent - the strategic focus of the Government was to stimulate employment, to increase competitiveness so that we could reduce unemployment, and particularly long-term unemployment.  I am particularly proud of the achievements during those Governments.  We brought unemployment down from double digit to 4% or 5%, which was effectively full employment and, in particular, we made a very serious dent on what was long-term unemployment.  In the mid-'90s to 2000, there was reference made to reclassifying the unemployed ... the long-term unemployed as unemployable.  We proved that through activation policies that what could have been a long-term unemployment for ever, those people became employed and I am very proud of that.  We introduced a national minimum wage, we reversed emigration with immigration, we significantly grew take home pay and we greatly advanced the national infrastructure, as manifested most particularly by the motorway ... motorways we see in the country today.  But I'd like to highlight the investment we made in science, research and technology and now two thirds of the IDA jobs are very much dependant on the investments we made around 2000 in basic research in this country.  Ireland is now third in the world in nanotechnology, fifth in material science, first in immunology and so on.  These are major achievements for a country of our size.  We also increased social spending on education, health and pensions, and particularly welfare payments.  We had budget surpluses every year between 1988 ... 1998 and 2007, with the exception of one year.  We reduced, as I said, the burden of taxes and we grew spending.  We established a National Pensions Reserve Fund and 1% of GNP was put into that fund for a rainy day.<br/><br/>However, notwithstanding the successes that I am proud of, we made mistakes.  We did not foresee the enormous explosion of credit with entry into the euro.  Prior to entering into the euro, we put an extraordinary amount of effort into what I would call the &quot;changeover process''.  We were very focused on the rate with which we enter, on competitiveness issues, particularly <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>our nearest trading partner, the UK, and the effect on inflation.  In hindsight, we should have put a process in place that would have allowed us to look at the risks and the potential and the benefits of low interest rates on this economy.  I think if we had done that, it might have helped to arrest the more serious, negative effects of a low interest rate and cheap credit on the economy and we could have put mitigating measures in place.<br/><br/>Secondly, we were very trusting of the regulatory environment.  We probably should have been more proactive in monitoring and reporting, particularly the Government but also, I think, the Oireachtas.  We should have had regular assessment of the financial stability and that could have helped.  We could have had more critical analysis of the financial stability report.  And I think we placed undue confidence on the process and the procedure that we put in place.  And whilst it's not the job of Government to micro-manage regulation, if it goes wrong, Government must accept the political consequences of that.  And I believe we have to.<br/><br/>And, thirdly, I think we allowed public spending to grow too quickly on the back of what I would call ''transient taxes''.  We had recurrent expenditure on the basis ... or recurring expenditure on the basis of transient taxes mainly from the unsustainable construction activity.  It's understandable why these mistakes were made.  The general commentary in the ... in the country was benign and that helps to explain some of the mistakes.  Even the ESRI in their mid-term report, 2008-2015, forecast a growth rate of 4% and even in their worst-case scenario, the expectation was that the resilience and flexibility of the economy, with appropriate management, would see us return to reasonable growth in 2010.  I mention that simply to say that well-respected and credible organisations - even with the best forecasters - can get it wrong.  We need to learn lessons from that and the lesson is that we need to challenge the consensus.  I think consensus is part of our gene as a nation.  We didn't challenge the consensus and, in particular, the Government should have challenged the consensus and, therefore, we failed to pursue the hard remedies that might have avoided some of the pain that our citizens had to endure.  For those mistakes, of course, I, as a member of the Government, have to share responsibility and I deeply regret all of those mistakes.  I regret, in particular, that we did not dig deeper and ask harder questions.<br/><br/>I want to deal now with the issue of regulation and my role and relation to that.  In 1997, when I became Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I had responsibility for the regulation of the insurance industry and credit unions.  I was conscious that in 1985 an insurance company ICI almost brought a bank down, owing as they did I think it was &pound;400 million at the time.  I was anxious that the Department which didn't have the expertise - we had, effectively, half an actuary - to continue to regulate insurance.  But I was also aware that banks were getting into pensions and life assurance and I believed that one ... eyes should look at an organisation and not separate regulators - one in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the other in the Central Bank.  The Government agreed to the establishment of a single Financial Regulator.  And we subsequently put a process in place to look at how that Financial Regulator would be put in place, whether it would be greenfield option, whether it would be part of the Central Bank or whether it would be what became subsequently known as the &quot;two-pillar approach&quot;.  In the context of those discussions, it was pointed out that the Governor of the Central Bank would have to have the authority to issue binding instructions to the regulator.  This was pointed out both through ECB intervention, through the Department of Finance and though the Central Bank itself.  When the report came, I was happy to go along with that.  We are, after all, a small country and there was no point establishing an organisation for the sake of it and we had to be mindful of the Governor's wider responsibilities as part of a single monetary union.<br/><br/>I was also conscious during that time that the role of the consumer was ignored in regulations.  Banks were, quite honestly, in some cases ripping off consumers.  There were hidden costs.  They were helping consumers establish bogus non-resident accounts for the purpose of avoiding tax.  There were many hidden charges and there was a lack of confidence in regulation, as we knew it, and even a State bank was involved in DIRT.  I was involved, too, in a number of inquiries as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment into banks - Guinness Mahon, Irish Intercontinental, National Irish Bank and so on.  And the combination of all these things brought me to the conclusion that all was not well in the manner in which we regulated the financial services and that is why I was so proactive in seeking to ensure that we had a new regime.  The mistake, I suppose, was after the new regimen was put in place, not being more proactive in ensuring that appropriate resources were devolved to the regulation of the financial institutions.  And, in fact, it wasn't until this ... until the Honohan report, I think it was, that I realised that the big institutions only had two individuals responsible for their regulation.  I think that was a serious error and the Government certainly wasn't aware of that.  And I think it's a pity that we weren't aware of the lack of resources that were being applied to regulation.</p><p> Chairman, I end there for the purposes of time.  I'm happy to take questions on my statement, or even things that aren't in my statement.  But above all else can I say if there's any lesson I have learned from my time in government, as a result of what happened, it is that we need to be more questioning, particularly of consensus.  And we did have a national consensus in relation to a soft landing in the property market that was not correct.  And it is the responsibility of Government and maybe, secondly, the Oireachtas to be more questioning of consensus of that kind.  And perhaps if we were, it may not have avoided all the problems, or any of them, but certainly I think it's a responsibility we all bear and as we go forward I think it's a lesson that we should learn.  Thank you. </p></speech>

And good afternoon, Ms Harney and Mr. Gormley.  I'd ask you to be as brief as you can, we only have 15 ... or I only have 15 minutes.  Maybe to start with Ms Harney first in relation to the last point you made with regard to regulation.  Outside of the issue of resources, which you referenced, you've detailed how you had a role in the establishment of the new regulatory system.  With the benefit of hindsight, are there other structural changes that you would do differently now if you had that time back again?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-29a.1072" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Harney" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072900002#OO00400"><p>Well, can I ... sometimes I think we've become a bit obsessed with structures, and I think both Governor Honohan in his report, and I think Mr. Patterson, when he was before this committee, whilst they had issues with the structure, did say that the structure wasn't the reason why mistakes were made, and I would agree with that view.  I think we can become a little bit obsessed with how things look, rather that what we do.  I think if there's anything I would say reflecting back, and I don't intend for one moment to scapegoat anyone, because I think, collectively, we all failed, but I think it's more to do with the culture.  The reason I was so keen to have a new regulatory environment was partly because of the cultural issues that I experienced.  As I said, customers of banks were ... had hidden charges imposed on them.  They were being helped set up bogus non-resident accounts to avoid tax.  I knew in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that we certainly didn't have the resources to deal with a modern insurance industry and I was very worried that what had happened in '85 could happen again, and that's why we sought to move that into a different era.  Many of the people on that committee recommended a greenfield site, and that had attractions to me initially.  But I think, given the involvement of the ECB, given the fact that we were part of a monetary union and the particular responsibilities that fall on the Governor, and, as I said, what was more of concern to me was what they did rather than who did it.</p></speech>

Can I ask in relation to the greenfield site issue: it would have been covered, I suppose, in media speculation at the time, that some of the ... maybe Fianna F&aacute;il members of the Government would have favoured retaining regulation more centrally within the Central Bank, whereas the Progressive Democrats members of Government might have been more identified with the greenfield site.  Can you enlighten us maybe as to the discussions that led to the ultimate establishment of what we had?</p></speech>

There were differences between, I suppose, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank on the one hand, and probably everybody else.  But what concerned me was how we regulated rather than necessarily who did it.</p></speech>

And this expertise is not easily found.  It's a very complicated area.  In my own Department at the time we only had the equivalent of half an actuary.  So I was conscious of all of those issues.  And what concerned me most was what the regulator did, rather than who actually did it.</p></speech>

Can I ask you then in relation to the discovery, and you mentioned the reports, and we've had evidence here from witnesses of two to three people who were directly regulating, on a micro level, different institutions.  How did that situation ... how was it allowed to come about?  How, in light of the fact that you said you had reservations, that you had only an effectively half an actuary in your Department regulating insurance and the credit unions, how come there wasn't more strict oversight of the actual prudential regulation of financial institutions?</p></speech>

Maybe it's ... I mean, we're all talking here about eight years on and hindsight and looking back at mistakes and trying to reflect and agonise about are there things we should have seen and done differently.  Certainly, if I was to say that having established a new regulatory environment, perhaps we should have looked for ongoing reports from that regulator.</p></speech>

I'll quote him directly.  He said, "None of the authority - the board - had any experience in regulation [regulating banks]."  You would have had some input, I'm sure, into the nominees onto the board of the new regulatory authority.  How come we could have appointed, or Government could have appointed, a board of people to regulate that had, between them, zero experience of regulation?</p></speech>

In fact, I ... if memory serves me right, I think I did suggest to the Minister of Finance that Mr. Patterson would be an ideal person to be chairperson.  I had come across him briefly in business and he impressed me.  That skillset is not easily found, quite honestly.  These ... other than retired regulators, I'm not certain who we could have put on that had regulatory experience.  There was a former CEO of an insurance company, an economist, I think.

I've taken the opportunity - in fairness, in the context of coming to this committee - to read the D&aacute;il debate again, and the whole emphasis in the D&aacute;il from Deputies of all parties was on consumer protection.  So it was appropriate that consumers, and we're all consumers, should be represented on the board as well.  I'm not certain.  I respect what Mr. Patterson had to say.

There's a lot of lessons we have learnt.  And one lesson we must learn is that this expertise globally is in scarce supply.  And, therefore, if you're going to acquire that expertise, whether it's in the form of executive staff ... and sometimes in Ireland we go for three instead of one with the expertise and the experience, we might go for three more junior people.  I think what ... if there's any other lesson we should learn from the regulatory issues it is that we need the appropriate expertise, whether it's on the board of the regulator or whether it's particularly working at executive level in the regulatory office.</p></speech>

And maybe it is partly because we're a small country, but there was a lot of deference, perhaps, to the banks.  In the first instance the failure of the banking system must rest with the bankers and the lenders.  And then the auditors and the accountants.  I think, to be fair, the regulator and the Central Bank come down third and fourth line of defence.  They're not up there No. 1.</p></speech>

If they do their job, who they socialise with is not ... of no interest to me.  But I do think we need a regulatory environment that's robust, that protects the consumer and protects the banking system.  And I think we were all quite alarmed with what came out subsequently.  Some reckless lending, which none of us, in our wildest dreams, could have imagined.</p></speech>

I've two questions that I have to ask you before I get to Mr. Gormley.  Hopefully I'll have a bit of time with him.  At the bottom of page 3 of your statement that you presented to the inquiry you said, "I have commented on Government's lack of awareness of the growing risks in relation to Financial Stability in the lead-up to the crisis - an omission that one hopes is unlikely to be repeated given the huge focus on regulatory implementation since then."  Briefly, do you feel that enough has been done to ensure that a repeat will not happen?  Briefly, please?</p></speech>

I think their ... certainly the regulatory focus now is much more robust.  There's no question about that.  I think all of us, whether as Members of the Oireachtas or members of Government, will be far more questioning and will get behind the data that's supplied and use our critical faculties more.  But if you're to ask me could we have another crisis, I can't put my hand on my heart and say, "No".  But sitting where I sit now, I think we've done everything so far possible to avoid that, yes.</p></speech>

This is my final question.  On the website, still, of the Department of jobs and enterprise, as it is now, when I was preparing for this I found a speech, or a press release of a speech, that you gave in 2002, 12 September 2002, at an event ... a breakfast event in a hotel in the IFSC, and I want to put a quote from it to you:</p> <blockquote> 	15 years after it started, the IFSC is fully on the world financial map.  I would like to see if we can give a renewed public-private push to bring [international] financial services to a new level in Ireland.  Let's renew the energy and commitment on all sides that got us this far.  The new financial regulator ... will help give a boost, as we already see in the Chairmanship in Brian Patterson.  There is a lot more we can do together.  So let's set our sights high. </blockquote> <p>I want to ask you, what did you mean in terms of a boost?  And, secondly, we've had a few witnesses that have outlined the clash, if you like, between the two roles of the regulator, regulation and promotion, that existed under the legislation.  And you seem to be indicating, if I'm not ... if I'm correct there, that the role of the regulator was almost equally important in terms of promotion.</p></speech>

I think Mr. Honohan said that ... the Governor said that in his report, that it wasn't of the first order.  Secondly, we established a global financial services sector here from zero and to have credibility in the global financial world you need good regulation.  It's not about light regulation or no regulation; it's about strong, robust legislation.  People are not going to put their funds and their money into a country where they're not confident of the regulation.  So, what ... when I was talking I was talking about the new, strengthened regulatory environment.  And in relation to the development of promotional role, the IDA had a strong role.  As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment I met with many financial services companies around the world, promoting the IFSC, and so too did the clearing house.  So, I think the Central Bank's role would have been certainly down the line from that and it would, in any case, have been secondary-----</p></speech>

Perhaps there was a conflict.  It's not the first piece of legislation that I am aware of where there might be this overarching clause that talks about the development role of whatever sector.  But I think the Central Bank's first and primary responsibility was the stability, financial stability of the country and I don't think anybody can take from that.</p></speech>

No, I wouldn't.  I have given evidence here to show you very clearly that I was across the issue.  And I think it's fair to say that I was more across this issue than other members of the Cabinet, with the exception, of course, of the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach himself.  And I had discussed it with Minister Lenihan.  I had, as I said, discussed it with David McWilliams.  Now, Mary Harney has made an interesting point here when she talks about challenging the consensus.  Well I did challenge the consensus by taking a contrarian view.  David McWilliams, as you know, was right about the bust, absolutely.  I wanted to get his views and Minister Lenihan had taken on board his views as well.  Both of us, therefore, were on the same page and-----</p></speech>

And that's why I put it to Mr. Lenihan and I said, "Are we going with the McWilliams option"?  The David McWilliams option.  And he said, "Yes".  And that's why I was clear in my own mind that I could approve this.  Now, also, bear in mind that this was an incorporeal meeting, where you're not present.

I ... as far as I know, the only difference ... I think David McWilliams was saying that the bond holders should not be included in the guarantee.  That's the one change.  The day following, he ... I don't think he was too concerned about that particular issue because again I got another e-mail from him.  So that was the only difference as far as I can see.</p> <p>  Other than that, we had gone through it ... by the way, you know, we did have a Cabinet meeting the next day and it was actually open to any member of the Cabinet to say to Mr. Lenihan, "I don't want an incorporeal meeting, I want a full Cabinet meeting on this."  That option was also open to myself.  I didn't feel it was necessary, nor did I feel, having discussed it at Cabinet the next day, that it was necessary.</p> <p>  But you have to remember this and bear this in mind at all stages, we were told that this was a liquidity problem.  We were not told that it was a solvency problem.  We couldn't have known that, nor could Minister Lenihan, and, therefore, we were working on that basis.  And we were, effectively, misled by the banks on that issue and that's why we progressed and that's why we made that decision.  But, likewise, I would put it to you as well, Deputy, that the Opposition parties were briefed as well.  We had to vote on this issue.  This wasn't a decision that was made in the middle of the night really, because the legislation had to be voted on in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  And the Opposition parties were briefed.  They were given the same information that we were given.  I don't think the Department for Finance hid anything from the Opposition parties.  And, again, you were probably given misleading information because, again, you were told that this was a liquidity problem.  We now know it was a solvency problem but that's what we were going on at the time.</p></speech>

You're very welcome, Ms Harney and Mr. Gormley.

I mean, I ... I'm sure, Deputy, that there must have been some individuals in the banks who knew that the situation was pretty dire.  And, in any event ... and you know, the financial experts will tell you, sometimes it's difficult to know when a liquidity problem becomes a solvency problem.  Where is that threshold?  But I do believe that there were individuals who must have known, in the banks, that there was a problem.  That's my view.  Do I have evidence for that?  I don't.</p></speech>

Mr. Gormley, when you had the conversation with Brian Lenihan at two in the morning and he invited you in as such, and you asked him the question, "Are we going with the David McWilliams option?", how did you know that Minister Lenihan knew what the David McWilliams option meant?  Had there been a discussion at Government level or a bilateral one between you and Minister Lenihan where the McWilliams option, as you put it, was thrashed out?</p></speech>

I met with the Taoiseach and with Minister Lenihan in the ante-room opposite the Cabinet room.  I had told David McWilliams in advance that I would pass on his ideas.  He had written an e-mail and quite detailed as you can see in the appendix.  I passed that e-mail on to Minister Lenihan and I said, "Are we going to do this?"  We discussed it but it was a fairly cursory acknowledgement of this.  I think there was also an element of Minister Lenihan not wanting the Department to know that he had been in discussions with David McWilliams.  I don't think David McWilliams was, perhaps, well got in the Department and so I was fairly circumspect in what I said but I did pass him the document, it was quite detailed.  And so, to answer your question directly, yes, he absolutely knew what was meant by that.</p></speech>

He did not favour the idea of nationalisation.  In our telephone conversation I had put it to him, and I had put it in, you know, in a broad way because I recall quite vividly that he wanted to know what the Minister had decided.  Now, I was not in a position to tell him that because we hadn't actually made a Government decision at that stage, nor would I have told him in any event because I was aware of his dual role.  He was giving us advice but he was also a journalist so I had to be extremely careful of what I said.  But when I did talk about nationalisation he said ... and the way I put to him and I do recall, &quot;What is wrong with nationalised banks?&quot;  That is the way I put it to him.  He said, &quot;No&quot;, absolutely, and essentially, the message was that markets don't like nationalised banks and so, therefore, nationalisation was off the cards.  And he was ... I think he explained it in the e-mail but also I think he explained it in a newspaper article that he wrote for <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>as well, the ideas that he was putting forward, how this was to be done and that is what followed.</p></speech>

The Minister didn't say that to me.  The Minister always played his cards close to his chest and, you know, he did not want to say that probably to me but I knew from ... and this was the peculiar situation I was in, I was hearing what the Minister was thinking from David McWilliams and that's what he said.  David McWilliams is very clear in that e-mail, as you can see, that we weren't to go down that particular route; we were to go with the full guarantee.</p></speech>

He goes on to say that the Department of Finance is worried that people will call the Government's bluff and they will have to come up with the cash for this, "Believe me, this will not happen."  So the view being put forward was that a guarantee would be cost-free and ultimately that there would be revenue to the State by way of guarantee fees of &euro;1.5 billion per year.</p></speech>

I think it was a feature of our time in government, Deputy, that we were all extremely busy and under enormous pressure and rushing from one meeting to the next.  It was clear to me that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance had been meeting upstairs, they were rushing from there.  I said, "I want to meet with you because I have something I need to pass on to you."  I had given that undertaking to David McWilliams.  It was a brief discussion.  I actually, funnily enough, I do not recall the liquidity discussion at the Cabinet meeting but I do recall the meeting in the ante-room prior to the actual Cabinet meeting.</p></speech>

The financial markets had been in turmoil really since August 2007.  We had queues outside Northern Rock here in Dublin in September 2007.  We know that from January 2008, the Department of Finance was preparing scoping papers around the issues of financial stability, was looking at contingency planning, including nationalising banks and consideration of a guarantee evolved over the following months.  What level of awareness was there within your party and at Government level as a collective body of the looming crisis and the preparations which were under way or not under way during 2008?</p></speech>

No, I wasn't.  I was interested in the testimony given by Kevin Cardiff to this committee because he indicated that plans had been prepared, contingency plans of some sort, over a number of months.  Was this communicated to the Cabinet?  No, it wasn't, and I wasn't aware of it.  I only became aware of these plans when I discussed it in the week previously that something was afoot, so to speak, but Minister Lenihan said, "Look, we're dealing with this."  And that was ... it certainly wasn't months in advance, as Mr. Cardiff had indicated.</p></speech>

But I think I said in my opening comments, when we entered the euro, with the huge availability of cheap money, we put a lot of effort into the whole conversion process, you know, what would we ... what rate would we go in at, how would we be affected <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the UK - we were very concerned about the competitiveness issues there and the likely impact on inflation.  I think, and this is with the benefit of hindsight, I think, if we'd put a process in place to look at the threats and the opportunities and the risks, we might have been able to take mitigating factors.  Could we, for example, have decided to limit the amount of credit going into construction, or to any particular borrowers?  Could we have introduced legislation to deal with the 100% mortgages?  These are some of the issues that we might have been prepared to look at, or to have rowed back earlier on some of the tax-related property reliefs.<br/><br/>Secondly, I think, as I said, I think some of the public spending, based on what I call transient taxes ... we were incurring recurring expenditure, I suppose, based on taxes from the property sector, and that was a mistake.  I think benchmarking, we should have benchmarked public sector salaries to public sector salaries elsewhere, rather than to public sector ... to private sector salaries in Ireland.

And do you believe that the overall policy in terms of regulation, the free market, for example, reducing and lessening the tax base, that those policies were very much espoused by your party?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-29a.1186" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Harney" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072900002#RR02100"><p>Well, Deputy, the ideology that I have comes from my background.  I believe in hard work and the dignity of work.  I believe in lowering taxes on work.  I think the things you want to encourage in the economy should not be subjected to high taxes.  I believe in a broadened tax base and even when the Commission on Taxation, that was put in place post-2007, reported, they did not suggest increasing the tax rates.  We do need a wider tax base.  Regulation, I think, as document ... core document 40 will say, on page 87, I was the one that was being proactive, as the official says in the note to the Minister for Finance.  I think there are a lot of myths about what we stand for.  I'm for regulated markets, appropriately regulated markets.  You know, way back when I was a Minister of State in the Department of the Environment, we established the Environmental Protection Agency because I felt local authorities hadn't the competence or the expertise to regulate very complex industries.  In Health, we introduced new regulation of the Medical Council and of pharmacies - brought in lay majorities.  In the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I introduced the new Director of Corporate Enforcement.  I think that's an indication of my commitment to regulation.  It's not regulation for the sake of it; it's regulation that is effective.</p> <p>  I believe ... we believe in a philosophy that encourages enterprise, rewards work.  I was the Minister that brought in the minimum wage.  So, sometimes there's a lot of myths about what we stand for.  I think my philosophy and my approach to politics is shared by a wide number of people in Ireland.  We certainly weren't a populist party in the run-in to the 2002 election.  We were cutting back on community employment because I believed, at a time of full employment, we didn't need to be moving towards 40,000 people in community employment.  That was unpopular, even among some of the Government Deputies, so I think we ... we reformed the insurance industry.  Again, there was a strong lobby by the legal profession against that, but insurance came down dramatically following the introduction of the PIAB.  So, I hope, Deputy, that in my philosophy and my participation in Government, I pursued what I believed was in the national interest and I am proud overall of the achievements, but, of course, I regret very much the mistakes we made, collectively, as a Government, and the pain that that brought to so many of our citizens.</p></speech>

In your experience, Mr. Gormley, was there any external influence of a property or political nature which brought to bear on policy as opposed to best intentions in the interest of the people?</p></speech>

He was absolutely opposed to it and we also spoke about social dividend.  He felt that that had no place in the legislation.  I know that he was lobbying subsequently and the windfall tax was then removed, regrettably in my view, because it was a way of dealing with the whole question of over-zoning, which we were trying to deal with at the time.  So, yes, it is my view, and I think I said this in my official statement, that there are certain lobby groups which have huge access to the corridors of power.  And that particular group, I think, has inordinate influence.</p></speech>

Ms Harney, you mentioned that you don't remember a discussion about that, there was general discussions at Cabinet about the international situation, but nothing specific to do with our banks.

I did not know, to answer your question directly, that there was going to be a meeting with the bankers the next day.  I wasn't informed about that.  But I did know that Minister Lenihan was thinking about these matters.  I did discuss the issue with him.  I was across the issue in the days preceding that.  I think it would have been helpful but I mean, the fact is that Finance, the way they operate anyway - and I've been critical sometimes of the way the Department operates - that they often don't give you prior knowledge of what's going to be discussed.  Whereas a Minister, if you are preparing a proposal, you have to go through all sorts of hoops.  You know, you have to do a RIA, a regularly impact analysis, etc.  The same laws don't apply to Finance.  Very often, they would come to Cabinet and just put down a proposal a few minutes beforehand, which I found, frankly, unsatisfactory on occasion.  But, no, were we passengers?  No.  Did things accelerate?  Certainly.  And I felt, as I said to Deputy McGrath, that, unfortunately, we were misled on the whole question of solvency.</p></speech>

Thank you to both the witnesses.  You're very welcome.  Mr. Gormley, I just want to, if I may, at the outset, just verify a quote of yours if I may.  It's from a radio interview in December 2010 with Marian Finucane.  And you say: "The arrangements have been made the previous Sunday", right?  And we've gone into that in quite a bit of detail.  And said: "Yes, this was the expert advice to go down the guarantee route."  And she then asks you: "When was this decision made?"  And you said: "That was on the day before; it was a Sunday.  We had a cabinet meeting.  We'd gone through it in quite a bit of detail, as I said."  Do you recall saying that?</p></speech>

Mary Harney has referred to a short discussion at the end of the actual Cabinet meeting which, frankly, I don't recall.  But that ... the quote that you've just gave me ... have given me there, that may be slightly misleading because the account that I've given here today is accurate.</p></speech>

I mean, it certainly does give that impression.  And if we go in later to the interview, Marian Finucane asks again: "Can I just ask you a question? I think the rest of us thought with the two Brians, that the decision was made that night."  And you responded, "Well, you couldn't just make a decision on the spur of the moment.  You'd have to discuss it for days in advance.  Of course not.  You can't do it like that. Everybody had to be involved in what was the best thing to in these circumstances."</p></speech>

I listened carefully to the advice that we were offered by the Attorney General.  I think it's fair to say that ... and, you know, as Mary Harney said we're going back a period of time now and I'm trying to recollect exactly but it's often been said that we didn't resist, that we just caved in; that's not the case.  Minister Lenihan did make efforts to include bondholders.  He did want to, actually, to use that phrase that has become often used now, "burn bondholders."  But a number of things happened.</p><p>First of all ... and this is ... I'm just ... you know, this is my recollection, we did get some support from Strauss-Kahn, who was supportive of our ideas in relation to this, but Trichet wasn't supportive and particularly then ... I'm thinking back ... there was a meeting then subsequently where Tim Geithner was there and he was not supportive.  And the very clear view of the Attorney General at that stage was that they were to be treated in the same was as depositors and so, therefore, it was not possible.  And that's my recollection of that.</p></speech>

I mean, we were ... I mean, you can compare it to the Greek situation, right.  People say, you know, "We ought to have stood up to these people."  Well, we did stand up, but there comes a time where you have to use, you know, your political smarts and know when you're beaten.  We're a small island in the Atlantic.  We don't have huge power or influence.  We're up against the might of these people.  So what are you to do under those circumstances?  Well, we said, "The only thing that we can do is to go along with this as much as it sticks in our craw."  And it did.  And I think it was the right decision, Deputy, because if we had gone down the Greece route, well, you see what the consequences can be.  And I do remember saying to people, "You know ... and people thought I was exaggerating at the time, "You know, we are in a very difficult situation here.  If we don't get this right, the ATMs will close."  And people thought this was a gross exaggeration.  Well, you can see now that it wasn't.  The ATMs could have closed and we could have had a very serious situation, so I think we made the right decision.</p></speech>

And an article at the time from the RTE said, "Harney accuses European Commission of misjudging Irish economic situation."  Now, obviously, you didn't choose the headline, but, in that article, you criticise Europe for not understanding actually the budget situation in Ireland at the time.  So, on reflection, was the Council correct?</p></speech>

I think the point I was making about the euro was a different one.  I think if we had put the effort in post-joining the euro that we put in to the preparation of joining the euro, we might have been able to identify the risks earlier and to have mitigated some of the difficulties, and I regret that we didn't do that.  And can I just reflect back on the question you asked, if it's in order, Mr. Gormley?  From the time Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy made their comments at Deauville that peripheral countries' bondholders ... bonds would not be fully honoured, we were on a hiding to nothing, quite honestly.  The momentum after that was just incredible.  And Olli Rehn came to Ireland.  And in relation to trying to get a better deal, I think the IMF were supportive, the ECB weren't, and that was our difficulty.  We sought the write-down of senior debt in the banks and, to the best of my knowledge, the IMF were very supportive of that but the ECB weren't.  And by the time it happened, we didn't have an alternative, quite honestly.</p></speech>

I'm just going to take some questions myself and then maybe propose we might take a short break after that then, if that's agreeable.</p><p>Mr. Gormley, just with regard to your own witness statement, you state that circa ... in and around quarter 1, 2009 ... this is on page 5 of your statement:</p><blockquote>	An immediate nationalisation was ruled out as the state would not be able to manage the loan books of all six banks at the one time.  There was also still the prospect of either AIB or Bank of Ireland being solvent. </blockquote><p>Can you advise what parties were involved in these discussions and was solvency a significant concern?  Did you ever look at the possibility of liquidation?</p></speech>

I think, if I recall, your own party leader favoured that particular option.  But, you know, I think it would have led to chaos and I think Governor Honohan said that subsequently as well - that it was not an option.  I don't want to say that that was the actual David McWilliams view because the liquidation of Anglo is not something that I recall in detail as a topic.  But the ... what I was trying to get at is the option of the State taking over the banks and that was not something that he favoured.</p></speech>

To your information, what was being presented to you, what did you consider the options to be and what advices were you partaking in?  I know Mr. Ryan was more central to that process but you would have been in orbit to it.  So maybe you could answer the question in that regard.</p></speech>

The only option at that stage - and it was a road that, I think, the Taoiseach was always reluctant to go down but it became inevitable - was to nationalise.  And it was the option, I think, that nobody favoured.  It was quite clear to us at that stage that we had an insolvency problem across the board and there was also ... in relation to Anglo, I do recall, it was always said to us by Minister Lenihan that it was a systemic bank and that, you know, for a number of reasons that it was linked as well to, for example, the credit unions and there was a lot of cross-securitisation and that it was linked as well to various other banks because of interbank lending.</p><p>And so that was the reason that ... for a lot of us it was the last option, and that's why we considered and that's why he gave us ... he gave us a good briefing at that time, and said to us that that was the option that we should go down.</p></speech>

The only two options were nationalisation or liquidation.  You clearly wouldn't want to liquidate when the Government had guaranteed the bank, that would be the worst possible time to do it so nationalisation was the only option.  The bank, it was clear to the Government that the bank was insolvent, at that point.</p></speech>

And if I can maybe just come back to what I was speaking to yourself Ms Harney, just give me one moment there and I'll deal with it.  It's in regard to, yes ... I'll just bring up some documentation ... this is just a reflection of a series of correspondence that took place between yourself and then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy.  And the question kind of relates to the reorganisation of the Central Bank and the creation of IFSRA and the establishment of the Irish financial regulatory office and so forth.  Maybe if you could just maybe expand upon this Ms Harney that, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, you were directly involved with the reorganisation of the Central Bank.  And, in hindsight, would you do things differently now?  And maybe comment upon the specific evidence as well.  I know you're familiar because you asked for some additional documentation to be added yourself.  You might just consider what was the general discourse going back and forth between yourself and then Minister McCreevy's office at the time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-29a.1302" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Harney" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072900002#VV00500"><p>Well, I think it's fair to say that the Central Bank and the Department of Finance were against any, certainly ... the greenfield option ... and then the ... I was keen to ensure that we'd better regulation, that we'd more proactive regulation and that we'd a single regulator.  As I said, the Department of enterprise was responsible for insurance and credit unions and I didn't believe that that was satisfactory.  We neither had the expertise nor the resources to do that.  And added to that were the inquiries and then the charges, the hidden charges, the fact that the banks were misselling products to their customers and so on.  So a process was put in place, chaired by Michael McDowell, senior counsel, I think there were nine members of it ... including representatives of various Government Departments, a lawyer and a number of other outside people.  And they favoured, by a majority, a greenfield site.</p> <p>  And in the intervening period between reporting and the time the joint memo was brought to Government there were lot of discussions back and forth between my Department, both at official level and a political level, in relation to a solution or an agreement.  And because the request was for the Governor to be able to give directions when anything to do with financial stability was involved, I was happy to agree with that obviously.  The Government had its own responsibilities.  We then came forward with a joint memo which is roughly around the two pillar approach, I think the secretary to the Government, Dermot McCarthy, was very involved in that mechanism too on behalf of the Department of the Taoiseach.</p> <p>  So we came forward with the two-pillar approach, under the auspices of the Central Bank.  And after the legislation was passed I wasn't involved any more in ... I had no further role.  If memory serves me right, I think the Secretary General of the Department of Finance may have sat on that overarching body and the authority would have reported in, both to the Department of Finance and to the, perhaps to the Oireachtas as well, I think.</p> <p>  But I think I said earlier, in response to Deputy Phelan, regulatory change alone, or sorry structural change alone doesn't change the culture.  Now there were regulatory deficiencies at European level which have been since addressed, given we were in a monetary union.  They didn't exist until relatively recently.  But there's no doubt that the culture was one of deference.  And although I want to emphasise the first responsibility is with the banks and thereafter their accountants, the regulator or the Central Bank are down the line from that.  But I think there was neither sufficient resources applied to regulation to just have as ... as Governor Honohan, or Mr. Honohan, said in his report, I think he said there were two people responsible for each of the bigger institutions.  There's no way that's possibly, that that could possibly be adequate, dealing with a very complex industry.</p></speech>

I don't suffer from the same thing ... or I don't actually have it, I suffer from the quite the opposite because I'm misnaming members of this committee at times and all the rest of it.  But I tend to recall that there was a ... maybe a conflict might be too strong a word, but there seemed to have been a strong position coming from your Department and a strong position coming from Minister McCreevy's Department, and maybe you could elaborate was that actually a conflict?  Was it an issue as to whether the regulator's office, because there was a lot of issues relating to consumer affairs and consumer protection, that it should be moved into your office?  Was there something that you would try to appropriate the regulator's ... or some of their functions and duties, as something that is an enterprise and trade related issue?  And also ... or was it that really we shouldn't be separating and fragmenting the role of the regulator?  We've had testimony here from Mr. Cyril Roux recently who more or less said that what the ... in summary, that every country had principles-based regulation but it just seemed to have been operated differently in Ireland.  Was there an indication of that concern, that if the regulator was kind of put out in that regards, that's something else?  I mean, if you could just explain to us what the narrative of this discussion actually is between yourself and Mr. McCreevy.</p></speech>

The Central Bank had traditionally given responsibility, or if memory serves me right and I hope it does, there was an issue around bank charges and the Central Bank referred that to the director of consumer affairs.  I was anxious to ensure that there was a strong consumer focus, given what had happened.  Remember, when these decisions are made they are made in an environment of what's happening at the time and, as I said earlier, I did take the opportunity to read the debate in the Oireachtas and the focus of everybody was around consumer protection and the fact that it hadn't been taken seriously heretofore.</p> <p>  The lesson I suppose, Chairman, is that having established a new regime we probably should have been more hands-on or more proactive in inquiring how it was progressing.  But remember the backdrop then was that there were no prudential issues.  There were issues raised about the expertise in the country and how limited that is, and I share that view, we are a small country.  So I wasn't anxious to establish an organisation for the sake of it.  What concerned me was not the shape of the body that emerged but rather what the body was going to do.  And it was my genuine view, given that there was a director of corporate ... of consumer protection, a statutory consumer protection directorate, I was very happy with that.</p> <p>  I've seen subsequently at this committee reference was made that we didn't have a similar person for prudential regulation and perhaps the reason for that there wasn't perceived to be any issue with prudential regulation.  And indeed any of the external analysis of the country, including the IMF, the OECD reports in 2006 and 2007, and the stress tests done, all gave us a very clean bill of health.

And what Eamon Ryan said to me, because obviously he knew I was coming before the committee, he said that at a meeting of the North-South council in late November, Brian Lenihan told him about the revelations he had been told about the Maple Ten share-buying arrangement.  In early January Brian Lenihan told him about the INBC-Anglo balance sheet transfer and he says as he recalled he shared the info with Dan Boyle on that occasion.  The decision to nationalise Anglo was actually made in a meeting in Brian Lenihan's office which was attended by Eamon Ryan, Brian Lenihan, David Doyle, Cathy Herbert.</p> <p>  Again, Eamon Ryan would have talked to us subsequently about that before it went to Cabinet, so that's the information that I have in relation to that.</p></speech>

Just, finally, I want to deal with two other matters.  And if the whole story was a movie, the two big scenes in it would be the night of the guarantee and the entry into the bailout programme, but life isn't like that.  It doesn't have big moments, it's a series of events that maybe have significant events actually through it.  So can I maybe ... this is a question I put to other Government Ministers as well and ... I'd appreciate it if you could maybe just deal with the question rather than a more, longer, response.  But, in general terms, did the structure or design of the banking guarantee, of the bank guarantee, along with its period of duration, have any bearing on the Irish State entering a bailout two years and two months after the bank guarantee?</p></speech>

I think a narrative, a political narrative, has evolved around the guarantee, and it goes something like this: the bank guarantee was the worst decision ever made in this country, and that all our woes stem from it; two, that Fianna F&aacute;il was up to something shady with Anglo; and, three, that the Greens didn't know what the hell was going on, right.  Now, I think the evidence supplied here to you today shows I think that ... I don't have the evidence to support that narrative.  The fact is that, as Governor Honohan said-----</p></speech>

I don't agree with you because that goes down the route of saying, "This was the worst decision ever made, and, therefore, our problems stem from that, therefore, we went in ... this is the reason we went into the bailout, because of the guarantee".  Our choices were extremely limited.  Most of the damage was done before the guarantee - 90% of it.

Because the narrative might be this was one big event and the next thing, there's another big event.  There's two years and two months, actually, in between them.  Did they have any relationship to one another?</p></speech>

Mr. Trichet is saying, when he came before ... when we met him in Kilmainham, he says, "[As] you know, we could [...] have continued on our side [...] having gone up to 100% of GDP [...] to 200% of GDP, [This is all the liquidity that was going into the banks after the guarantee] and why not 300% of GDP?  [I can't do the French accent, so I'll just do the dramatics]  Then what would [...] the Commission [of the] inquiry be asking for?  You would say, "Were you totally crazy at the ECB to continue, when you were going [to] the wall at 100 miles [an] hour, to continue [providing] liquidity and liquidity and liquidity?"."  So is Mr. Trichet right?  Were we actually going into a bailout programme?</p></speech>

The reason for the guarantee was the banks hadn't got access to money and they were losing it pretty rapidly.  The reason we subsequently ended up moving into a bailout was because of rapid increase of cost of borrowing on the markets, and I referred earlier to Chancellor Merkel and to President Sarkozy and the comments about peripheral countries.  Once that statement was made, it was inevitable.  I mean, the domestic view was that we'd enough money - I think Mr. Corrigan may have said this before this committee - for another six months or so, but, to be honest with you, things moved very fast around that period, so fast it was quite scary.  And the bailout became inevitable.  And there was a difference in the support between the IMF and the ECB around that time, I do know that.</p></speech>

A question for Ms Harney.  With the establishment of the single ... of the whole, I suppose, regulation ... the new regulation mechanism and, prior to that, your Department was in charge of the insurance sector.</p><p>Do you believe there was a knock-on effect in terms of the regulation of the insurance sector?  And I'm saying that in mind with what has happened with Quinn Insurance.  You might just give me your thoughts on that.</p></speech>

Do you think there were consequences, adverse consequences for the taxpayer, in the way insurance companies like Quinn Insurance were regulated under the new regulatory structure?</p></speech>

I said earlier we had the equivalent of half an actuary and I remember having very detailed discussions with officials and, particularly, the Secretary General of the Department.  Clearly, we were concerned because of what had happened in 1985 with ICI, that we did not have the capability internally in the Department to deal with what was a very complex industry and also the coming together of banking and insurance.  And a number of banks were involved in insurance products and it was better that they would be regulated with one pair of eyes, as it were.  I think I need to be careful in relation to what happened with Quinn Insurance.  Clearly, there were regulatory issues that have arisen there, and maybe issues that go beyond regulation ... very serious issues that had implications for the insurance industry in the country and the reputation of the insurance industry internationally, actually.</p></speech>

The answer is I don't know, but one thing I do know is we didn't have that competence in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the whole purpose of moving responsibility and having a single Financial Regulator was to have a more robust, more proactive regulatory environment with the appropriate expertise.  And I did say earlier - and it's a view I formed during my time in government - that sometimes because of the salary implications of bringing in experts, many, on occasion, they have to be hired from outside the country.

I emphasise again that I think the main responsibility must lie with those that made the bad lending decisions, the reckless lending decisions in many cases but can I say in relation to the regulator, it's been advanced here, both by Mr. Patterson who chaired the financial regulatory authority and by Patrick Honohan in his report, that the regulatory structure was not the cause of the problem.</p></speech>

What I do know is that I did trust Minister Lenihan.  In my view, he ... and I discussed this with Deputy Murphy, just in the break there, he was working very long days.  He was trying to do his best and I do know that, had it been necessary, he would have broached the subject.  But I suppose, Deputy, you know, none of us knew that this meeting, this crisis meeting, including Minister Lenihan because I'm sure he would have informed me on the 28th, "There's going to be a major meeting tomorrow."  I don't think he knew at that stage and so events moved very, very quickly the next day and, you know, I was, as I said, across the issue aware of it, but your question relates to should I have brought it up at Cabinet and, at that stage, I suppose it just ... it just wasn't there at the top of my agenda at that moment, you know?  I brought it up with Minister Lenihan and the Taoiseach before Cabinet but the way it operates normally, as you know, is that it's the line Minister that brings up items at Cabinet.</p></speech>

There would have been discussions amongst many of us about the emerging global situation, both with the Minister for Finance, with the Taoiseach and with others.  It wasn't that we were oblivious to what was happening, I can assure you.  Everybody was very much on alert.  We knew the situation emerging in the banks was serious and my recollection of the meeting of 28 September is that at the very end, the Minister for Finance told us that the emerging situation in the banks was serious.  The Minister sat beside me at the Cabinet, so I just want to be certain, because Mr. Gormley doesn't remember that, I might be confusing a private ... a conversation he had with me but I'm fairly certain he actually told the wider Cabinet.  But I remember, on that evening, he was very concerned about the emerging situation in the banks from a liquidity point of view.  There was ... even from anecdotal evidence, I knew people myself that were talking about going to take their money out and then there was a radio programme and so on, so there was a lot happening very quickly.  But if the purpose of your question is to ask us were we mindful of what was happening in the international marketplace, we certainly were.</p></speech>

It's a very serious matter and I think all of us at Cabinet were aware of our responsibilities and we acted on the best possible information.

So, he was stating that the Department of Finance were concerned that potentially the markets, would consider this a bluff.

I did say in my statement that I excluded myself for the reasons I gave, from the actual decision, although I supported it when the Minister for Finance made contact with me on Monday night, my memory is it was around nine, 9.30 in the evening.  I believe we had no alternative, quite honestly.  And I think if we had excluded some banks, I think it would have led to enormous controversy and it would have led to legal action and it would have been very hard to justify because Anglo was systemic.  It was certainly no bluff.  I will acknowledge that the information on which the decision was made was very limited and on that night the view was that we had a liquidity problem, not a solvency problem.</p></speech>

And I think other witnesses that have give evidence here before the committee who were present on the night have confirmed that.  That emerged subsequently.  And as the, you know, the loans got transferred to NAMA and the haircut was substantially bigger than anyone had anticipated, that is the reality of what happened, Senator, and I think many of the comments I made earlier in relation to mistakes made - perhaps we could have done things differently to have better information, to have minimised the burden on the taxpayers, to have mitigated some of the risks.  But we did not have that information.  And I have to say that in my experience in government, between 1997 and January 2011, my colleagues always acted in the national interest.  When serious problems were brought to attention, they were dealt with, notwithstanding the consequence, political or otherwise.  That has been my experience.</p></speech>

Senator, rather, was the thing that disappointed me about the Department.  And let me say that many of the officials in the Department did Trojan work.  They worked around the clock, including Mr. Cardiff, who was unfairly maligned, in my view.  But the Department calls the shots and they often, I suppose, had a practice which was like, you know, "Do as I say, not as I do".  And in terms of the way that they approached Cabinet meetings, I felt that they would produce memos, as I said, at the last minute, not giving us enough time to scrutinise those memos, not having done the necessary homework themselves, whereas I was running a Department, which was a huge Department, and if I had to put something through Cabinet, every single line had to be accounted for.  And that's the ... that's the problem that I encountered.</p></speech>

And I didn't see the structure as the big issue.  I felt ... and, even in hindsight, I'm not certain we would have got agreement to have a completely green field situation, I think we would have been taking a lot of people from the Central Bank.  The difference with NTMA, really, was it was a completely new and expanded role when it was established, albeit with some people from the Department of Finance.</p></speech>

I can check.  My memory is it was a call from the Minister on Saturday morning or maybe late Friday night.  It hadn't been changed, I think, since 1995 and there was a view that given what was happening, we needed to increase it to &euro;100,000.  It was felt on that occasion that that might have been adequate.  Clearly, subsequently it proved not to be.</p></speech>

Ms. Harney, can I start with yourself?  In your witness statement, you state that there was a short discussion on the liquidity issues in the banks at the Cabinet meeting on Sunday, 28 September 2008 but the main focus of the meeting was to deal with the decisions required for the imminent budget.  I know you've mentioned this, but can you just discuss the liquidity issues conveyed to you at that time?  And did you think these discussions would lead to the Government announcement of a Government guarantee for the banks within 48 hours?</p></speech>

My memory is that we spent the whole ... I think it was morning and afternoon, I can't quite remember the time of the day, it was a Sunday.  We were discussing the Estimates.  That was always a long meeting and always a difficult meeting because there was friction and tension between, say, normally the Finance Ministry and other line Ministers.  So there was a long discussion.  And my memory is that at the end of that meeting that the Minister for Finance said there's a serious situation emerging in the banks.  I don't think the word "guarantee" or anything like that was mentioned.  That's the best of my recollection.</p></speech>

The norm at a Cabinet meeting is if a line Minister has some new issue that mightn't wait until Tuesday, which was the next Cabinet meeting, or something new was emerging, the tendency would be to brief your Cabinet colleagues.  There wouldn't be papers, it would just be by way of a short statement.</p></speech>

I think I've said to you that, at that stage, Minister Lenihan was, as I said, keeping his cards close to his chest.  But we did have that discussion at the pre-Cabinet meeting on the 28th, where I raised my concerns but the actual ... my knowledge of the drafting of the legislation that you referred to was not there, I just didn't ...

I would have preferred if we had that, but we didn't.  Minister Lenihan didn't have time, but we did discuss the options.  He did say to me that he had been speaking to David McWilliams.  I subsequently spoke to David McWilliams.  He then sent me those particular e-mails.  I think you may have put a question to Mr. McWilliams whether he discussed the issue with me.

Many people have been speaking to David McWillams.  Most people aren't senior members of Government during the financial crisis.

You also talk about the phone call conversation, the e-mail with David McWilliams.  You go on to talk about that short and rushed meeting you had with Mr. Cowen and Mr. Lenihan on the Sunday before.  You say then about your decision not to leave your house and go into Government Buildings, and finally on page 4 you talk about "the responsibility of dealing with these matters ... was then [assigned to] my colleague, [Mr.] Eamon Ryan".  It could, if you look at those things, it could look like your contact with this whole affair in relation to the crisis and the management of it was quite brief, if you look at it in that way.  And I'm wondering how it is that, in much of your statement, in fact, is given over to the notes from your colleague, Mr. Ryan.  Now, you were the leader of the Green Party, were a member of Cabinet, and yet-----</p></speech>

That's in relation to the guarantee.  Just to move on now to the question of what happened subsequently: we were in a crisis.  Things were moving very, very quickly.  I was not just the leader of the Green Party, I was also in charge of a huge Department, and I'm sure if you talk to your colleague, Minister Kelly, he will tell you that it's a big Department.  It was even bigger then.  I was looking after more issues and you could ... you know, from libraries, fire brigades, the whole thing.  I was also the leader of a party, of a small party, that was in the worst crisis you can imagine.  I had to deal with the party members and that was my brief because, you have to remember, that if the Green Party decided to pull out of Government, that was the end of the Government.  And so it was my duty ... and we divided up the roles, Eamon Ryan's Department was a much smaller Department and he had more ... frankly, he had more time on his hands.  And so, therefore, it made sense under the circumstances to operate in this way.</p></speech>

I'm just thinking about the public's idea of Cabinet responsibility and collective Cabinet decision.  It seems from what you've both said, in fact, that neither of you knew anything of the build-up, anything about the legislation, anything about the planning, anything about the crisis, anything about all the documents that ... now, in fairness, we've seen a lot of documents.  But it seems to me that both of you arrived almost at that night with very little knowledge.  Is that ... is that a fair assessment of what happened?  And in that case, how many more of your Cabinet colleagues were also in that boat?</p></speech>

It's also reasonable that they would not have made the wider Government aware of that for a whole host of reasons.  And that would not be unusual.  Line Ministers would often operate in an environment where you're putting contingency proposals in place in the event of something awful happening and you wouldn't necessarily brief the rest of the Cabinet.  You would normally brief the Taoiseach, and if it had an implication for another line Minister, so that is not unusual.  I think, to be fair to the Minister for Finance, he was extremely open in his dealings with me.  I think he kept me as informed, as well informed, and it was right that if his Department, in consultation with the Attorney General, were putting measures in place in the event of something awful happening ... it's better that that was happening than the alternative of not doing that.</p></speech>

As Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, were you lobbied in your time?  Did you influence the Minister for Finance in any aspects of the budgets that were in your time?  If so, can you outline any such changes and could you say if any such changes was as a result of lobbying to your Department?</p></speech>

I was aware on occasion when I would go into the Department, I would see people ... representatives of the construction industry in the Department.  Nobody ever lobbied me personally.  I ... it was common practice at the time that the Minister for the Environment would be invited to the CFI annual dinner.  I went, I think, on the first occasion and gave a speech which was probably not to their liking, when I talked about the over-zoning and all the rest.  So, I was never personally lobbied but I have no doubt that they were in the corridors of power.  Very often, it made more sense for lobbyists to go directly to the Department of Finance.</p></speech>

You say that "Green Party TDs and Senators voted for these cut backs and tax increases, convinced that this was the correct course of action, while also knowing that it would lead inevitably to electoral annihilation" and, finally, you said "I&rsquo;m proud of the dignified way that the Greens conducted themselves during this time of adversity."  Could I put to you, Mr. Gormley, a contrary view that in the general election of 2007, the harsh austerity measures were unthinkable and that no Government really would have a democratic mandate to impose such measures.  And in that context, Mr. Gormley, can I ask you was the worst day in government better than the best day in opposition?  Was that a siren call or was it sound advice from a partner in government?</p></speech>

And I can say, I remember Mary Harney saying that to me and I was absolutely mortified when it appeared in the newspaper.  It was ... John Downey, the deputy press secretary, came to me and apologised to me that it appeared in the newspaper and then I subsequently apologised to Minister Harney.  But, it actually isn't true.  I can tell you that now.  Some of the worst days we've ever had was when we were in government and it was unimaginable and just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, it did.

We were ... we were there ... we were forced to take the most unpalatable decisions but we did so trying our best to make these budgets as progressive as possible.  And we had a backroom team working on that and I'm proud to say that each of those budgets was progressive, that they actually did hit the wealthier people a lot more than poorer people.</p><p>And, Deputy, can I say, you know, I think I've had a conversation with you before about this that, you know, in an ideal world, if we could clone Joe Higgins and create 90 Joe Higgins and you had a majority in government, I'm telling you now that your room for manoeuvre in government would be limited in a crisis like this.  You would have to make terrible decisions like Syriza in Greece.  It's something you don't want to do, but you ... it's forced on you and, you know, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy, but that's the situation that we were in.  We had to take those decisions and I think they were the right decisions.</p></speech>

Ms Harney, you say in your statement, "I am proud of the economic and social achievements over the period [in government].", and in the Oireachtas core documents, Vol. 2, it says, I'll quote very briefly, the Progressive Democrats 2007 election manifesto claimed that, in government, the Progressive Democrats will "Continue our successful policy-approach of significantly increasing housing supply to reduce the cost burden on homebuyers".  Ms Harney, evidence on this inquiry asserts that between 1996 and 2006, coinciding largely with your time in government, saw the price of an ordinary home increase each year over those ten years by the equivalent of the average industrial wage - each year, the equivalent of the average industrial wage.  How can you describe that as a successful policy?</p></speech>

The take home pay of lower income groups and middle income groups were substantially increased.  We ... even in the worst day in 2007, 2008, there were 1.7 million people in work in this economy.  In the late '80s, there were 900,000 people at work.  So we generated huge employment, huge opportunity, reduced both unemployment and long-term unemployment, in particular.  And, yes, there were issues around the property.  It was among the reasons why in that election we advocated a change in stamp duty.  Two people in Dublin selling an apartment, a young couple, if they were both single with an apartment worth &euro;300,000 each, which wasn't huge in Dublin, had to pay the equivalent of more than the average industrial wage by way of stamp duty and we advocated that too.  The view taken, Deputy, was a greater supply might reduce the cost.  It was the shortage of housing in particular parts of Dublin, mainly to do in which the manner in which we develop housing in this city-----</p></speech>

It is an enormous financial swindle that could potentially confine an entire generation of young Irish people to years of bad debt.  Far from being a reflection of economic vitality and fundamental demand the housing  bubble is, in the main, a vacuous financial confidence trick that has been foisted on us by an alliance of banks and [...] landowners. </blockquote> <p>Then he referred to the price of an average home close to ten times the average wage.  Do you agree with his analysis now?</p></speech>

I agree with some of Mr. McWilliams' analysis - not all of it but I agree with some of it.  But Morgan Kelly, when he published in 2006, made the point that at that stage it was too late to stop the property bubble.  So different people put forward contrarian views but the view that the Government went with, Deputy - and this is where I said earlier that we should have been more questioning - we went with the consensus that there would be a soft landing in the property market and we based our election manifestos in that election on a ... and most parties did on the basis of a 4.5%, 5% growth figure.  Clearly, neither of those situations turned out to be the case.</p></speech>

He did worry about leaks, obviously, for the very obvious reasons that if something inappropriate is leaked it can be self-fulfilling.  I wasn't aware that Mr. Cardiff made that point to the committee, but it's probably true.  Very often a line Minister would inform people that aren't of the same party in a way that they mightn't inform their colleagues, and that's not a reflection on their colleagues, it's just they want to keep things as tight as possible.  I think that was the perspective he had.</p></speech>

I didn't know about the advice that you have just spoken about.  And, frankly, Deputy, I don't think my presence there would have changed things one iota.  I mean, the presentation again is one of "the night of the guarantee".  The fact is that this had to go through a process, and the AG was very clear on this, that this was legislation that had to be agreed.  So it was open to people the very next day, if they had concerns, they could have raised concerns there.  Likewise, as the legislation was progressing.  But the fact is that we didn't have those concerns and I didn't see, you know, it as a ... it wasn't the priority for me to go in at that stage because I had, as far as I was concerned, dealt with the issue in my own mind.  And I was very clear at that stage that this was the right decision, and I still hold the view that, under the circumstances, it was the least worst decision.</p></speech>

Mr. Gormley, in your witness statement you mention a report from 2010 from NUI Maynooth in relation to ghost estates.  What steps did you and the Green Party take in the 2007 to 2010 period to improve the planning system in a way that reduced the number of ghost estates that might be abandoned?</p></speech>

The fact is that if you look at the amount of land that was rezoned at that stage ... at the height of the boom, I think it was 44,000 ha, when, you know, that was 32,000 ha more than was needed.  And so, in the planning legislation that I introduced, we said that each council had to have a core strategy, that they had to have evidence-based zoning, that they had to get experts in, and that it just couldn't be done in the haphazard way that it had been done up until then.  I also initiated a number of planning inquiries because it had come to my attention that there was corruption taking place - a number of complaints from various members of the public.  Unfortunately, those inquiries were shut down.  The final thing that we did, and it's important ... I really do believe it's important because you can go right back to the Kenny report, back in the '70s, which recommended a windfall tax to deal with this sort of corrupt over-zoning that we were witnessing - that's an 80% windfall tax.  And then we went through a tribunal dealing with the corruption, and that tribunal recommended a windfall tax.  We introduced it, and it was a good measure.  It should have been retained and, unfortunately, it was ditched as well, and I find that very regrettable.</p></speech>

I'd like to just go back to the issue raised by Deputy Doherty, and, especially with you, Mr. Gormley, about the solvency of Anglo because it is an important point, and there was a PwC report, Project Atlas.  There was one in September '08, one in November '08, and one in December '08, and then a summary of it was prepared for the regulator and the Department in February '09.  It didn't raise any solvency issues; in fact, they concluded that even under the most stressed scenario, in terms of the assumptions, that the minimum capital requirements would be maintained by Anglo-----</p></speech>

So, can you be ... can you clarify when, to your best recollection, you were told that Anglo was insolvent?</p></speech>

And, as I said - and I will consult afterwards - my colleague at the time, the finance spokesperson, Dan Boyle, was the one who said, no, we've ... there is a problem.  Now, and that came from information that was supplied to us by Eamon Ryan, but I'm more than happy to go back, and, can I say this, Chairman?  Eamon Ryan took copious notes, and those notes are now in the UCD archive.  I suggest that they should be here, in front of you and your committee, because they're the best notes.  In fact, at one stage other members of the Cabinet used to get a little bit irritated there were so many notes being taken.  But they're there, and I think they would provide an important insight for this committee.  And I would suggest that, not only do you get hold of those notes that are in the UCD archive, but that you would also interview Eamon Ryan as well.</p></speech>

I'd have to get you the exact date but my recollection is that the meeting took place in the Taoiseach's office.  I was there, as was the leader of the Fine Gael Party, Enda Kenny, as was the leader of the Labour Party, Eamon Gilmore.  I have to say I was disappointed in the response.  I suppose, from a political point of view, it's understandable that the leaders of the Opposition were not interested in a type of Tallaght strategy, as you put it.  What they wanted was a general election.  You know, I was quite prepared at that stage to say to people "Look this is a national emergency.  This is what this country is going through right now.  We need to co-operate and if that means that we co-operate for a period of time and then have a general election, so be it."  Now, it was not a runner - immediately, I could see - and, in fact, I heard that before we even went into the meeting that there had been a statement made to some of the newspapers to say that they weren't interested.  During that meeting, my memory is that Deputy Kenny, as he was then, was quite silent - he didn't say that much.  Deputy Gilmore was a little bit more aggressive in saying he wanted a general election now and that was the end of it.  And ... so that's how it turned out.  I was particularly disappointed then afterwards because you may recall that the Green Party then subsequently left Government and we voted for the Finance Bill from the Opposition benches.  And Eamon Ryan, at that stage then, tried again and he approached Simon Coveney with an offer.  And the offer there was ... it related to a motion of no confidence and Fine Gael and Labour said that they would vote ... they would withdraw their motion of no confidence and the reason for that was that we had made it very clear that we would have no option at that stage, because we had withdrawn from Government, that we would have to vote with the Opposition.  And so, therefore, if they had voted, at that stage, no confidence in the Government, the Government would have fallen and the incoming Government would've had to introduce the Finance Bill.</p> <p>   Now, from a political point of view, I have to be quite frank with you and say that was my preference - you know, let someone else do the heavy lifting - because I was a little bit peeved at what happened previously, when I had tried to extend a hand of co-operation and it was, you know, put aside.  In the end, a deal was done.  I think ... if I ... I was not at that meeting.  I think Eamon Ryan was at that meeting,.  If I recollect correctly, perhaps Senator Doherty, as he was then, was at that meeting.  And, you know, it was an arrangement that was made.  We voted from the Opposition benches for a terrible Finance Bill and that sealed our fate, you know.  I mean, we had to go into an election after that.</p></speech>

Mr. McWilliams did call it correctly.  He was right and so I wanted to get a different perspective.  I wanted to find out from someone ... I found him to be engaging, personable, quite enthusiastic and he had ... I had met with him down in my Department.  He'd also been on the ministerial corridor, we had had chats.  I don't say I ...I knew him very well but I ... I knew him reasonably well, on a professional level, and I listened to his advice and I found him to be, as I said, very co-operative and that's why I spoke to him.</p><p>I had had some contacts with him and I used those contacts.  I didn't have contacts with other economists and, in any case, as I said, the two people that were right about the bust were Morgan Kelly and David McWilliams, as far as I can recall.</p></speech>

I'd like to thank the committee for their courtesy and I want to wish you well.  I think the work you have ahead is important.  It will certainly, hopefully, add to our ... not only our store of knowledge that we've already received from other reports, from Honohan and the other people that have ... Watson and so on, but also that I think it will hopefully improve the economic management of the country.  And, I suppose, if there's any message, it is that we all need to be more questioning than perhaps we were, particularly when there's a national consensus.  I think that is a time for parliamentarians, particularly members of Government, to get behind that and to be more questioning and that's something I think that we overlooked in ... during the period that we're talking about, during the run-in to the recession.</p></speech>

Now, I can understand why it is that political parties would feel that the AG's office is a block; it's quite natural.  You know, the AG's office goes through things line-by-line and says, "You'll have to go back."  And it prolongs the legislative process.  But from my own point of view, I hold Paul Gallagher in very high regard.  He was of enormous assistance to me.  He worked extremely hard.  He's dedicated to public service.  He helped me particularly on the issue I was dealing with, which was the incinerator.  I was at the time ... I was told at the time that if I didn't deal with this properly and work on it and take it step-by-step in a very measured and legislative way, that they could pursue me personally.  This is the ... and Paul Gallagher helped me out and I'm very grateful to him for that and I just want to put that on the record.</p> <p>  And finally I want to say, Chairman, I think this is an important committee.  It's important that your report is very thorough, that you go through every single thing.  I don't think, to be quite honest with you, that even with the best will in the world, and putting in all of these measures, that you will avoid in the future another bust.  It is part of the cycle.  But you can, I hope, mitigate those circumstances and ensure that, in future, we don't come down with such a thud.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-29a.1608" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Fidelma Clarke" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015072900002#YYY00400"><p>Thank you.  I have been asked to provide a witness statement in relation to my role as chief risk officer and company secretary of EBS Building Society.  As you've said, Chairman, I was appointed chief risk officer in January 2009, reporting the to CEO, Fergus Murphy.  From that time, I also had a dotted reporting line to the chairman of the board risk committee.  I had been appointed company secretary in July 2008 and resigned from that position in June 2009 to concentrate on the demands of the chief risk officer role.  Given the hour, I thought what might be most beneficial for the committee would be for me to drive some of the key themes from the written statement that I have submitted and, with the benefit of some time for reflection, some of the lessons learned.</p> <p>  The route cause of EBS's financial difficulties were set out in its restructuring plan submission to the EU Commission in May 2010, comprehensively covered by Professor Nyberg and have been discussed by this committee earlier today and also last week.  These were: a decision to step up lending to the land and development sector at the height of the Irish property boom and insufficient management oversight of this lending; strong growth in EBS's residential loan book in response to competitive pressures; the fact that EBS was a moderately-capitalised business albeit, within regulatory requirements; and an over-reliance on wholesale funding.  The board of EBS took the decision to enter into land and development sector in 2002 and to step up this lending in 2005.  Controls put in place to mitigate risk weren't sufficient in the face of the timing of the decision and the scale of the financial crisis which ensued.</p> <p>  The growth in residential mortgage lending over the period 2000 to 2008 is a reflection of the strategy of the board of the society to retain EBS's mutual status and remain a relevant mortgage provider in Ireland.  This necessitated moving with the market.  Numerous changes to credit policy were approved, which allowed customers borrow more than they had in the past.  At each stage, the options were clearly documented and considered by the executive and the board before approval.  Increased risk appetite, as set out in the society's policies, was supported by a strong economic climate, improved demographics, higher income and lower tax levels - all of which improved loan affordability.  Loan exposure was limited with mortgage indemnity insurance.  Significant investments in underwriting systems, models and management reporting were made.  The long-established management controls in place, including centralised underwriting, loan affordability assessment, mortgage indemnity insurance and independent property valuations, were insufficient to withstand the scale of the economic downturn and the significant correction in house prices.</p> <p>  In terms of its capital position, EBS operated within regulatory capital requirements throughout the pre-crisis years.  But its tier 1 capital ratio of 7.9% at the end of 2008 was inadequate to absorb the unprecedented level of provision losses arising from the crisis.  The PCAR II and PLAR exercises in Q1 2011 resulted in a required tier 1 capital ratio of 22.5%.  Finally, in relation to the liabilities side of the balance sheet, the reliance on cheaper wholesale funds of all credit institutions has, I believe, been extensively commented on.</p><p>Between 1999 and 2007, EBS's loan book grew by 300%, while deposits grew by 170%.  Similar to other institutions, the gaps that ... had been funded through wholesale funding and international corporate deposits.  As we now know, this was an unsustainable model and new regulatory requirements in relation to loan-to-deposit, liquidity coverage and net stable funding ratios are in place to prevent a recurrence of this situation.  Accountability for these failings was demonstrated to members in the stepping down of the chairman of the board and the finance director early in 2009.  </p><p> In terms of the risk management of the society, Professor Nyberg expressed the view that the risk management system in EBS was not adequately resourced and seems to have lacked influence within the bank.  Looking back, and with the benefit of hindsight, I agree with him, although I do not believe that this of itself contributed significantly to the overall outcome for EBS.  The risk team was established in 2002, comprising three people.  It's responsibilities were set by the chief risk officer.  These included establishing and providing input to a credit risk committee, an operation risk committee and a capital committee over the period 2003 to 2006, documenting the society's risk governance framework, developing a risk assessment process for each function, ensuring that all of the organisation's risk policies were documented, developing an enterprise risk report for the chief risk officer with inputs from across the society on key risk trends and risk positions, delivering the Basel II programme, which included the new requirement for capital assessment, the ICAP process, an internal capital adequacy assessment process, modelling and reporting on requirements - a significant undertaking between 2004 and 2008 - also developing loan-loss provision models to meet aspects of the new international financial reporting standards and building and submitting new regulatory reports on liquidity, asset quality, large exposures and impairments.  </p><p> The credit risk committee was chaired by the chief risk officer and comprised representatives from the business areas, credit underwriting, the distribution channels, and risk.  Its role was to monitor risk trends and review proposed changes to policy in line with the society's approved strategies for onward recommendation to the executive and board.  The risk team was not involved in strategy formulation, approval or implementation in terms of day-to-day business operations, nor was it involved in the credit approval process.  This was managed by the commercial business and residential underwriting and from 2005, a commercial underwriting unit.  There was a senior management credit approval committee, called the loan advances committee, made up of business, credit and senior management, and separately, a subject which the committee has touched on earlier today, a board credit approval committee, comprising non-executive directors and members of the executive.</p><p> This committee has heard there have been many regulatory developments in the area of corporate governance and risk management as a response to the financial crisis.  Risk management is not confined to risk specialist or control functions.  Current corporate governance for financial institutions is set out on a three-lines-of-defence model.  Business units are the first line of defence and are primarily responsible for managing risks on a day-to-day basis, taking into account the institution's risk tolerance and appetite, and in line with its policies, procedures and controls.  The second line of defence is a risk management function, which is independent of operations and management.  Its role is to challenge decisions that affect the institution's exposure to risk and to provide comprehensive and understandable information on risks, enabling the board to understand the institution's overall risk profile.  The third line of defence is an internal audit function, which assesses the adequacy of the operations of the other two lines.  Today, good governance requires that a chief risk officer should be an independent senior executive with distinct responsibility for this job.</p><p> In EBS these standards commenced with my appointment as a dedicated chief risk officer and member of the executive team in 2009.  From 2009, I presented a detailed risk report to the board each month with an independent assessment of the level of risk being run in various key areas and the actions management were taking to mitigate risks.  The number of board risk committee meetings increased and I met regularly with the chairman of the committee to discuss the risk position and outlook for the organisation.  The board credit approval committee was disbanded and board training programmes were extended.  We developed a risk appetite statement setting out the board's limit of risk appetite in each area and monitored and reported on adherence to this risk appetite statement on a monthly basis.  </p><p> A number of actions were taken to mitigate, where possible, the extent of the downturn in the Irish economy and property market on the society's balance sheet and to manage the business on a day-to-day basis through the global credit crunch.  Lending criteria were tightened.  We brought in external, experienced credit resources to advise us on how to manage our business through a downturn.</p><p>The credit function was reconfigured to manage distressed assets and those at risk of becoming distressed.  From the first quarter of 2009, we conducted quarterly reviews of at-risk and impaired cases which informed provision estimates.  We commissioned an external firm to review potential mortgage debt solutions in place internationally and we presented the findings of this review to the Oireachtas committee in 2009.</p><p> We completed a number of control enhancement programmes.  These included enhancements to commercial property documentation and security and deeds management.  It ensured that no legal discounts were applied by NAMA, nor capital add-ons applied by the regulator, as a result of missing or incomplete data or documentation.  And, of course, throughout the period 2009 to 2011, we monitored funding and liquidity positions very closely and took all actions available to us to avert the risk of a run on deposits and to make contingency plans for that eventuality or possibility.</p><p> Some concluding remarks, if I may?  The crisis and its aftermath have been debilitating in terms of Irish people's financial health.  I fully acknowledge my share of responsibility, together with all who worked in EBS in the pre-crisis period, for that failure, however unintended.  From 2009, I worked to the best of my ability with the executive team of EBS, overseen by the board, to minimise, where we could, its impact on customers, on EBS and on the economy.  And I am sorry that we could not do more.</p><p> Concerns of a housing bubble at the start of the 2000s dissipated in the face of sustained economic growth and the apparent levels of increased wealth, reinforced by positive commentary from external bodies and commentators.  The system misjudged both the probability of an economic and property market collapse occurring, and its impact in terms of loan losses when compounded by an international credit crunch - a one-in-100-year event.  It has taken more than six years to fully realise the impact of the deterioration in asset quality which concluded with the publication of the European Central Bank's comprehensive assessment results in October of last year.</p><p> In the past, policy followed strategy.  Risk appetite and risk capacity are now considerations which feed into banks' strategy-setting processes.  Limits of risk appetite, in pursuit of the agreed strategy, are set out in banks' risk appetite statements.  Regulatory mandated recovery plans ensure that early warning indicators inform banks where action is needed to prevent bank failure.</p><p> Excessive competition must be curbed where it threatens the stability and soundness of the banking system, a concept at the heart of conduct risk considerations.  And I think the recent example of the loan-to-value cap for first-time buyers is a welcome development in this regard.</p><p> Finally, it may sound self-evident to state that banks are, at the end of the day, credit institutions.  There needs to be sufficient credit expertise and credit risk evaluation at each level of the organisation, from the boardroom to the bank branches.  Thank you very much.</p></speech>

Just in your own address to us, that you sent in in the core documents you said the traditional conservative approach to lending in EBS unravelled in the period 2000 to 2007.  Would you like to expand on that?</p></speech>

Competitive pressures put institutions in a place where they made decisions to extend their credit criteria in a way they hadn't prior to that.  It was informed by enormously strong economic growth from the mid-'90s, affordability was very substantially improved with the reduction in tax rates and the low interest rate environment.  Also, there were a number of households where there were two incomes rather than one income as women returned to work, given the demarginalisation of the tax rates.  So decisions were made very much informed by a very positive economic environment and a view that that positive economic environment would be sustained.  We now know, with the benefit, of course, of hindsight, that that wasn't the case and the soft landing that people spoke about for many years in the early 2000s became a very, very hard landing at the end of the day.</p></speech>

Book 1 at page 143 and book 1 at page 147.</p><p>The first one refers to loan approvals of &euro;54.7 million sought for noon the following day, increasing the connected exposure to &euro;88.7 million, and the second one is a 24-hour turnaround for approval for &euro;23.96 million.  It's hard to imagine anything further from the model of a group of teachers assisting each other with their house expenses.  So, what was going on at that time?</p></speech>

I wasn't part of the executive and I wasn't involved in the loan approval process but, clearly, what happened was that the society made a decision to step up its lending to land and development sector.  To support the approval of larger loans, it had established a board credit approval committee in 2003 and I think, probably not unlike any other institution, it had a process in place whereby loans were approved within a certain period of time, generally 24 hours.  It was one of the issues that the chairman of the board risk committee raised with me when I became chief risk officer, that he had felt that non-executive directors shouldn't actually be involved in credit decisions.  And we made the decision, reasonably quickly, to close the board credit approval committee.</p></speech>

I see, on page 4 of your document to us, "Having recognised that it could not survive in its current form, EBS was [doing the things you just described]".  Mr. Murphy did present to us that it could've survived and that building societies of the traditional kind have survived in the United Kingdom, for example.  Did we throw out the wrong kind of organisation?</p></speech>

I joined it in 1991, I was doing a master's with Trinity and I wanted to find out the difference between an annuity and an endowment mortgage so I joined it for six months and I stayed there for a very long time thereafter.  I think it would be nice to believe that that society model could have been sustained.  My own personal belief is the availability of credit and the very intensive competition in the market from the early 2000s meant that had EBS decided to retain its 1990s model, if I can call it that - the one I was familiar with - I'm not sure that any board would have - and I am speculating, so let me say that - I'm not sure that any board would have voluntarily taken itself out of the market that it felt was its business to be in and that was providing mortgages to homeowners, traditionally teachers, guards and PAYE workers.</p></speech>

I mean, we have some executive pay of &euro;700,000 a year, somebody getting &euro;1.87 million departure money and so on.  I mean, did the EBS lose the run of itself in that ... in the model it was adopting compared to its traditional one?</p></speech>

I've seen the numbers in relation to remuneration.  I saw them probably the first time that you did.  Not everyone was being paid anything like the levels that you're seeing there so I wouldn't say that it was ubiquitous across EBS or anything like it.  And, clearly, they related, in the main, to members of the executive rather than people who were at middle management or lower management.</p></speech>

I suppose, I mean, I had the benefit ... or not the benefit but certainly the position of looking backwards when I became CRO in 2009 at what had happened before.  We did a lot of backward review in preparing our submission to the ... for the restructuring plan.  So it is clear - again, with the benefit of hindsight - that the availability of credit and the ... on one side, and the demand for ... availability of wholesale funding ... and the demand for credit, on the other side, coincided and all financial institutions moved away from purely funding their balance sheet with ... their lending with deposits.</p><p>I suppose in a ... in the environment in which Ireland was operating, there wouldn't have been sufficient savings to fuel the type of growth that we saw in the 2000s.</p></speech>

There is a paper that, I think, follows that board minute, which is from the group treasurer, and sets out the proposal to provide those lines of credit and to increase, therefore, the overall line of exposure to the sovereign.  As both Alan Merriman today, I think, and Fergus Murphy said last week, there was, I believe, a view that that would ... that was not a particular risk for the society at that time.  They were all for banks and institutions that were covered by the guarantee scheme and I think you'll see in the treasurer's note that what was being proposed were lines of credit that would be fully covered by the guarantee scheme within the terms of the guarantee scheme.</p></speech>

Could I refer to ... there's a contrast, isn't there, I think, between what was called light-touch regulation but in fact, a fairly substantial level of adverse findings, over a long number of years, by the regulator where EBS is concerned.  In Vol. 2, page 175, there is a letter, I think in 2003, pointing out this.  And they go right up to 2008, so there seemed to be a period, a long period, where this was a problem.  Page 175, I'll come to that one first, if I may.  Thank you, Chairman.  &quot;The examination&quot; ... and this one is from Dr. O'Reilly, who was the then regulator, it &quot;raises questions about the maintenance of lending standards in your institution. ...  a plan of remedial action addressing all of the issues [is due by the] end September&quot;.</p><p>And he wrote on 31 July:</p> <blockquote> 	We [...] request that the stated residential mortgage lending policy or institution should be reviewed and ratified by your Board at its next meeting.  [The] policy should incorporate the guidance on prudent loan assessment given by the Central Bank in July 2001 [...] </blockquote> <p>So that's, you know, in a sector which has been described as light-touch, that's fairly hands-on, requiring you to do very definite things in regard to prudent lending, for example.</p></speech>

So, absolutely, the regulator conducted regular - and continues to - inspections, where they come on-site, they request a number of loan files and they review them in detail, absolutely.</p><p>And on foot of that, they come up with a number of findings that you'll see through these core documents, that you'll have seen.  For those not in financial services they can look, and are, extensive.</p><p> In terms of the responses, we have typically found that a number of the individual items can be answered by return so it's not the regulator inspection team doesn't see or can't find a piece of documentation when they're actually on-site.  They have always been taken extremely seriously by EBS and I think they're response which I know is a draft version which follows from the letter on page 175, from the then chairman underlines that ... underlines the importance with which the society takes these findings.  In this particular instance, I think there is confirmation that the policy was reviewed and ratified by the board in March 2003 and that it did take into account all of the prudent lending guidelines as set out by the regulator.</p></speech>

Where there's a very strong letter from Yvonne Madden of the Financial Regulator to Mr. McGovern, and by my count there are 85 adverse findings and 93 recommendations and, you know, around page 63 there's ... 63 and 64, there's just adverse finding on top of adverse finding - no evidence of assessment, no evidence of intention to rent a room-----</p></speech>

So, the fact that this was four years after the 2003 letter, was the society lax in responding to the regulator?  What was going on?  Because this ... that, and another one in 2008 that ... there's a very high level of adverse finding from the regulator and a very high level of recommendations, going over about a five-year period.</p></speech>

There ... in terms of the individual findings for individual cases, as I think I've mentioned and others have mentioned, in general they were able to be dealt with by return in terms of reviewing the loan files and providing an update on each case or a piece of documentation that maybe the inspectors, when they were on-site, couldn't find.</p> <p>  The operations of the society were of course continuously reviewed by both its internal audit function and the external auditors.  And because EBS was involved in securitisation programmes and establishing covered bond banks, one of the, I suppose, ancillary benefits for a financial organisation at the time was that in order for loans to qualify and in order for any institution to be able to issue a bond, independent inspectors would come in and review substantially large numbers of cases.  And the ... if you didn't hit a 99% or 98% tolerance rate in relation to what documentation should be on file and what was available, you wouldn't qualify in order to issue a bond.  So, I don't believe that these documents represent an organisation that had very poor controls but I do believe that it was a valuable exercise on each occasion.  The Central Bank, as I said, continues to do these types of inspections and banks do take them very seriously.</p></speech>

This was, I think, in the early days of diversification.  It's a board minute of 31 May 2002 and there were approaches on that page - "Go for Broke" or "Toe in the Water".</p><p>And when you turn over, the commercial property market, which was what they were going into, the document itself says "Annualised [...] returns over the period 1990 to date (peaked at 38.2% in 1998, now down to just below zero)".  And when you go to year-to-date performance, the third item is, "Activity in the investment property area is down on last year (not surprising in view of the negative returns)".  So were the signs not there that diversifying away from a business which they're very good at, going into areas with returns below zero or negative returns, as on the ... page 96 there?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I can't give you any witness information in relation to that.  It dates to a time long before my appointment to either the executive team or the review.  I have seen this document in the booklet of documents.  I think, though, going back to where commercial property lending started in EBS, based on what I have seen in the society's records, it commenced in the early 1990s as a result of a change in building societies legislation.  And, at that time, EBS had a four or five ex-ICC members as senior executives, including the chief executive, who would have taken a decision to enter slowly into the commercial property sector and to limit the amount of lending to the commercial property sector to, I believe, 15% of the overall balance sheet.  I don't believe that percentage was ever exceeded.  And based on what I have seen, the intent was to create some form of diversification of risk because as a primary building society in Ireland, you had a very high level of concentration risk.  All of your assets were relating to residential property in one jurisdiction, which is one of the reasons that EBS, from ... actually from the 1970s, had put mortgage indemnity insurance in place.  And in the early 2000s when other institutions had other forms of types of insurance, including ... or moved away from mortgage indemnity insurance, and at a time where customers no longer wanted to pay for the bond that would need to be put in place, EBS took the decision to continue to put that insurance in place itself and to pay for it.</p></speech>

I think no one would argue with that with the benefit of hindsight.  Again, unfortunately, I wasn't a member of the executive and wasn't involved in this strategy review or presentation or discussion.  Certainly, when they were first introduced and, again, in an increasingly competitive environment, they ... I believe that people felt that the risk was lower because they typically were provided to customers with very ... or at the lower end of the loan-to-value spectrum so that there was some equation of how much risk are we taking in a loan and, therefore, what price should we charge for it?  But, clearly, those two things diverged, given the economic environment which ensued.  And EBS was involved in tracker mortgages albeit I believe to a substantially lesser extent than other institutions, as per Professor Nyberg's report.  I think he quotes EBS having an exposure to tracker mortgages of 20% <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>50% in some of the other institutions.</p></speech>

If I spoke about the board.  I think others have spoken today and last week and I, based on my knowledge, however it has been garnered, I believe the board wanted to preserve EBS as a mutual independent building society.  And I think if ... and I have reread the annual report and accounts of EBS over those years and they are informative in relation to what the key areas of focus for the society were.  And I suppose I'm really taking my information from there.  There was a desire to do what EBS had been established to do.  Provide mortgages to teachers, guards, nurses and, in the main, PAYE workers, that was EBS's core business.  But through time the pressure on margins as a result of what we now know is absolutely excessive competition meant that EBS was under pressure to be able to create capital.  And, I think, as Mr. Merriman has explained well earlier today, without the ability to create capital, it wouldn't have had any credit to make available to mortgage providers.  And, therefore, in effect, it didn't have a business model.</p><p>And I think that influenced its view to look at whether or not it felt that there were other forms of non-core business it could get into, and I suppose, because it had entered commercial property lending in the early 1990s, it possibly felt that it had built up 15 years of experience in that area and, therefore, stepping further along the spectrum in whatever way, as we now know, was decided, was ... was appropriate at the time.</p></speech>

I know it's called a one-in-a-100-year event, which we now actually use to inform what's called reverse stress testing in banks, so we come up with situations which will actually break the bank, and look at what would the things that a bank would need to take to prevent that, if possible, from happening.  That sort of thinking wasn't in banking, I believe, in the early 2000s.  And, again, I believe if people had felt that they were taking a very aggressive or, or dangerous stance that would threaten the viability of what it is they were setting out to preserve, I don't believe they'd have made that decision.</p></speech>

If you remember, Basel II, as it was called, so a new capital requirements directive which ... which effectively gave banks options in terms of their own internal modelling and capital requirements, was to say, if you've got a model internally that you use to make business decisions and you can prove that that model holds through time, we will allow you to hold an appropriate amount of capital for that.  Alternatively, if you can't do that, you've to hold a standardised amount of risk.  Those models were only beginning to be built in the 2000s ... The risk controls, risk functions, risk thinking, establishment of board risk committees, independence of chief risk officers, board oversight, all of those things changed very, very substantially over the past 15 years.</p></speech>

I think, as Mr. Merriman said earlier today, it was becoming evident from the end of 2007 that things were changing, certainly not to the extent of what happened.  But with the collapse of Lehman's and a pressure on, on funding and liquidity beginning to be felt, and I think 2007 was the first year where there was an actual negative growth in house prices for the first time, there were signals there that thing were beginning to change and, therefore, it was not a surprise that the society looked at what the future would be and again, with a new chief executive officer in Mr. Murphy, coming to the society from ... not only from externally, but also from another jurisdiction, it would have given him, and did I believe, clear and clean eyes to look at the business model and to determine that it did need to be changed, and changed quickly.</p></speech>

What the regulator was calling out was that in their opinion, at that time, you shouldn't have someone who was responsible for risk who's also responsible for managing a business line within an organisation.  And if we come to where we are today in terms of good corporate governance, it's now mandated that this is an independent function, independent of all business and operations.</p></speech>

I think, as Mr. Merriman said earlier today, he had a huge number of responsibilities.  Thinking today, and we saw it emerging in 2007, but thinking today is it is beneficial for a bank to have someone who's independent of the business, to be able to challenge without any possible conflict, decisions that might be made.</p></speech>

Just moving on in the same book, up to page 109, this is the minutes of a board nominations committee meeting on 19 February 2009.  On page 109 and turning over to page 110, and we have about two people who were invited not to reapply for re-election to the board.  And just to comment on that in relation to Mr. Merriman, who was one of them, the minutes talk about accountability and about the perception of accountability.  So in relation to Mr. Merriman, which was this in your view?</p></speech>

As Mr. Merriman said, and I think as was well articulated in the 2008 accounts of EBS, the then chairman who had been chairman for two years set out that, given that the society was reporting losses for the first time, the society felt it needed to demonstrate accountability to its members and it wanted to do that both at board level and also at executive level.  And as Mr. Merriman said earlier himself, he felt he was probably the right person from an executive level.  Is any one person responsible for the decisions of the society?  I don't believe so.  The decisions and the risk decisions of the society and indeed any bank, are a collective responsibility, in my opinion, of the board and also of the full executive team.</p></speech>

I know ... I heard Ms Tinney earlier say that she felt that his skills would have been useful to the society and certainly we heard from, I think, Mr. Merriman today to say that his preference would have been to stay.  I think the overriding consideration was as a mutual, EBS wanted to demonstrate accountability to members first and foremost and it took the decision to put that consideration above other considerations.</p></speech>

So I think this decision, in relation to whether or not to reappoint someone to the overall board, was taken in the context that, having launched a broker business and having then had to shut it down, that there was no requirement to have an additional executive director on the board of EBS from that time.</p></speech>

And it did that based on, again, what I've read from the records, and what I was involved in from a risk perspective in reviewing, it did that in order to create a business that potentially could be sold at a later date.  And, therefore, having arm's length third-party servicing would be a benefit to the model.  Having invested in all of that, it was decided to continue with a view, in the future potentially, to having other options and potentially, selling it on, if appropriate, at some future date.</p></speech>

I think someone described it well at one time was, it was a good idea at the wrong time.  And so the society made decisions on the basis of, it had very little credit to make available, that if it was making any credit available from 2008 and 2009, it was going to make it available to home owners and people who desired to home, own homes, in Ireland and to its core membership.  So it ceased to provide credit to Haven.  But the capability was held and actually AIB Bank now is using that capability in terms of its own broader business model, so Haven has ... effectively survived.</p></speech>

So I was appointed company secretary in July 2008, I had been deputy company secretary for a year prior to that.  Separate to that, I was head of risk, responsible for, as I've mentioned earlier, producing enterprise risk reports for the organisation, supporting its risk committees, reviewing the risk disclosures of the society, helping conduct risk assessments-----</p></speech>

Because I've been just looking at the EBS annual reports and I'm utterly confused, I have to say. For example, 2005, you are ... let me find it here now ... you're listed under "Executive Forum".</p><p>No, sorry, maybe go back to 2005.  So you're under "Management and Head of Risk" in the 2005 report.  The 2006 report has you under "Management" again and it just says "Risk".  And then, 2007. "Executive Forum - Credit and Risk".  Can you just clarify was there a change from '05, '06, '07?</p></speech>

There was a change from '05-'06, so the executive forum was, I suppose, a management body that sat underneath the executive.  So you had the board of EBS, we had the executive team and then you had, effectively, a senior management group and that's what the executive forum is.  My responsibilities changed quite substantially over the period 2003-2008-----</p></speech>

Ms Clarke, Haven, the broker market business of EBS, was a significant change for EBS.</p></speech>

I just reference, in the particular document, the "Broker Market Entry" here ... it's the "Board Update" document.  It's in the core documents.

Haven, the broker market of EBS, was a significant change for the EBS.  And the board was updated in '05 around that.

I think the driver, based on what I've read and what you have too, was that, I think, by 2005-2006, 40% of all mortgage lending was being done through brokers.</p></speech>

And I think that was the primary driver behind the board's decision to ... to progress with a broker channel.</p></speech>

But there was one very important distinction and that was that the society was prepared to pay for mortgage indemnity insurance for its core business, but it was not prepared to pay for mortgage indemnity insurance for its broker business.  And, therefore, the loan-to-value exposures that it would entertain for broker business were different.</p></speech>

EBS increased commercial and development lending significantly in the period from 2003 onwards.  I'll just go through some of the slides that we have here.  The first one here is actually this one that went up.  Okay, you see at the top of the screen there, Ms Clarke, "A self assessment process has been completed on commercial property lending and 29 risks were identified, one of which was external.  There are 6 risks that are considered high in nature".  It then goes through various bullet points.  Just noting the first two of them, "Concentration risks on large exposures which could provide a bad debts exposure or large redemptions".  And, secondly, "Making losses due to bad lending decisions".</p> <p>  I'll just move on to the next slide, which the 005.  What we have here at the end of the page is a whole load of product offering by the society and just how ... and the upper slide ... a demonstration of how the whole mortgage market was moving in 2006.</p> <p>  On to the next slide, which is 006, the highlighted section there is "Change the Stress Test on Interest Rate" and how the current policy, which was a stress test at the standard variable rate in the next column of +2% to move up to a 6% that you were exceeding to maybe be 1% above it.</p> <p>  And the on to... I'll just skip on to another couple of slides.  This is from 2005 and it says 100% mortgages move from pilot to permanent solution.  EBS are considering a number of options round 100% mortgages at the time.  Option 1 is "Increase Price" and that is not considered an option.  As you can see this is in red, because consideration as "Market pricing would make it difficult to charge a higher rate for this product.  Most lenders are charging between 3.1% and 3.25% for this product", that's some less the standard variable rate.  There is 2, "Reduce Cost", which is "Genworth have indicated that they will not reduce pricing for this cover.  We may be able to negotiate some reduction base lending to state guaranteed employment sector; not agreed at this juncture."</p> <p>  I just want to stop there for a moment.  What was Genworth's problem?</p></speech>

I think I have made reference earlier to the fact that in the 1990s, five or six of the executives and most senior people, including the chief executive officer, were ex-ICC people.  They had a huge amount of expertise in, in commercial lending.  I think one of the lessons learned and, you know, one of the things we can see now looking back is that because Ireland went through 15, 20 years of quite a benign economic climate, the people who'd, you know, cut their teeth in credit by lending and maybe making losses, all of those people had passed through the system by the time, you know, the mid-90s had come and that was reflected very much, I believe, in the fact that when we were trying to get our hands around the extent of this problem in 2008, 2009, 2010, we had to bring people back out of retirement from other organisations to help us or people over from England to help us to help us get our hands around how do we go about managing that.</p></speech>

Absolutely there was excessive competition in the market, which led to downward pressure on the society's core business, which led it to take decisions about what it could do to remain viable, which led it to, I believe, agree to a proposal to step up lending to a land and development sector at a time that, it transpired, was the very height of the market, unknown at the time.

One of the documents we looked at earlier on was decisions in relation to credit policy from 2006 and, actually, at that time we recommended that we share our proposed changes with the regulator and we would have often invited the regulator in or ... at reasonable intervals if we felt there was something that would be of value for them to know.  I do believe it was a ... from what I could see, it was, you know, there were small teams in terms of inspection teams.  I think in terms of the broader structure of the Financial Regulator from top level through middle level through the inspection teams ... you know, it's hard for me to comment on the upper levels because I would have had no interaction with them.</p></speech>
