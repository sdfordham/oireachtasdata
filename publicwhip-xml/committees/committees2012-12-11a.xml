This section provides that an authorised officer may require a person to take such steps as are necessary to alleviate a case where an animal is in acute distress or an acute state of distress.  This would include obtaining necessary veterinary care or providing appropriate shelter or food.  A person who fails to comply with this provision commits an offence.  Should this not be enough, the officer may seize and detain the animal before disposing of it, including by re-homing.</p><p>  I understand the reason for this amendment is that in the veterinary profession, "acute" has a more limited meaning than in ordinary language.  I have been advised by the Parliamentary Counsel that in interpreting legislation, the courts will follow the ordinary meaning of language, having regard to the context in which it is used rather than specialist use.  For that reason we are not proposing to accept the amendment.  Basically, I am taking the advice of Parliamentary Counsel over that of some veterinary practitioners around the concern about using the word "acute" in the profession.  I am obliged to take that advice.</p></speech>

In this context "acute" means serious, urgent and requiring attention.  That is the Webster's Dictionary meaning of the word "acute".  It applies if an animal is injured, suffering or in a state of acute neglect or distress.  In other words, if the matter is serious, urgent or requiring attention as a result of an animal's distress or neglect, an authorised officer may take measures.</p></speech>

The security officers built a nest for the swan, where it stayed until it was taken by animal welfare people today.</p></speech>

They are a series of minor amendments to improve the grammar and readability of the section.

If we examined secondary legislation it would avoid a lot of the gremlins that arise.  An announcement is made but nobody sees it going through the D&aacute;il and its passed.  Then unintended consequences arise.  My amendment would provide a good protection for future Ministers.  As with EU legislation, we should scrutinise all regulations here before they are signed by a Minister.  A committee may scrutinise regulation but it does not give it the power to overrule a Minister.  It does ensure that he or she hears the wisdom of the committee and takes it into account before signing off.  </p></speech>

There is a standard procedure surrounding the laying of regulations before the House.  I ask the Deputy to read the fourth last paragraph on page 10 of the Bill.  It defines the laying of regulations and orders and describes what is required.  It also describes what must be done to annul an order and how the House can take action.  I agree with the Deputy that before introducing a regulation, we should arrange a discussion by a committee to tease out the issues and thus ensure that we have got them right.  I do not know whether we need to insert a requirement for a Minister to do so in primary legislation.  I have been advised that such a provision is inadvisable.  It is the House that should decide whether a regulation goes to a committee for consideration.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.  It goes too far into primary legislation even though it would make some sense to do it from an agricultural and animal health point of view.</p></speech>

I remember one regulation that could have been contentious but we twice went over very detailed procedure and followed the advice given by the committee.  What could have been contentious turned out to be not contentious at all.</p><p>  I believe that one is not going to change matters by making something desirable.  The reality is that Ministers will be told that it is desirable to bring regulations to a committee but they are in a hurry because Departments always issue them at the last minute.  A Minister is told that he or she must sign the regulation and, therefore, nothing will change.  Obviously the House is controlled by whatever government is in power.  That is the reality of the system that we operate.  I am not sure that it is easy to change that part of the system.  I would not like to live with the American system where its Executive does not have a working majority in the house so nothing gets done.  I am not opposed to the idea of the Executive having a working majority in the House unless it steps completely out of bounds.  Of course I mean a practical working majority and not a theoretical one.  To ensure that there is proper debate we must build on what we have done with EU legislation and the provision must be written into primary legislation otherwise there will be no progress.  I would prefer if the Government introduced an omnibus ruling or a new Standing Order that no regulation could be passed unless it was referred to an appropriate committee.  I will not hold my breath to see if that will happen in the short term.</p><p>  I ask the Minister to accept my amendment. This is one case that is not based on technical advice supplied by a draftsperson.  The Minister has received policy advice not to bring all of this down on our heads because it is too much hassle.  Legislating can never be too much hassle.  Every shortcut taken with legislation - all governments have done it - has always proven to be the most vulnerable to controversy and difficulty.</p></speech>

This may be a pedantic point but until someone identifies it, it is not identified.  My view is that it is intended to refer to cases where it is not possible to identify it.  If one sees a cow at 100 yards, one has not identified it but if one reads the ear tag, one identifies it.  The fact that it is not identified may mean that it has not been examined in order to identify it.  In contrast, if one includes the phrase &quot;possible to identify&quot; one refers to the fact that one tried to identify it but did not succeed.</p></speech>

The context of use of the word "identified" is the reference in the Bill, "it is not identified in accordance with animal health and welfare regulations", which are quite clear in terms of what identifies an animal in respect of traceability.  The real danger is imported animals without identification and the disease risk they pose.  The identification systems provide important safeguards and reassurance to customers domestically and internationally and there is no room for doubt.  If an animal is untagged and lacks the proper papers, then it is not identified.  To change this wording from "not identified" to "not possible to identify" would make it unenforceable.  If a sheep has no tags then it is not identified.  If the amendment were accepted, the subsection could never be applied as it is always possible to identify it if one can tag it.  That does not change the fact that one may not know where it originated or the disease risk it poses.  Its disease status remains unverifiable, therefore it presents a real danger to the health status of our country as a whole and the viability of our highly export-orientated agri-food sector.  It may also be a threat to public health if it enters the food chain.  It is with this concern in mind that unidentified animals are in breach of EU regulations, which require that animals be identified with reference to a register and tags.  Furthermore, these EU regulations provide for remedial action if tags are lost.</p><p>  This has been an issue in some Border counties when we had disease risk.  We needed to take action.  If animals were abandoned and the tags were removed from their ears, we had to be able to take action.  Under the regulations, it is possible to re-tag animals.  For example, it may not be common practice but it happens quite a lot that mountain sheep lose tags.  We do not want animals that lose their tags in a commonage area or in mountainous areas, having been caught in a hedge or a wall, should be deemed to be not identified.  That is dealt with under the regulations for re-tagging.  The strong advice is that we need to be legally clear and strong in this area in respect of the powers of the Minister.  For the reasons outlined, the current wording is stronger than that proposed by the Deputy.</p></speech>

It relates to compensation for owners of animals when those animals must be put down or removed from the herd in the case of TB and so on.  The valuation around that is a complex enough matter to get right in legislation.  The wording as it stands proposes the Minister would propose a valuer and if the farmer was not happy with that valuer, the Minister would propose a second valuer.  If the farmer still was not happy with the valuation from the second valuer, the Minister would propose an arbiter for arbitration.  I felt that was a one-sided process in terms of the person choosing the people involved.  I propose to change this by removing this section and inserting a new section under amendment No. 60.  This is a much more measured way to deal with this.</p></speech>

It is an improvement on what was there before.  I also accept the Minister's statement that one cannot value individual chickens or whatever.  My worry is that a Minister could start issuing guidelines that would mean that people would not get full compensation at the value on the day.  I will reflect on the issue.  We have a new section.  Of course I would like to have a section amended to state that all these regulations would have to come before the House, which we can do on Report Stage.</p><p>  I will move my amendment later.  In the meantime, I will reflect on what the Minister has said in his explanations, then we can come back to this on Report Stage.</p></speech>

I fully accept there are situations as the Minister has outlined in which compensation should not and cannot be paid.  People cannot be compensated if they have drawn the problem on themselves.  I believe that if compensation is refused, there is a right to seek an independent appeal and it is very important that people would be informed about that and the associated timeframe.  As the processes become more thorough, they also become much longer.  Those of us who deal with the Ombudsman find that one would nearly need to take the Ombudsman to the Ombudsman because of the delays which have become pervasive across the system.</p></speech>

However, a person may challenge a Minister's decision in the courts.  The Department does not have an appeals process in place because it would be farcical to have the Department deal with an appeal against a decision made by the Minister.  Two valuation systems and one arbitration system are in place for this reason.  While the Minister can introduce guidelines, he or she cannot decide on a valuation of an animal.

The same principle applies where a person takes a case to court to secure a small amount because the risk and costs of going to court far outweigh the benefit the person may obtain from compensation.

The Minister will inform the person in writing of the reason for non-payment and the person will have an opportunity to query the Minister's decision.  The Minister is then required by law to consider any such representations and inform the owner of his or her subsequent decision in writing.  The decision can then be challenged in the courts if a person is denied compensation.</p></speech>

In a logical world we would get the whole Oireachtas to agree that no regulations would be introduced without first being discussed at the relevant committee, but we do not live in logical world.  If I am waiting for that to happen on a global scale, given the lack of progress in D&aacute;il reform, I will be left waiting.  What is needed to change this procedure, therefore, is a courageous Minister to become the bridgehead of change and to accept that what has been common in the past should not be accepted, in light of what the Taoiseach said on the day the Government was formed, that there would be a new way of doing things in the House and that Ministers would be much more accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister could lead the way and I would hope all his colleagues would follow and that an omnibus arrangement by order of the House would come into place specifying that all regulations, under whatever legislation, would be discussed with the relevant committee before being signed off by the House.  I ask the Minister to reflect on the issue between now and Report Stage.  Perhaps on Report Stage he will be able to say the Government has made a decision that from now on there will be primary legislation to amend legislation to ensure all regulations come before committees of the House.  If that happens, I will withdraw the amendment.  Having been a Minister and having started a process of discussing regulations with the committee, my experience was that it was helpful and should be provided for in the legislation.  That nobody else is doing it does not mean the Minister should not lead.</p></speech>

To be clear on the actual definition of the laying of a regulation and orders, every regulation and order made under this Act, other than an order made under section 12 or regulation made under section 26, shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if a resolution annulling the regulation or order is passed by either House within the next 21 days on which that House sits after the regulation or order is laid before it, the regulation or order is annulled, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.  In other words, a Minister can pass a regulation and it can be introduced immediately.  The D&aacute;il can then choose to annul that regulation within 21 days.  That is my understanding of how it works.  If either House of the Oireachtas deems that to be a mistake it can annul it within 21 days.</p></speech>

This amendment proposes this should be changed to "an authorised officer should enter and inspect".  That does not make sense in that one wishes to give them the option to do it rather than telling them they should be doing it.  Clearly, entering a premises is a last resort and one would need to have very good reason to do that.  Perhaps this amendment is not a mistake but it does not make too much sense to me.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 79 to section 50 will allow for a printed copy of a record that is maintained in electronic form to be used in court.  Second, it is to allow for the fact that some data may be kept in electronic form and to clarify that information kept in this way may be used as evidence in proceedings.  People may ask what happens in the case of someone altering a computer record.  The evidence of a copy could then be rebutted, for example, by producing an unaltered original.  It is rather legalistic.  The second of the two amendments being discussed together is to ensure one can get sworn statements from authorised officers and use them in court as evidence, rather than obliging officers to travel and attend all the hearings.  I believe this proposal makes sense and I hope the Deputies will accept it.</p></speech>

I also indicated my intention to oppose this section and that Fianna F&aacute;il would not allow on-the-spot fines at all.  I acknowledge the idea was to take the process out of the courts and, to a point, so doing is very neat and handy.  However, someone who was trigger-happy could fine one on what he or she considered to be reasonable grounds and then allow one to appeal to the courts.  Consequently, it could work contrariwise to the intention of the Minister.</p><p>  I acknowledge the Minister's intention is to remove this process entirely from the courts.  That is fine in the case of speeding or parking offences, because there is a 99% certainty that the person concerned has parked illegally if one finds him or her parked on a double yellow line or without a parking ticket and so on.  Similarly, in the case of a speed gun, it is not merely reasonable opinion but is a little stronger than that, as there is much evidence that the person concerned was speeding.  In this case, however, the Bill proposes to allow on-the-spot fines on the basis of reasonable opinion, not evidence.  As I noted, instead of taking the law out of this, a trigger-happy official could start firing out on-the-spot fines all over the place on the basis of his or her reasonable opinion while stating those who did not like it could go to court.</p> <p>That is like telling someone who is refused planning permission in Galway to go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There is no chance there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-11a.229" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2012121100014#N00200"><p>The idea behind this section is that, where possible, we should try to keep offences out of court, which is the same rationale behind the penalty points system whereby if people accept they are at fault and want to pay up and be done with it having learned their lesson, we should have a system that facilitates that.  If somebody has mistreated an animal, either a domestic animal owner or a farmer, and he or she is called on by an authorised officer, that officer should have the power to issue a fixed payment notice, which would also give an instruction about what needs to be done to deal with the animal welfare issue.  It will be positive for animal owners or farmers, in particular, to stay out of court and the fine of &euro;250 will be a rap over the knuckles with an instruction to improve animal welfare and deal with the issue raised.</p><p>  I have listened to the arguments and I do not understand why farming organisations have a problem with this.  Would they rather that farmers or animal owners be taken to court for relatively minor animal welfare legislation breaches or a fixed penalty notice, which would not require a court hearing or result in a criminal record and all the stress and cost that brings?  If I have, as the Deputy describes them, trigger happy authorised officers, I should remove them from the list because that is not the way they should behave.  Authorised officers should be consistent, operate under a common code in terms of how they behave and interact with people they are encountering or inspecting.  My understanding is that while an authorised officer visits a farm, for example, the Department issues the fixed payment notice.  When an animal's welfare issue is prosecuted following a visit to a farm or a home owner, the officer must go back to the Department for a decision on the issuance of a fixed payment notice.  People who are overly eager to dish out such notices or who want to flex their muscles should not be authorised officers and even if they are, they cannot issue notices on the spot.  They need to return to the Department to seek sanction to issue a notice, which is a relatively small fine in addition to a notice requiring a change of practice.</p><p>  The alternative is that authorised officers take people to court.  That is the only option available to them and this is madness.  It is the nuclear option every time where either nothing is done or people are taken to court.  We are trying to arrive at a middle ground where when it is reasonable to say to a farmer that he or she should not do what he or she is doing or to say to an animal owner that what he or she is doing is unacceptable and he or she should pay &euro;250, read the notice and conditions and we will leave it at that.  Everybody can learn a lesson and move on.  That is a sensible approach, which is being put in place to protect animal owners from being taken to court for oversights or for doing something that is not a significant breach of the legislation.  In the same way many people are happy to accept penalty points for motoring offences rather than receiving a summons to appear in court, in most cases people would accept a fine under this section if they recognise they have something wrong and can move on from that.  If they think they are being hard done by, they can go to court where they would have been taken anyway.  I do not understand why people are so nervous about this measure, which offers an out of court settlement that both sides should welcome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-11a.230" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="15:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2012121100014#N00300"><p>The Minister is making great play about people wondering about trigger happy authorised officers.  I have witnessed trigger happy garda&iacute; who have caught people.  With something as black and white as speeding, it is like shooting fish in a barrel given the places they pick on a good wide road on a fine day to set up a speed trap.  They catch enough people to fill their quota of fines.  The notion that there are no trigger happy officials and there are processes in place to monitor them is belied by what everybody knows has been common practice to deal with something as simple as speeding because, traditionally, speed traps would not be found on bad bends on bad roads.  That was something we changed when we were in government.  When we brought in the legislation to provide for speed cameras, we said they had to be erected at known accident spots because the safest roads tended to have the most cameras.</p><p>  The one major difference, however, regarding fixed penalties is they normally issue for clear black and white offences that require a physical measurement.  For example, the parking of a car on double yellow line can be clearly identified. The latest speed cameras capture images of both the car and the driver, which means clear evidence can be shown to the driver and used by the garda.  Speeding is a calculable offence.  In other words, once the licence plate and driver are identified, the speed can be measured.  Some motoring offences are prosecutable on the basis of reasonable opinion, for example, careless or dangerous driving which are not measurable.  These offences are prosecuted in court and if the garda has a reasonable opinion that the motorist was driving carelessly, it is not considerable for an on-the-spot fine or penalty points and the only person competent to decide is a judge.  All fixed penalties apply to measurable offences.  Unfortunately, animal welfare breaches are not measurable in the same way and, therefore, there will be significant differences between strict authorised officers and less strict officers.  The senior official cannot go to the farm to examine the issues and he or she will be faced with many reasonable opinions if he or she is to overturn the official's decision.  At the very least, the section should be deleted because it has not been thought out.  It is unprecedented to impose on-the-spot fines in matters of opinion rather than mathematical fact.  In this case, the Minister should accept the amendment that provides there should be evidence at the very least.</p></speech>

The Minister has clearly set out his position on the matter.</p><p>  A case may arise where an authorised officer seems to be coming back to his or her senior authority with more fines than others or seems to be more detailed and diligent than others in getting fines.  Is there a system in the Department for checking whether somebody is trigger-happy?  Some fines relate to a farmer having a lame sheep where it might take a day to realise that the sheep is lame.  There should be a mechanism to address when somebody is being over-zealous and where it is pointed out to him or her that he or she is not taking all reasonable measures.  Such a mechanism would give us peace of mind.  </p></speech>

We spoke earlier about people being afraid to go to court because of the cost.  If there is an allegation or suspicion that a person is committing an offence and he or she has a fixed fine or payment notice served upon him or her, he or she could find himself or herself under pressure to pay the fine or fixed payment rather than go through due process even though he or she believes himself or herself to be innocent.  It will be undoubtedly viewed by sections of rural communities as a money-gathering exercise for local authorities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-11a.235" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2012121100015#O00300"><p>I will make some comments because there is a misunderstanding regarding what we are trying to do.  In order for an individual to get a fixed penalty notice, someone will have to carry out an inspection and go back to the local authority on reasonable grounds and a second authorised officer must approve that.  Two people must be involved.  Perhaps we can improve the wording but section 49(1) states that where an officer of the Minister, authorised by the Minister in that behalf or a local authority, authorised by the manager of the authority in that behalf, has reasonable grounds for believing that a person is committing or has committed an offence, he or she can serve a notice on that person.  This is not just one person who is trigger-happy or over-zealous.  It is a system that allows a person who has made an inspection and thinks there are reasonable grounds for sending a fixed penalty notice to offer somebody the option of just paying up and forgetting about it.  According to section 49(1)(<i>c</i>), a person is not obliged to make the payment.  If a farmer or pet owner decides that he or she has done nothing wrong and will not pay, he or she will not be taken to court for not paying.  The onus would still be on the authorised officer, the Department or local authority to take that person to court, as they would or would not have done if this was not there.  There is no downside to this for the owner.  He or she is given the option to pay the fine, fix the problem and forget about it or do nothing and let the law take its course.</p><p>  We put in this section to protect animal owners, not to improve enforcement.  We can take someone to court if we have reasonable grounds for believing that he or she has been cruel to the animal or responsible for significant welfare issues.  We can put the evidence before the court and it only becomes evidence when it is laid before the court.  It is reasonable grounds when one is putting the case together.  If the person feels it is not fair to ask him or her to pay up, he or she has the option of not paying.  There is no offence involved in not paying.  Not paying does not affect the subsequent court case if there is to be such a case.  It is made clear here.  Section 49(1)(<i>d</i>) states that &quot;a prosecution in respect of the alleged offence will not be instituted during the period specified in the notice and, if the payment specified in the notice is made during that period, no prosecution in respect of the alleged offence will be instituted.&quot;  The question of whether one pays the money or not is irrelevant to the case if it is taken at a later stage.  What it does stipulate is that if somebody gets a fixed penalty notice, he or she has the option to kill it there and then by paying up or doing nothing and when the fixed notice period ends, he or she can expect either to be taken to court or for the matter to be dropped.  </p><p>  The upside is for the person who committed the offence not the authorised officers.  I can only think it due to a misunderstanding that people believe this to be some kind of charter for overly zealous inspectors to hand out on-the-spot fines.  That is not what this was intended to do.  Two people must make that decision and the decision to send out a fixed notice must be authorised in a local authority or in the Minister's office.  It is then up to the person.  If he or she feels that this is an unfair process, he or she can do nothing and let the law take its course.  It does not cost him or her anything.  He or she is not doing anything he or she would not otherwise have done under the current legislative structure whereby we take someone to court if we have reasonable grounds for believing he or she is committing an offence.  We tried to introduce a system that would short-circuit us having to go to court, and bearing the cost of that, and keeping people out of court when they do not need to be there.</p><p>  I understand that people might see this as a revenue-raising exercise but it is not.  This is an option for people who have been caught out because they have been doing something that they should not have been doing.  It allows them to deal with the problem speedily.  Obviously, if they are caught a second and third time, the option may be to take them to court rather than giving them a fixed penalty notice.  I find it difficult to understand why people are as suspicious as members seem to be about it.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; C&uacute;iv mentioned that other aspects of the law are black and white in that they are based on facts.  Many cases relating to animal welfare come down to interpretation by the person observing.  I am not casting aspersions on anybody but people making that interpretation and judgment as to whether to impose a fixed penalty payment might not understand what it is to be a member of a farming community with animals.  If people pass a field in the middle of winter with snow on the ground and see animals there, some of them might interpret that as cruelty.</p></speech>

Some people think human and animal comfort are the same thing and want one to build very enclosed sheds whereas if one puts the animals in the part of the world in which I live into a closed shed, they get pneumonia.  They would survive better on a mountain than they would in a shed, particularly mountain sheep.  I am sure the Chairman will testify to that.  It is totally counter-intuitive but these animals thrive in conditions in which we would perish, while they would perish in conditions in which we thrive.  When I first saw this and when the Minister's officials spoke about it, I thought it was a great idea that would save us all bother because it must be asked, who wants to go to court?</p></speech>

Most people who did not get good technical advice would believe that solicitors would not defend their cases for less than &euro;1,000, and that would even be before they passed through the court door.  People might as well stump up and shut up instead of paying more in legal fees than is outstanding in the fine.  The wise approach would be to advise a person to wait to see if a summons is issued.</p></speech>

Using the pool of people who have experience in preventing animal cruelty and in managing same will be useful in an urban environment.  However, this is not the intention in terms of agricultural holdings.  We have debated this issue previously.  To my mind, providing a farmer or someone else with an alternative to court is a protective measure for the individual, in that it would keep him or her out of court, and is not meant to be used as an excuse to dish out numerous fines to make money.</p></speech>

Forgive my input as Chairman, but I am mindful of a cross-departmental issue.  We are trying to get agreement on deeming environmental wardens, dog wardens and park rangers as authorised officers.  I am sure that it is the case in many areas, but we have a serious problem concerning dogs on the hills in that they are brought onto open mountains by casual walkers and are causing carnage.  Neither a park ranger nor a dog warden can be an authorised officer.  There is a blatant disregard for animal welfare.  If the person identified as the animal's owner was required to pay an on-the-spot fine, he or she might be deterred.  Signs are fine, but this measure would be helpful.  It goes beyond farmers.  Indeed, it protects farmers.</p></speech>

It is a definable offence.  One could take a photograph of the person to prove the point.  The problem is that we are discussing new territory.  What would happen if we decided that careless or dangerous driving was to receive an on-the-spot fine?

At the outset I want to make it clear that there is no intention to introduce new fees in this legislation.  The basic idea of the section is to ensure that any new Minister may only introduce new fees that are clearly linked to a service that is being provided.  It is not intended that fees would be onerous or yield any form of profit.  Therefore, to address concerns raised by some Deputies I have introduced the amendment which further ensures any fees a future Minister might introduce can be at a rate no higher than the cost of the service linked to the fee.  It safeguards to prevent people making money out of fees.</p></speech>

Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-11a.365" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Clare McGrath" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012121100003#C00300"><p>I am pleased to come before the joint committee to outline the role of the Office of Public Works, OPW, in the area of procurement of construction services.  I propose to open with a summary of the core responsibilities of the office.  The OPW has responsibility for some 2,200 buildings.  This is a wide-ranging portfolio comprising Garda stations, office accommodation, heritage properties, museums, laboratories, storage facilities, etc.  The office provides a shared service to Departments and agencies in the areas of property management and maintenance.</p><p>  The National Procurement Service, NPS, which was established in 2009, is currently a function of the Office of Public Works.  It provides professional procurement services to ensure the public service can efficiently and effectively access the best value goods and services in a legally compliant manner.  One of the goals of the NPS is to encourage participation by small and medium-sized enterprises in public procurement.  To this end, the <i><i>eTenders</i></i><i>.</i><i><i>gov.ie</i></i><i></i>website is a source for publishing and accessing tender notices on Government and public sector procurement throughout Ireland.  As we continue to strive towards a more efficient delivery of public services, the NPS will continue its education programme and hold seminars on public procurement.  This will assist buyers and suppliers to interact effectively with emerging markets and keep them informed of current procedures.</p><p>  The Office of Public Works is the lead agency in co-ordinating the management of flood risk and we deliver our responsibilities directly through our own resources and contractors and in conjunction with other agencies such as local authorities.  In respect of heritage services, the OPW manages in excess of 700 sites, catering for up to 3 million visitors at guided sites annually, and protects site fabric by a continuing programme of planned maintenance adopting best architectural and conservation principles.  Furthermore, the office provides specialist procurement and technical input to the Government and various Departments on particular projects where the office is not funding the works, for example, assisting the Department of Education and Skills in the expansion or addition of 15 schools.  These items do not appear as expenditure on the Office of Public Works Vote.</p><p>  To address the topic under discussion today, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is responsible for determining national policy on public procurement.  We, in the Office of Public Works, are practitioners and in our day-to-day operations we give effect to these national guidelines and, where applicable, European Union directives in this area.  The OPW complies with the Government decision of 2009 in its commitment to pay contractors and suppliers within 15 calendar days, thereby improving on the statutory requirement of 30 days under prompt payments legislation.</p><p>  For all construction and construction related services, the Office of Public Works is obliged to use the capital works management framework forms of contract.  In accordance with the Department of Finance Circular 10/10, tenders for project works valued at between &euro;50,000 and &euro;250,000 are advertised on the <i>eTenders</i> website using the short or minor form of contract.  This is the standard procedure for project work.  Another form of building works contract used is investigation and building works designed by the employer.  For the provision of services that may be required occasionally, namely, professional services, the relevant forms of contract for consultancy and archaeology are used.</p><p>  Maintenance works, using the short form of contract, impact on small businesses.  Given the volume of maintenance work required, tenders are issued to building contractors included on a list in the relevant region or outside Dublin.  This current process is beneficial to small business as it has allowed for the inclusion of additional applicants on the current list through application at any time while the list system is in place.  This avoids repetitive paperwork and the use of additional resources by small and medium-sized enterprises as only one application for assessment is required.  Tenders for each region are distributed on a rotation basis so as to be fair to everyone on the list.  There are approximately 225 contractors on the list for building works.  I am pleased to be able, through the joint committee, to invite small firms involved in construction to apply for inclusion on the list.</p><p>  Eligibility is based on turnover levels, relevant insurance, tax compliance, membership of the operative pension and sick pay scheme, health and safety compliance and relevant work experience.  On awarding of a contract, a performance bond may also be required.  Members will be interested to note that in 2011, just under 1,300 businesses undertook construction related activities, services or works for the Office of Public Works, on which some &euro;160 million was expended.  While these figures demonstrate the extent to which firms have access to and provide services for the OPW, they do not account for the number of suppliers to the businesses the OPW procured for the provision of these services.</p><p>  I thank members for their attention and will do my best to answer any questions they may wish to raise on the eligibility of small firms in tendering for capital works projects in the Office of Public Works.</p></speech>

Her organisation is one of the hidden assets to this country, particularly regarding the work it does on heritage sites and State buildings.  While I have local arguments with the Office of Public Works on the manner in which it deals with flooding, that is a matter for another day.  On heritage services, I have a non-construction-related question.  Does the Office of Public Works advertise catering contracts regularly for the various heritage sites?  If a person wishes to become a service supplier to a heritage site, whom should he or she contact?</p><p>  The use of the short form of contract in respect of maintenance works was a welcome initiative.  However, the OPW appears to hide it under a bushel to an extent.  How many of the 225 companies to which Ms McGrath referred have left that list over the years?  Is there much churn of companies on the list?  What are the turnover levels for companies in this regard?  As Ms McGrath made reference to eligibility being based on turnover levels, what are they and do they depend on the kind of work companies would be doing?  Where does one apply and can details be found on the OPW website?  On the issue of payment within 15 calendar days, is the OPW fully in compliance with that measure at present?</p><p>  As for non-capital areas, one of the frustrations experienced by this joint committee's predecessor was that it heard a presentation from representatives of the Irish printing industry during the lifetime of the previous D&aacute;il.  They were of the opinion that they were getting a very raw deal in the manner in which State contracts were awarded for printing.  The meeting took place at around the time of a referendum in 2008, when one of the referendum information booklets was published in Spain.  It was because of the manner in which contract in Ireland are not broken up.  The State tends to tender for big contracts and certainly at that point, did not tend to break them up into smaller chunks to facilitate smaller companies, which would qualify under all of those criteria.  Has this situation improved and has consideration been given to breaking big contracts, including capital contracts, into smaller chunks to enable smaller companies to get involved?</p></speech>

We have franchises in place for the running of catering facilities in the heritage sites.  They are publicly advertised when they come up and while I am unsure whether the Deputy had a specific site in mind, we publicly advertise.</p></speech>

It would depend on the circumstances and on what were the local arrangements.  When such a contract is put out, we might not have a large audience for it and it might not be valued.  It is like the Deputy's subsequent question, in that one looks at the market, at what the OPW wants and where it wants it and one then determines the procurement around what is the optimum, both for people to be able to apply for it and in respect of service provision and in order that the OPW is not obliged to go back out very quickly thereafter.  However, such contracts are advertised.</p></speech>

Such departures would not have been because of anything the OPW has instigated but might have been on the other side, that is, pertaining to the aforementioned 225 companies.  Turnover levels in respect of most jobs are determined on an annualised basis.  Were we placing a contract for a particular amount, it could range, under the guidance from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, from 75% on an annualised basis to 150%.  Again, however, the Office of Public Works examines such contracts, in cases where we are placing individual ones, ascertains what is appropriate and then sets turnover levels that are appropriate to what we seek to have done.  Consequently, we do our utmost to ensure that people can compete.  We cannot make them competitive but we do our utmost to make the position such that as many as possible can come in to compete in respect of the turnover levels.  The guidance indicates 75% on an annualised basis, up to 150%.  Moreover, there is an application form with which people may apply.  I will go back and will make sure it is on the website, if it is not, because I am very happy to advertise before this joint committee that this is the case.  However, we will send the application to anyone who contacts us.</p><p>  On the Deputy's question regarding the 15 calendar days, we are at a compliance rate of 97% in respect of the 30-day target.  As for complying with a 15-day target within that figure of 97%, I believe we are up at 65% and growing.  It is at that level and the OPW is very concerned to ensure we are paying promptly.  I reiterate the compliance rate in respect of the other figure is at 97%.  As for the Deputy's reference to State contracts, again we carry out a lot of investigation and consideration of the market with regard to the service that is being sought.  Moreover, we give consideration to regionalising or dividing into lots, as appropriate, taking into account both access for the market and the value for money question.  There is not a single size, as it is about looking at each instance of procurement and determining what is the optimum strategy.  I will take away the Deputy's comments with regard to printing and perhaps will revert to the joint committee on that particular subject.  I think that might cover the questions.</p></speech>

I am trying to get my head around a number of issues.  What proportion of the complete public procurement within the State is carried out by the OPW?  I understand it is responsible for the procurement of common goods within the State.  On an annual basis, I believe that public procurements on the island of Ireland amount to approximately &euro;20 billion.  Ms McGrath mentioned a figure of &euro;160 million in respect of the OPW's construction activities, which obviously would represent less than 1% of the total and I am trying to get an understanding of this issue.</p><p>  One of the major subjects for discussion for this joint committee on a regular basis is that Ireland appears to be an outlier with regard to the level of procurement that leaves the State.  We win prizes for this etc. but as a citizen and a representative of small to medium enterprises, I note this is not the type of prize one wishes to win.  Can Ms McGrath provide members with details of comparative analysis on the level of extra-State procurements that occur through the OPW's functions and through those of another European economy of similar size?  What have been the trends with regard to extra-State procurement versus internal State procurement over the past three or four years?  Is the position improving or getting worse in this regard?</p></speech>

I referred at another committee of the House to the fact that, by value, 95% of EU advertised contracts remain in the State.  I do not refer to the number of contracts but to the value.  We had reason to look at contracts that were awarded by the National Procurement Service.  It may have related to a parliamentary question.  I stand to be corrected on it but 4% of all EU advertised contracts went outside the island of Ireland.  Between the Republic and Northern Ireland, 96% remained.</p></speech>

The next question related to a comparative analysis.  A recent report examined potential savings on procurement of approximately &euro;9 billion, excluding capital.  The OPW&rsquo;s own Vote is very small, at approximately &euro;392 million.  That includes rents.  The amounts are to be found elsewhere in the public service.  We place contracts on behalf of other public sector bodies through the National Procurement Service.  The single biggest one of those relates to energy.  The others are much smaller than that.  There is much more public procurement in other sectors, such as the health sector or local authorities.  When the State is procuring, many people are making decisions because there have been central cuts to allocations.  It creates tension that could even become a conflict between obtaining value and getting the most for one&rsquo;s euro and at the same time the impact that will have.  One must balance both of those.  Different bodies are responsible for setting targets and policy in that regard.  The OPW, as a procurer, seeks to maximise value but also to spread it.  We are conscious of that within the construction area.  In certain instances one looks at where one can leverage the State&rsquo;s covenant to get best value for the State.</p><p>  Social clauses are a consideration.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is considering changes to directives and the inclusion of social clauses within contracts.  They may well be included within the capital works framework.  The Department will provide the lead in that regard and we will give effect to whatever is decided on the matter, but we do not have social clauses at present.</p><p>  On the 15 days, I cannot make any comment on a semi-State body.  The OPW is 90% compliant with the 30 days.  We are 65% compliant, and increasing, on the 15 days payment on the construction side.  We seek to continually improve on that.  Issues usually arise on elements of the contractual relationship.  We have not been in court over prompt payments.  In terms of subcontractors, the privity of contract is with the main contract.  I understand Senator Quinn&rsquo;s Bill on the payment of subcontractors has gone through Second Stage and I believe it will go to Committee Stage after Christmas.  Issues arise about the turnover in that regard.  That will apply to the private sector and the public sector and it must be expedited.  I am not aware of issues arising in the OPW with payments by main contractors to subcontractors.</p></speech>

That does not refer to the National Procurement Service, it only relates to OPW contracts.  What is the percentage of other contracts that leave the State?  The OPW pays upward-only rents on many of the buildings it currently uses and charges upward-only rents to people as well.  What is the position in that regard?</p></speech>

In some respects the OPW is the facilitator for the contract and many people consider that to provide security.

I would be then left at a loss because the main contractor went bust and failed to pay me, despite the building having been handed over to the OPW.</p></speech>

This contract provides that the main contractor is the only contractor with which the Office of Public Works has a contractual arrangement.  All other contractors on the site are domestic subcontractors.  The old system of nomination was dispensed with in 2005 when the new contract was introduced and whatever security was provided by nomination is no longer in place.  As to whether the Office of Public Works provides a guarantee for the payment of subcontractors, the position is that there are no contractual arrangements between any subcontractor and the office or any other public sector contracting authority.</p></speech>

The Office of Public Works is an employer of contractors and continues to be in that relationship.  It is not a one-off relationship, as would be the case with a board of management.  We are in a better position to the extent that people wish to treat with us again, particularly where the sums involved are below the EU thresholds.

In that regard, if the Deputy wishes to raise specific issues with the GCC, I will do so on his behalf.</p></speech>

What are the trends in respect of contracts outside the State in recent years?</p><p>  For how many premises does the Office of Public Works pay upward only rents and in how many cases does it charge upward only rents?  I referred to an example involving a semi-State company and small business.  The OPW manages the procurement element of contracts small businesses secure with semi-State companies.  In a scenario where a semi-State company defaults on its payments to a small business, would the OPW have a role in the matter or is this strictly a matter for the semi-State company and contracting company?</p></speech>

When I alluded to a figure of 95%, I was referring to Ireland and all European Union advertised competitions for procurement, rather than procurement solely in respect of the OPW.  We recently answered a parliamentary question on contracts placed by the National Procurement Service in which we indicated that 4% of such contracts went outside the island.</p><p>  In terms of trends, I understand from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation via Enterprise Ireland that the latter works closely with the small and medium enterprise sector to facilitate SMEs in participating in competitions in other jurisdictions.  While I do not have figures with me, I understand Enterprise Ireland has provided valuable assistance for companies seeking to compete in other jurisdictions by leveraging their ability to win competitions elsewhere.  I do not have a comparative analysis in respect of other jurisdictions, although I will suggest to the National Procurement Service that it consider this issue with a view to being able to identify trends, as requested by the Deputy.</p><p>  On rents, we have something in the order of 450 leases, a small number of which are upward only rents.  We seek to leverage our covenant in relation to this and we have been able to optimise the position where reviews have been done.  I do not have figures on the number of upward only rents in cases where the Office of Public Works is the landlord, although I can revert to the joint committee on the question.  I am not sure if the Deputy is asking how many of the tenants in such leases have expressed to the OPW that they have a difficulty with their rents.  I take his point about the case in County Donegal and I will revert to the joint committee on OPW leases.  As members will be aware, upward only rent clauses have been illegal for the past couple of years, which means no new leases can be created with such clauses.  This is an historical issue. </p></speech>

I am fascinated by Ms McGrath's statement that 96% of contacts are awarded in Ireland.  I have a list of 100 tenders which featured on the eTenders website in the period from 4 September 2012 until this morning.  Is it not strange that not one Irish company tendered to operate the eTenders website, which is run by a Swedish company?  I find it strange that small companies which do not have experience in online tenders are dealing with a Swedish company.  The eTenders website is experiencing serious glitches and small companies are encountering difficulties with the facility.  Was the tender document drawn up by the procurement section of the Office of Public Works for the website so prescriptive that not one Irish company was able to tender for the contract?</p><p>  I have here a tender document on the suitability of contractors for small works associated with an extension at Kill national school in County Waterford.  Ms McGrath referred to a turnover requirement of between 75% and 150% of the value of the contract.  The tender document for Kill national school includes a declaration that the contractor's annual turnover for the three previous financial years be not less than one and a half times the sum tendered for the project.  In light of this, I find it difficult to understand Ms McGrath's earlier comment.  The document also states that the level of public liability insurance must be &euro;6.5 million and employers' liability insurance for the contract was &euro;13 million.  This requirement excludes a large number of small companies from tendering for projects.

The eTenders website has been in existence since 2003.  It was previously held by a Scottish firm but was retendered in the past 12 months for an off-the-shelf system to provide a portal to enable communications between public sector buyers and suppliers.  The NPS is responsible for the eTenders website but in respect of procurement, it is responsible for supplies and services and not for works.  Works are the responsibility of whoever the public sector buyer is.  The documentation that would be put on <i>eTenders</i> would be done by the public sector buyer who wants to-----</p></speech>

Her opening statement stated that one of the NPS's goals is to encourage participation by SMEs in public procurement and that to this end, the <i>eTenders</i> website is a source for publishing and accessing tender notices on Government and public sector procurement.  In her speech, Ms McGrath stated that as efforts continue to strive towards a more efficient delivery of public services, the NPS will continue its education programme and hold seminars on public procurement.   If this is what the NPS is prescribing and encouraging within the public sector, it automatically discourages small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly companies that are starting up.  We are trying to push new start-up companies but they are obviously being excluded because of conditions in contracts.  We either decide to have a public policy to encourage as many start-up companies as possible or we ring fence existing companies that work with the OPW and the NPS.  It appears to me that everything is ring-fenced.</p></speech>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, through the GCC, is the body which sets the guidelines, for example, those relating to works contracts concerning turnover being 75% of the annualised value up to 150%.  When the OPW carries out these types of contract, we look at the contract and determine what is appropriate on an individual case-by-case basis.  I cannot state what other procuring entities follow or why they might determine that the turnover levels should be at a different level.  I accept the Deputy's point in respect of making access as wide as possible and I will certainly raise this issue when we attend the GCC.  The chair of the GCC might raise it as well.  I am very happy to deal with individual instances where people say we are not complying with respect to our own works contracts.  I am not aware of that because internally all parts of the organisation involved in procuring works are very conscious of facilitating firms with regard to having access to a competition - not necessarily how it might win it but at least facilitating access.</p></speech>

We are regularly in contact with small businesses.  I believe the Small Firms Association reckons that about 60% of people it surveyed indicated that they have had very negative experiences regarding public procurement in this State.  We are talking about the development of the local enterprise offices as part of the new enterprise structure.  We finally got some interaction between small enterprises and the development of the local enterprise offices.  What role do small enterprises have in the design and culture within the OPW regarding tender contracts?  Does the OPW work regularly with ISME and the Small Firms Association?  Does it meet with groups to examine how tenders can be structured to make them small business-friendly?</p></speech>

"Meet the buyer" events have been held in various locations throughout the country through the NPS and InterTradeIreland.  These are trade shows, for want of a better word, where public sector buyers meet public sector suppliers and inform them of what is happening in their business areas.  There are forums for interaction at various levels with supplier representatives.</p></speech>

We do that regularly.  We are required to do it under EU directives.  There is interaction with the contractors.  The most recent example that comes to mind is the schools building programme.  At present, we have prequalified for eight new schools, and there are seven others coming down the track.  At the prequalification stage we received 79 expressions of interest from contractors for those schools and a huge number of them had feedback sessions after the event to explain to them why they were not on the list of ten or 11 contractors who will be invited to tender when the time comes.  That is ongoing.</p></speech>

Ms McGrath said in her opening statement that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is responsible for determining national policy on public procurement.  Is that a two way process?  Can Ms McGrath influence that in turn and make recommendations surrounding how we should conduct our national procurement process?  In other words, if the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is not encouraging her or does not have a policy requiring her to have some type of social clause, where possible, within any of the procurement processes, is she in a position to say this could be good thing or can she go it alone without the Department stating it or without feedback?</p><p>  With regard to the social clause issue, I have been doing a little work on this.  I have a Private Members' Bill relating to public procurement.  There are a few glitches in it which must be fixed before it goes any further.  However, the social agenda in Ireland at present is to create jobs.  It has come to my attention from speaking to various experts in public procurement that it is possible to build the concept of a social requirement into the criteria from the beginning when one is advertising with the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i>.  Once some type of social clause or social agenda is included there, one can then implement what is really a social clause around job creation.  The reason I raise this is that we are spending &euro;2.25 billion in a capital investment programme that was announced earlier this year.  If we are serious about taking the unemployed off the live register and giving them jobs and if we are one of the biggest providers of capital investment through schools building programmes and with nearly &euro;1 billion being spent on roads and so forth, do we have to wait until the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform states that a social clause must be included before the procurement or is Ms McGrath in a position to do that beforehand?</p><p>  What experience has Ms McGrath had of developing social clauses and developing them effectively?  If she has had such experience, does she speak about the benefits of a social clause as part of the education programme being rolled out to show people the way to effective procurement?  The National Assembly for Wales has a social clause but it will be most likely knocked down by the EU because it contravenes EU legislation.  However, it can be done in the right way.  The people to whom I have been speaking, who are expert in this area, say that once it is included at the beginning of the process, not when the tender comes out but when the advertisement is put in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i>, and a number of other things are done - it is not as simple as the advertisement - we can include a social clause, particularly with regard to having a job creation procurement strategy in any of the capital programmes we are procuring.</p></speech>

The capital works management framework and the various contracts that ensue from that are set out.  No public sector procurer who avails of the use of those contracts can change them.  We must go back through the Department and make suggestions, which we do in this regard.  We would not run on our own on this because of the impact on the guidelines and the contracts the Department sets out.  I take the Deputy's point about raising it first when advertising in the journal, but we would do that only under the auspices of the Department.  We are practitioners in that sense.  We are policy takers, but the policy is set by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  However, where we have issues with elements of contracts or other issues or where we have ideas to improve things, we refer back to the Department, as do all other public sector bodies which procure works.  They revert to the Department as well, and it would take on board all these suggestions.</p></speech>

They were broken up as much as possible without incurring extra costs on the state and ensured a certain level of local employment, including apprentices and individuals from the long-term unemployed. It worked successfully.  With no disrespect to anybody, there is different culture among people working in the public service and those in the private sector.  Many businesses are at breaking point and find it difficult to operate.  An application for a tender is a very expensive process and can takes weeks on end with full teams working on a weekly basis on a tender.  They could prepare ten tenders and have nothing to show at the end of the day.  While we are giving confidence to the State that the company will be able to fulfil the contract and has the necessary balance sheet to deal with any problems, we are cutting down on red tape and ensuring such contracts are accessible to small business.</p><p>  Has the Office of Public Works ever advertised a tender in the European Union that fell below the requirement value for tendering there?</p></speech>

The delegates said they have a database with 225 contractors on their list for building works.  The meet the buyer events conducted by the Office of Public Works are excellent but I suggest it speaks to the buyers about the design of contracts and the 225 contractors.  I appreciate one has to visit organisations.  That is fine, I used to work for a business organisation, but one is not at the coalface.  I recognise that many legal issues have to be provided for in a contract today.  I suggest OPW use its 225 contractors and its database for those really good events to speak to business people about the design of contracts.  It is good to speak to them after the event but it may be more beneficial before the actual contract is designed.  A regular process might result in the OPW being able to refine those 50 pages into what is required to keep the lawyers and everybody else happy towards a practical business friendly document.</p></speech>

I meant to say in response to Deputy Lyons and Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's question that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, is exercised in regard to the amendments to the directives and what is being considered to ensure that social clauses are included.  He has responsibility for the Office of Public Works but this issue is being dealt with by the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  On the issue of EU advertising.  Suppliers and buyers can register their advertisements on the <i>eTenders</i> website.  The suppliers who register on the website can be from anywhere.  The EU tenders website does not necessarily comply with EU procurement rules.  It is a website that allows and facilitates access by businesses to competitions.</p></speech>

Even when there was no requirement to open up tendering to jobs outside of Ireland, some public companies were doing that which, in effect,  was likely to cost Irish jobs during the most acute jobs crisis in this generation.</p></speech>

Under the provisions of the directive, I understand there is a move to electronic procurement in many other jurisdictions in Europe.  Therefore, the same situation will apply to all jurisdiction.  It will enable one to register within that jurisdiction as a supplier and then one is notified of opportunities.</p></speech>

This is one for ten printers, for an extension to a school.  Both have similar employers liability of approximately &euro;13 million and public liability.  Whoever draws up the contracts appears to apply a similar standard of figures to exclude smaller companies.  I would like to have an opportunity to speak to the National Procurement Service in respect of the framework agreements and the problems around it because it definitely excludes small companies.  In the move to centralisation all that is wanted is big companies.  People sometimes ask why not get five or six small companies to come together.  The position is that they are all in competition with each other for the local business.  How can they be brought together to make an agreement?  We are seeking competition yet under the framework agreements we are excluding competition.</p><p>  How many procurement managers are in the Office of Public Works?  When a company gets through the hoops of preparing a tender document, how is the tender awarded?  I notice consistently that 65% depends on price and 35% on something else.  Within the education sector in my parish, the builders went to the wall before two schools were built.  It appeared to me that the contract was judged on tender price rather than any other criteria, that the lowest possible price was chosen without a due diligence on the companies or whether the price was viable and sustainable.  Consequently there is a delay in the children going into their new school as a result.</p></speech>

It is a work in progress.  Substantial funds have been invested into the various PEACE programmes over the years.  That money has not been wasted and there have been benefits in improving the climate of reconciliation and co-operation between both communities particularly at grass roots level but also the North-South all-island level.  It is good that we have that level of co-operation and we need to continue to work on it.  The last week shows that we have a distance to go and that there are still issues with sectarianism and with what used to be called the siege mentality, which still exists to some extent.  In a state that was built on a sectarian head count that is not surprising.  We must work to try to ameliorate that.  Reconciliation is the most important issue and a considerable amount of work remains to be done there.</p><p>  I have visited some of the projects that have been funded over the years and the real value comes from the small local projects, including the small joint ventures North and South.  The Minister mentioned the small initiatives at local authority level and along the Border corridor, which have done much good work.  I was a local authority member in the past and I know there has been great co-operation between local authorities along what is referred to as the Border corridor, which has been very positive.  All parties have contributed generously to that.</p><p>  I have a question on the oversight of how the money is spent.  It is important that we get value for money and get the maximum results for every euro spent.</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy that it has provided good value for money, particularly the local projects.  I have seen some of them and they certainly get engagement from the local communities across the board and make a big impact at community level.  The SEUPB manages the projects as well as providing oversight.</p></speech>

It would be quite useful for us to get the detail.  We are informed that the proposed contribution will enable fulfilment of contractual obligations arising in 2012.  I would like to know what the contractual obligations are.  Unless we have that detail, which may well be available but which I have not seen, it is difficult to evaluate.  Given what has happened in the past week or so, we cannot but be aware that the peace is still fragile and needs to be worked on.  It would be quite useful to understand what exactly is coming out of it.</p><p>  Will this Supplementary Estimate be the only one put in front us?  Last year there was funding taken out of the homeless fund for an oversight commitment and it occurred quite late in the day as well.</p></speech>

No doubt the Minister had an obligation to the commitment in terms of the climate change element of whatever the Department oversees, but when one sees a man dying in the doorway, as somebody did on Friday last, one wants to ensure that whatever is available in that homeless fund is spent.  I merely draw attention to the matter because that happened last year and I would not like to think that we went the full year without spending in that area.</p><p>  I received from the Minister a reply to a parliamentary question on 27 November on the budget and Supplementary Estimates which stated that there was &euro;895 million in respect of the budget, current spending was running close to profile but the capital spending on housing, water and rural development areas was behind profile.  Is that likely to come in front of us or alter before the end of the year, or is this the last Supplementary Estimate we will see?</p><p>  On climate change, I am aware that-----</p></speech>

I will let her speak because, in fairness, she is very co-operative and, to put it mildly, we owe her minutes following her outstanding co-operation one day when there were spectacular instances where there was not such co-operation.

It is valid to ask whether all of that will be spent by the end of the year or whether there will be a further meeting next week to deal with other issues.  The spending of this money is not a private process after all; it is a public process.  It is valid to ask, when the Minister is here, whether that money will be fully spent or whether there will be a further meeting to disburse funds in a different way than we had anticipated.</p><p>  Will the Minister also be back before us to give an assessment on the Doha deliberations and whether the Government would have seen what transpired there as satisfactory?  Clearly, next year is approaching and we need to have some idea.  It is useful to be able to ask that now.  I ask, only so that it is in the public arena, that he include the amount of money that was spent going and the number of staff.  I see no reason-----</p></speech>

That has made an impact and given us some savings as well.</p><p>  We have provided additional moneys as well this year for landfill remediation, which are matters that have been subject to European Court of Justice infringements and on which I am trying my best to catch up with the legacy issues of 31 European Court of Justice judgments against Ireland in a number of areas, including groundwater quality.  We need money for those and we are spending those as the invoices come in or else the courts make the decisions in lump sum fines or daily fines against us.  That answers the questions.</p><p>  On the Doha conference on climate change, am I before the committee next week?</p></speech>

First, he might clarify that his initial Estimate was &euro;8 million for what was to be paid out under the scheme over the year.  No more than what the Minister stated about the Leader programme, is it the case that the drawdowns of previous years came into effect in the past year and, as a result, there was an outlay of &euro;16 million, &euro;8 million of which is due back in the next calendar year relating to this year?  Is it mainly an accountancy exercise?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-11a.489" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12012121100004#C02200"><p>It is.  We are getting receipts from the European Commission for various ongoing works on the PEACE programme and we are spending that now rather than waiting for the receipts to come in.  We have agreement for that from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-11a.490" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1101" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12012121100004#C02300"><p>I concur and agree with the route the Minister is taking and I have no difficulty in that regard.  Like others, I concur with what has been said and agree with the concept of this process of the PEACE programme.  It has gone according to the expectations envisaged in 2007.</p><p>  There is one area on which I would ask the Minister to be mindful and use whatever influence he can, especially in the context of his Government position, that is, the acknowledging of the past and dealing with it.  As the Minister stated, the programme looks to record of the complex history and experience of Northern Ireland and the Irish Border counties, and ranges from trauma counselling for victims and survivors to all those who have been injured, affected and maimed, physically and mentally.  There are many victims of that unfortunate and sorry saga and many families have yet to get closure in this regard by virtue of remains that are still missing.  I would ask that the Minister use whatever influence he can to highlight further the plight of those affected by that sorry saga in our history.  I would hope he would use whatever influence he can to bring some form of closure for families who are still awaiting the remains of their loved ones as a result of that conflict.</p><p>  The other point I wanted to make was on the Estimate of the Department and the spending that has been incurred during the course of the year.  I recently tabled a question to various Departments on consultancy fees for expertise engaged by those Departments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-11a.492" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12012121100005#D00200"><p>We have reduced considerably the amount of money spent on consultancy in recent years.  We provided money for consultancy on Irish Water, and PricewaterhouseCoopers won that particular contract which cost approximately &euro;100,000.  We also use consultants with regard to infringement cases at the European Court of Justice as we regularly need expertise to deal with these court cases.  This is paid from the environment fund.  An evaluation of the property tax was also carried out.</p></speech>

A concerted effort has been made by the Government to reduce these figures but one can argue whether the overall figure of &euro;6.5 million represents progress.  A total of 50% of this figure related to the Department.  Will we see a vast reduction in the coming year in the percentage spend by the Department <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> other Departments?</p></speech>

This has been a significant problem for me to deal with.  A number of planning inquiries were held and planning issues arose in Wicklow and other places.  A level of expertise is required to explore these ongoing issues.  This must be paid for and invoices have been issued.  Mr. Seamus Woulfe, senior counsel, has been dealing with these matters on behalf of the Department.</p><p>  I share the Deputy's concern about reducing consultancy fees as much as we possibly can, but nevertheless we cannot expose the Irish taxpayer and the Department to judgments of the European Court of Justice without having the necessary expertise.  We cannot cover every aspect of every issue in-house so we must obtain the necessary services required in the marketplace and, unfortunately, they cost money.</p></speech>

I will not say what the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, stated last week.</p><p>  I acknowledge the significant contribution the Taoiseach has made to non-governmental organisations.  A group from my constituency of Longford-Westmeath met the Taoiseach and he brought them into Government Buildings.  They were very appreciative of the interest he showed in what they do in central Belfast.  This type of co-operation is very important and it should be funded.  Will the Minister elaborate on whether funding will be available for non-governmental organisations to build relationships with their counterparts in Northern Ireland?  These include library boards and historical societies.  It would be important to work in this area.  We also need to develop tourism, roads and planning on an all-Ireland basis.  It happens in some cases but we need to accelerate the process.  Priority must be given to it because much damage was done to communities and parishes in the Border area.  It is important we build infrastructure, particularly where it is light years behind.  I hope funding will be provided for this.  We should not make these communities suffer more than they did during the Troubles.</p></speech>

It is timely the Supplementary Estimate is coming before the committee because, like many, we thought the horrors in Northern Ireland were behind us but we have seen the recent riots in Belfast and other areas.  It is time we refocused.  Those involved in what has been happening on the streets of Belfast in recent days are from areas of high and long-term unemployment.  Although we have problems in our own economy, I would hate to see us slipping back from the Good Friday Agreement and no longer concentrating on the problems in the North.  We have come a long way but we could slip back easily and quickly.  Therefore I very much welcome the Estimate and the focus shown by the Minister in bringing it forward.

The Leader programme is very important in rural Ireland and is a great source of assistance in rural development for business and community ideas.  However, I have very grave concerns about the dissemination of Leader funding in Mayo.  There were three Leader companies in Mayo but only one of them is operating.  MFG went to the wall and the Mayo North East Leader Partnership is the subject of a governance investigation.  I accept this, and I know it takes time for investigations to deal with matters appropriately and to follow due process.  With MFG gone, no Leader money is being disseminated to Gaeltacht areas in the county.</p></speech>

Nobody would expect the Minister to condone the malpractice activities of Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta, MFG, a private company which had to be liquidated.  In recent months the neighbouring Leader companies have taken to providing the necessary assistance for processing applications on behalf of the Department.  There is no reason that projects in areas that were formerly funded by MFG cannot be put through the designated Leader companies in those areas.  I am very familiar with north-east Mayo.  There are concerns about the irregularities in the MFG company.  It certainly has had an impact on the funding of projects but also, as the Deputy said, it is slowing down the necessary projects which can be submitted for approval.  We will reach closure on that issue in the very near future.  As the Deputy pointed out, we have had to go through due process.  I share the Deputy's concern about the delay but not only is the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government involved, but also the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the European Commission.  The oversight and audit division has had to investigate these matters thoroughly to ensure European taxpayers' money is protected and the irregularities dealt with.  I can assure the Deputy that these matters will be brought to a head in the coming days.</p></speech>

Both Leader programmes are working very well in my constituency of Sligo-North Leitrim.  It would be unfortunate that we would all be affected as a result of some areas not working as they should.  The areas in communities along the Border are working very well.  All the moneys have been well-spent.  That is the feedback I am getting from both counties, Sligo and Leitrim.  I hope our area will not be affected by mistakes made in other counties.  The suggestion, that local authorities would administer the Leader programme, will not achieve anything.</p><p>  I am in a Border constituency.  On Thursday, I will host a group of people from ICBAN, which is working very well with many projects along the Border.  These projects are vital to Fermanagh, Sligo and Leitrim.  I know the projects that have been highlighted and promoted by ICBAN and the local authorities have achieved substantial investment in infrastructure in recent years.

In the past 18 months I have had the opportunity of presenting to this committee on a number of occasions and today I would like to build on some of the issues I have previously discussed as well as looking forward towards 2013 in a more general European context.  I intend to focus my initial remarks on the latest findings of EM Ireland's 2011 accountability report, copies of which members should have before them, before moving on to discuss the upcoming Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the designation by the EU of 2013 as European Year of Citizens.</p><p>  As many of you will be aware, EM Ireland is a not-for-profit, voluntary, membership-based organisation founded in 1954.  We aim to provide a robust, fair and reasoned voice on European matters in Ireland through increasing awareness and understanding of European issues.  We also strive to publicise opportunities presented by the EU and the potential ramification of legislation which is constantly evolving at a European level.  We develop this interaction by promoting accountability at an Irish and European political level, educating on EU issues, informing business of EU opportunities and working with non-governmental organisations, civil society organisations and citizens.  In keeping with one of our founding aims, we are committed to ensuring increased engagement by the Irish people with the EU.</p><p>  I must apologise in advance for the heavy use of statistics in my upcoming presentation but our accountability report serves to outline, through measuring in statistical terms, key indicators tracking Ireland's engagement with the EU on a number of different levels.  Our 2011 report follows on from the success of the inaugural 2010 accountability report.  Our report 2011 is based on monthly analysis of nine key indicators whereby we extended and refined the systems used to identify, track and store the relevant data.  Data integrity was of central importance in the compilation of this report and much time was dedicated to ensuring that tracking the information took place using only mathematical systems, thereby decreasing any opportunity for subjectivity.  It is crucial to point out at this stage that although the accountability report 2011 endeavours to track Ireland's engagement with the EU throughout the calendar year, that is, from 1 January 2011 to December 2011, the general election that took place in Ireland on 25 February 2011 resulted in a change of Administration and some subsequent structural changes.  Therefore, for the purposes of a number of the indicators in this report, tracking only began after the 31st D&aacute;il was in session, that is, after 9 March 2011.  This is highlighted where relevant in each chapter.</p><p>  Essentially, we focused on the following four principle areas: European Council and Councils of the EU; European Parliament level of engagement; pre-legislative input; and Oireachtas engagement<b>.  </b>Overall average Irish ministerial attendance at the meetings of the Councils of the European Union stood at 86%, with either a lead Minister or Minister of State attending 61 out of a total of 71 meetings that took place once the 31st D&aacute;il was in session in 2011.  This is an increase of 9% from the data recorded from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2010 in European Movement Ireland's accountability report 2010, where the overall ministerial attendance rate recorded for the full calendar year was 77%.</p><p>  In a new departure from our 2010 report and based on suggestions and feedback, we compared Irish attendance to that of our EU counterparts with Ireland coming second best in terms of overall attendance in 2011.  The Czech Republic came first with an impressive 96%.  We found it particularly interesting to note that when comparing Ireland to other EU countries who are in EU-IMF programmes, Ireland had the highest average ministerial attendance rate with 86%, Greece had an average ministerial attendance rate of 63% and Portugal's rate stood at 55%.  Much like his predecessor, former Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, the current Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, attended every one of the seven European Council meetings which took place after 9 March 2011.  General affairs, environment and justice and home affairs councils all enjoyed a 100% attendance record by Irish Ministers under the 31st D&aacute;il in 2011.  As it stands, eight out of ten Council configurations have an average Irish ministerial attendance record of 80% or higher, compared to four out of ten in 2010.</p><p>  In respect of European Parliament engagement, overall Irish MEP attendance at plenary sessions of the Parliament decreased by 1% since 2010, which may be attributable to the fact that MEPs were campaigning in the two elections that took place in Ireland in 2011, namely, the general election and the presidential election.  As this committee will appreciate, attendance is a static measure recorded on a roll call but is not in itself a dynamic measure of engagement, standing, impact and influence, which are, admittedly, far more difficult to quantify.  In Parliament, Irish MEPs asked 683 parliamentary questions in 2011, dropping from just under 1,000 in 2010.  Conversely, Irish MEPs made a total of 727 speeches in 2011, which is an increase of 100 from the previous year.  There is Irish MEP representation on 14 of the 20 standing committees.  The workload of<sup>:</sup> these committees differs greatly from those of Oireachtas committees and we see that five reports were drawn up by an Irish MEP acting as rapporteur.  Irish MEPs are represented on 15 out of 41 parliamentary delegations to places such as China, Palestine and the USA.  It is important to note that, in addition to sitting on parliamentary committees and delegations, most Irish MEPs are also members of a range of intergroups dealing with specialised interest areas such as disability, the media or trade unions.  Our report merely touches upon the workload of an MEP but we used the most scientific barometers at our disposal.</p><p>  In terms of Oireachtas engagement, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs met a total of 17 times between 9 March 2011 and 31 December 2011 under the 31st D&aacute;il.  The attendance record of members of the committee under the 31st D&aacute;il from 9 March 2011 to 31 December 2011 was 71%.  This is an increase of over 10% from the data recorded in EM Ireland's accountability report 2010, where the overall attendance figures for both the European affairs committee and the European scrutiny committee were 58% and 55%, respectively.  As per the programme for Government; pre-Council briefings took place on just three out of the 11 general affairs meetings that took place between 9 March 2011 and 31 December 2011, which represents 27%.  However, it must be noted that for four of the General Affairs Council meetings, the committee was not yet in place.</p><p>  On the question of pre-legislative input, from the 23 consultations reviewed for this report, the percentage of the total submissions that originated in Ireland ranges from 0% to 5%; with an average of 0.9%.  This represents a decrease of 0.7% from the 2010 average of 1.6%, as calculated by similar analysis carried out in the accountability report 2010.  To put this in context, the Taxation and Customs Union Directorate-General received a total of 1,726 consultations on its green paper on VAT, with just two coming from Ireland, which is a mere 0.1% of the total.  From an Irish perspective, there is a clear opportunity for business sectors, civil society, NGOs and public opinion to have a stronger input into this stage of the European legislative procedure. EM Ireland looks forward to playing a leading role in facilitating this enhanced engagement.   This finding is one that we feel we all have a duty to help improve and forms an important part of EM Ireland's activities for 2013.</p></speech>

It is worth recognising the tremendous work they do on behalf of civil society.  While there are several groupings in this area, the European Movement Ireland is the one we hear from the most and the one that carries out the most valuable work.</p><p>  The accountability report deals with the quantitative aspect of attendance at Council meetings.  Would future reports examine the agendas of these meetings and the input from Irish Ministers?  Is there some methodology that could track the volumes of items raised and addressed by Irish Ministers and, subsequently, the outcomes?  Using such a methodology would give a better representation of the quality of the work done by Irish Ministers.  I am loath to use numeric data on attendance of Council meetings because there may be issues which do not relate to Ireland at a meeting.</p><p>  I take the report's point about the Oireachtas committee system of EU scrutiny.  A former Chairman of this committee, Deputy Durkan, and I have different views about the European affairs committee.  I have always believed scrutiny should be pushed back to the sectoral committees.  Deputy Durkan has always argued the opposite because sectoral committees do not always see the importance of the European agenda as they should.  The report gives one example of this where Irish submissions on the future of EU taxation and customs policy came to 0.1% of the total made.  It might be better if such issues were tracked by the relevant sectoral committee and that they accepted their role within the European legislative framework.</p><p>  The work done by European Movement Ireland is excellent.  My points are about improvement rather than criticism.</p></speech>

I have had a concern for some time about our scrutiny of EU legislation and directives.  I do not believe it is adequate, a point I have put on the record before, and it should not be deferred to the sectoral committees.  There needs to be far more accountability.  The report points out there were just two comments made by Ireland out of a total of 1,723 on the Green Paper on VAT, a mere 0.1%.  That says a lot.  What about the other Green Papers?  We have a large challenge in this regard.  Much of our legislation, almost 75%, is secondary coming from Europe.  We need a stand-alone and dedicated committee, representing the people, to scrutinise EU legislation and directives.  Some have argued this is a role for the Seanad.  Such a committee would also ensure the best deal for the people with inputs at the correct point.</p><p>  The European Movement Ireland has examined the quantitative analysis of Irish ministerial attendance at Council meetings.  Has it any measure of a qualitative analysis?  For example, such a directive comes from Europe and is dealt with by the Oireachtas committees.  Is there any analysis of what the Irish people have said about it and are their views reflected by Oireachtas Members?</p></speech>

However, since I became a member I have noted attendance is linked to the meeting's relevance.  Similarly, one would expect ministerial attendance at Council meetings would increase because of the economic crisis emanating from Europe.  When it comes to the business of MEPs and Ministers in Europe, what is relevant to people at home is what they are actually doing out there rather than attendance.  It is not just about attendance or the number of speeches made.  It is the content of the speeches that is important.  One could be speaking every day on some matters.  The point is how relevant are these speeches.</p><p>  The most striking point about the report is the lack of Irish input at the pre-legislative phase.</p></speech>

From the new year, we will reschedule our meetings to Thursday afternoons in order to facilitate the diaries of our MEPs.  We hope to see increased involvement of MEPs from across the island.</p></speech>

There are extenuating factors in respect of attendance, and MEPs have similarly encountered difficulties in this regard.  The figures may say one thing but the issues behind them also need to be reflected.</p></speech>

I will not repeat my colleagues' comments but I wish to ask a question that logically follows on from them.  I recently came across the Blue Star programme in a primary school and I am very impressed by it.  Along with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Creighton, and the then Cathaoirleach of Cavan County Council, Councillor Sean McKiernan, I visited East Knockbride national school near Bailieborough when it was being awarded the Blue Star.  We met the pupils and learned about the various projects they had pursued.  All of them had studied European languages.  The awareness throughout the school of European geography, history, language and culture was impressive.  They learned the traditional folk costumes and clothes of the various parts of Europe.  I am a primary teacher by background, and it was one of the most impressive things I have ever witnessed.</p><p>  The Blue Star programme is clearly an effective means of developing an awareness of Europe and European identity.  I would be happy for any of my three children to take the programme.  What is the level of take up and are there plans to develop it further?  It has enormous potential for expanding beyond schools to reach the families and communities of the students concerned.  What is the movement doing at third level?  That is also a critical area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-12-11a.546" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2012121100006#E00500"><p>I join my colleagues in welcoming our guests and compliment them on their comprehensive report.  It is important that we have a barometer against which to measure our performance and that of our colleagues in the European Parliament.  Every so often we need a reminder as to whether we are coming up to the mark.</p><p>  I take a different view on attendance at meetings.  It is very important to attend even the non-statutory meetings, whether with Ministers or MEPs, because decisions are made and policies are formulated at them.  Sometimes they are used as opportunities to fly kites which suddenly return to ground as policy.  It is important that we represent the people who elected us at these meetings.  It is not possible for everyone to attend the various meetings in Brussels.</p><p>  In a previous D&aacute;il I was a member of four committees.  I was unable to attend them all because they were not on at the same time.  The problem we face now is that even though there are fewer committees in this D&aacute;il than in the last one, their schedules appear to clash.  The Order of Business and the quorum at the beginning of business clash with committee meetings.  Two or more committee meetings are often scheduled for the same time.  We need to avoid clashing as best we can.</p><p>  Deputy Dooley asked about the appropriateness of particular committees to address issues.  I have always taken the view that the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs should specialise in European scrutiny and European affairs by virtue of the fact that its members are attuned to what is happening in Europe.  That does not mean members of other committees are not attuned but this committee is more focused.  The committee faced a couple of glitches in its previous incarnations.  On one occasion a sensitive issue was cleared by another committee which shall remain nameless.  If the issue had come before this committee it would not have been approved and the country would have been saved considerable embarrassment.  I am not telling tales out of school when I say that a member of the other committee approached me at the time to inquire whether this committee could hold a hearing on the issue.  Unfortunately, the pass had been sold by the time we held our hearing.</p><p>  On another occasion, a European directive which impacted on a sector of the community in Ireland was approved by the Government and a certain Minister refused point blank to appear before this committee.  This is not a reflection on Ministers in general but it speaks volumes in itself.  This Minister had no difficulty in meeting the appropriate sectoral committee.  Everything is for a reason.  I was critical of the Minister's decision at the time.  I am not giving away any names, ranks or serial numbers.</p></speech>

Have they any figures with regard to the role of MEPs in terms of ongoing scrutiny and keeping the public informed and getting the message to them in their constituencies?  They mentioned how the Irish Presidency might be perceived by the ambassadors and about asking ambassadors how it is perceived in their countries.  Has this been done with other presidencies?  If so, how was it done and what methodology was used?  Was it based on results or outcomes?</p><p>  I welcome the move towards getting ambassadors out to meetings to meet citizens.  Has there been any measure of support among the general public for the European Union?  Is there concrete information available on whether there has been a reduction in support over the past few years?  Is there a greater understanding of the European Union now and is there a greater acceptance of its role?  Is there greater support for it and for the European Parliament among the public?  We have had MEPs since the 1970s.  Have people a better understanding of their role or do they see them as dealing with similar issues to those raised with Deputies and county councillors?  It seems to me there is a crossover of roles and we all get the same types of queries, rather then MEPs being considered as just being involved in European scrutiny and legislation.</p></speech>

I am aware there is another programme entitled "My Vision for Europe" as my old school, St. Mary's diocesan school in Drogheda, came second in the competition relating to the programme and I was invited to the presentation, where I met one of my old teachers, Mr. Joe Sweeney, who had helped prepare the school's bid.  In talking to the students, I was struck by how much the competition had increased their knowledge and awareness, not just of the European Movement in Ireland, but also of the issue of how Europe is governed.  In the context of the Irish Presidency, does the European Movement Ireland intend to continue with the My Vision for Europe programme during the Presidency?  I understand the movement has issues in the context of resources and commitments, but the programme is very worthwhile.  Will that programme be run next year?</p></speech>

We invite transition year students to upload a video on a number of different themes on EU matters.  This year, due to a combination of factors, the decision was taken by all parties involved that given Ireland would hold the EU Presidency next year, it will be European Year of Citizens and given our increased workload and the challenge to our resource capacity with the increased level of Blue Star engagement, the My Vision for Europe programme will be in abeyance next year.  However, we hope to reactivate it in 2014.</p><p>  In the context of the citizen dialogue launch event, on 10 January, we are encouraging anyone who wants to attend to upload a home made YouTube video.  We would love to see as many transition year students as possible get involved in this and hope this will, somehow, replicate what the My Vision for Europe programme did.

I will try to respond now to the questions put by the committee members, but can go through this in greater detail if I have time later.</p><p>  With regard to the Chairman's questions and comments on our accountability report, this is the second year of the report, which is very much a live document.  Meetings such as this afford us the opportunity to engage with the members of this committee to get their feedback and input.  One of the new developments in our report this year was to compare how Ireland performs with the rest of the member states.  This came about as a result of feedback and conversations with people like the members of this committee and MEPs.  I hope we have demonstrated clearly that we recognise the limits of the report, in that it is based primarily on quantifying statistically attendance and other information, which does not tell the whole picture.  However, we feel it ensures and promotes openness, transparency and accountability, which are an important part of any democracy.  The Chairman asked about the league table and attendance at other Oireachtas committees.  We did not do that for last year's report, but that is something we could consider, were it not for the lack of resources.  From our perspective, the most important committee to report on is the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs and that is the one we attend and send staff to every week.</p><p>  The Chairman praised the engagement of the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton.  She plays a hugely important role and has been very supportive of our organisation.  We are involved with her and her officials and her Department and the Department of the Taoiseach on a huge range of programmes and projects.  She is engaging in our pre-Presidency conferences and she has been prominent in driving the Blue Star programme.  She has also given a number of Presidency briefings to our members and to the broader Irish NGO civil society network.  We fully appreciate how engaged and committed she is.  I would like to draw the Chairman's attention to page 54 of our report, where we state it must be noted that for four of the General Affairs Council meetings, the committee was not in place and for one meeting the D&aacute;il was still in the summer recess.  We endeavour to qualify and highlight the statistical information in so far as we can.  Our accountability report is fact based, but this has associated limitations.  We are very grateful for the work this committee is doing and its increasing level of engagement and support the committee's efforts to increase its profile in that regard.</p><p>  Deputy Dooley asked about the statistics on attendance, agendas and participation and how best to elicit, qualify and quantify the input and work programme of Ministers in this regard.  That would be a challenge and if we were to do that our report would certainly not stop at 55 pages.  Due to resource capacity, that is something that must be left for another day, but we will try to expand the report and give added value by looking at the outcomes.  In respect of tracking work on sectoral committees, this is an area we can consider developing.</p></speech>

At that point, the committee might like to discuss whether further action should be taken.  We would be more than happy to share suggestions that would facilitate access and make the process more user-friendly, which is a big problem in this area.  I hope I have answered Senator Healy Eames's questions in this respect.</p><p>  Deputy Crowe touched on a number of interesting points.  We have worked closely with the MEPs.  On the basis of the input from the MEPs, we intend to expand the chapter of the report dealing with the European Parliament in next year's report.  Attendance levels reflect the use of differing electoral systems.  We work at length to explain the role of MEPs.  I could not go through it in too much detail today because of the time constraints I faced.  There is an onus on all civil society groups to work to enhance and promote the pre-legislative input.</p><p>  With respect to Northern Ireland, we do not seek to be partitionist in any way.  We work closely with the Northern Ireland MEPs.  They are classified from a UK perspective.  We work closely with European Movement Northern Ireland.  We have very good relations with European Movement Northern Ireland, which is one of the partners for the youth media and the Irish Presidency project.  I suppose there is an all-island element in that regard.</p><p>  We will seek to track and analyse the use of the Irish language where information on it is available.  It is an interesting point.  I have to be honest and admit that such information is not always available.  We conduct our research on the basis of the information that is available in the public domain.  The material we are presenting to the committee is based on public records.  We will consider taking the suggestion on board.</p><p>  Deputy O'Reilly asked about the Blue Star programme.  Some 34 schools throughout the country participated in the programme last year, which was the pilot year.  European Movement Ireland is the national implementation body for the programme again this year, with support from the Minister of State and the Department of the Taoiseach.  I am delighted to report that 92 schools are taking part in it, which is a fantastic increase.  We are very excited about it.  As part of the revised Blue Star programme for this year, we are asking primary school pupils to make an input into Ireland's Presidency of the EU and take a view on it.  There is also a section dealing with citizenship in the context of the European Year of Citizens.  Schools from every corner of Ireland are taking part in the programme this year.  As Deputy O'Reilly said, the schools in question will take part in a number of projects to coincide with Europe Week in May.  Their Blue Star certificates are presented after they have completed their annual programmes.  We are delighted to report that work on this fantastic initiative, which involves primary schoolchildren, parents and wider communities, is well under way.  We are delighted to be closely involved in supporting it.</p><p>  The Deputy also asked about our activities in the third level sector.  Since European Movement Ireland was founded in 1954, we have felt strongly about education and have worked in the second and third level sectors.  We are managing and administering the College of Europe scholarship application process on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills this year.  The deadline for interested students is 15 January next.  We are also working closely with the Commission, the Parliament, the Minister of State and the Department of the Taoiseach on the <i>eujobs.ie</i> initiative.  This involves going to careers services in third level institutions - institutes of technology and universities - throughout the country to make Irish students aware of the internship or career opportunities that are available.  It is important to note that there has been a decline in the level of Irish applications to the EU.</p></speech>

Many people went into non-EU-related areas during the boom times.  We strongly believe there needs to be an increased focus on, appreciation of and awareness of languages.  There is a slight level of apathy.  There is also a lack of information on and awareness of the opportunities that exist.  That is something we are trying to change.  My colleague, Mr. Richmond, has carried out an overview of every EU-related third level programme of study in the country.  We will publish that review, which is far more extensive than the report we are discussing today, with the support of the European Commission representation here in Dublin.  It will be distributed to every second level school, every career guidance counsellor and every careers service in every third level institution in the country.  We outline the various internships that are available in the various EU institutions in our green book publication.  We are working to lessen the information deficit in the third level sector.</p><p>  Deputy Durkan spoke about meetings that clash with meetings of this committee.  I can empathise with him as he faces such challenges.  I should add that European Movement Ireland is very supportive of the work of this committee.  We look forward to continuing to work with the committee to do everything possible to publicise and promote what it does and increase the level of engagement of Irish people.  In advance of the referendum on the fiscal stability treaty, various business groups and organisations with different viewpoints were allowed to make presentations at this forum.  We were afforded similar opportunities.  I commend the committee on the information booklet and various reports it produced at that time.</p></speech>

The total additional funding being sought for the HSE is &euro;360 million.  I am allocating a once-off extra Exchequer receipt of &euro;45 million from the Medical Defence Union, MDU and savings of &euro;70 million, which have been identified within my Department's Vote and will contribute towards the HSE requirement.  Thus the net cost to the Exchequer is &euro;245 million.  Chairman, this represents just 1.8% of the health sector budget for 2012.  Given that we are in a time of ever-reducing budgets in the past three years, with a reduction of &euro;2.5 billion, I believe this not to be unreasonable.</p><p>  This Supplementary Estimate must be seen in the context of the challenges that faced the Health Service Executive this year.  As Deputies will be aware, the health sector faced a very significant financial challenge in 2012 and 2013 will be no different.  The 2012 national service plan was based on the achievement of cost reductions of &euro;750 million to meet the cost of delivering the maximum level of services possible and commitments in the programme for Government.  A range of saving measures were identified in the Estimates to enable the HSE to meet these objectives in the implementation of the plan.  The shortfall in the HSE reflects the underlying expenditure difficulties in the acute hospital sector, child welfare and protection services and the demand led scheme.  It is worth emphasising that there are demand led schemes in health and a demand led element in our hospital services, which I will identify later.</p><p>  This Supplementary Estimate together with the savings in my Department's Vote, the extra Exchequer receipt from the MDU and other measures being taken by the HSE should ensure the HSE achieves a balanced Vote at the end of this year.  An additional &euro;162 million has been sought to meet deficits in services, specifically in the acute hospital sector and child welfare and protection services.  Spending on the primary care reimbursement service - effectively a demand led scheme - is projected to be in the region of &euro;230 million in deficit by the end of the year.  </p><p>  I will outline the details of the Estimate and the other measures being taken to address this year's deficit.  First, however, I will outline the reforms which have been initiated to strengthen the financial management system of the HSE.  My Department undertook strategic measures during 2012 to address the ongoing financial issues in the HSE.  A review of the financial management systems in the HSE was commissioned.  Its overall intention was to review the present state of the financial management system in place in the health sector in Ireland in the context of the serious overruns projected, the continuation of a challenging financial environment for the foreseeable future and the radical reforms envisioned in the programme for Government.  The review came up with a number of recommendations to strengthen the financial management process in the HSE with particular reference to managing the transition phase that the health sector is currently undergoing.  Subsequently PA Consulting were engaged to draw up urgent measures to be put in place to strengthen the HSE's financial management capacity and processes, having regard to the findings and recommendation of the Ogden review.  My Department is now working closely with PA Consulting and the HSE on a financial improvement programme for the HSE.  We have had many descriptions of the problems in the HSE over the years, but no remedy described and applied to it.  That has now changed with the measures being put in place following the PA Consulting report.</p><p>  The sector faced very significant financial challenges in 2012.  The budget targets set for the HSE were extremely demanding and regrettably were not all achieved.  The impact of the retirements under the "grace period" posed significant challenges, given that 4,700 people left the sector before the end of February.  While cost containment plans were rolled out across the health sector, the continued escalation of expenditure and PCRS has resulted in a projected deficit for the HSE this year.</p><p>  As 4,700 staff left the HSE, this meant we had to pay out considerably more in lump sum superannuation payments, however it did not mean we got savings across the board as many of these people had already left active service but had never formally retired and now took the opportunity to do so.  That had a further negative impact on the HSE budget.</p><p>  My Department has worked intensively with the main health insurers to agree a system of cash flow and accelerated payment, which will provide a cash flow benefit this year.  At any one point in time, some income will be outstanding for the treatment of private patients in public hospitals but reducing the time taken to recover the income outstanding will provide a cash flow benefit to the HSE.  This will be achieved in 2012 via the income collection agreement which has been just finalised with the three main insurers.</p><p>  The income collection agreement will reduce the total level of income outstanding to the HSE by insurers as it involves insurers making accelerated payments based on 70% of the estimated value of claims that have not yet been reported to insurers.  The balance of 30% will be paid upon the validation of a fully collated claim from the HSE.  The payment relates to treatment that has been already carried out in public hospitals but for which a claim has not yet been raised and therefore it is not an advance payment.</p></speech>

I do not know how the Minister came to those conclusions, but he did and it was obvious from as early as March last that the budget was in rag order and was deficient in terms of trying to provide services.  The Minister referred to demand led schemes, the increase in the number of medical card holders and other issues that could not be foreseen.  However, as early as March this year the former chief executive officer, CEO, of the HSE, Mr. Cathal Magee, said that the budget arithmetic was no longer valid and that the premises on which it was based were also no longer valid.  That is an indication of why we are here this evening, because it was identified last March.  In fact, when one looks at the aspirational nature of the budget arithmetic last year, it was evident that unless Government decisions were made and legislation was passed early in 2012 the budget would be in difficulty from the start.  I can point to a few issues such as hospital consultant pay, price referencing, generic substitution, agency staff and private health insurance recoupment.  None of those issues was dealt with comprehensively or in a meaningful way by the Minister, the Department or the HSE by bringing forward the proposals that were a critical component in the arithmetic of the Estimates the Minister presented to the House last year.  It is for those reasons we have always maintained it was a flawed budget from the start.</p><p>  We are now ramming through a &euro;360 million budget overspend.  Only a couple of months ago people with intellectual and physical disabilities were outside the gates of Government Buildings protesting at cuts that were miserly in terms of the overall budget.  If the budget had been reined in, as had been warned in the previous March, they would not have had to be there and the Minister could have gone about his business in a more orderly fashion, without forcing people to take to the streets to hold onto their basic rights.</p></speech>

When the signalled &euro;750 million in cuts in terms of the current year first presented on top of &euro;1 billion in cuts in 2011, I and other voices indicated at this committee and on the floor of the House that it was unsustainable and that our population's needs were going to run contrary to the Minister's approach.  This has proven to be the case.</p><p>  The backdrop to the Minister's further cuts of &euro;130 million last August was a dogged refusal on his part to accept that the situation was unsustainable.  Despite repeated denials and a dogged rejection of the concerns of this and other Deputies, the Minister is now before us with a &euro;360 million Supplementary Estimate to prevent services collapsing before the end of this month.  Of the &euro;130 million in cuts that the Minister announced at the end of August, one of the smallest elements, but by far and away the most notorious, involved the 450,000 hours cut in home help hours and a &euro;1.8 million cut in home care packages.</p><p>  I am willing to support this Vote because I recognise that it is needed.  I am using the opportunity to appeal to the Minister once again to recognise the serious pain, fear and discomfort that has been caused across the State as a result of those particular cuts.  I ask the Minister to use a small element of the &euro;360 million provision to reverse those cuts and to restore the home help hours and home care packages.  This is the very least that should be done.  They should be restored to pre-budget 2012 levels.</p><p>  I wish to ask a couple of questions regarding the Minister's press conference last week.  In the statement by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, she said that there was a commitment, and I have examined the press statement-----</p></speech>

At the press conference last week, the Minister of State mentioned that there was a commitment to restore home help services.  What does this mean?  It was also included in her press release.  In fact, she "welcomed" - that was the phraseology used - the commitment to restore.  What does this mean in real terms going into 2013?  Does it only mean that there will be no further home help cuts in 2013 or, in line with the normal person's understanding of the English language, as is the case for most of us, does it mean that what has been taken away will be restored?</p><p>  The single largest element of this Supplementary Estimate comprises the medical card services and community drug schemes.  Some &euro;240 million of the additional &euro;360 million is required.  I have no hesitation in supporting this, as we have mass unemployment, tens of thousands of people are no longer able to afford private health insurance and people are being further pushed into poverty as a result of social welfare cuts and job losses.  The medical cards are required.  This is inevitable and predictable.  However, what did the Minister mean when he stated at last week's press conference that there would be further restrictions on medical card eligibility next year?  Will he elaborate on what he meant by that?  Both commentaries - by the Minister of State and the Minister - require clarification, one in respect of further restrictions on medical card eligibility and the other in respect of restoring home help services.</p><p>  In the Minister's address to the committee, he stated, "The impact of the retirements under the 'grace period' posed significant challenges given that some 4,700 people left the sector before the end of February".</p></speech>

It was accepted by senior people in the HSE that the budget was unsustainable from very early this year.  There were &euro;1 billion in cuts last year and &euro;750 million in cuts this year.  We are talking about a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;360 million, with the prospect of another &euro;781 million in cuts in 2013, along with a loss of 3,200 additional staff.  I am seriously worried about the patients and the public using the health services.</p><p>  In the early autumn there were &euro;133 million of cuts, and I will briefly focus on the home help part of that.  The Minister has given assurances that a process will be put in place with the home help hours but I would like to see the cuts reversed.  Nevertheless, the Minister has given guarantees regarding the process by which the reviews of these home help hours will be done.  I am satisfied that what the Minister has indicated is not happening on the ground.</p><p>  One of my constituents is wheelchair bound, with no use in one hand and very limited use in the other hand.  This person is unable to stand, go to bed, use bathroom facilities or cook unaided.  That individual was assessed in October this year as requiring the hours that she had been allocated.  A month later she was supposedly assessed again, with the number of hours reduced.  Within a month, this individual's circumstances had not changed and there was no assessment either by a public health nurse or another professional but there was a reduction in the home help hours.  That is just one of a number of cases which I can relate, and I am sure other Deputies can do so as well.  Will the Minister comment on the question of home help hours?</p><p>  Will the Minister confirm that this Supplementary Estimate will allow him to open again the respite beds that were closed in the Community Hospital of the Assumption in Thurles?  Both the Minister and a local Fine Gael Deputy promised that these would be open again before the end of the year.  The Minister stated that his Department is working closely with the HSE and PA Consulting on a financial improvement programme for the HSE.  What does that mean and will we get details of it?  Will the Minister detail what exactly is being done in that regard?  Will he indicate what capital projects are affected by the reduction of &euro;7.5 million in the capital Vote?</p></speech>

Will the home help hours be restored fully for everybody requiring them?  Am I right in thinking the reason for the Supplementary Estimate is because, for example, it was not possible to collect money in time from health insurers?  Are we likely to have a similar problem next year?</p></speech>

Why are services in the west getting more than the rest?</p></speech>

On a serious note, I will deal with the questions as they were posed.  Deputy Kelleher keeps alluding to a budget deficit of &euro;360 million but I have pointed out that from within our own resources, the budget deficit is at &euro;245 million.  That is what is being sought.  The Deputy mentioned the previous chief executive of the HSE, indicating that he spoke about the accounts before this committee, referring to two issues in particular.  The first was that money from insurers had not been collected but at this stage, in excess of what was intended to be collected has been recouped.  The second issue was the need to get cheaper drugs.  A deal has been done which far exceeds what was originally envisaged, although not all of it will come this year.</p><p>  Deputy Kelleher argued there was a complete lack of negotiations but intense negotiations were ongoing all year.  The Deputy knows that the pharmaceutical industry is a major employer in this country, with over 20,000 people in the sector and 100,000 people indirectly dependent on it.  There are billions of euro in exports and income to the State from this area.  It is difficult to ensure that we continue to support the industry in the research, development and innovation in new drugs while at the same time making it very clear that we need much better value for money for existing drugs and many drugs that will be going off patent.  We have reached a good deal from the perspective of the taxpayer and patient who will consume the pharmaceutical agents.</p><p>  Many agents have described the problem but very few give us a remedy.  PA Consulting has done that and I will elaborate on that presently.  There was no reduction in the run rate until the new acting chief executive, Mr. Tony O'Brien, took over; there has been a reduction in September, October and November.  That process will continue and I have absolute faith in the new director general designate.</p><p>  Nobody with a disability had personal assistance hours cut.  There was some reduction in home help, as mentioned by others.  The issue has been of considerable concern to people.  I have read to this committee on a number of occasions the list of issues that I sought to be addressed during the course of any reduction of hours.  This was not done initially.</p></speech>
