Representatives of the HSE will also attend our meetings.  We must deal with correspondence received late yesterday evening from the HSE regarding the funding of the pension of a previous CEO of the CRC, Mr. Paul Kiely.  We will deal with Mr. Conlan first and, if possible, have a short break at 1.30 p.m or earlier before commencing the second session.  The various speakers for both sessions have been agreed.</p><p>  I refer to the minutes of the meetings of 12 December, 17 December, 19 December and 20 December.  Are the minutes of the meetings agreed?  Agreed.  Are there any matters arising from the minutes?  I refer to the meeting of 20 December with NAMA.  There is a clarification on the evidence given by the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of EU approval for the loans transfer and the fact that while it is not finalised, it has been completed for the first two tranches of loans.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's letter is item 3.8A.  </p><p>  The next items are correspondence from accounting officers or Ministers.  Item 3A.1, correspondence dated 23 December 2013 from Professor Noel Whelan, chairman of St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group regarding public compliance.  The correspondence is relevant to today&rsquo;s meeting and will be noted and published.  Item 3A.2 is correspondence dated 23 December 2013 from Mr. Adrian Neilan, CEO of Bord na gCon, regarding further information requested at the committee's meeting on 7 November 2013, which is to be noted and published.  We will return to this correspondence when the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the acquisition of the Limerick stadium is before us.  We should have it before us within a short period.</p><p>  Item 3A.3 is correspondence dated 21 December 2013 from Dr. Olive Braiden, chair of the National Gallery of Ireland, regarding further information requested at the meeting on 21 November 2013.  The correspondence will be noted and published.  Items 3A.10 and 3A.11 also refer to this and a note analysing the information received from the National Gallery and the two Departments has been prepared and will be circulated for next week&rsquo;s meeting.  We can then decide whether the matter warrants further investigation.  Item 3A.4 is correspondence dated 18 December 2013 from Mr. Paul Maloney, former CEO of Dublin Docklands Development Authority, regarding further information requested at the meeting of 12 December 2013.  It will be noted and published.</p><p>  Item 3A.5 is correspondence from Ms. Mary Day, CEO Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, and contains further information requested at PAC meeting of 19 November 2013.  It will be noted and published.  Item 3A.6 is correspondence dated 19 December 2013 from Mr. Billy Hawkes, Data Protection Commissioner, regarding a response to the letter from the clerk to the committee dated 18 December 2013 regarding information supplied by a whistleblower, which is to be noted and published.  </p><p>  Item 3A.7 is correspondence, dated 24 December 2013, from Mr. Martin Callinan, Commissioner for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in response to letter from clerk to the committee dated 18 December 2013 on information supplied by a whistle blower.  This is to be noted and published.  I propose that we reply to the Commissioner reiterating the fact that our expert legal advice, which we are entitled to rely on, indicates the documentation was lawfully received from the whistle blower.  This matter will be dealt with substantively next week when we examine Chapter 7, on the management of the fixed charge notice system.  I suggest members get a briefing from the clerk and the parliamentary legal advisor next Wednesday on the outcome of the analysis undertaken on the material supplied.  I suggest we meet at 6 p.m on Wednesday.</p><p>  Item 3A.8 is correspondence dated 23 December 2013 from Mr. Seamus McCarthy, Comptroller and Auditor General, regarding the clarification I referred to earlier.  It will be noted.</p><p>  Item 3A.9 is correspondence, dated 23 December 2013, from Professor Niamh Brennan, former chairperson of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, requesting a transcript of the meeting.  That will be noted.  Professor Brennan will come before us shortly.  Item 3A.10 is correspondence, dated 7 January 2013, from Mr. Joe Hamill, Secretary General at the Department of the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht regarding further information requested at the meeting on 21 November 2013.  We have already dealt with this and will return to it next week.

This is to be noted and published.  It relates to correspondence we have asked for between NAMA and the Department.  We should express to the Department our worry and concern regarding documents that have gone missing.  We should request an up-to-date report.  They are important documents relevant to future inquiries, perhaps, and it is important we retrace the documents and that they are presented as required.</p><p>  Item 3A.13 is correspondence dated 7 January 2014 from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General at the Department of Education and Skills, regarding issues raised at meeting of 27 November 2013 about the award of contracts for school transport services.  This is to be noted and published.  Item 3A.14 is correspondence received on 10 January 2014 from Mr. John Crawley, financial advisor of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, regarding further information requested at the meeting of 19 December 2013.  This is to be noted; we will return to the issue at our meeting on 6 February 2014.  </p><p>  Item 3A.15 is correspondence dated 14 January 2014 from Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien, HSE director general, regarding a letter to me, as Chairman, about further information requested at the meeting of 11 November 2013.  This is to be noted and published and is relevant to today&rsquo;s meeting as it relates to the Central Remedial Clinic.

No. 3B.2 is correspondence dated 6 January 2014 from Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin, Secretary General of the Department of Health, regarding the hepatitis C tribunal, to be noted and a copy to be forwarded to Mr. Edward Stevenson.

They are listed from 4.1 to 4.20.  If there are any issues arising from these reports, members might raise them with the clerk and we can discuss them at a future meeting.  A number of reports and accounts have been submitted, so members should note the content of those.</p><p> Our work programme is now on the screen.  A number of meetings have been scheduled up to the Easter break.  This programme is subject to change as we need to consider the examination of further section 38 bodies and also issues relating to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  </p><p> Do members have any matters to raise under any other business?</p></speech>

We are waiting for guidelines from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges but a legal application must go in and it must be legally proofed.  It is more complex than we thought originally but it will be dealt with.  We will have it finalised this week.  I will brief the Chairman.  We are in the hands of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in terms of whether it gives us compellability powers.  It is not as straightforward as we had anticipated originally.  It is fairly complex.  We need to dot our i's and cross our t's.</p></speech>

That submission must be robust in terms of its legal position and what we intend to do.  The draft letter is being double checked and it will go to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It is up to it to give us or not to give us permission.  It is a test in terms of the process for this committee and it is one I hope will be expedited in the context of the request and then the response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014011600004#C00900"><p>What is the anticipated timeline for completion of the guidelines?</p></speech>

I think they were being legally proofed also by a senior counsel.  I will get a note on that for the committee next week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014011600004#C01100"><p>Much of this is arising from the new legislation.  As Deputy Dowds said, it is critical in terms of the compellability issue.  Therefore, we must be very clear of our legal position in that regard because there are implications if it is not successful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014011600004#C01200"><p>It would be helpful to the committee if we had an indication of the timeline.</p></speech>

They are in a different league because they are not public servants.  The HSE has told us it has written to the section 39 bodies asking them to come back to it in regard to compliance.</p></speech>

The Chairman will remember I raised it at the last session.  I understood that those who carried out the audit would be in communication with the Department of Health to give the names of those organisations where that suggestion was made and that the Department would go back and investigate the matter further.  I raise it because I do not see it in any of the correspondence from the HSE and I do not believe we have received anything from the Department of Health to indicate that matter is in hand and is being addressed.</p></speech>

The committee will meet the Accounting Officer of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for examination of the 2012 annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, chapter 7 - management of the fixed charge notice system.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  When we meet next week, one of the issues we will have to consider at our 6 p.m. meeting is the request from the whistleblower to come before the Committee on Public Accounts.  We need to make a decision on that.  We can do that on Wednesday.</p></speech>

I would like to apologise that elements of my opening statement were in the media this morning but it had nothing to do with me.</p> <p> This is my statement.  Chairman, Deputies, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the PAC for this opportunity to make a statement regarding recent events at the CRC and my role in those events.  My primary intention today is to give a full account to the committee pertaining to my role and knowledge of the CRC and to provide any information I can to assist the committee in its work.  First, I want to say that I recognise the importance of the committee's work in this regard on several levels, not least in its role of flushing out the ambiguities that exist around how public moneys, no matter where they are sourced, are used by section 38 agencies.  Everything should be clear and transparent to all stakeholders in charities but in terms of the CRC, that has not been clear or transparent enough prior to the committee undertaking its work.  </p><p> Given the public access to this committee through the media and without seeking to justify for a moment the apportionment of moneys, which is not my aim, I respectfully ask that everyone with an interest in the continuation of the CRC's good work take into consideration a few facts.  First, the importance and excellence of the CRC's service to its clients is not being questioned and that vital work depends on public support.  Second, the percentage of the overall CRC budget that is under scrutiny with regard to additional salary payments is less than 1%.  Third, the practice of paying allowances is being phased out.  The salary for the office of chief executive has been pegged back to the HSE pay scale for the first time ever.  This will give the next chief executive of the CRC a strong base from which to address the five remaining allowances.  Fourth, a new board and chief executive will be able to start with a clean slate, with greater transparency and will be able to seek the public's continued vital support for its work.  Finally, in this regard, I wish to address the public perception that has developed that charitable donations were siphoned off specifically to pay salary allowances.  That was never my understanding of how funds were managed.  The CRC pools all of its revenue from many sources each year into one fund and applies them jointly to the central overheads which include some salary allowances.  Of course, all moneys received by the CRC are public moneys of one form or another and there is no support for salary payments in excess of HSE pay scales.  The idea that there was a transfer of moneys from public donations directly to into the salaries of a number of executives is inaccurate in itself.</p><p> The second point I want to address relates to my appearance at this committee.  When I was first asked to appear on 11 December 2013, I was not in a position to be an effective witness.  I had just returned from my honeymoon in the United States, where I was for three weeks and where I first learned of the questions being asked.  As the committee can appreciate, I was highly stressed by all that had transpired, particularly by the tone and volume of the media coverage.  I had just tendered my resignation from the CRC and because of this, I was told that I had no access to my files in the CRC.  In addition, prior to the PAC meeting that week, my home was besieged for days by journalists, forcing my wife and I to leave for several days in order to maintain some level of privacy.  I did not have the time or the resources to prepare adequately for such an appearance and to be an effective witness.  When these circumstances changed, I was happy to accept the invitation and I want to assure the PAC that no disrespect was intended by my failure to attend.  </p><p> A number of issues have arisen which I would like to address, the first being the manner of my appointment.  I was not responsible for my own appointment; nor was I responsible for setting the salary I was offered.  When the position of CEO became available in the CRC in April 2013, having worked as CEO in the matter for eight years until December 2012 and having also served on the board of the CRC for eight years, I felt very qualified to apply.  I inquired of the then chairman whether, as a member of the board, I could apply as an internal candidate.  When he indicated that I could, I formally removed myself from any involvement in the discussion on the recruitment process and formally applied for the position to Amrop Strategis, the external consultancy appointed to manage the process.  Please note that I would have done this regardless of whether the search was taking place on an internal or external basis.  I then attended an interview co-ordinated by Amrop Strategis and three members of the CRC board and was subsequently offered the position with a salary of &euro;125,000.  I found out later that there were three other internal candidates interviewed for the position.  </p><p> On my appointment, I became aware of the HSE issues with the salary my position had been awarded and I set about establishing a salary scale for the job.  The salary was 48% lower than that of my predecessor and approximately &euro;15,000 higher than that of the line managers who report to the CEO's office.  A salary range was eventually agreed with the HSE of group 1 chief executives on a scale of &euro;82,000 to &euro;98,000.  My own salary was reduced to reflect this.  As the salary awarded had been greater than the HSE-approved figure, I have since returned any excess.  When I took over as CEO of the CRC, five members of the senior staff were on salaries in excess of the HSE-approved levels and were in receipt of what are now called top-up payments.  While I totally understand the confusion that these payments have caused in the public domain, I would like to provide some context for their payment.  Top-up payments or allowances were ordinarily used when the amount received from the HSE would not cover the full cost of a salary.  They were also used in consideration of people taking on extra duties and responsibilities.  In respect of the CRC, it is my understanding that these payments were made with the full knowledge of the HSE, arising from discussions between the executive and the chair of the board in 2009.  It was also agreed with the HSE that this practice would be phased out and that all salaries would become compliant over time.  </p><p> In July 2013 when I took up the position of CEO, allowances in the CRC amounted to a total of approximately &euro;125,000 annually.  I was not happy with this and resolved to end the practice as soon as practicable.  As some of the recipients were coming close to retirement, I decided to do this on a phased basis.  I firmly believed that with time and a pragmatic approach from all involved, this matter could be resolved.  I also instructed that all future recruitment would be done in a HSE-compliant fashion.  </p><p> Questions have also been raised in this chamber and in the media about the sale of CRC Medical Devices which I would like to address.  CRC Medical Devices was set up in 2007 with the intention of raising extra moneys to support and develop CRC activities.  A loan of &euro;550,000 from the Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic Limited was approved for this venture.  The business was importing and customising wheelchairs for individual users and was moderately successful initially.  However, due to the decline in the economy and the resulting pressure on prices and margins, the company struggled in subsequent years.  By December 2012 the accumulated losses were &euro;462,000.  On being appointed CEO of the CRC, my first priority was to sort this matter out.  I set about exploring options, including closing the business or selling it.  I decided on the latter and three companies expressed an interest in purchasing the business.  One of these companies, MMS Medical Limited, signed the sale agreement to procure the goodwill, assets and stock last November for approximately &euro;410,000, which could rise to &euro;510,000, which will, over time, be paid back to the Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic Limited.  This agreement also had the added advantage of protecting the jobs of the employees of CRC Medical Devices.  While I fully recognise that it does not fully cover the full cost of the investment, I believe it is the best deal that we could have completed, given the time scale and the losses being incurred.  </p><p> I have worked in medical administration for over 20 years.  During that time I was CEO in the Mater Hospital for eight years, Deputy CEO for five years and finance director for seven years.  During my time in the Mater I was responsible for 3,000 staff and budgets ranging from &euro;200 million to &euro;250 million per annum.  I also played a significant role in the new Mater Hospital development programme, a &euro;300 million project which was brought in on time and on budget.  I was intrinsically involved with the medical specialists in bringing in the lung transplant programme to the Mater Hospital.  I have served on many boards in a voluntary capacity.  I have always acted in a professional and honest way.  Recent events and the way they have been reported have upset me greatly, not just the way in which my reputation was sullied without basis, but also the way in which the whole CRC organisation has been cast under a shadow.</p> <p>I am well aware of the great work it does every day.  I am saddened by the effect these events are having on its ability to raise much-needed funds for the good work it does.  As I said at the outset, I was in the US when these events began to unfold.  Due to the scale and nature of the coverage and commentary on the matter, I felt the CRC was being damaged and wholesale change was needed at the top of the organisation so that the public can engage with and trust it again.  It was for that reason that I felt the appropriate thing for me to do was to tender my resignation, thereby giving the CRC a chance to win back the public's trust, which is so vital to its ability to raise funds and secure its annual operations and future enhancements.</p><p> As regards non-compliance on salaries, I have played a part in establishing a precedent whereby the remuneration of chief executives of the CRC will be set in compliance with the HSE for the first time in the history of the CRC.  In time, this will be a key factor in securing the adjustment of the remaining salaries that exceed the pay scales.  This should position the CRC to be in full compliance with the HSE.  It should form the basis for full transparency to all of the CRC's stakeholders in the future.  I hope these adjustments and changes will allow people to see their way to continuing their much-needed support for an organisation that has made a telling contribution to its clients, their families and the wider community since its establishment in 1960.  That concludes my statement.  I thank the committee for its forbearance.</p></speech>

We have all got copies of it.  I want to get those issues out in the open before I raise them with Mr. Conlan.  It appears that at its meeting of 11 December last, this committee was misled about the terms of the pension awards to Mr. Paul Kiely.  It was certainly misled by omission, and I suggest it was knowingly misled.  According to the letter that was sent to the Chairman, there are specific issues regarding what we were told.  The letter suggests that an additional lump sum was paid to Mr. Kiely, and not declared, as part of a confidential agreement that was obviously never supposed to see the light of day.  The letter also suggests that payments made to Mr. Kiely might be in breach of the memorandum and articles of association of the CRC.  This is an extraordinarily serious suggestion for the HSE to make.  We are talking about large payments which, as part of a kind of pretend operation, allow Mr. Kiely to be paid a pension as though he had worked until November 2016.  We did not know about that either.  Before we go ahead and ask questions of Mr. Conlan, who was on the board at the time, I would like to ask the representatives of the HSE whether they have anything with which they can back this up.  Can they give us any evidence in support of what has been suggested?</p></speech>

It is dated 14 January 2014.  It states:<blockquote><br />Dear Mr. O'Brien,<br />As you will be aware, as the Interim Administrator I am working through a range of operational, governance and legacy issues at the Central Remedial Clinic (CRC).<br />It is anticipated that much of the related work and audits will be completed by the end of the first quarter of this year, at which time issues requiring further attention of the CRC/HSE will have been identified.  However, at this stage, it is necessary to brief you on a significant remuneration issue which has now been identified.<br />The issue of <i>remuneration</i>continued to be a live issue for the Board of Governors of the CRC in early 2013.  The Chairman formally announced to the Board, at a special meeting in February 2013, that the Chief Executive, Mr. Paul Kiely wished to resign in June 2013.  The Board accepted Mr. Kiely's resignation and approved, notwithstanding the focus on remuneration, a retirement package.  The Chairman, in outlining the details of this package, intimated that the proposed package 'was considerably less beneficial to Mr. Kiely' when compared with the terms of the HSE's Early Retirement Scheme.  It was, also, agreed by the Board that the terms of Mr. Kiely's settlement would be confidential and that a legally binding confidentiality agreement would be put in place.<br />Mr. Kiely received in his final salary payment from the CRC in June 2013, the following amounts in addition to his basic salary: &euro;200,000 Tax Free<br /><i>&euro;273,336 Taxable</i><br /><i>&euro;473,336 Total </i>In addition, an amount of &euro;268,689 was paid to Mercers to ensure that Mr. Kiely's pension/lump sum benefits would not be less than if Mr. Kiely had continued to remain on as Chief Executive until November 2016.  At about the time of this final payment, an amount of &euro;700,000 (in two instalments of &euro;450,000 and &euro;250,000) was paid by the Friends and Supporters of the CRC that was described in the draft internal accounts as a donation.  The minutes of the Friends and Supporters does not record an approval for this 'donation' (which represents almost half its annual income) by the Board of Directors.  The payments to Mr. Kiely could not have been made by the CRC if the &euro;700,000 had not been received from the Friends and Supporters.<br />The above arrangements raise a number of serious matters:- The CRC's Memorandum of Association allows its income, whencesoever derived, to be applied for payment of reasonable and proper remuneration of any officer in return for services actually rendered.  Payment of ex gratia amounts of the magnitude paid in the above case would not appear to be in line with the Memorandum.<br />- The benefits derived from the package paid, coupled with the benefits to be derived from the payment of further benefits under the terms of Mr. Kiely's defined benefit pension scheme membership, could not be regarded as being considerably less beneficial to Mr. Kiely than the HSE Early Retirement Scheme.<br />- The cost of the package to the CRC/Friends and Supporters of the CRC is substantially greater than an option of allowing Mr. Kiely to retire on the basis of pension benefits accrued to date of retirement.  However, early retirement with payment of benefits was not an option under the terms of the pension scheme.  It should be noted that pension and lump sum benefits would be paid out of the pension fund and not by the employer.  The CRC contributes to the pension fund on a current basis.<br />- Payment calculations in relation to benefits are based on a remuneration, of which, approximately half, has not been adjusted for public sector pay cuts.In relation to confidentiality, it is difficult to envisage how payments amounting to &euro;700,000 by the Friends and Supporters to the CRC which is clearly linked to the payment made to Mr. Kiely could, or indeed should, not be disclosed in the accounts of the Friends and Supporters of the CRC and the CRC.</blockquote></p> <p><blockquote>It should also be noted that the minutes of the Board of Governors meetings (which record the Board approval of the package) are subject to disclosure under FOI.<br />I have not, as yet, had sight of the detailed advices (from EY and Mercers) provided to the Board/Remuneration Committee in support of the granting of the package/payments, and these may cast further light on the Board's rationale for sanctioning the package.  However, on the basis of the available documentation, the arrangements are considerably at variance from the understanding the PAC may have gained from evidence given at the hearing attended by representatives of the CRC Board of Governors.  The onus is on the HSE, as its accounts are the subject of the examination by the PAC, to ensure that complete information, in so far as is possible, is available to the PAC.<br />At this stage, it is necessary for the CRC to satisfy itself that the payments made/benefits conferred are reasonable and proper (in the context of its Memorandum of Association) and that any amounts paid were correctly calculated and authorised.  In the event of there being a loss to the CRC (or the Friends and Supporters of the CRC), steps will be required to be taken to make good that loss and deal with other consequential issues. <br />Yours sincerely, <br />John Cregan <br />Internal Administrator</blockquote></p></speech>

It is difficult, in a short period, to take it all in.  Perhaps Mr. O'Brien will clarify a few issues for us.  He is obviously correct that this is many miles away from what the committee was told.  The package deal for Mr. Kiely is unrecognisable.  What we understood, and this came out at the previous meeting, was that Mr. Kiely was getting &euro;200,000 tax free.  What we did not understand, did not know and were not told was that there was an extra sum of &euro;273,000 which was taxable.  Presumably this was part of his pay-off.  We now find that what Mr. Kiely got was &euro;473,000 as a kind of pay-off, with &euro;273,000 taxable.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Our director general took immediate steps following that meeting.  That was well documented and publicised.  On 18 December 2013, Mr. Cregan was appointed as the internal administrator in the CRC.  At the time, we also gave a number of commitments to the Committee of Public Accounts that, following Mr. Conlan's resignation, we would immediately seek to fill the next CEO post by the Public Appointments Service, which is a matter in hand, and also on the issue of replacing the board.  This is part of the commitments the HSE gave the Committee of Public Accounts as to how it would ensure the stabilisation of the CRC and ensure that its absolutely essential services and the work that all the staff are doing continued, but also bring absolute clarity to the governance of the organisation.</p></speech>

I cannot understand why it lost money because there were significant margins and its competitors seemed to be making money.  According to research that I have done, at least 80% of its competitors were making money but this company did not.  Mr. Conlan decided to sell it, which may have been a good decision.  Mr. Conlan decided to do that early on.  Why was there no tender?</p></speech>

The company was losing between &euro;8,000 and &euro;10,000 per month and if we extended the term, the company would have ended up being wound up rather than sold on.  We put the word out into the market.  Everyone who was anyone in the business was aware of it.</p></speech>

It was a decision I had to make.  Sometimes one must take decisions.  The risk was that we would get nothing back.  At least now, with the agreement that has been put in place with MMS Medical, there is some recovery of moneys and the six jobs that had been in CRC Medical Devices were saved.  I believe that if we had gone to tender and extended it for six months or longer, the company would have gone bust.  That would have been the end of it, no moneys would have been received back and the jobs would have been lost.</p></speech>

To me it is very simple, our job as a committee concerns public moneys and moneys collected by the public.  A sum of &euro;700,000 that should have gone to front-line services was transferred from one company, the Friends and Supporters of the CRC, to the main company, CRC, and classified as a donation &ndash; it was some donation &ndash; which would have been fine if it had been used for front-line services.  Would Mr. Conlan reflect on what I have asked him - does he think it is credible that he was not aware of these payments?  Does he think that is credible?</p></speech>

The accounts were signed off in May 2013 and then, by coincidence, these payments of &euro;742,000 were all paid in June 2013.  Is that correct?  They were all paid after the accounts were signed off.  There are a lot of coincidences, a lot of timing and dates after things have been signed off.  People were still applying for front-line services.  Half the 2013 annual income of the CRC friends and supporters was being raided for one individual who was leaving.  Mr. Conlan is telling me that he was a member of the board at the time when this agreement was signed, that he became the chief executive officer, but he was not aware of it.</p></speech>

That was the conversation that triggered all of this debate about public moneys and so on.</p><p>  The proposal is that we invite the members who attended the special board meeting, including those witnesses who gave evidence on the last occasion, and bring them all together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I would presume, in view of the fact that it was a special meeting, that the reasons for the meeting were included on the invitation to board members.  We need to know whether the Health Service Executive has that documentation setting out the reasons for the special meeting.  The first question that arises in this regard is whether Mr. Conlan has that documentation in his possession today and, if not, whether he can obtain it for the committee.  As I said, this was not a regular board meeting; the letter makes it clear that it was a special meeting.  The second question is whether Mr. Conlan himself received that notification.</p></speech>

Can he understand how shocked I am, as a teacher who is on leave of absence from Scoil Mochua, which is under the patronage of the CRC, at these revelations?  I thought the limits of my capacity to be shocked had been reached at the last meeting, but I was wrong.  The staff and students of Scoil Mochua are also shocked at what has transpired.  Does Mr. Conlan comprehend how these revelations take away from the core work in which the CRC is meant to be engaged?  One of the problems with this discussion is that it is easy to forget that the point of the CRC is to look after the needs of the students and patients in its care.  Does Mr. Conlan appreciate the huge damage that has been done to those people as a consequence of what has transpired?</p></speech>

This matter was clarified by Mr. Kiely at our second last engagement when he distinguished between the two pension funds operating in the CRC, one of which was the voluntary hospitals pension fund - the VHSS that has been referred to - and the other relating to a group of workers in the CRC who were in a privately-funded pension scheme.  He made reference to the fact that:<blockquote><br />The Central Remedial Clinic's advisers on its pension fund, Irish Pensions Trust, took the opportunity of putting together an application in order that the clinic could address the deficit in the pension fund for the Pensions Board ... The 70 staff members were balloted.  The partnership arrangement to meet the minimum funding standard by 2017 meant that the individuals had to increase their rate of contribution.  They had to double their rate of contribution.  The clinic had to increase its rate of contribution by 2.5% and put in a lump sum which was actuarially calculated.  Consider the reason the books show the transfer of the &euro;3 million.  The &euro;3 million was the lump sum that went in for those 70 individuals because it was unanimously accepted by the staff to protect their pensions.</blockquote></p></speech>

I return to a question I posed when Mr. Kiely and other members of the now defunct board came before the committee.  It is probably best to direct said question to the HSE, which, unlike the former board of the CRC, is in a position to take action on the matter.  I was aware that in the south-west Dublin area adult services were to be provided by the CRC after it had received a significant sum from the HSE or what was the then health board.  I am not sure of the exact date but I think it was 2003.  Those services collapsed approximately three months after they were set up.  The were provided at Scoil Mochua.  I understand that in 2010 the director of adult services at the CRC stated that it was still receiving the money relating to those services.  As far as I can see, no former students of Scoil Mochua benefited from the services.  Is Mr. O'Brien in a position to obtain an answer to my question on this matter?  Will he indicate if the CRC is still in receipt of money for these services?  Have any former pupils of Scoil Mochua or any residents of south-west Dublin or Kildare benefited from the services in question?  As already stated, I put this question to the members of the former board.  However, I presume that I cannot expect to receive an answer from them.  I would appreciate it if I could obtain a written answer on the matter from the HSE.  Perhaps its representatives might discuss this issue with the director of adult services at the CRC.</p><p>  I do not know whether Mr. Conlan is aware that the health services building at the school in Clondalkin is in a very ramshackle state.  This has been the case for several years, despite the existence of this big pot of money which the Friends and Supporters of the CRC had in its possession.  The electrics are dodgy and the roof is leaking.  During the Celtic tiger era, three different plans regarding the erection of new buildings were displayed on the walls of the school.  I am curious to know the amount of money that was spent on the preparation of these plans, particularly in view of the fact that construction never proceeded.  I would be grateful if this matter could be investigated.</p><p>  Would it also be possible for an investigation to be carried out in respect of the appointment of special needs assistants in either 2010 or 2009 and why it took so long for these individuals to be paid directly by the Department of Education and Skills?  I am aware that those individuals were eventually paid.  However, as a result of the fact that they received lump sums, many of them lost money on foot of taxation considerations.  I would appreciate it if the HSE could also investigate this matter.</p><p>  There are one or two other questions I wish to put to Mr. O'Brien in respect of the future.  What is the position regarding the replacement of the board of the CRC and the appointment of a new CEO?  How will the CRC be governed from now on?</p></speech>

We expect to advertise the post in the next one to two weeks.

He said he was unaware of the meeting and he cited an alternative date of March.  As the conversation moved on, not alone did he recall the special meeting but he was able to tell us that he was in Spain and that he had tendered his apologies for the meeting.</p><p>  As regards the vacancy for CEO, the position which he occupied for a number of months, initially in response to questioning Mr. Conlan said that he had only known of the vacancy in March.  Later, when pressed, he conceded that he had received a telephone call.  I must say to Mr. Conlan that these are not just matters of detail for the committee.  It bothers me a lot that he has to be pressed to give full information on basic issues such as those.</p></speech>

Given the matters at hand, with which he is fully conversant at this stage and for which he was requesting information to prepare, the obvious years for which he would need those minutes would be 2012 and 2013.

I do not accept for a second that a person of Mr. Conlan&rsquo;s experience and competence who is conversant with the issues at hand just accidentally forgot to ask for records of critical minutes to prepare himself for a meeting of an Oireachtas committee.  He is in the Oireachtas now.  As Mr. Conlan knows, this is the process of accountability.  I find that very odd.</p><p>  Could I put it to Mr. Conlan that, notwithstanding his explanation for his non-appearance at the committee meeting when he was invited, my perception is that when he resigned from the position it was because he wanted to wash his hands of the situation and run a million miles away from it?  That was my sense of it, and I do not think I was alone in thinking that.  Mr. Conlan&rsquo;s actions and the level of evasiveness that he is demonstrating today suggest that this in fact remains his position.  That is how I read it.</p></speech>

I think it must be put into a certain context, that the amount of moneys being put into salary top-ups at the CRC was less than 1% of its budget.  When the CRC started its business in 1960, 100% of salaries were paid from donations and so it has come a long way and sometimes decisions must be made that are practical and pragmatic.  I do accept, however, that the practice should cease.  However, it is in place and it must be brought to a conclusion.</p></speech>

Moneys were used that were charitable or supportive donations for the work of the CRC.  A proportion of those moneys was used for top-ups for salaries for a number of senior people in the organisation.  In case Mr. Conlan is under any illusion, the public regards that as being wrong.  Clients and service users of the CRC regard that as being wrong.  I would have thought that after everything we have been through in these committee meetings and the public debate surrounding it, Mr. Conlan would have landed on the position that it also was a wrong thing to do.</p></speech>

Mr. Conlan has stated he was not aware of the appointment of MERC.  Members have just received the minutes of the meeting which took place on 25 March.  They refer to the fact that the chairman informed the meeting that Mr. Nugent and Mr. Conlan had a preliminary meeting with MERC, a recruitment company, to discuss the available options and that a proposal was awaited from MERC.  Moreover, a second meeting had been scheduled with another company, Amrop, which would be attended by the chairman and Mr. Nugent.  Further on, the minutes go on to the recruitment sub-committee and state it was decided that a recruitment sub-committee should be formed to oversee the process of replacing the chief executive and the chairman, Mr. Nugent and Mr. Conlan were nominated.</p> <p>That is in direct contradiction of what Mr. Conlan told this Committee of Public Accounts hearing earlier, in answering questions from a number of members.

He is economic with the truth here, or with the facts.  That is the frustration being experienced by members.  I must draw Mr. Conlan's attention to the importance of this meeting and the evidence being given.  It would appear to me that Mr. Conlan is not giving the full picture when he is asked questions.  It is hard to believe some of his remarks and commentary.  It is a fact here, noted in the minute of 25 March, and it is in direct contradiction of what Mr. Conlan stated earlier in answer to questions from the members of this committee.  It is not acceptable that Mr. Conlan would continue in this vein because the paperwork is being slowly dripped to us and we are having to extract a considerable amount of information painstakingly from him.  That is totally unacceptable.  I must ask Mr. Conlan, in answer to members' questions, would he please disclose the full facts.</p><p>  Deputy Harris is the next speaker.  I am sorry for cutting in here but it is merely to have it at such a level that at least we can get the truth out.  Mr. Conlan talks about the work being done by the CRC.  He lavished the staff with praise, and I agree with him, but then he goes on to causes serious damage to the organisation by the manner in which he is conducting his hearing here this morning.  I caution Mr. Conlan in this regard.  It is not acceptable.  I want to see the full facts being explained here to members in answer to their questions.</p><p>  I cited a number of issues here in regard to these minutes.  I also would say to Mr. Conlan that in his opening remarks he stated, "The idea that there was a transfer of moneys from public donations directly into the salaries of a number of executives is inaccurate in itself".  That is nonsense.</p></speech>

I did not have the chance to scan those minutes.  We can now establish that not alone was Mr. Conlan aware of the CEO vacating the position, but that from my reading of this because he had gone to the lengths of conducting preliminary meetings with recruitment specialists, it would appear he was so aware prior to the special meeting.</p></speech>

This is not a comedy hour.  Mr. Conlan is before an Oireachtas committee and he is honour bound and duty bound to state the full facts.  As I stated to him earlier, I had the strong feeling that he was attempting to palm us off or mislead us.  I now discover, perhaps, that Mr. Conlan has come in here to tell downright lies.  As a member of this committee, I can tell him I do not appreciate that and I am sure my colleagues and the Cathaoirleach feel exactly the same way.</p><p>  Mr. Conlan did know about Mr. Kiely exiting his position.  Mr. Conlan was part and parcel of managing the process.  He should not tell me that he only discovered today about this gold-plated pension package.  I do not accept that.</p></speech>

Was Mr. Conlan aware of that?  He probably does not remember.</p><p>  Mr. Conlan is a member of the board, Mr. Kiely is exiting and Mr. Conlan has no knowledge of this pension package that has been agreed by the board of which he is a member.  That is not credible on any level.  Personally, I would like to see Mr. Conlan alongside Mr. Kiely and the other board members on the next occasion so that we can test that proposition with them.  I rather suspect that, as and when we do so, we might arrive at a different conclusion or Mr. Conlan's recollection might be more accurate than it is today.

We will return to all of this, but it is important to state briefly that, for staff, service users and those who donate, today, rather than being a moment of clarity and getting matters back on track, has been another knock to the clinic, and that is shameful.  Mr. Conlan should have come before this committee fully informed and fully minded to tell the full unvarnished truth and to give us the full facts.  He was not prepared to do that today.

I do not think I have ever been at a meeting where the emotions are such that we are angered and saddened.  It is fast transpiring today that the friends' and supporters' group, a good and noble concept, had been transferred into the directors' and friends' group with more than half of the annual income going to pay off a lad by his buddies on the way out the door.</p> <p> I want to start with Mr. O&rsquo;Brien.  I thank the HSE for the upfront nature of and fast speed at which it has been getting the relevant information.  I hope and trust this will be the beginning of a fruitful relationship with this committee.</p><p> Obviously, the interim administrator is inquiring into the financial situation within the CRC.  The director general, Mr. Tony O'Brien, and the interim administrator have made comments on the pension arrangement and goodbye package given to Mr. Kiely.  Is Mr. Barry O'Brien aware of any other financial issues that are being considered or that have caused concern for the interim administrator?</p></speech>

That is why the DG wrote to the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts to advise him on the matter.  He does say that it is anticipated that much of the work related to the audits will be completed by the end of the first quarter.  What we were challenged to do was look at all the operational bases of CRC, ensure that they were sound and that we had good governance.  He is covering a broad range of issues.</p></speech>

I can imagine such media attention and difficult questions would cause anybody stress at a human level.  However, can Mr. Conlan imagine the level of stress caused among the staff, whose boss Mr. Conlan was, on finding out that a board on which Mr. Conlan sat and for which he shared responsibility basically gave a sweetheart deal to his predecessor at a time when staff were being asked to take public sector pay cuts?  Can he imagine the stress of the clients, who had to suffer a diminution of front-line services, or the volunteers collecting the money?  While I accept that Mr. Conlan was stressed, the difference is that he was a participant in what happened at the CRC.  As a participant, and as someone who must accept collective responsibility for what happened at the CRC, what does he say today to people who worked under him, the clients and volunteers?</p></speech>

The suggestions being made by members around here in respect of achieving some redress in that regard should be pursued.  I would like them to accept my bona fides in that I was not aware of the level of payments being approved for Mr. Kiely.  I was aware only of the &euro;200,000 and the kicking in of the pension in November 2016.  I was not aware until this morning of this letter-----</p></speech>

I am finding it really difficult.  I am finding it really difficult for reasons similar to those expressed by Deputy McDonald because Mr. Conlan is not an amateur.  His CV, which he referenced in his opening statement, shows he was the chief executive officer of the Mater, a director of finance in the Mater and on a board for eight years.  This is not a residents' association, with all due respect to residents' associations.  Mr. Conlan was an accomplished public servant, yet he knew nothing.</p></speech>

The main purpose of that responsibility was to be a custodian and guardian of the Mater hospital&rsquo;s interests and the CRC&rsquo;s to do with its pensions.  As a result of that, given that I was a director of 12 other companies and had a huge portfolio in the Mater hospital with not only running the place, but building the new extension, the CRC board was one on which I could be more passive than active.  My attendance rate was testament to that.  Its meetings were at 5 p.m. on a Monday afternoon which were extremely difficult for me to attend because operationally, in an acute general hospital, it is the busiest time of the week.</p></speech>

Was everyone just sitting there like nodding dogs or were there people living up to their responsibilities as directors?</p><p>  This has been so absurd today that there have been moments that are comical.  However, this is very serious as Mr. Conlan knows.  These services are vital.  The reason the HSE is putting in so much effort to salvage this is because these vital services, provided by front-line staff, are excellent.  Did the directors let the organisation down by not challenging, not taking their role seriously and just nodding along?</p></speech>

We had this misleading or inaccurate statement provided by Mr. Kiely at the end of his testimony to this committee.  We had Mr. Conlan&rsquo;s successor at the Mater who provided clarity on it.  It transpired the board of the CRC, as well as the auditors, signed off on financial statements which included the inaccurate statement on the Mater and its pension fund relationship with the CRC.  Mr. Conlan has told the committee, and it is true, he was on the CRC board as chief executive officer of the Mater to look after its interests.  Did he not spot this at any stage?</p></speech>

In all of my eight years as a member of the board, coinciding with my eight years as chief executive officer of the Mater hospital, I did my level best to spread myself as much as I could to attend board meetings and to play the role I was supposed to play.  I was not privy to Mr. Kiely&rsquo;s pension settlement.  That is the truth.  I was not part and parcel of the remuneration committee that negotiated this.

It was a letter from the then chairman, Mr. Ham Goulding, to Ms Laverne McGuinness, national director of the HSE, stating: &quot;In accordance with the terms of our Memorandum and Articles of Association we are commencing a recruitment programme to find his replacement.&quot;  This refers to the CEO.  It goes on to state:<blockquote><br />We have signed a contract with Amrop Strategis to handle the recruitment on our behalf and they have started the Executive Search process which will be carried out by reference to their contacts and database and by newspaper advertisement.  We would like to have the new executive in place by the end of June[.]</blockquote>The next thing we heard about it in the HSE was when the appointment was then made by way of an internal competition.  So, with reference to Deputy Deasy's second question, what we are now saying is what our internal administrator stated in a letter to the committee:<blockquote>At this stage it is necessary for the CRC to satisfy itself that the payments made/benefits conferred are reasonable and proper (in the context of its memorandum of association) and that any amounts paid were correctly calculated and authorised.<br />In the event of there being a loss to the CRC (or the Friends and Supporters of the CRC), steps to make good that loss [and deal with other consequential issues] will require to be taken.</blockquote></p></speech>

Quite clearly, we already heard at a previous hearing that the then CEO was part of a private pension scheme whose terms and conditions he would benefit from.  I also think it is hugely erroneous for the CRC to make reference to a package which was available in 2010 in the HSE when in fact Mr. Kiely chose to retire in June 2013 when no such package was available.  To use that as a basis for calculating or as a methodology to award benefits-----</p></speech>

When people discovered they were going to be scrutinised by the HSE in regard to their salaries, they resigned.  However, the deal they constructed around the resignation was incredible.  I think they deceived people within the organisation with regard to how they accounted for it.  I think the board members were aware of that.  Certainly, some of them had to be aware of it.  We are going from the attitude that mistakes were made and pay policy was breached to full knowledge of things that should not have happened.  The scale of sanction with regard to how things were accounted for is something I have to question.  I think it is very serious.  It is not just a case of "maybe we paid him too much".  If I was a member of the friends and supporters association I would have serious questions about the now resigned board members of the CRC.  I do not know what steps they might take after this.</p><p>  When Mr. Conlan resigned from the Mater hospital, what kind of retirement package did he receive?</p></speech>

We are just clipping the tip of this iceberg.  I have been introduced to much of this only today.  Things have been constructed by members of the board.  I will use my words carefully.  It seems to me that what was constructed was disingenuous at the very least.  I go so far as to say that the details and reasons given for this were completely false in some cases and there is an element of deception here.  The donation and how it was regarded within the accounts is a serious matter.  I am unsure how we should proceed.  Do we bring in members of the board again and ask them what they knew and did not know?  My guess is that people will deny they knew anything.  There must be some accountability here.  I have asked the HSE how it intends to proceed.  If Mr. O'Brien accepts what I am saying, and he seems to, the HSE administers and polices this area.  I ask again, what does he propose to do regarding this entire situation?</p></speech>

Perhaps there is a case that can be made for having a special inspector.  The HSE's person there at present could be termed as such.  It is clear that a huge number of unanswered questions remain.  This morning's session has simply added confusion to the whole saga.  I agree with Deputy Dowds and others about protecting the front-line services and restoring some sort of confidence in the charity sector.  I agree that all that work is very important.  However, the CRC and others seem to have done a huge disservice to that entire sector.  What we have heard this morning is shocking and shameful.  As Deputy Deasy has said, it cannot be let go.  We have to get to the end of this.  This has now opened a series of other questions.</p><p> I believe we will need to have a further session with all of those people we mentioned earlier.  Mr. Conlan's presence there would help.  Without putting too much pressure on the HSE and the interim administrator, I hope they will give us as much of the information and paperwork as possible so that we can piece this together.</p><p> I thank Mr. O'Brien and his colleagues in the HSE for getting the information so quickly for this morning's hearing.  We have another hearing with representatives of St. Vincent's University Hospital.</p><p> Deputies &Aacute;ine Collins and Ross wish to ask some questions.</p></speech>

In 2006, Mr. Simon Hall, who was mentioned earlier, travelled to Nashville to a conference and to Texas with somebody else from CRC.  In 2007, he went to Orlando, which is where the F&Aacute;S guys went.  In 2009, he was in Orlando again for CRC with five staff members for several days.  I am sure there were conferences.  In that case, four of the staff gave a ten minute lecture between them so that probably justified their trip.  In 2010, he was in Vancouver with Mr. Tom Kehoe, whom Mr. Conlan knows.  In 2011, he was in Buenos Aires.  I do not know whether he was with anybody.  In 2012, he was in Vancouver and New Delhi.  Presumably all of these trips involved conferences.  In 2013, he was back in Nashville and he is due to be in Vancouver again in March this year.  Is this justifiable expenditure?</p></speech>

Before beginning I again remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery to please turn off their mobile phones or keep them away from microphones as they interfere with the sound quality of the transmission of the meeting.  I advise witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the provisions within Standing Order 163 that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.</p><p>  I welcome Professor Noel Whelan and ask him to introduce his officials.</p></speech>

Mr. Cregan, who is the HSE-appointed interim administrator at the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, should be invited before the committee.  He is the person on point and central to the inquiry into the accounts of the CRC.  If we are to ask board members to appear before this committee, he should be included, as the work he has done over the past few weeks will be invaluable.  This has taken on a completely new significance, considering what we have learned today, and he is probably integral to examination of the information given to the committee today.</p></speech>

There is a two-page letter from this man which has some pretty amazing allegations.  They need to be teased out.  We also need to ask him about other documentation.  It is fair to say the justification for Mr. Kiely's extraordinary lump sum was based on a false premise and the accounts were not recorded honestly.  I am not surprised people would not admit that they were aware of certain facts, considering what Mr. O'Brien stated at the end of the last session, which is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may be contacted with regard to potential criminal prosecutions in this case.  It is absolutely critical that the interim administrator be asked to come before the committee if he is the person central to the examination of these matters.</p></speech>

Perhaps we could have a separate sitting to discuss directly with Mr. Cregan the various papers prior to a meeting with the board, and perhaps he would attend that meeting as well.  It could be on the same day.  We will see what is the proper thing to do and ask the clerk to the committee to make the appropriate arrangement in consultation with Mr. O'Brien and the HSE.</p><p>  Professor Whelan can now introduce his team.</p></speech>

I am joined by fellow board members and non-executive directors.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1085" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Noel Whelan" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014011600026#CC01700"><p>It is short as I know the committee has a busy day.  We are here today because although the group believes it is compliant with public sector pay policy for the health sector, the HSE regards the group as being non-compliant.  As a national and international organisation and service, we need to come before the committee and explain the matter so that eventually - I hope very quickly - the group will be accepted by the HSE as being compliant with public sector pay policy.  I will address that soon.</p><p>  To help the committee understand the group, I will outline some brief details.  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group Limited is a not-for-profit organisation.  It is a private company limited by shares; it is owned by shareholders, the Religious Sisters of Charity, and it has charitable status.  It comprises three operating divisions, which are St. Vincent's University Hospital, St. Michael's Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and St. Vincent's Private Hospital.  Of these, the two hospitals in Elm Park are on private land owned by the shareholders of the group.  Separate trading names were registered for each division within the company, and St. Vincent's Private Hospital was established in 1974 with the primary purpose of providing additional capacity for public patients by providing a private hospital for insured patients or those who could afford to pay.  This also allows the hospital to attract consultants of the highest calibre, ensuring the best service for all our patients.  Any surplus generated by the private hospital is reinvested in the group and no dividends, fees or remuneration for being a director or bonus payments are paid to the company's directors.  We contribute thus in a voluntary capacity.</p><p>  The integration of the three then separate hospitals into a single group was completed by decision of the shareholders in 2003.  It was considered that this provides the best model of care for patients and ensured that we could move insured patients from the public hospital to the private hospital, thereby freeing additional capacity in the public hospital and maximising patient choice.  This unique model has worked extremely effectively for patients over the past decade.  It has increased capacity, improved access and provided high-quality and safe health care.  As the group is at the core of today's committee meeting, I dearly wish to tell about its expansion, its many accomplishments and developments, etc., all of which are of specific benefit to Ireland's health sector, but I would go over my speaking time in doing so.  I will put the information in an appendix which I hope will see the light in due course.</p><p>  I will come to the core issues I presume are before the committee today.  The first is public pay policy.  We are before the committee today because of public pay policy as it relates to the health sector.  A significant focus remains on remuneration arrangements for three staff in St. Vincent's Healthcare Group Limited.  We believe the group is in compliance with public pay policy in the health sector; this belief is based on legal advice, and we can expand on that if required during questioning.</p> <p>We had not divulged any information in relation to the salaries of the small group of executives involved as there were issues involved, including contract law, individual contract rights and data protection, and they had to be considered.  Critically, also, there were no public or charity funds involved.  Let me stress that so there is no ambiguity about it.  No funding was used from charitable donations.  The group's charity fundraising body is St. Vincent's Foundation.  It is run entirely on a voluntary basis.  The funds raised philanthropically go towards the aims and objectives of St. Vincent&rsquo;s Foundation.  So there is no charity money involved.</p><p> As members of the committee may be aware, I, as chairman, and my colleague the vice chairman met the director general of the HSE and his colleagues on Thursday last, 9 January, to discuss the pay policy issue.  This was the week suggested by the HSE for the meeting.  We again met the director general and his colleagues on Tuesday, 14 January 2014.</p><p> We are in current discussions with the HSE which we hope will lead to an agreed process that will result in there being no issues with the HSE regarding pay compliance.  As members can appreciate, there are complex issues to be worked out and we must, of course, ensure that the law is upheld in the process.  The HSE&rsquo;s own circular has asked agencies not to break the law as situations are dealt with.  In a letter of 5 November that was also emphasised to us by the HSE.</p><p> To be specific here, while the current group model has worked excellently for our patients - and we believe fervently it has - the group board is, in the public interest, willing to adapt it.  Subject to the early successful outcome of the process I have just referred to, the net result should be, and I hope it will be, as follows: there will be no pay compliance issues with the HSE; the salary of the group CEO will be paid entirely from funds generated by the private hospital and thus outside the purview of public sector finances as such; and the roles of group CEO and CEO of St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital will not be occupied by the same manager.  There has been, as members know, sound logic for the incorporation of the two roles in one person.  We can expand on that later if members wish.  That is our position in net form regarding public service pay.</p><p> I turn to corporate governance, which is kind of related to pay as well.  There has been a lot of discussion about the integration between the public and private hospitals of the group and whether there is the appropriate level of corporate governance in place to ensure that public investment in health within the group is appropriately safeguarded.  My colleagues and I will be very glad to expand on this if required during question time, but let me first mention a few points relating to governance here.</p><p> First, two hospitals of the group, St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital and St. Vincent&rsquo;s Private Hospital, have been accredited by the Joint Commission International, JCI.  This is a prestigious, internationally recognised independent organisation for accrediting health-care organisations worldwide.  St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital is the only academic teaching hospital in Ireland to be accredited.  First we were accredited in 2010 and then we were re-accredited in 2013.  One of the key international benchmarking standards - which is why I raised this in the governance context - of JCI is &ldquo;Governance, Leadership and Direction,&rdquo; and we have consistently met this high standard.  This is on the basis that the group board and St. Vincent&rsquo;s hospitals have clear responsibilities, accountabilities and authorities defined at each level in the organisation.</p><p> I come to my second point about governance.  Financial clarity exists between the three hospitals in the group.  The financial accounts and the bank accounts for the three hospitals are separate.  Money provided by the HSE for the treatment of patients under the service level agreements with St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital and St. Michael&rsquo;s Hospital is, of course, extremely closely monitored on an ongoing basis by the HSE.</p><p> Of prime concern to us is upholding the public interest in our corporate governance arrangements.  We want to do that.  We have noted the fair comment from, among others, members of this committee and we accept that it is not just about protecting the public interest but being seen to do so as well.  Consequently, the board of St. Vincent's hospital group is willing to add immediately to our existing board committees a public interest committee of the board.  Nobody is forcing us to do this, but we would wish to do it to put a clear focus on this.  This committee will monitor, on an ongoing basis, issues arising from the public interest which may be of relevance to the group.  This committee will be an addition to our existing committees - audit, remuneration, nominations, risk advisory, clinical governance, and mission effectiveness.  Each of these committees and the board itself would like to think we keep the public interest in mind at all stages, but we are going to add this committee to give a clear, acute, laser-like focus to public interest as we go forwards.</p><p> The points I mention are but a few points from a very broad canvas relating to governance, which I know some members of the committee have raised legitimately in public.  I hope we can respond further to the governance issue as well as the public pay issue if members wish.</p><p> The last point I want to stress in my statement is the release of information on remuneration.  We know there has been disquiet on the part of the Committee of Public Accounts about the release of the information on remuneration levels on 23 December, just before Christmas.  While we will go into it in questions if members want to, there was an explicable reason for this and I hope we can address it during question time.</p><p> My colleagues and I will endeavour honestly to answer as fully as possible any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I also thank the HSE representatives for remaining with us.  At the outset I want to make three points that predicate my remarks.  None of this exchange today and none of the work of the Committee of Public Accounts - I think I can speak collectively on that - in any way seeks to undermine or devalue the excellent service being provided to many patients in all the hospitals under the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group and the excellent work being done by their front-line staff.  The witnesses have given us an extensive list of health advances; let us take that as read.</p><p>  To the best of my knowledge, at no stage has anybody suggested that any charitable funds have been used for pay or pensions.  I am very happy to put it on the record that I do not suspect that or in any way allege it.</p><p>  I welcome that the witnesses have come here with proposals and ideas.  We will see how we get on with the proposals and ideas in terms of the questioning and the view of the HSE.  However, I acknowledge that the witnesses have not come empty-handed.</p><p>  I need to start at the beginning.  The witnesses will have heard comments from members of this committee and others about the extreme disquiet we had about the refusal of the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group to reveal the level of what has now become known as top-ups being paid to some of its management.  I believe there are 34 section 38 organisations.  When we met here in December, St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group was the only such organisation that had refused to reveal those payments.  As Professor Whelan correctly said, we were rather cynical about the timing of the release of the information just before Christmas Eve.  Why did the group refuse on the day we met in December to provide that information to us or the HSE?  What was the reasoning behind the timing of the release and the group's change of mind on the issue?</p></speech>

I will respond very briefly to say we will cover those two things.  On the first question, about the alleged refusal to disclose the information, I will ask Mr. Jermyn to cover that.  I will come back to the board's issue of releasing the information and so on.  Maybe Mr. Jermyn could come in on the first and then I will come in on the second question, with the Deputy's permission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1090" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nicholas Jermyn" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014011600027#DD00500"><p>As the chairman said in his opening remarks, we have always believed we were in compliance with the Government pay policy.  The remuneration paid to the three senior executives relates to work they undertook in the private sector.  In this regard we have always believed that we were compliant.  We had to seek legal advice; we did seek legal advice and then in the public interest we realised we needed to ensure that we co-operated.  The Deputy has referred to that.  We have said that the HSE requested that the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group supply this information to the committee.  As I said, we had to check and we decided that we would forego the legal advice in the interests of the public.  Because we were compliant, we thought we were compliant and we wanted to work with everybody, we decided to disclose the information.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1091" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Noel Whelan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014011600027#DD00600"><p>I might come back in.  As Mr. Jermyn has said, the legal situation that faced us, as we were told, was that we were completely and utterly compliant with the section 38 legislative requirements.</p> <p>We can cover that in the questions if members wish.</p><p> Moving onto the late disclosure of information, people were looking for the information coming up to about 20 December.  At that stage the board was in perpetual session.  We decided it was a major public interest issue and that we needed to review the public interest requirements.  Nobody forced us and we unilaterally put aside the legal advice and said that we would release the information.  Then, we called a board meeting on 22 December.  We are a voluntary board and people have other things to do.  People receive no pay so we cannot press a magic button and get a special board meeting.  We called a special meeting and we said we would release the information.  The board agreed and that brought us up to the Friday before Christmas.  Then we released the information and it hit the public on 23 December.  I admit it was near Christmas but we could have held off until the new year when it would come out in the fullness of time.  We rushed to get it out and I know it irritated people.</p></speech>

Does Professor Whelan acknowledge that it was regrettable he did not provide the information sooner?</p></speech>

We have read the correspondence from our meeting on 20 December from Professor Whelan, Mr. Jermyn and the director of finance to the HSE and this committee on the view that the hospital group was compliant with public sector pay policy.  Mr. Jermyn's letter to the committee quoted the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform suggesting it only referred to public sector pay.  Ms Oonagh Buckley and Mr. Brazel from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform were present on the day and Mr. O'Brien and Ms Lawler attended from the HSE.  Everyone was <i>ad idem</i>that the hospital was not in compliance.  Do the witnesses now accept that they were not in compliance?  I have read the language in the opening statements and I have heard Professor Whelan's comments that he believes the group was in compliance but the HSE does not think so.  Does Professor Whelan accept that, under the service level agreement and in the view of the HSE, the Department and the Government, the hospital group was not in compliance with public sector pay policy?</p></speech>

In this regard, we have always believed it is similar to any other public servant who has additional employment in the private sector, whether lecturing, self-employment or any other employment.  The remuneration to these individuals was private and not a matter for public disclosure.  That was the view we took.  We had legal opinion from senior counsel and, in the case of four of the seven additional staff, they were being dealt with under the process entered into with the HSE when the topic arose.  We firmly believed we could deal with them.  With regard to the three executives referred to in the media, we felt it was compliant but we recognise the difference.  We must work through this, as referred to in the chairman's address.</p></speech>

However, the negotiations were not completed when we made the disclosure so we informed the HSE that there were seven, including the person on secondment.  In respect of the three individuals referred to - myself, the company secretary, Mr. Maloney, and the director of nursing - we accepted the need to address the situation and we started looking at it in October.  We were engaged in a process, as the circular from the HSE suggested, with the four people to get them dealt with.  The three people we are talking about had additional roles we needed to look at.  The group roles we played were needed and we had to decide what to do.  The chairman has outlined in his opening remarks that we are now engaged in a process with the HSE and we should bring ourselves into compliance with the circulars in respect of the three people.  The model we have been working through has worked for our patients and we must now examine the model of having three people in a role in two ways.  This applies particularly to myself.  We are in a process and we have recognised that we must address this.  The chairman has indicated the board will examine it.</p></speech>

We are very unique in the context of the way we deliver care between the private and public hospitals and St. Michael's Hospital.

That is my problem in a nutshell, namely, that an element of his job is now running a public hospital, or the public element of the hospital.  I do not wish to put words in Mr. O'Brien's mouth but when I had an exchange with him on 20 December, his view was that Mr. Jermyn was paid to be the full-time chief executive of the university hospital.

The attachment or appendices give a list of services and work that I carry out.  As the Deputy will know, I am working for the university hospital as well as for the group.  It is all one entity.  The key here is that the university hospital is linked to many other hospitals in the region, as the Deputy will know.  I am involved in St. Columcille's Hospital and Holles Street hospital in that role.  With that role and the new integration and reorganisation, a large part of what I do is that integrational link.  It is about the delivery of the quality of care.  As the Deputy said, the care delivered by people in St. Vincent's University Hospital and by the associated hospitals is second to none.</p></speech>

The Minister for Health said at a committee today, in regard to Mr. Jermyn's situation, that there is only one hospital in the country where the CEO is both the CEO of a public and a private hospital.

The key initial task was to consolidate that group.  Our shareholders wanted us to do that.  They wanted us to ensure the private hospital emerging and the public hospitals were unified interactively so that the public hospitals could benefit from the private hospital to share beds more for the public sector.  The key task was to consolidate the group.  We immediately asked how would we do this.  We could have recruited another person separately but we said let the one individual do the two jobs fully and actively because they are intertwined.  Then the new hospital came on stream.  We had to have that designed, built and developed and had to get it up and trading and so on.</p></speech>

However, the board has agreed - the chairman indicated this - that there is a need to look at the situation but I want to stress that at no time did anybody think that the model we had was not working.  It still works.  However, the key here is to recognise that there is a need to look at it now, having regard to the changing circumstances, etc.  This is a governance issue as well, so I suppose it may not be fully right that I should be answering that question.</p></speech>

It is quite clear there is a difference of opinion between the board and the HSE in terms of compliance or otherwise.  In good faith, our view as a board, supported by legal opinion, was that we were compliant.  The HSE and others have a different viewpoint.  In order to move forward, we need to resolve that difference, where we have a joint agreement as to what is compliant or not compliant - legal or other issues aside.  To reiterate the point made in the opening statement, our way forward, in negotiation with the HSE, is to agree a proposal, a process, which will, ultimately, lead to a successful outcome and a mutually acceptable proposal around three modalities.</p><p>  In terms of the compensation of Mr. Jermyn from the point of view of section 38, we would absorb that salary cost which is where we would like to get to and also the separation of roles.  Our objective is clear, namely, we want to arrive at a mutually defined position where we are compliant.  We want to move on with the continuation of serving our patients and doing our business which is the provision of top class health care to people in this country.  That is our main objective.</p></speech>

These are not personal remarks but are about the structures which have been put in place.  I want to give two examples.  The first is the situation pertaining to consultants and the second is that pertaining to the mortgaging of facilities which were constructed with State assistance.  I will start with the latter one.  Chapter 46.3 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report in 2011, with which the witnesses will be familiar, states:<blockquote><br />In November 2010, SVHG opened a new private hospital on the Elm Park campus.  Responding to my enquiries in relation to that matter, the HSE reported that, over a number of years, publicly-funded assets had been used as security by SVHG in return for facilities from commercial banks.  The Accounting Officer stated that those arrangements included<br />- security granted in favour of Ulster Bank in 2002 by a subsidiary company of SVHG over a car park on the public campus, with a floating charge on the subsidiary company&rsquo;s assets<br />- a mortgage debenture granted over certain property at the Elm Park site to Bank of Ireland in respect of the new private hospital<br />- a mortgage of certain property at the Elm Park site, granted by SVHG in favour of Bank of Ireland in 2009<br />- a mortgage debenture in favour of Bank of Ireland in October 2010 including<br />- a fixed charge over the entire St Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital site<br />- a floating charge over all of the undertaking, property and assets of SVHG both present and future.</blockquote></p> <p> We know that once it was established, the HSE tried its best, in the interests of the taxpayer, to get some sort of hold or lien for the taxpayer.  The Accounting Officer told the Comptroller and Auditor General that the deed of covenant that they managed to put in place was, in effect, the least worst option.  Cathal Magee, the former head of the HSE, told this committee on 26 January that it emerged that a &euro;200 million grant for a clinic and science building had been made to the health care group in 2004 without the funded assets being secured in favour of the State through a legal security instrument.  He then said that the creation of this security made it impossible for the HSE to secure first ranking for the State over the entire public hospital.  It was at that point that he referred to it being the least satisfactory option.  The Department of Health and the HSE told the then Comptroller and Auditor General that the HSE could find no other example of the mortgaging of such a publicly funded facility at a voluntary hospital.  In reply to my parliamentary question on the issue last night, the Minister for Health confirmed that there was no departmental or ministerial consent given to any of this.  I ask the witnesses to respond.</p></speech>

We have private assets that we own.  However, there was investment in St. Vincent's University Hospital and we opened a new clinical services building in 2009, the building of which began in 2000.  Prior to that, there was no instrument to allow us to secure the State's interests.  In 2009 or 2010, the HSE introduced an instrument that allowed us to protect the State's interest.  We had entered into those agreements prior to that date.  I remind Deputy Harris that the grant for the new 100 bed ward block was enacted and then we retrospectively sat down with the HSE and signed a grant agreement.  It was stated last November, regarding that grant agreement, that "the HSE has advised that the State's interest in St. Vincent's Hospital is secure and that the State does not have a financial interest or exposure-----</p></speech>

I am trying to explain that we signed a State interest agreement in 2010 or 2011.  It was signed up with legal agreement with the HSE so the State's interests are protected and statements have been issued confirming that.  On 19 November the Department of Health, as I understand it, issued a statement in which it confirmed that the State's interest was protected.</p></speech>

The conclusion of the report from the Comptroller and Auditor General is that St. Vincent's Healthcare Group pledged publicly funded assets in return for bank finance for the development of its private hospital.  It is perfectly legitimate for Mr. Jermyn to talk about the new structures that were put in place and it can certainly be said that the HSE ran around retrospectively trying to claw back the situation.  However, it is very clear, in black and white in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and from Mr. Magee's comments, that the structure put in place is the least worst option in terms of the interests of the taxpayer.  It is not as good as the State would have wished.</p></speech>

The board went through all of what the Deputy has raised.  The board was under the leadership of Mr. Stewart Harrington, who was the deputy chairman at the time, so perhaps Mr. Harrington would like to comment on the Deputy's very valid questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1154" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stewart Harrington" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014011600030#GG00700"><p>I will start by saying that we are fully aware of this.  It might be useful if I give a little bit of context to this and fill in the background.  If we go back to the original development of the hospital in 1972, an agreement was put in place with the Department of Health at that point in time whereby it gave a grant for the construction of the hospital and that grant was repaid over 30 years.  In point of fact, therefore, the grant was paid off in 2001 or early 2002.  That was the situation.  When we received notification from the Eastern Health Board, as it was at the time, that we were going ahead with the new clinical services building, I expected that they would come up with some sort of mechanism to protect the State's interest.  Normally, this should take place.  I come from a construction and surveying background so I understand the process.  I informed the board regularly that I could not understand why such an agreement had not been brought up.  Construction started and took a number of years.  I am sure board members will confirm that I used to report on how the construction programme was going, whether we were on budget, on target and so forth and I used to say that we could expect some form of a grant agreement from the Eastern Health Board at some stage and subsequently, by the way, when the HSE took over, but nothing ever happened.</p></speech>

We have a list of the investments made by the taxpayer between 2000 and 2004 on developments at St. Vincent's University Hospital totalling &euro;130 million.  Did Mr. Harrington not think someone on the board should have asked about the public interest?</p></speech>

We then came to the next development, which was the construction of the new ward block, now known as the Nutley Wing.  The HSE was in charge at this stage and when it granted approval, it sought to put a grant agreement in place.  It was only then that the HSE discovered that an agreement had not been put in place in respect of the clinical services building.  The HSE contacted us immediately, we sat down with them and worked out an agreement which fully protects the State's interest.</p></speech>

At the board meetings where the public hospital was represented by virtue of the presence of the public hospital CEO, for whom the State is paying, nobody was asking about the public hospital and what would happen if something was to go wrong.  Some of these developments were commercial ventures.  That is what I am asking about - corporate governance.</p></speech>

The hospital campus is one and there is an integrated model of one legal entity.  We never said we were not going to sign any grant agreement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report, if I recollect correctly, refers to a lot of facilities for which grant agreements were being made.  There was no vehicle at the time.  In 2009, as the Deputy may recall, the Mater Hospital was the first of the big acute hospitals to sign one of these agreements.  We sat down with the HSE.  It is important to emphasise, despite what the Deputy has quoted, that we signed an agreement.  We are a charitable organisation, a public not-for-profit institution.  We are there to serve the public.  The assets are now protected for the State in perpetuity.  The Deputy is correct that loans were taken out prior to 2009 but since then we have put an agreement in place.  The board decided to put it in place and did not shirk its responsibility.  We agree that we must protect the State's interests.  We are providing public services.  We have a private hospital on campus but one board runs the entire institution for a very good reason.  There are huge benefits in terms of patient care to be able to provide services with one identity.</p></speech>

With the indulgence of the committee, I wish to refer quickly to the issue of consultants and their contracts, which is another example of the perceived conflict of interest.  This goes back as far as 2011 when, according to an article by Susan Mitchell, the HSE at that time raised concerns about a possible mass breach of the consultant contract at St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin.  St. Vincent's confirmed that 220 patients were treated by public hospital consultants in St. Vincent's Private Hospital, a move that was likely to raise questions from stand-alone private hospitals.  I have also had correspondence from consultants on this issue who are very concerned about it.</p> <p>Basically, they are saying that as both hospitals - the public and private hospitals - are under the same governance, it is leading to an obvious conflict of interest.  They are suggesting that type B contract holders, who are entitled to work in the public hospital to which they have been appointed only, and who should be generating income for the public hospital by treating their private patients in the public hospital, are treating their private patients in the private hospital and depriving the public hospital of the income.  Can Mr. Jermyn respond to that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1167" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nicholas Jermyn" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014011600031#HH00200"><p>I must stress that we are a single legal entity.  We have a private hospital and a public hospital on our campus.  The governance structure of the board allows me to control and manage that.  I emphasise that when St. Vincent's University Hospital opened in 1972, it had no private beds.  That was the model.  The private hospital opened in 1974.  As a result of what happened in later years, we now have between 45 and 55 private beds in the public hospital.  Since 1974, we have operated a model whereby private patients are treated when clinically appropriate in the private hospital.  We actually max out.  We do very well with private income in the public hospital.  The difficulty is that we always used a model whereby private patients who could afford it were put into the private hospital, thereby leaving the public beds available for public patients.  Our model has been operating since 1974.  It might be affected in the event of the development of a system of universal health insurance.  I know people will say there is a conflict, but I can say quite confidently that I see no conflict.  There is a compliance issue for us under the consultants' common contract - we have to ensure consultants practice at a certain level across the private and public systems.  I have full sight of what is going on in the private and public hospitals.</p></speech>

Has the board considered that in this day and age, it would be appropriate to have a board that is elected by all the different interests in the hospital?  I would like to recognise at this point, as Deputy Harris did at the beginning, the extremely important and valuable work that is done by Professor Whelan and his staff.  It is very important for that to be acknowledged in these circumstances.</p></speech>

That is absolutely understood and respected.  One of the suggestions made by my colleague in his opening statement related to a public interest committee.  I think that is a vehicle for addressing some of the observations that have been made by the Deputy with regard to broader representation of interest groups.  At the end of the day, we are involved in the provision of health care services.  We have a very complex and constructive conversation and contract with the HSE.  In return for the grant moneys we receive from the taxpayer, we provide substantial health care services to citizens.</p></speech>

Can he comment on what it does and how it relates to St. Vincent's Hospital?</p></speech>

Pianora is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the group.  It was established - before my appointment, but that is neither here nor there - as a special purpose vehicle to construct the car park on the site of the public hospital.  I gather that the car park was constructed in 2001 in accordance with the Department of Health's policy guidelines, or policy generally.  It wanted to ring-fence the construction of car parks from the development of other medical facilities.  The car park was financed by a term loan of over &euro;20 million from Ulster Bank and by grant aid of approximately &euro;4 million from the Department of Health.  It is under the management and control of the unified board.  Obviously, it pays its expenses from the receipts that come from people using the car park, which is managed on an outsourced basis by a firm called Q-Park.  The receipts that come to us are used to discharge the operating expenses, the interest on the loan and the repayment of the principal.</p></speech>

As my colleague has said, the Pianora company was set up to build the car park in the university hospital.  There is a separate car park in the private hospital.</p> <p>We borrowed money when we built the private hospital.  Income from the car park is used in the private hospital.  They are separate.  Deputies may not be aware of the campus.  It is very much separated, as are the accounts in banks.  The physical building of the private hospital and its private car park are separated.  On the public campus element, we have car parks directly used for public patients and visitors.  </p></speech>

Not to be difficult but under the old consultant contract one had category I and category II.  Category II is still around, as are some category I contracts.  A new consultant contract was brought in, with category A, category B and category B* types.  What I can say is I think category A is a fully public consultant who does not engage in private practice and practises in a public hospital.  Category B consultants practise in a public hospital or where there is a private hospital on the campus or a co-located hospital or where the employer is the same, a category B consultant practises and is allowed to do private practice on the campus, in the private beds in the public hospital.  In our case, category B consultants also practise in the private hospital, which is on our campus and they are under our employment.</p></speech>

Category B is for consultants in that category who can have private practice in a public hospital only.  An existing category B consultant on transfer to the new contract had a maximum of 70% public practice and 30% private practice.  For a category B consultant who has been appointed since 2008, when the contract came in, the ratio was 80:20.  That is my understanding of the consultant contract.</p></speech>

That was an aspiration of the previous Government but nothing was agreed.  Mr. Jermyn stated that the hospital is not co-located.  Quite clearly, therefore, a B* contract refers to a consultant who has rights to practise both in the public hospital and privately off site.  There are very clearly defined definitions of what limits apply to private practice.  That is how it should operate, without exception, right across the public health system.</p></speech>

As Mr. O'Brien said, we are responsible for monitoring category B consultants.  The advantage I wanted to stress is that in our private hospital we are not there to make profits and pay out dividends.  We are a charitable organisation under the umbrella of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group Limited.  I am in a position to monitor those consultants and their level of private practice on our campus.  We have had this model working on our campus since 1974.  As I said, the definition of a category A consultant is that they can only do public practice and have no private patients whatsoever.</p></speech>

As I said, Mr. Redmond retired from the private hospital, which is a privately-owned part of the hospital.  He was paid purely with private income from the hospital.  He has retired and, as I said, he has not worked with us.  He has had a break in employment and is, I believe, looking for work and on the market to look for work at this point in time.  There may be a situation whereby we might use some of his skills but he is no longer CEO of the private hospital.  We are restructuring the organisation.  In fairness, I should stress that we have a group chief executive and, in light of discussions the board is having with the HSE, we have replaced Mr. Redmond with a chief operating officer in the private hospital who reports directly to me, as Mr. Redmond reported directly to me at the time.  It would not be fair for me to comment on his personal arrangements.  I do not know them all.  As I said, the Deputy is obviously very well informed.  I am not too sure what he is doing.</p></speech>

Many people listening in will pause for reflection when they hear that ten of the hospital's complement of 200 consultants are solely dedicated to public medicine.  I am setting the scene for my questioning.  In applauding and acknowledging the work done by the medics and medical staff of the hospital, this is no way to organise our health services.</p><p>  I ask Mr. O'Brien to remind the committee for how long he sought from the gentlemen before us information in respect of top-up payments.</p></speech>

On the first occasion the question was to ask if they were in compliance with remuneration and if remuneration greater than the approved level was being paid.  St. Vincent's confirmed that it complied with the salary scales approved by the Department of Health and the Minister for Health.  Fast forwarding up to the audit, when I wrote to St. Vincent's, among others, on 3 July 2012, it confirmed the information it had provided to HR.  It stated that there were three managers who were paid by the company for work carried out over and above their public service contract which was funded from private company resources, not from HSE or foundation income.  It stated that "as public funds are not involved it is not appropriate to give further details of payments made."  I wrote again in December 2012 and again in January 2013 it confirmed the same thing, stating that as these three individuals are paid for work over and above their public service contract, it was not appropriate to disclose that information. </p></speech>

Can I put to him that in real terms his hand was forced, that he resisted, and that was evident even from correspondence from his colleague, Mr. Nicky Jermyn.  We saw dispatches from him at one of our last committee meetings before Christmas and that he was unwilling and, dare I say, very unhelpful and, in fact, almost dismissive of the HSE as it went about its work in establishing legitimately whether his organisation was fully respecting and compliant with public policy and, if not, the extent of that lack of compliance.</p><p>  May I put it to him, as a group of reasonable people who run a very fine organisation, though bizarrely structured - which is not his fault but rather Government policy in the health service - that was an unacceptable approach for him to take with the public authorities and the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I do not think it was unacceptable and I will give the context for it.  We had legal opinion many years ago to suggest that nothing untoward was taking place.  That was before the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest legislation.  We then got further legal opinion as to whether in the next context we were legal in every respect.  Our legal opinion said we had nothing to answer for because what was happening was that public moneys were not being used in any respect.  Moneys from the private source are being used for private purposes.  We had this legal advice and the controversy-----</p></speech>

After that advice stated we had nothing to answer for in the context of the public controversy which was taking place with the moneys, we decided to get senior counsel advice just to be sure.  On foot of all that advice, as the controversy developed, we said we would put the legal advice aside.  We were not forced into anything only we were slow to respond.  We had the legal advice and we said honestly and openly to the HSE that we believe we are compliant because the issues involved in our side are not relevant to the circular.  Let me just say, because it is relevant to the Deputy's question, this is senior counsel opinion.</p></speech>

Second, payments made bona fides to such executives in respect of such duties and services are not in breach of the one-person-one-salary principle relating to public sector pay which principle is confined to activities within the broad public service.  Third, such payments are not unlawful top-ups and are not financed by charitable donations.  Fourth, in the operation of St. Vincent's University Hospital and St. Michael's Hospital, the board of SVHGL, that is, St. Vincent's, is fully compliant with statutory and contractual requirements relating to health care sector pay policy.  Finally, payments in respect of services and duties relating to St. Vincent's Private Hospital are not in breach of the public service one-person-one-salary principle.</p><p>  We had this type of advice.  As the controversy developed our board met in continuous sessions saying let us, in the public interest, put all this aside and unilaterally disclose the information and, at the same time, say we believe we are compliant.

I thank Mr. Menton.  That is very helpful.  I think Professor Whelan will acknowledge, not withstanding the sterling service he provides to patients, that &euro;220 million of public funding is, by any stretch, a very significant level of funding.  He will be aware also that the FEMPI legislation dates to 2008 and that there is an expectation at all times, but particularly in difficult times, that bodies and organisations in receipt of State funding respect the rules and regulations that come with that.  I am sure Professor Whelan will agree with me on that and in that spirit I find the learned advice of Mr. McDowell, senior counsel, notwithstanding.  I am really struggling to get to grips with what appears to be his position to this moment that topping up salaries was not blatantly disregarding the rules and regulations stated repeatedly by way of circular from the HSE and made explicitly clear to him, and that he still does not accept that was in breach of the rules and regulations, the basis upon which &euro;220 million of taxpayers' moneys were channelled to his hospitals.</p></speech>

Professor Whelan spoke of the public interest, but let us now consider public confidence.  It is important that somebody such as the Professor state categorically at a meeting such as this that he understands absolutely the necessity to observe Government policy in respect of public service.  He may not like it and those involved may not like it, but that is a separate issue.  They should state that they recognise this policy and fall strictly within it.</p><p>  The experience to date, and the reason they are here, is that they were not in compliance.  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group is still not fully in compliance.  Not only that; the group has been resisting giving information.  It seems to me it was forced by the public discourse into a position in which it had to come clean with the information.  The group is now here and is in discussion and dialogue.  That is excellent.

There is one very important issue that should not be lost sight of here, which is that the individual to my left is an employee of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group and he has contractual rights under his employment contract with us.  His employment contract covers his role as the group chief executive and this is a dimension which is central to the difficulty we seem to be having between us here as to what is appropriate and what is not appropriate and the issue of compliance or non-compliance.  We have not asked him to waive his natural rights, and natural justice would play a part in the board's deliberations around whether we would or-----</p></speech>

There was no wiggle room for them to get out of that.  With all due respect, some of them were earning only a fraction of what Mr. Jermyn takes home.  As an entity that is in receipt of State funding, I suggest that for future reference - if the configuration continues as it is - the group should be alert at all times when signing into contractual relationships with anybody that so long as the group is in receipt of public funds, it is absolutely obligated to comply with public pay policy.  That should be factored into the process at every stage.  It should have been front and centre whenever people were appointed.  I understand Mr. Jermyn has been employed for some time.</p><p>  I would like to move on now to one of the group's proposals.

I want to tease this out a little.

Am I correct that this CEO will be accountable to and governed by the group CEO?  Is that how this will work in terms of management?</p></speech>

How does that sit as a concept with the HSE?  Does it not continue to cause a difficulty for the following reasons?  In that scenario, the roles would be separated and this would mean the group CEO could continue on his current salary.  However, would it not also mean we would have a publicly funded entity with its top management answerable to A. N. Other structure that is privately funded, financed and salaried and that manages, albeit on the same campus, private entities?  Is there not a problem with that?  I would like the HSE's view on that, but also that of Professor Whelan.</p><p>  I understand these matters are being discussed and have not been signed off on.</p></speech>

The arrangement sets out the quantum of work and the total funding to be allocated to that body.  Clearly, that is the overarching agreement which sets out the matter.  The HSE has a direct input into that.  The HSE has a nominated person who is the overseer.  In a sense what we are saying is that we would continue to have exactly the same relationship with St. Vincent's University Hospital as we have with any other hospital in receipt of public funds.  There would be an appointed chief executive and a relationship.  I have no wish to paraphrase Professor Whelan, but I gather what he said was that to safeguard the public interest, the hospital would put in place a public interest committee as part of the board which would ensure that full recognition was given to that public interest for St. Vincent's University Hospital and the service level arrangement it is proposed to have with the HSE.</p></speech>

The real issue for us is that we have a situation whereby we are not contributing in any way with public funds to the group chief executive salary.  That is the real essence of why we are here in the first place and what is happening.  We are saying we will certainly continue to fund a hospital chief executive at the approved salary scale with all the terms and conditions.  However, the funding of the group chief executive is a matter for the St. Vincent's group.  The matter of governance and accountability for the public hospital would have to be absolutely copper-fastened in the service level agreement as well as ensuring that the public interest is fully safeguarded as part of the governance arrangement with the board.</p></speech>

We have pencilled in, hopefully, 31 March 2014 with the HSE to settle everything and to have everything clear.  I will outline the issue on the part of those of us on the St. Vincent's side of the fence.  The HSE said to us on 5 November, legitimately - we agree with it fully - that to avoid any confusion at that stage it was important that the hospital group understood that the HSE was not instructing the group to breach any individual contracts of employment.  It would be great if we could press a magic button and say that it is settled, but individuals have rights in this democratic society and we are moving towards that.  Deputy McDonald asked me for a timeline.  I dearly hope - we all hope - that we will aim for 31 March 2014.</p></speech>

It was written in the context of seeking a declaration.  What I said was that the group could tell me the information relating to what the group was paying without breaching the contractual arrangements that the group had, and I asked whether the group could please inform me of that.  There is another sentence attached to that letter which is of great significance.  It was not to say that the group may not have further decisions.  The letter said that when the group declares what it has, then, depending on that information, there may be further issues, in respect of which we will consult with the group and the Department of Health on actions that the group may have to take.  It is important to have that in context.</p></speech>

It obviously became apparent to the group that there were compliance issues and that the group was not in compliance in respect of a small number of employees.  Did you approach them, either individually or collectively, at any stage and put it to them that this was an issue or a difficulty?

We would have much preferred not to.  However, it is right to get it out in the open and deal with these issues.  It is important that we say this: we were paid for work we were asked to do, and it was benchmarked.  We recognise the difficulties now with the situation and we are going to co-operate fully with our board in the best interests.  However there are legal and complex issues relating to disentangling situations.  I say sincerely - I know I can speak for my colleagues as well - that we really want to bring this to a closure, which will allow the great organisation that is St. Vincent's Healthcare Group to continue in such a way that it can look after patients and such that people can have confidence, including committee members who represent their constituents.  I hope sincerely that we will reach agreement.  However, Deputy McDonald will understand that there are issues.</p></speech>

The interaction with Deputy McDonald is similar to the interaction with this committee prior to Christmas when Mr. Jermyn refused to come before us.  He had to be talked into coming here.  We were told that the top-up of his salary was because of extra work done.  It has now been decided to employ a chief executive officer for the public side of the hospital and that chief executive officer post will be compliant with the HSE arrangement.  I ask Mr. Jermyn to correct me if I am mistaken.  Because Mr. Jermyn is no longer working in the public end, can the committee presume that his arrangement with the board amounting to &euro;300,000 will be reduced by the amount of the top-up of &euro;136,000?</p></speech>

I am asking him to stop talking in circles.  A CEO for the public side of the hospital is being employed.  Mr. Jermyn is getting a top-up of the equivalent of his salary - &euro;136,000 - for extra work done.  It is reasonable to ask that because that work will be going elsewhere to another CEO, will this mean that the top-up will now not be given to Mr. Jermyn or is he holding to the contractual arrangements?  It is as simple as that.</p></speech>

Is there confusion in the handling of patients between the public and private hospitals?  Are patients referred to the private hospital for income?  All such questions need to be answered.</p><p>  I have received a number of letters written to me as Chairman of the committee and written on headed notepaper from St. Vincent's University Hospital.  These are unsigned letters but in my opinion they make serious charges about the hospital and the top-ups.  While they are not signed letters they are written on headed notepaper.  It is a concern that this is the case.  Two of the letters state clearly that there is no effective protection for whistleblowers and therefore the writers have not signed the letters.  They express concern about the management, the care of patients, the reduced level of staffing on wards, nurses being distressed and crying while working.  The letters refer to the closure of Loughlinstown hospital and no planning in place to prepare for a potential increase in the numbers attending the accident and emergency department.  One of the letters states that the hospital is in chaos and the drug error is at an all-time high.  </p><p>  If this is all happening on the front line, then I must ask about the money being paid to the managers of that front line.  They seem to be under pressure.  They are concerned and they are writing anonymously but using hospital headed notepaper.  I am trying to balance that with the type of management in place and the type of proposal that is envisaged for the public hospital.  I am not convinced by the presentation to the committee because Deputy McDonald in particular has had to extract the information, even down to the issue of compliance.  That is how the exchanges stand.  </p><p>  I have a question for Mr. O'Brien.  I refer to the expression used by a witness that they are in the same ball park.  Will all these issues be resolved by March as a result of everyone being in the same ball park?  Is Mr. O'Brien confident of bringing this matter to a conclusion, considering what has been said here today?  Is that an unfair question because discussions are under way?</p></speech>

So far as the HSE is concerned, the key challenge is that there is full compliance with public pay policy.  That requires St. Vincent's to make a number of key decisions and to take a number of key actions.</p> <p>Ultimately, however, what the Health Service Executive wants to see is that all public servants under its remit would be in full compliance with public pay policy.  We have set that out clearly in terms of the choices that are there.  The situation in regard to Mr. Jermyn is one challenge, but we have asked St. Vincent's to cease the additional payments immediately in respect of the other two staff members.  In regard to Mr. Jermyn, the options, as the HSE sees it, are that he reverts to being the CEO of the public hospital only or he becomes CEO of the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, thereby removing any liability from the public purse to fund such a post.  In either event, we require a decision to be implemented at the earliest possible date, in accordance with our requirements of all other section 38 agencies.  We have met on two occasions and have clearly set out our position.  We reiterated that position formally in writing yesterday, and it remains the position today.</p></speech>

Let us get down to the bread and butter.  Will Mr. O'Brien outline the sticking points in regard to St. Vincent's?  It strikes me as somewhat peculiar that Mr. Jermyn might become group CEO but will still be dealing with the public hospital.  In other words, his work will not relate exclusively to the private hospital.  What is the highest salary for a CEO which the HSE regards as being in compliance?</p></speech>

If his overall income is in excess of &euro;136,282, will the HSE regard St. Vincent's as being in breach of public pay guidelines?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, we will take the necessary steps under our service level arrangement.  St. Vincent's has said it will take the necessary steps to appoint a public interest sub-committee of its board to ensure everything is appropriately managed.  There is no question, therefore, that the public interest, and the &euro;195 million in public moneys, will not be properly safeguarded and reported.</p></speech>

We are always open to public competitions and any appointments we have made, including in the case of the chief operating officer, for example, have been done by way of public competition.  I expect to see that continuing.  Deputy O'Donnell has raised a very valid point.  The pay of Mr. Jermyn and so on will be and is subject to negotiation.  That is on the private side of the fence.  As Mr. O'Brien rightly said, what we do in regard to the group activities is a matter for the private company.</p><p>  On the other issue, I do not see a problem.

Up to that point we said, "Let us abide by what the lawyers are saying to us".  Then there came a stage when the controversy was moving on and we stopped a meeting and said, "Hold on, we wish to not run counter to public policy".  That is still our stated wish and we suddenly said, "Let us put the legal advice aside and [honestly, Deputy] let us then move into disclosing the information".</p><p>  The Deputy asked earlier about giving it out before Christmas.  The Chairman commented in public, I think, about this and I understand perfectly the reason for the commentary and so on.  The way things evolved was, as I said to Deputy McDonald in answer to her question, that we could have held it until the new year.  Quite honestly, however, when the board took a decision to say, "Okay, we will put the legal advice aside and we will disclose it", rightly or wrongly, we went and disclosed it immediately.  One could argue, by God, that just came before Christmas Eve.  It did but I can only say that the motive for doing so was to get it out as quickly as possible given that we had decided we had to do so.  As I said - and I repeat - we could have waited for the new year and perhaps there would have been no negative comments about it.</p></speech>

We had seven people.  One we just discussed, Mr. Meagher, who was seconded and on the other three people we were working to compliance.  We received a circular from the HSE around October or earlier in the year and then what happened was that we honestly believed we were in a position where we were working to compliance based on the criteria set in the circular.  What happened then was that the board had agreed it was going to disclose-----</p></speech>

The reason we disclosed the three people - it was seven versus three - was because we had not completed the discussions with the individuals.  As we said earlier on, we have now completed those discussions and we are compliant with those three.</p><p>  In regard to the circular, there is a differentiation.  As group chief executive, I can say that I think we have covered it and we are committed to sorting this out.  The actual view was that for the public work we receive a public salary for a public pension and we do public work.  In the context of the three people that were dealing with the group work, they were paid privately and that was deemed outside the one-salary-one-person public sector public pay service.  We have discussed this and I do not-----</p></speech>

It states:<blockquote><br />I am writing to set out the essential features of pay policy as it applies to the Health Service and in particular to those bodies funded, in whole or in part, under service agreements with the HSE under section 38 of the Health Act 2004.  In light of the findings in the HSE Internal Audit Report on remuneration in bodies funded under Section 38, dated March 15th 2013, the Minister for Health has instructed that section 38 providers be reminded of their  obligation to conform fully to Government pay policy.  For the avoidance of doubt, employees of Section 38 providers are public servants.</blockquote>That is the purpose of the pay policy.</p></speech>

What I said earlier to the committee was that we identified one or two options for St. Vincent&rsquo;s with regard to the CEO position.  We accept that we must fund a CEO for St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital, which is a public body.  Equally, we have a liability to fund whatever is the agreed salary for the manager of St. Michael&rsquo;s Hospital, which is another public body.  If St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group decide to appoint a CEO, we as the funder will not contribute any money whatsoever from public funds for the salary of that post.

This issue would arise at board level but ultimately the board would not have a say in diverting public moneys.  It would have to have full regard to the service level arrangement, which it has confirmed it will do, and to give assurance to everyone, it said it will have a public interest committee or sub-committee as part of the board to ensure that.</p></speech>

Earlier, I mentioned correspondence I had received and which I will forward to the witnesses.  I ask them to provide the committee with a comprehensive response to the issues raised because I am concerned about them.  I ask the board of St. Vincent's to give priority to dealing with it.

That is our requirement and we see that date in March as being the absolute latest time by which we would tolerate a resolution being agreed and signed off.

Also, a vote is scheduled in the House, which will interrupt but not interfere with the proceedings.  It will give the ambassador a chance to have a cup of coffee.<br />I welcome Her Excellency, Diana Zagorianou-Prifti, the ambassador of Greece to Ireland, and thank her for meeting with the committee to discuss the programme and priorities of the Greek Presidency of the European Union, which Greece assumed this month from Lithuania.  Of course, Lithuania assumed the Presidency last year from Ireland.  The Presidency is aiming to build on some of the gains of the past year in further promoting economic growth, job creation and securing financial stability and a more co-ordinated economic governance.  I understand the Greek Presidency is also expected to focus on enhancing civic and society engagement in the European Union through policies and initiatives in response to the daily problems, concerns and insecurities of Europe's citizens.  We look forward to exploring those issues with the ambassador after she delivers her opening remarks.<br />Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br />The ambassador is a regular attendee at this committee.  I invite her to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1500" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Ms Diana Zagorianou-Prifti" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014011600003#B00500"><p>I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators for inviting me to the meeting and giving me the opportunity to describe the main goals and priorities of the Greek EU Presidency in the first half of 2014.  Greece is the third and last country of the trio of Ireland, Lithuania and Greece to hold the Presidency.  In July 2014 we will hand the Presidency over to Italy.</p><p>  On 1 January 2014, Greece assumed for the fifth time the rotating Presidency of the EU Council.  The budget of this Presidency is no more than &euro;50 million, the lowest amount we could manage.  During the Presidency, Greece will host, in Athens, 14 informal ministerial meetings plus the Gymnich informal ministerial meeting as well as approximately 110 other lower-level meetings.  Greece assumes the Presidency at a time that Europe is going through an extremely delicate phase.  We are all aware of the fact that the EU is in a deep crisis, and my country is in the middle of this.  For years now we have talked about recession and unemployment in most of our countries.  Naturally, as long as there is prosperity, things are always easier.  On the contrary, economic problems often lead to intense internal division and conflicts and to the awakening of old, and considered obsolete, ideas and stereotypes.  Thus, instead of integration and cohesion we risk having more distance between states and societies.</p><p>  The extent of the debt crisis and of the associated recession and unemployment has undermined the confidence of EU citizens in the very idea of European integration.  Disenchantment with the European integration process is growing.  Furthermore, social cohesion has suffered enormously, in particular in the countries where the effects of the crisis have been more pronounced.  We have to deal with a wave of euroscepticism and we should try hard to convince anyone concerned that the solution lies on more, not on less, Europe.  To overcome the hiatus, Europe needs to move forward, not backward.  We need more European integration, not less.  Moreover, we need good jobs and sustainable growth and we must ensure that our policies are aligned with this popular demand.  These aspirations are shared by the Hellenic Presidency.  We formulated our political priorities in order to reflect and serve these goals.  Ultimately, our hope is to contribute to the reaffirmation of the European project at the hearts and minds of the people of Europe.</p><p>  Our challenge is to ensure prosperity and stability; for this the EU must reaffirm its mission in the hearts and minds of its citizens.  We are called upon to tackle the economic and financial crisis, to safeguard the common currency, to tackle recession and unemployment and to regain the trust of European citizens to safeguard the European social model of democracy and the rule of law - elements that until recently were taken for granted, but have been put to the test by the crisis.</p><p>  The period of the Hellenic Presidency will also be pivotal in Greece, at a time when the first signs of an exit from the crisis are becoming discernable.  It is a crisis that has cost the Greek economy a cumulative recession of 25% of GDP, with unemployment rates mushrooming, particularly for the young, and in which the average Greek has lost 40% of their living standard compared with 2007.  Thanks to the persistent efforts and sacrifices of the Greek people, Greece has taken major strides in the direction of fiscal health, showing the best structural - that is, cyclically adjusted - primary surplus in the eurozone, at over 6% of GDP, and has also achieved a deficit reduction of 13% of current GDP.  There are good grounds for optimism that the six months of the Hellenic Presidency will coincide with the recovery of Greece's real economy.</p><p>  The main principles which will guide the work of the Presidency can be summarised as follows: enhancing civic and society engagement in the EU, with the ultimate goal of the development of the EU into a community of shared values and "common destiny" for all its citizens, while preserving and strengthening the European model; deepening the Union, especially economic and monetary union, EMU - the aim remains to safeguard the irrevocability of the common currency, on a solid and sustainable basis; and reinforcing EU democratic legitimacy and accountability along with collectivity and solidarity links among member states, as well as incrementally constructing European democracy and expanding civil rights.  Briefly, the promotion of policies and measures for achieving growth, combating unemployment, promoting economic and social cohesion and structural reforms, deepening integration and completion of EMU, as well as addressing external challenges, including EU enlargement, formulate the priority framework of the Hellenic Presidency.</p><p>  With regard to growth, jobs and cohesion, unemployment has reached record high rates in most EU member states, affecting the young in particular, and recession is a constant threat to European economies.</p> <p>In this context, growth is considered to be a driving force for a sustainable way out of the crisis because it is expected to create jobs, strengthen political stability, correct social imbalances and, ultimately, reinforce European cohesion.  From the Greek perspective, jobs and growth are structurally and inextricably connected.  Initiatives and actions for halting unemployment and boosting job creation are absolutely necessary in order to avert the danger of jobless growth.  The main objective is to balance the timetable of fiscal consolidation with the implementation of a substantially enhanced and realistic compact for growth and jobs, which can be transformed into a diverse European investment programme, modelled after the cohesion policy and with a focus on employment.</p><p> Striking the right balance between fiscal solidity and an effort to boost growth is considered to be the catalyst for achieving the necessary cohesion among national economic policies and hence among European societies.  It is such a cohesion that constitutes the foundation of further European integration, which is the second priority of the Greek Presidency.  The European Investment Bank, EIB, can play a strong role in respect of labour-intensive projects - for example, projects relating to SMEs, basic infrastructure, energy and climate - with the support and trust of the European Central Bank, ECB.  One specific way to boost European growth would be to significantly increase the lending capacity of the EIB to finance expanded investments, particularly in the countries most affected by the crisis.  The whole movement must essentially be backed by the EIB.  This ambitious investment programme will qualify targeted actions, especially in countries which register alarmingly high levels in all four social indicators - unemployment, youth unemployment, social exclusion and poverty - with an emphasis on SMEs.  The latter are a source of innovation and employment and an important factor for economic growth and social cohesion in the EU, mostly in the European south.  In any event, it would be useful to launch a dialogue on those specific subject areas that offer high growth potential and, at the same time, job creation.  I refer here to innovation, services to firms, transport, shipping and tourism.  A Commission White Paper on that matter in the coming months could be the springboard for this project.  European leaders have decided to strengthen efforts to combat youth unemployment and to endorse the joint EIB-Commission initiative - entitled "Investment Plan" - to finance SMEs as the key employers in the European economy.</p><p> I will now comment on further integration of the EU-eurozone.  The global financial crisis revealed the great extent to which the fiscal policies of the eurozone member states are intertwined.  Furthermore, it made clear the absence of preventive and corrective structures in the original economic and monetary union architecture, which would absorb the shocks within member states and deter any threat to the macroeconomic stability of the euro area.  The course towards a deep and genuine economic and monetary union requires an integrated financial, fiscal and economic framework.  In this economic and monetary union, member states, with the assistance and co-ordination of the European institutions, would be able to implement their reform programmes, with focused actions on the specific needs and conditions of each member state.  This exercise should be consistent with and devote special attention to the social dimension and the democratic legitimacy and accountability of the new economic and monetary union.  In this framework, progress on the following building blocks will be emphasised.</p><p> First, the promotion of the banking union.  This remains essential to the improved functioning of the EMU and a prerequisite for increased confidence in the European economy.  The Hellenic Presidency will strive to reach agreement on the Commission's most recent proposal on the single resolution mechanism, SRM.  Depending on recent progress, we may face other issues that seem ripe for agreement, namely, the banking recovery, the resolution directive and the deposit guarantee directive.  There is also special interest in promoting, as a matter of urgency - given the small legislative period until the elections for the European Parliament - issues concerning tax fraud and evasion, as well as the financial transactions tax.</p><p> The second building block relates to agreement on the principles of the reinforced budgetary and economic integration frameworks. The aim is to ensure the effective implementation and further integration of new EU-eurozone economic governance mechanisms in order to enhance synergies between member states in a growth and jobs-friendly way.  In deepening the economic and monetary union, we will strive to lay the foundations of an ever-prosperous, well co-ordinated model, with the correct balance between solidity and solidarity and the necessary institutional autonomy of its members.  Our work will be guided by Herman Van Rompuy's roadmap and the Commission's blueprint.  This new eurozone should fully respect the Single Market and remain open to non-euro area member states.</p><p> The third aspect relates to special emphasis being attached to the social dimension of the economic and monetary union as one of the pillars for further deepening that union.  It cannot be overstated that special emphasis will be attached to the social dimension of the economic and monetary union as one of the pillars for its further deepening.  At the same time, we will need to lay the foundations for an institutional structure that will ensure enhanced transparency, accountability and representation in respect of the entire exercise.  This dimension entails particular importance as an answer to the demographic and fiscal crisis of the European welfare state.</p><p> On migration, borders and mobility, instability on the European periphery, together with the perseverance of the causes that lead to immigration flows into Europe, increase these flows and place an extra burden on EU member states in a period of economic crisis.  This burden falls mainly on the EU member states located on Europe's external borders to the east and, to a large extent, the south, as well as on those heavily affected by recession and unemployment.  Coincidentally, on occasion some EU countries fall into both of these categories.  In this context, the Hellenic Presidency will concentrate its efforts on highlighting the positive aspects of a comprehensive migration management in order to boost growth.  In addition, it will spare no effort in promoting all dimensions of migration and mobility policies.  At the same time, action is envisaged to tackle the problems arising in the context of the economy, social cohesion and political stability as a result of illegal migration.  More specifically, within the framework of the EU's global approach to migration, the relevant EU policies and the union's co-operation with third countries, our approach has three main aims: to stop or reduce illegal migration in an efficient way, while safeguarding respect for human rights; to improve and better organise legal migration and facilitate mobility; and to enhance synergies between migration and growth.  Special emphasis will be placed on fighting illegal migration, with a focus on readmission and return, as well as on fighting human trafficking and building institutional capacities for better border management in the process of updating the EU action plan for tackling migration pressure.  Our main objective will be to contribute to building a comprehensive approach to border management, while reinforcing preventive actions in third countries of origin and transit of illegal immigrants.  Such an approach will be to the benefit of all EU member states.</p></speech>

The Hellenic Presidency will promote the implementation of the common European asylum system and will plan an emphasis on solidarity measures and the need to increase European funding to assist those member states which have most been affected by migration.  Respect of obligations deriving from international treaties and EU law is imperative in this effort.  As "mobility" is a broader term than "migration", it is necessary to link the external dimension of migration with interrelated policies - such as visa policies, strategic partnerships, EU competitiveness and a common migration policy - that are capable of contributing to the implementation of the Europe 2020 agenda.  The task force for the Mediterranean that we decided to form at the European Council in October is an important first step in the right direction to agree that the problem should be addressed to the extent possible at the place of origin.  The task force should present its results before the end of the year.  In light of the fast-approaching end of the 2010-14 Stockholm programme, the Hellenic Presidency will work on formulating the strategic vision and laying the priorities of EU relevant policies covering the years between 2014 and 2018, founded on solidarity, joint responsibility and co-operation between member states.  The development of the freedom, security and justice area has been and will continue to be a major objective for the Union.</p> <p>Today as Europe is being plagued by the economic crisis, it is essential to reinforce the common European policy on the areas of justice and home affairs.  Such a common policy must be founded on solidarity, joint responsibility and co-operation between member states.<br />Being a traditionally maritime country, Greece recognises the great potential that marine and maritime activities have in terms of benefiting the EU economy as a whole in a sustainable way.  At the same time, Europe has obvious strategic interests that justify the urge to bring to the fore and deal with security problems involving the management of sea borders.  In this context, Greece introduces a horizontal thematic that will run through all four of the Presidency's priorities, namely EU maritime policy.  The main idea is to redefine and restart EU maritime policy in all its aspects, not solely confined to issues of growth and development as initiated in the Limassol declaration pronounced during the Cypriot Presidency in 2012.<br />Our objective will be the adoption of a text on maritime policy-strategy at the June 2014 European Council highlighting two dimensions: security and growth.  In this context, the Hellenic Presidency will focus its efforts on the following actions.  They include building on the integrated maritime policy in the marine and maritime agenda for growth and jobs, including seabed mapping, blue energy, aquaculture, blue biotechnology, environmental issues and exploitation of marine mineral resources, as well as developing the indigenous energy resources of the European Union as an additional factor in reducing Europe's energy dependence; pushing for the implementation of maritime spatial planning; updating the EU maritime strategy on maritime transport in light of the recent international developments; and adopting the EU Strategy for the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, EUSAIR, December 2012 EC Conclusions.  Maritime and marine growth, transport, environment and tourism are the four pillars of EUSAIR.  The Commission is expected to adopt the communication and the action plan during spring 2014.  The Hellenic Presidency considers the EU macro-region strategy for the Adriatic and Ionian seas region an important priority and in this context will organise a ministerial meeting.  The actions also include shaping a European maritime security strategy.  The preparations for shaping an actual EU maritime security strategy are under way.  Our goal is the adoption of the strategy during our Presidency at the June 2014 European Council.  Other actions include promoting co-operation and synergies of coast guard services, promoting nautical and coastal tourism and dealing appropriately with the sensitive but ultimately important issue of European security of sea-borne migration.  Our goal is to promote this issue, <i>inter alia</i>, in the framework of the third priority - migration, borders, mobility.<br />Our aim is to co-operate closely with all partners that share the same strategic interests and to promote strategies and policies that will benefit all EU member states.  The sea is an area of privilege in terms of knowledge and action for Greece and is an inexhaustible source of growth and prosperity for the whole of Europe.  While the dissolution of the European Parliament in May means that we have a tight schedule to keep during the first trimester of our Presidency, as far as legislative work is concerned, the second trimester is going to be equally busy as it provides a good opportunity to have political-strategic debates on the most pressing issues and reach political guidance and direction for the next trio Presidency.  Already, we are working very closely with Italy in order to have a smooth transition from one trio Presidency to another and to ensure that the necessary follow-up work will be taken forward.<br />I can assure Deputies and Senators that having already undertaken the rotating Presidency four times, my country is fully aware of the climate within the EU and the relevant difficulties but that we see this six month-Presidency as the big challenge.  Greece has the know-how as well as the sensitivity and the necessary perception of reality to guarantee a successful Presidency in the interests of all European citizens.</p></speech>

We congratulate Greece on the Presidency and its contribution in the past and wish it well in respect of this Presidency, which is a very important one from Greek and European perspectives.  As we all know, Greece has contributed greatly to society in the millennia gone by and there is no reason why its contribution in the present time cannot be as great.  There are a number of challenges that the ambassador recognises and has outlined.  Economic and social challenges have emerged over the past number of years that need to be dealt with.  In our Presidency, we did our utmost to deal with them, as have prior and subsequent Presidencies.</p><p>  This is a unique time, as we all know.  It is not like anything we have had in the past.  There were new experiences and new very unpopular measures had to be taken by governments throughout the EU both within the eurozone and outside it.  In these times, there is a great opportunity for a Presidency to take ownership of the Presidency and the European project and progress it because the challenges we have experienced in the past number of years should and could have been anticipated but were not.  There are lessons to be learned from that.  There are also lessons that continue to be learned from the perspective of people who tend to exclude themselves from identification with European unionism, for want of a better description.  We see the emergence of euroscepticism, to which the ambassador referred, and its popularity.  It is a good time to remind all those who are eurosceptics of what happened when Euroscepticism or a similar approach emerged in the past and its consequences.  There is no harm in reflecting on those issues at this particular time.  </p><p>  It is also no harm to remember that easy options will always be presented by people who usually do not have responsibility but hope to have it at some time in the future.  It is a great opportunity for a Presidency to be able to explain to its own people and the European community at large that, unfortunately, easy options have not worked in the past.  If they had worked, we would all be practising them.  </p><p>  There is also an opportunity to once again pinpoint the successes of the past and the past 60 years in particular - the things that went right - and how much the people of Europe have benefitted from those decisions made at that time and which will live on.  One of the things we learned during our Presidency and over the past four or five years is that things happened that were not anticipated but should have been anticipated not only by our own institutions but by European institutions.  There are lessons to be learned from that which we hope will result in measures being taken which do not negatively impact in particular on one member state or two or three member states but which should be accepted as being part and parcel of the responsibility of the evolving European project.  As long as that happens, the EU is safe and secure and will progress and achieve the economic progress to which we aspire.  If there is one thing that must be learned from the experiences we have been through, it is that we can prevail.  All those prophets of doom and gloom that predicated annihilation, oblivion and the end of all that we knew were wrong.  All those who predicted the things that allegedly could be done in the good times were wrong as well.  So we go back to basics and basic economic thinking and basic social policy and will recover and rebuild anew.  </p><p>  I apologise as I must go to another committee that is in session at the same time in which I must play a particular part.</p></speech>

The ambassador is a regular attendee at this committee.</p> <p>We would be very happy to provide assistance and information to the ambassador considering that Ireland recently held the EU Presidency.  I attended a recent COSAC meeting at which I met some of the Greek delegates.  They were very positive and hopeful about the Greek Presidency as a means of bringing some positivity to Greece in difficult times.  I noted at the COSAC meeting the priority given to youth unemployment by member states.  I ask if this could be prioritised by the Greek Presidency.  </p><p> I must apologise that I must leave to attend another meeting.

Deputy Bernard Durkan referred to Greece's long and proud history and the fact that Greece gave democracy to the world.  Now is another opportunity for Greece to lead in Europe.  We have all endured tough times but perhaps Greece had the toughest time of all.  However, that difficult experience could provide a potential for inspiration.  What lessons have been learned by Greece?  What lessons might Greece have learned from the experience of other countries in the eurozone?  I am particularly conscious of the Greek experience because of our Irish experience.  Have the Greek people felt isolated within the European project?  Is Europe a consideration in their lives?</p><p>  On the question of areas where growth might be achieved, when I was attending conferences as a regular member of this committee it was pointed out that substantial growth could be achieved by the implementation of the EU services directive, such as, the electronic signature and aspects of the digital media area.  It struck me that national growth and GDP could be increased by 2% to 3% with the implementation of more electronic processes which would facilitate the creation of cross-borders business.  Is this being implemented in Greece?</p><p>  The ambassador referred to the European Investment Bank and the investment plan to finance small and medium enterprises.  Is it planned to ring-fence funding for youth employment?  Is the EIB discussing the catastrophe of youth unemployment?  One in three young people in Ireland is unemployed.  Families have invested in their talented young people, as has the State.  We do not want that energy and spirit to be demoralised.  Like Senator Noone I am very aware of a particular group of young people.  Has the EIB any policies to focus on youth unemployment?  My final question is about border management, migration, mobility and policing, to which the ambassador referred in her presentation.  In her view is there a role for sharing information across borders about the backgrounds and records of citizens?  I will conclude by saying that I am very proud of Greece.  It has had a difficult time, no more than ourselves.  I very much hope this will be a very successful EU Presidency for Greece as well as for Europe.</p></speech>

I extend best wishes to her country on its Presidency of the EU.  We appreciate the economic difficulties across the European Union which are a challenge for all politicians and in particular for the EU Presidency.  The ambassador stated that one of the main principles is to enhance civic and societal engagement with the EU.  How challenging has it become to promote the ideals and benefits of the European Union?  In her view, will the economic crisis have a negative effect on the perception of citizens about the Union?</p></speech>

My colleague, Senator Healy Eames has referred to the issue of the border areas and refugees from Syria and other countries.  Turkey is not part of the EU but it is has 600,000 refugees from Syria and there has been a movement of refugees into Greece.  Is Europe doing enough to deal with the Syrian crisis and to support countries such as Greece who are dealing with an influx of people?  Should there be a European initiative to deal with this issue so that more support is provided to countries who are dealing with this problem which has arisen almost overnight?  It has not been possible for such countries to undertake any forward planning for dealing with this problem.</p></speech>

One of the factors that irritated Irish people was other European leaders and countries basking in the reflected successes of the Irish economy.  To its great credit, improvements have begun in Greece.  However, no more than in our case, it is a very difficult journey for the people.  How is the Greek Presidency of the EU and international commentary on Greece being perceived by the people?  Is such commentary perceived as being supportive or misplaced?  The Greek people face a difficult journey.  In the view of the ambassador how will Greece be interpreted by Europe during the very important six-month period of the European elections?  There are many parts to the spectrum but Greece will be used in the arguments for and against European Union integration and membership.  How is this being perceived on the ground?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1517" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Ms Diana Zagorianou-Prifti" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014011600007#G00600"><p>It thank members for their very interesting questions which I will try my best to answer.  I hope I will cover all the topics raised.  Senator Healy Eames is correct that the crisis in Greece is much tougher than in any other country.</p> <p>This was due to different reasons.  Some of the causes were down to us, as we made many grave mistakes previously and during the implementation of our programmes, but there were also some problems with the programmes themselves that meant they could not be easily implemented in the fairest and most correct way.  As such, we went through a difficult phase, the outcome of which was that our people did not find everyday life easy.  I do not want to speak about numbers and GDP alone, but families' incomes and capacity to live have worsened.  My personal perception is that, among middle-income households, the capacity to live is less than it was in 2005.</p><p> Multiple mistakes were made by all sides, we went the wrong way and the correct way, there was some good and some bad, etc.  Despite all of this, we have passed across to the other side of the river.  We have left behind us those difficult and ambiguous situations, although we still face difficulties.  We have not solved our problems, but we know how to proceed.  The way will not be easy.  We still have many reforms to complete and many paths to walk, but we know what is in front of us and that, at the end, we will exit the crisis.</p><p> The EU was another great partner in the solidarity it showed us.  We were a eurozone country and an EU member.  Had we been alone, I do not know whether it would have been possible to exit the crisis.  The eurozone and EU countries helped us, for which we are grateful.  They did their part and we did ours.  The OECD has predicted that if we complete all of our reforms, which we believe we will, the growth rate will be more than 2% per year and as much as 3% or 4%.  Perhaps we could exit the crisis much sooner than foreseen.</p><p> The youth unemployment rate is high.  Indeed, unemployment rates in Greece are high in general.  There has been a kind of brain drain.  Not all, but many of our best brains are going abroad.  Everyone who emigrates to search for a better life does so with one eye looking back to their country for an opportunity to return and offer their skills.  We view this as just a difficult phase and are ready to go through it.  We are confident that we are finally succeeding.</p><p> It is in these circumstances that the European Presidency comes to us.  As members know well, the press that we received was mixed.  However, it was mainly positive.  We perceive this as acknowledging that we are capable of managing the Presidency.  It is a good opportunity for us to show what we can and will do, but not only within the Presidency.  We will touch on sensitive issues.  We are the most appropriate people to indicate what are the most sensitive sectors in the crisis.  It is important for the EU, us and the subjects themselves that we have a good Presidency.</p><p> Refugees are coming to us from Syria and other countries.  There is a large flow of immigration.  We are one of the main doors to the EU.  The amount of money that we spend to contain this flow is considerable, especially in this period.  We are not well supported in this task.  We would like more support and co-operation.  We have a good understanding with Italy, Malta and others that face the same problem.  None of the illegal immigrants are entering Greece to reach us.  We are just a transit country.  The final destinations are northern European countries.  We are obliged to contain them, send them back, feed and help them, provide them with health care, etc.  This is not an easy task and is quite costly.  We try our best and, for the main part, succeed, but we are bearing a great burden alone for most of Europe.</p><p> That is all, but if I have forgotten to answer any question, please remind me.</p></speech>

The main topic of business is consideration of the Revised Estimates for the Department of the Taoiseach.  The D&aacute;il ordered on 18 December 2013 that the following Revised Estimates for the public services be referred to this committee for consideration: Vote 1 - President's Establishment; Vote 2 - Department of the Taoiseach; Vote 3 - Office of the Attorney General; Vote 4 - Central Statistics Office; Vote 5 - Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions; and Vote 6 - Office of the Chief State Solicitor.</p><p>  I welcome the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Paul Kehoe, and their officials.

The 2014 Estimates in each case are the President's Establishment - &euro;3.267 million; the Department of the Taoiseach: &euro;19.423 million; the Office of the Attorney General - 14.301 million; the Central Statistics Office - &euro;39.577 million; the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions - &euro;36.838 million; and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor - &euro;26.309 million.  The total Estimates for these Votes in 2014 is &euro;139.715 million, a reduction of 5% from the 2013 Revised Estimates of &euro;146.615 million.</p><p>  I will briefly describe for the committee the broad areas of work which are undertaken by the Department of the Taoiseach.  I will also briefly outline the proposed Estimates allocations for the President's Establishment, the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  As Members will be aware, while I have certain responsibilities to the Oireachtas in respect of administrative matters in the legal offices, they operate independently of my Department.  The Minister of State will make a short statement on the Estimates for the Central Statistics Office, for which he has delegated responsibility.</p><p>  The Revised Estimates for the President's Establishment for 2014 is &euro;3.267 million.  This includes just over &euro;2 million for pay and administration, with the balance of &euro;1.2 million to fund the centenarians' bounty.  Based on last year's figures and recent trends, it is estimated that over 400 centenarians will receive the bounty in 2014, although this is impossible to predict.</p><p>  Vote 2 is for the Department of the Taoiseach.  A total of &euro;19.423 million has been provided in the Estimates for the Department of the Taoiseach in 2014, a reduction of 12% on the 2013 Revised Estimates.  In accordance with the programme for Government, my Department aims to provide a strategic centre which ensures a joined-up approach to the development and implementation of Government policy, and includes a small office to monitor delivery of the programme for Government across all Departments.  As well as a number of executive functions appropriate to the centre of Government, much of this work involves support for meetings of the Government and Cabinet committees, including the Economic Management Council.</p><p>  I believe that there were a significant number of achievements during the course of 2013 to which my Department contributed, working with other Departments and agencies.  I will mention a few of these.  One was Ireland's successful exit from the troika programme and re-entry into the bond markets earlier this month.  This was greatly facilitated by the deal on the promissory note achieved in February and the achievement of fiscal targets in 2013 and in the 2014 budget.  Second was the very successful Irish Presidency of the European Union in the first half of 2013 which has been widely commended.  This was a major undertaking for the Department and I acknowledge the efforts of all involved, including temporary staff recruited for the Presidency.  Third, as well as the EU Presidency, we have continued to restore Ireland's international standing and reputation, including through visits I have undertaken to America, the World Economic Forum in Davos, the G8 summit in Lough Erne, Japan, and most recently the Persian Gulf states.  The Global Irish Economic Forum in October 2013 was another important part of this process.  Fourth was the effective implementation of the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs and the updated Pathways to Work strategy published in July, which has been reflected in a fall in unemployment to 12.4% and a return to substantial new job creation, although unemployment is still too high.  Fifth, there is the continued reform of the public service, in particular through the Haddington Road agreement concluded last June, as well as major reform programmes in local government, health, education and other sectors.  Sixth, there was the putting in place of a comprehensive strategy for mortgage arrears, including Central Bank targets for each bank and the establishment of the new insolvency service.  Seventh, there were political and constitutional reforms, including a new phase of D&aacute;il reforms introduced last September, the work of the Constitutional Convention and meeting our commitment to hold a referendum on the Seanad.  This was the sixth referendum during the lifetime of the Government and we are committed to further referendums in 2015 drawing on the work of the Constitutional Convention.</p><p>  My Department was involved in many other specific initiatives and issues during 2013, for example, promoting the development of the Irish Financial Services Centre, IFSC, resolving the Priory Hall complex problem and facilitating social dialogue through the National Economic and Social Council.</p><p>  For 2014, a great deal of further work is required in many of these areas, as well as progressing other priorities identified in the programme for Government and the Department's strategy statement.  During 2014, the programme for Government office will continue to oversee implementation of the programme and will publish the third progress report next March.</p><p>  The most important objective for the Department in 2014 will be job creation and, as I said on many previous occasions, 2014 will be all about jobs.  Work is now advanced in preparing the Action Plan for Jobs 2014 and the Department will seek to ensure that this is delivered, along with the continued roll-out of Pathways to Work.  My Department's work on the implementation of these strategies in 2014 will include some regional and local activities.  My Department will also continue to support me in a strategic programme of international engagement, based around jobs, increasing trade and investment.</p> <p>I recently had the opportunity to visit Japan and the Gulf States.  Next week I hope to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, and I also expect to travel to the United States in March where my focus will again be on building on our strong economic, political and business links with the US and progressing issues of concern to the Irish community, including immigration reform which is matter of increasing importance.  During the planning and organisation of my overseas visits, my Department will continue to prioritise value for money and will minimise associated costs.<br />Through the work of the Cabinet committee on economic infrastructure, we will seek to maximise productive investment across the economy, including delivery of public private partnerships projects and other stimulus investments to support economic growth and employment.  We also intend to deliver on the commitments in the medium-term economic strategy to ensure that the banking sector provides credit in a manner that supports economic recovery.<br /><b></b>In relation to the European Union, I intend to build on the successful Presidency to develop alliances and work with our partners to advance and defend Ireland's priority interests.  This is, and always has been, a core objective for me and my Department.<br />I continue to play an active part in the Council and, of course, continue our intense engagement across the board with the European Commission.  We will also work to maintain the important political relationships established with the current European Parliament and to develop connections with MEPs in the new Parliament following the elections in May of this year.  Alongside changes in the European Parliament, a new European Commission will be appointed later this year.  Ministers will be making particular efforts to engage with the new commissioners soon after they take up their new roles.  We also intend to deepen our long-term relationship with the European Commission and other institutions by maximising the number of Irish people working in these institutions on both a permanent and temporary basis.  It is for this reason that the Department&rsquo;s Estimate provides &euro;1.2 million towards efforts to increase our presence, including meeting the cost of seconded national experts in relevant positions in EU and international organisations.  This is an important investment in our future, by increasing our understanding of such institutions, whose work often impacts significantly at national level and thereby improving their understanding of us.<br />My Department&rsquo;s 2014 Estimates also include an allocation of &euro;250,000 for supporting EU engagement.  This money is spent supporting work in primary schools through the Blue Star programme, in local community groups, non-governmental organisations and others, as well as working with stakeholders to build awareness of the EU jobs available to Irish citizens.<br />Earlier this week the Government published a new public service reform plan which sets out a new wave of reform across the different sectors.  Implementation of this, including delivery on the potential under the Haddington Road agreement, is overseen by the Cabinet committee on public service reform.  In addition, my Department is jointly sponsoring an initiative on renewal of the Civil Service with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Together with the consultation process recently launched on Civil Service accountability, this will result in a new vision and set of reforms to ensure that the Civil Service is fit for the challenges it faces in the years ahead.  I expect the work to be completed by the summer.<br />Through the Cabinet committee on health, the focus in 2014 will be on the next phase of the reform process including publication of a White Paper on universal health insurance, implementation of &quot;money follows the patient&quot;, structural reforms to move towards a purchaser-provider split in health delivery and full implementation of the hospital groups announced last year.<br />My Department&rsquo;s Estimate includes an allocation of &euro;920,000 for the Constitutional Convention in 2014.  I believe that the convention has been very successful to date and, following a number of regional meetings in 2013, it has identified two further matters that it will examine this year, namely, D&aacute;il reform and economic, social and cultural rights.<br />Northern Ireland and North-South relations and relations with Britain will continue to be important priorities for my Department.  With regard to Northern Ireland, I was disappointed that the Haass talks concluded on New Year&rsquo;s Eve without reaching agreement.  It should be said and recognised that significant effort went into the talks.  I have placed on record my thanks to Dr. Haass and his team for accepting the invitation of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to facilitate these talks and for their tireless pursuit of an agreement.  I hope that the period ahead can be used to build on that effort and provide a basis for a future agreement.  The Government is ready and stands ready to work with the Northern Ireland Executive, the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland to support further efforts to achieve greater peace and build a united community in Northern Ireland.  We will also continue to support the work of the North-South Ministerial Council and I look forward to the next plenary session of the NSMC that will take place in Dublin on 6 June 2014.<i></i><br />Another important occasion in 2014 will be the official visit of Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann, President Higgins, to the United Kingdom.  The first State visit by the President to Britain will be an important and historic occasion.  Following on the very successful visit to Ireland by Queen Elizabeth in 2011, it will be a brilliant opportunity to deepen the relationship.  While the visit, of course, is a matter primarily for the Uachtar&aacute;n, the Government will offer any assistance that it can and that is required to ensure that the visit is a success.  My Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will provide assistance with logistical and other matters, while all relevant State agencies will also be asked to contribute.  Ambassador Dan Mulhall in London will of course be centrally involved. <br />I am sure and hope that the visit will reflect the deep and growing relations between Britain and Ireland, not just in history and politics, but also in economics, trade, culture and kinship.  I understand that it is also intended to have an appropriate event in London during the State visit to reflect our cultural ties that will be supported by Culture Ireland.  It will also provide an opportunity for the very large Irish community in Britain to participate in the visit and for their enormous contribution to the life of both Britain and Ireland to be recognised.<br />During 2013 my Department has organised, or assisted with, a range of commemorative events including the 1913 Lock-out and the foundation of the Irish Volunteers.  Of course, 2014 marks the centenary of the start of the First World War.Last December Prime Minister Cameron and I jointly visited a number of memorials in Flanders to pay our respects to those who died during the war, particularly soldiers from all parts of this island who fought in British uniforms.  It was a unique occasion at Tyne Cot, Menin Gate and in Flanders.  I believe it was important in showing how far relations between Britain and Ireland have come in recent times.<br />The 2014 commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising will also take place at the GPO on Easter Sunday, 20 April, while the National Day of Commemoration ceremony will be held in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham on Sunday, 13 July.<br />A total of &euro;1.46 million has been provided for the Moriarty tribunal in 2014.  The tribunal is currently dealing with applications for third party costs.  The single member has indicated to my Department that the majority of applications for costs have been considered by him and that he hopes to have this process finalised in the near future.  A new legal costs unit in the State Claims Agency is dealing with bills of costs from third parties at tribunals of inquiry, while the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office is handling bills received prior to the establishment of the legal costs unit.<br /><b></b>The allocation for the National Economic and Social Council in 2014 is &euro;1.99 million, a reduction of 21% since 2010.  The council continues to provide a forum for dialogue between Government and the social partners as well as analysing economic, social and environmental issues.  Following reports on the economic and social dimensions of the crisis in 2013, its work programme in 2014 will include housing, care of the elderly and jobless households.<br /><b></b>I have outlined some of the priorities which the Department will be working to progress during the course of 2014. In all areas the Department seeks to ensure value for money and to maximise efficiencies and will continue to do so in 2014, adhering to best practice in terms of procurement. </p> <p>In all areas, the Department seeks to ensure value for money and to maximise efficiencies and will continue to do so in 2014, adhering to best practice in procurement.  The Department already participates in a number of shared service projects and is scheduled to join the Civil Service human resources shared service during 2014. </p><p> In respect of Vote 3, the Office of the Attorney General, for 2014 the Office of the Attorney General has a net budget of &euro;14.301 million.  This is broken into &euro;12.885 million for the administrative subheads, &euro;2.204 million for programme expenditure and appropriation-in-aid of &euro;788,000.  The majority of the administrative expenditure relates to staff salaries, which will cost &euro;10.834 million in 2014.  The next largest expenditure is provided for in subhead A4 and is &euro;2.091 million in respect of the Law Reform Commission.  Funds for the operation of the commission are channelled through the Vote as a grant-in-aid.  Since 2008, the Vote's gross budget has reduced by 22.8%.  Measures taken include reductions in expenditure wherever possible and a 28% reduction in administrative staff numbers.  Staff losses have been confined to administrative positions in order to avoid any interruption of the core work of the office, that is, the provision of legal advice and drafting services to its clients.  The office is fully engaged in all the public service reform initiatives.</p><p> In respect of Vote 5, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Estimate for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is &euro;36.838 million.  This provides for the salaries and expenses of the director and her staff, the cost of the local State solicitor service, fees to counsel engaged by the director to prosecute cases in the various courts, and legal costs awarded against the State arising out of judicial review and other legal proceedings.  The Estimate for 2014 represents a drop of 2%, or &euro;576,000, over the 2013 Estimate.  The biggest single factor in this drop is the reduction in the provision made in input A4, general law expenses.  This input covers the payment of legal costs awarded by the courts in judicial review matters and other applications connected to legal proceedings.  The provision of &euro;2.121 million in respect of this input for 2014 represents a decrease of &euro;1.213 million over the 2013 allocation.  This reduction is possible because of an underlying reduction in the amount paid in respect of law costs awarded against the office over recent years.  This has been driven by a costs settlement policy implemented by the office.</p><p> In respect of Vote 6, the Estimate for the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office is &euro;26.309 million.  Salaries, wages and allowances account for &euro;14.8 million out of a total of &euro;16.969 million.  A figure of &euro;11.2 million is allocated for the payment of legal fees incurred by the office.  This can be broken down into an amount of &euro;9.6 million for counsel fees, &euro;1.4 million for general law expenses and &euro;200,000 for the use of external solicitors.  The remaining &euro;2.2 million is attributable to the general running costs of the office and includes provision for items such as IT services, training, security, cleaning, utilities and upkeep of offices.  The figures for salary and legal expenses, combined, account for 98% of the net allocation in the Revised Estimates of &euro;29.92 million.  Appropriations-in-aid are estimated at &euro;1.86 million and will include legal costs recovered by the office along with the recoupment of the pension levy.</p><p> In conclusion, I thank Members and I commend the Estimates to the committee.  The Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, will make a statement on the Estimates for the Central Statistics Office, for which he has ministerial responsibility.</p></speech>

While the main focus is to meet the statistical requirements of Government, the information published by the CSO is also used by other public bodies, and by businesses, universities, research institutes and the general public.</p><p>  There is a significant international dimension to the work of the CSO.  The EU institutions, the IMF, the OECD and other international bodies are all important users of official statistics.  These bodies also have a significant role in defining and monitoring standards for the compilation of comparable information; and the CSO subscribes to the standards set out in the UN fundamental principles of official statistics and the European statistics code of practice.</p><p>  The net allocation in 2013 amounted to &euro;39.758 million and included preparatory funding for the 2016 census of population.  In addition, the allocation included funding for the 2013 farm structure survey that was undertaken in June and for a household finance and consumption survey, the first of its kind to be undertaken by the CSO.  The net allocation for 2014 is &euro;39.577 million.  The allocation provides funding for core outputs and for the following projects: the 2014-15 European health interview survey, the 2014-15 national employment survey, the 2015-16 household budget survey and the 2016 census of population.</p><p>  The CSO is also implementing a long-term programme of changes in how it organises household surveys so that it can meet future information needs as efficiently as possible.  In 2014 the CSO will publish about 300 releases and publications.  All of these statistics are published online and members of the public are increasingly aware of, and able to access, statistics and indicators on the social, economic and environmental issues that affect their daily lives.  The CSO&rsquo;s statement of strategy gives priority to delivering the core statistics needed for policy, while keeping a strong focus on cost reduction.  The office continues to meet all of its commitments under the public service reform programme; and is implementing a programme of reform and continuous business process improvement in the collection and processing of statistics.</p><p>  The CSO is taking a lead role in developing the Irish statistical system by working closely with other Departments and public bodies to promote a more coherent approach to meeting data needs through the development of a code of practice for the Irish statistical system and promotion of a national data infrastructure, which will support greater usage of administrative data for statistical purposes.  Making better use of data throughout the public sector is an important part of public service reform and will contribute to more evidence-informed decision-making and better measurement of policy outcomes.</p><p>  Better co-ordination also contributes to reducing the burden on data providers.  Between 2008 and 2012, the CSO has continued to reduce the response burden of its non-agricultural business surveys.  When measured from 2008, the burden to 2012 has decreased by 33%, exceeding the target reduction of 25% over this timeframe.  The CSO Vote for 2014 provides for a total of 660 staff, the same number as 2013.  This no change situation reflects the cyclical nature of the work of the office and the introduction of new surveys this year.  However, the long-term trend in core staff numbers is significantly downward.  In conclusion, I commend the values and principles that inform the CSO&rsquo;s work.  The CSO makes an important contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s public policy by providing a high-quality and, most importantly, independent statistical service.</p></speech>

There is a full page on the specifics of what was discussed at the committee.  I just want to ask one question in regard to the two Cabinet committees referred to.  Did they meet to discuss the budget in addition to the matters that are listed?</p></speech>

Obviously, the list of things people discussed is there.  Direct discussions took place between the Ministers for Health and Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of the budget and the ceilings to be set out there.  Many of these matters were impacted on in one way or another by the budget but these Cabinet committees did not hold meetings strictly on the budget; nor did any other Cabinet committee.  There were direct negotiations with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Finance.</p></speech>

Last year, during the Estimates meeting, we spoke quite a bit about the legacy of the past and victims' meetings.  I would like to know the Taoiseach's plan for 2014 because it is referred to as part of his work programme.  I refer to the families of the disappeared and the 16 victims of republican paramilitary violence up to 2003.  I understand the Taoiseach met some of the families last summer.  There was a major documentary in 2013 and I think the Taoiseach made a speech following that asking Deputy Adams and Sinn F&eacute;in members to come forward with any information they might have to help.  Does the Taoiseach have plans to continue his work under this peace heading in regard to the legacy issue of the families of the disappeared?</p></speech>

I met with members of the families last year.  I also spoke directly to Deputy Adams in respect of his contacts in the former Provisional IRA about knowledge or information on who abducted the persons involved, who might have been responsible for their deaths and where their remains were left or buried as the case may be.  In his conversation with me, Deputy Adams made it clear that it would be very difficult after all these years to pinpoint accurately, from the sources known to him, where the remaining seven remains might be.  He suggested from the knowledge he gave to me that the remains of the seven disappeared were in County Meath or County Monaghan.  On the occasions on which I have the opportunity to visit either county, I continue to say that there may well be people out there with information about the remains of somebody left on their lands or whatever.  While it was a long time ago, closure has not been brought to the families in these cases.  While the organisation dealing with this has done a great deal of work, there are families out there who have not had closure.  For my part, I will continue to do whatever I can do to bring about that information and that these remains can be recovered.</p></speech>

There is the same kind of legacy culture of not coming forward with information.  If those people who have information could help the garda&iacute; in the investigation-----</p></speech>

Somebody made a decision to carry out an assassination or a murder and gave instructions that it be done, that the person or persons be transported and shot or whatever the method of murder or assassination was and that the person or persons be buried or left in different locations.  I share that view absolutely.  People who might have remorse at this stage, or who have any knowledge or information, should come forward.  I understand the garda&iacute; are pursuing a very active line of inquiry in respect of the tragic death and murder of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe.</p></speech>

He said significant achievements last year included the launch of a new east-west interconnector and the signing of a memorandum of understanding on the trading of renewable electricity.  I understand a memorandum of understanding has been signed to facilitate industrial wind farm development in certain regions in the country, including the midlands, with a view to exporting that electricity by way of a new interconnector.  I think the memorandum of understanding was signed by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, and his counterpart in the British Government.  Has that memorandum been finalised?  What will be the progress on that for this year?  I refer to it because the Minister referred to it in the context of achievements by his Department last year.</p></speech>

The briefing note gives a broad scope as to the operational aspects of the Department.  The purpose of this afternoon's meeting is specific but I have allowed a degree of flexibility.  I can revert to the agreed agenda and we can go through this heading by heading.  However, I need a degree of discipline from members.  We are discussing programmes in regard to their administration, pay and non-pay elements and matters relating to outputs and output targets.  If there are finances in the Department of the Taoiseach relating to actions arising and where we can measure outputs, we can debate that, but I will not open up a general debate.</p><p>  There is a certain degree of sensitivity surrounding  the previous issue, so I did not intervene.  However, I will intervene from here on in.

There are two issues that the convention wishes to conclude in this session, namely D&aacute;il reform and economic, social and cultural rights.  When the work is completed on those two areas and the convention sends in its report, I will talk to the chairman to get his views on how he and the convention should operate in the future.  We have built up a bank of issues upon which the Government will have to make decisions in terms of whether referendums should be held in 2015.  I have already signalled that it is the Government's intention to hold a number of referendums on the issues that have been reported on by the convention.  While a figure of &euro;920,000 is included for 2014, I cannot say whether all of that money will be used.</p></speech>

The Votes for the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Chief State Solicitor and the Attorney General are all related in that they are all legal entities.  During 2013 the Haddington Road agreement was brokered and there was a lot of talk about the cuts that applied to those earning salaries in excess of approximately &euro;62,000.  Everyone in this room who is paid by the taxpayer had a salary reduction.  A question arose as to whether that cut would apply to professional fees.  The briefing note tells us that there were cuts to professional fees in 2009, 2010 and 2011.  In July last year the Government decided to invoke the FEMPI legislation to implement a 7.5% cut to the professional fees paid to general practitioners, pharmacists and others who are not direct employees of the HSE.  Did that FEMPI cut also apply to the legal fees at the Office of the Attorney General, the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions?  I see no reference in the documentation to the FEMPI cut in that regard.  Why, in 2014, will we not have a saving on professional fees?  Legal fees are the biggest issue under those three headings.  The troika was here and one of the biggest regrets of its representatives when they were leaving was that they had not secured reform of the legal professions.  The legal profession talked out the troika for three years and the legislation to reform that profession and make it more competitive was not produced.  I had assumed that the cuts to professional fees that applied under Haddington Road applied to people who were being paid by the State, as is the situation in the health sector.  Has it happened in the legal area too, and if not, why not?  The legal fraternity was able to out-manoeuvre the troika on legal reform for three years.  Did it out-manoeuvre the Government with regard to a FEMPI cut to legal fees for the coming year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1583" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI32014011600007#F02100"><p>There is still a lot of work going on in the preparation of Bills for legal services and for further reforms in the legal profession, as the Deputy knows well.  Some of that work is being resisted, obviously.  As I understand it, all fee notes for work carried out by counsel were critically examined and, where necessary, reduced to reflect the value of the work completed.  Following this review, a reduction of 8% was due under the measures contained in the FEMPI Act of 2009, as applied.  It is fair to say, therefore, that the fees paid by the State are substantially lower than those in private practice.</p><p>  The programme for Government sets out that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will examine the possibility of tendering for procurement of barrister services and the potential benefits involved.  In respect of the Office of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor's office, the Department accepted that, for the present, it would be preferable not to introduce competitive tendering in the normal sense as those offices have been very successful in reducing legal fees over the past number of years.  Since 2008 overall expenditure on fees to counsel have been reduced by 30%.  It should be noted that the number of cases coming into the offices has not decreased significantly during this period.  That does not answer the Deputy's specific question, but I will get the information he is seeking.</p></speech>

I will take this issue up with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform too, but it seems that the Taoiseach's Department is carrying additional costs for that new office.  I ask that the Department provide information to the committee on those extra costs.</p></speech>

Finally, the last paragraph on page 86 refers to the Department undertaking a focused policy assessment on legal services and expenditure.  I can take this up with the line Minister but it affects the Votes for the Taoiseach's Department.  Is there a timescale for that policy assessment exercise?  Is the Taoiseach able to say anything more on it other than the information contained in the briefing note?  If not, I will take the matter up with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

If I were a cartoonist drawing a clich&eacute; of the old man with the scythe leaving the old year and the baby coming in with the new year, I would have to seriously revise it in view of what we have endured in the past week in revelations.

It is our entitlement to respond.</p><p>  In his statement and long briefing document, all produced with taxpayers' funds, the exit from the bailout and the deal on the promissory notes is extolled at length but may I put it to him that the downside should have been included also.  The Taoiseach deals at length with the saving from the promissory note but neglects to say that the debts are put over 40 years and the children of children yet unborn will carry them.  There should be some reference to the serious implications for people of the legacy of debt of 125% of gross domestic product now and interest payments of &euro;9 billion a year.  The Taoiseach gives us the rosy spin, and he has had the EU establishment spinning for him for the past two to three weeks because it was important for them that the bailout of their financial system on the backs of our people would be portrayed as something good.  I am asking the Taoiseach to comment on the sustainability of what has been put forward in his opening statement.</p><p>  I wish to raise also the issue of funding of trade missions undertaken by the Taoiseach.  Will he comment also on his failure during his trade trips to make a reference to the human rights of the oppressed people of China who are routinely brutalised or those whose hands and legs are chopped off in countries such as Saudi Arabia and so on?  I believe the Irish taxpayers would want the Taoiseach, when he is using their money to go to these countries, to have a strong position on that.</p><p>  What funding will the Taoiseach allocate to mark the commemoration of the First World War, 1914-18?  Will he take into account the First World War was a bestial and criminal enterprise by governments and the successors of those governments with whose representatives he rubs shoulders at commemorations but does not comment on the reasons that millions of working people slaughtered each other for the sake of their markets and colonies.  Will the Taoiseach speak out on the criminal enterprise that it was or would that embarrass the Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron and the others?</p><p>  The Taoiseach states he will remember the soldiers, the soldiers who in the main were the poor and working class youths from all sides who were slaughtered and brutalised.  They should be remembered, but they were victims.  I would like the Taoiseach to comment on that.</p><p>  There is an allocation for the Moriarty tribunal of &euro;146 million for 2014.  Is that the totality of all and any costs outstanding in relation to this tribunal?  Will the Taoiseach give a breakdown of where the money is due to go?</p><p>  The briefing document deals at length with the fair and social inclusive policies of the Taoiseach.  May I put it to him that several agencies, including the ESRI, disagree with that statement?  The ESRI states the impact of the Government's economic policies and austerity measures bears hardest on those with lower income and on the poor whereas the very wealthy and corporate sector and so on are not affected in the same way.  Will he defend this when it is palpably not the case?</p></speech>

On the question of exiting the bailout by the end of 2013, I believe this was an achievement that was regarded objectively by markets and international analysts as being significant and being the first eurozone country to exit a bailout programme.  Market sentiment which has neither sympathy nor memory reflected that in its opinion.  I was glad to see that early in January the National Treasury Management Agency was able to go back to the markets at a very acceptable rate and as a consequence was able to reduce its requirements for 2014, and has been in a position to have funding for the country to the end of the first quarter of 2015 without having to go to the markets at all.  That has been reflected very favourably by business and by international market sentiment.</p> <p>As I have said on many occasions, credit is due to the people, who have put up with many challenges and difficulties in recent years.  They understand that this has been part of the process of exiting the bailout programme while maintaining our momentum towards the achievement of the targets we must meet as we try to put a shape on the public finances and get the country back to work.</p><p> I was also asked about sustainability.  Obviously, our debt-to-GDP ratio is very high.  That is why it was significant that there was a small primary surplus in the budget announced by the Minister for Finance.  Clearly, the question of banking union is still a matter of deep discussion at European level.  Further meetings of senior officials will take place later this month.  It was always signalled that the decision of 29 June 2013 would be considered by the European Council towards the back end of 2014, when banking union and all of that is in place.  We have had the stress tests in respect of the assets of our banks.  They have measured up in that regard.  The same opinion will apply in terms of the European stress tests to be conducted on all banks in the autumn of this year.  As a result of the changes made with regard to the promissory note - the extension of loan maturities and the interest rate reduction - a significant amount of money will not have to be borrowed.  While that helps us in a way, we are still left with significant challenges up ahead in any event.</p><p> It is difficult to describe the international trading situation to Deputy Higgins in the context of the possibilities that exist for Ireland.  I was in Japan before Christmas on foot of the invitation that was extended by Prime Minister Abe.  I had a long series of meetings in Tokyo and Osaka.  Clearly, the Japanese Government, on the instruction of the Prime Minister and with his consent, was happy to lift the restrictions on beef going into the Japanese market.  As the Deputy knows, this was restricted in the case of Ireland since the BSE crisis over ten years ago.  We estimate that the Japanese market is worth approximately &euro;15 million.  It will have to be built up from a base again.  Specific cuts are of real interest and value to the Japanese people.  A significant number of Irish meat producers were in Tokyo to see at first hand the exact requirements of the Japanese authorities in this regard.</p><p> I was accompanied on my trip to Japan by representatives of many companies and I met many Irish business people while I was there.  This would suggest that there is serious potential in terms of jobs.  It is not like it used to be.  In many of these cases, the people in question are able to monitor and supervise the progress being made from Ireland.  As a result, there are jobs at home and there is real value abroad.  I met 15 or 16 young engineers in Osaka who are working for Mitsubishi.  They are there by choice.  They are working on turbines for gas-generating stations.  Some of their work would apply here in Ireland.  It is a big experience for them to work in companies of that magnitude.  They will be able to bring that experience back to Ireland with them when the time comes.</p><p> I was in the Gulf states - Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Qatar - last week.  I was accompanied by representatives of 87 Irish companies who went there intending to gain new business or further existing business.  We should look at the impact made by Glenbeigh, for instance.  Philip Earle from Dublin has built a new unit for record storing and data collection at the entrance to the new Al Maktoum International Airport, which will cater for 120 million passengers a year.  That project is being supervised and monitored from the company's headquarters in Dublin.  There is significant potential for the number of jobs associated with it to grow in the time ahead.  I also met Tim Clark of Emirates, which is doubling its number of flights coming in here on the basis of its assessment of the Irish market.  When taken with the flights already offered by Etihad, this means that from September there will be 24 flights a week from Dublin to the Gulf states.  That is very significant.  Qatar is also interested in dealing with Shannon Airport.</p><p> It is clear that a series of Irish companies have done serious business or are in the process of following up on that.  All of the 600 people I met in Dubai are there because they want to do business.  Obviously, many of them want to come back after they have gained some experience.  Saudi Arabia is in a slightly different position.  It is the 19th largest economy in the world.  It has a 2.7% debt and &euro;700 billion in reserves.  It has allocated &euro;57 billion for education in 2014, in terms of colleges and buildings.  A number of Irish people who have worked in the education sector are in Saudi Arabia to give advice on elements of the educational area.  I discussed questions relating to Syria, including the implications for the general region of what is happening there, with the Crown Prince.  I said that Saudi Arabia has been a very moderate voice in the pursuit of peace globally and regionally.  I also made the point that Saudi Arabia has been elected to-----</p></speech>

The Deputy might well laugh, but that is the forum for dealing with issues where human rights are concerned.  The question of human rights in the general region was raised in those discussions.  I have to say directly to the Deputy that Irish business people from 87 Irish companies, who want to do business in Saudi Arabia and in the Gulf states, were there because they believe they can create jobs here and in those areas.  I make no apology for assisting them in their efforts to further job creation and grow our economy through what they do here.</p><p>  It was quite a nostalgic and emotional moment for many when I had the opportunity to visit the Messines Ridge and the peace tower.  This memorial was put together by Paddy Harte and Glen Barr many years ago.  I visited many locations and scenes associated with what took place between 1914 and 1918.  I saw the place where the German troops sang "Silent Night" and were responded to by the Allies.  The local primary school choir sang "Silent Night" in the same spot while I was there.  I saw many headstones with Irish names and I visited the Menin Gate, which commemorates over 50,000 soldiers, including three brothers from Dublin, who went missing in action and whose resting places were never found.  I think this made an impact on me and on the British Prime Minister.  I went to see the solitary grave of Willie Redmond, who was an MP for 32 years.  He made the point, with regard to the 36th and 10th divisions, that we should think about the kind of country we could have if the joint spirit shown by Protestants and Catholics in fighting in the war could be united in the country.</p> <p>We still talk about that issue, even arising from the recent Haass talks, and I believe the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, was struck by the impact of it.  Visiting the peace tower, I was certainly struck by the symbolism of the instructions given by an Irish Army officer in respect of the protocol for the laying of wreaths and what was to be done.  The Prime Minister subsequently visited a number of graves where members of his family, back along the line, are laid to rest.  <br />In the context of the obscenity that was the First World War, it is important that people understand the implications of the book, <i>The Sleepwalkers</i>, which addressed the decisions taken by European countries subsequent to 1918 that led, if one likes, to the circumstances that erupted in the 1930s and resulted in the Second World War.  This is clearly the reason we have the European Union.  Irrespective of the arguments or discussions we may have, a European Union is needed for these reasons and in order that we never again witness the slaughter of 60 million people.  If members have not visited Flanders, it is worth making a personal journey to see the names of young Irish people on the headstones, soldiers of the Great War who were lost in battle.  They are not only just statistics but feature the names and addresses of people from Deputy Higgins's county, my county and every other county.  I spoke to teachers who have brought students to Flanders over the years.  This was my first visit and it made a powerful impact.  It is a reason for engaging in discussion and negotiation on many matters. <br />In respect of the Moriarty tribunal, the reason provision is made for costs is that the sole member has indicated he expects the costs to be finalised very quickly.  I have outlined for Deputy Higgins the different methods for assessing costs.  I hope the matter will be finalised by the sole member as quickly as possible.  </p></speech>

The main purpose of the meetings this week is to conduct hearings that will enable the joint committee to compile a report that will be submitted to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  As members will know, the Department is carrying out a review of foreign policy and external relations.  Before Christmas the committee agreed to invite four individuals to make presentations that will assist us in compiling a report.  <br />Today we will meet Mr. Denis Staunton, deputy editor, <i>The Irish Times, </i>and Mr. Graham Butler, University of Copenhagen.  The format of today's meeting is that the two contributors will separately make presentations to the committee and their presentations will be followed by a question and answer session.<br />I welcome Mr. Denis Staunton who has previously held many posts with <i>The Irish Times</i>.  He was its foreign editor.  He has also worked as its Washington correspondent and as its European correspondent based in Brussels and Berlin.  He has a wealth of experience from the media world, particularly in foreign affairs.  I compliment <i>The Irish Times</i>on its work and coverage of foreign affairs issues.  It does a comprehensive job on world news which is important for us on the committee.  We thank Mr. Stanton for continuing the good work by reporting what happens globally which is very important.  I ask him to make his presentation which shall be followed by a question and answer session.</p></speech>

As the Chairman mentioned, <i>The Irish Times</i>is the only news organisation on this island to sustain a global network of foreign correspondents, including staff correspondents in a number of capitals and full-time correspondents in various other capitals and a whole network throughout the world.  It is a big investment for a small newspaper in difficult economic times but we are committed to it because we believe it is essential, now more than ever, for the Irish public to be informed about and to better understand the world beyond our shores.  In an increasingly networked world, events and decisions far away can have a powerful and immediate impact on citizens here, not least on their economic circumstances.  This is particularly important given what we have seen over the past few years, as apparent certainties of the Cold War have given way to a new multi-polar global order.  Therefore, various places that may once have seemed remote or peripheral to our interests have become central to them.  The foreign policy review offers a welcome and timely opportunity to consider whether Government policy and the conduct of external relations ought to change in any way in order to take account of changed circumstances.  <br />As a foreign correspondent in Berlin, Brussels and Washington and reporting at various stages from almost all of the countries of the European Union, parts of the Middle East and throughout North America, I have had the opportunity to observe Irish diplomacy at close quarters.  Much of my brief remarks here will be devoted to the conduct of Irish diplomacy and how it might best adapt to ensure that it remains as effective as possible.<br />The purpose of Irish foreign policy is the same as it always has been, namely, to promote Ireland&rsquo;s interests and values abroad.  There can be a perceived tension between the State&rsquo;s interests and its values but they should not be in conflict.  Although economic diplomacy is increasingly important for Ireland as well as for other countries, it is a mistake to imagine that activities that have no apparent commercial benefit, such as promoting human rights, supporting efforts at disarmament and playing a full role in multilateral institutions such as the United Nations and the OSCE, are purely altruistic.  As a small country, it is in our interest to support a rules-based global order, and respect for human rights and the rule of law are not only right in themselves but contribute to this country&rsquo;s image in the world.<br />The most dramatic geopolitical changes in recent years have been the rise of China and the remarkable economic advance of other previously poor countries in Asia, particularly, and in Latin America.  These changes have been matched by the relative decline of the United States and Europe as their share of global output has reduced.  The changes create major challenges particularly for a small, poorly funded foreign service such as ours, which has traditionally been staffed by gifted generalists rather than specialists.  Since the foundation of the State, Ireland has been fortunate in that the interlocutors that have been most important to us have either shared our language - as in Britain and the United States - or else in Europe have shared deep and long-standing cultural links which we have benefited from up until now.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the rising powers in Asia which remain unfamiliar linguistically and culturally.<br />The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is highly unusual among foreign services in offering no incentives to learn languages &ndash; either in pay or promotion.  Most other services pay annual allowances for language proficiency with harder languages, such as Chinese and Arabic, earning a bigger bonus.  Some of the bonuses run to a few thousand euro a year in many of the European places.  Many other services also take language proficiency and cultural knowledge into account for promotion.  They do not simply base promotion on standard, conventional and managerial skills.  Other services have a list of postings where ambassadors and other senior diplomats must be proficient in the local language before taking up appointment.  If our diplomats are to be effective, particularly in unfamiliar cultures and in small embassies where they often operate on their own and take on multiple responsibilities, they must be equipped with the requisite language skills.  This means paying for full-time language training which means a year in the case of the harder languages and rewarding those who achieve and maintain language proficiency.</p></speech>

The other big issue relates to embassies and representation abroad.  About a decade ago many countries were shrinking their embassy networks.  They thought that technological and other changes would make traditional diplomacy obsolete.  In fact the opposite has turned out to be the case.  The past few years have seen many countries, including our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, opening new embassies and consulates around the world.  Our Government needs to do the same, not least because many of the countries with which we want to increase trade place a very high value on formal government-to-government contacts and embassies play a key role in facilitating business and trade deals.  An expansion of the embassy network in Asia and Latin America cannot, however, come at the expense of our diplomatic presence in Europe and the United States.</p> <p>Deeper political and economic integration in Europe has made it more important than ever to have an Irish presence in all European Union capitals.  After all, each of these countries can vote on matters of great importance to Irish citizens.</p><p> This year's planned referendum on Scottish independence and a possible future vote on British membership of the European Union have introduced an element of constitutional uncertainty to the politics of the United Kingdom.  Any change in the constitutional order there could not only affect Ireland's interest within the European Union but could undermine the stability of the constitutional settlement in Northern Ireland, with unpredictable consequences for the whole island.</p><p> In the United States of America a tiny Irish diplomat staff is not only dealing with the regular bilateral issues and the by-now traditional issues of Northern Ireland and immigration but also important new matters such as the US policy on tax avoidance and evasion.  Ireland has enjoyed a remarkable level of access to legislators and policymakers on Capitol Hill and in successive US Administrations.  This is a source of great envy to other European countries represented in Washington.  Some people in Ireland may be under the impression that such access happens of its own accord or that it is a product of our unusual charm as a people.  In fact, it is the result of years of cultivation of a vast network of relationships.  These relationships must be constantly renewed and supplemented by our already overstretched diplomats.</p><p> This brings me to the Irish diaspora, an invaluable resource throughout the world but one that should be cultivated rather than simply exploited.  If one spends any time with the Irish abroad one sees quickly that they know a great deal more about us than we know about them.  Yet most of our efforts to engage them are focused on pumping out more and more information about ourselves and letting them know what they can do to help us.  It might be worth occasionally allowing the traffic to move the other way and to offer them something, like a vote in some elections, perhaps, rather than simply identifying the wealthiest and most obviously useful and exploiting their goodwill.</p><p> It is not only the embassies that are overstretched.  The hollowing out of the Department's headquarters at Iveagh House means that even if the money is found to send a diplomat abroad to study a language for a long period, often, there is no one suitable available to cover for the job that the diplomat had been doing.  In the same way, secondments to international organisations, like the United Nations or the European External Action Service, can be problematic and can put an intolerable strain on resources at home.  Many of the Irish officials who went to work in the European institutions in the early years of our EU membership are now approaching retirement age.  We should be working in a focused way to encourage Irish officials to work there.</p><p> Meagre resources at Iveagh House have a further impact on our diplomatic relations.  There are not enough staff to cultivate relationships properly with the foreign diplomatic corps in Dublin, some of whom believe they have a lack of access both to Department officials and politicians in Dublin.  This produces a major wasted opportunity to increase the effectiveness of our bilateral relationships, particularly with smaller EU member states, by engaging more intensively with diplomats here.</p><p> Another issue, as far as Iveagh House is concerned, is the need for a dedicated policy unit to formulate policy in a long-term way.  Again, Iveagh House does not have such a unit but it should.  The committee will have noticed that none of the changes I have advocated will be possible unless the Government decides to spend more money on diplomacy.  However, I maintain that in a world where the global influences the domestic so powerfully and immediately, it would be money well spent.</p></speech>

I will ask you one question briefly before I hand over to Deputy Brendan Smith.  You remarked in your introduction on the small number of diplomatic staff we have in the United States.  I have been to most of the consular offices and the Washington office as well.  Given the big geographical area in the United States, from east to west and from north to south, there are areas where we lack consular offices.  Let us consider Texas, which is almost the size of France and a country in itself, as well as various other states.  Where do you see potential to establish more consular offices in the United States?</p><p>  People talk a good deal about Asia at the moment and say it is the place to do business.  Jakarta and Bangkok are mentioned as places where we do not have a diplomatic presence.  Is it better to have a small network of embassies than no embassies?  For example, is a one-man embassy with one local staff member better than none?  Is it better to have a presence anyway rather than have no presence?</p><p>  At the end of your contribution you referred to Iveagh House not cultivating enough of a relationship with diplomats.  The members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade have a special relationship with the foreign diplomats based here.  We meet them on a regular basis and they come to meetings regularly as well.  It is an area that is working well.  You can answer my questions with those of Deputy Smith.</p></speech>

My apologies for missing the earlier part of the meeting.  I was at another committee meeting.  I welcome Mr. Staunton.  In his closing remarks he referred to Irish officials being seconded to international organisations and so on.  From my limited experience in government, officials were invaluable to Departments, especially those who had experience in the European Commission, the European Parliament or the Council.  They could bring back important corporate knowledge, friendships and the ability to network, valuable resources when working towards decisions and trying to influence decision-making at Commission level, especially at official level.  Mr. Staunton made an important point in that regard.</p><p>  Reference was made to a vote for the diaspora in elections.  The Seanad must be reformed and the Members of the Seanad have always maintained that.  Is Mr. Staunton of the opinion that we should have particular representation for members of the diaspora, rather than simply a vote for them?</p><p>  What happens under EU enlargement?  If Turkey joins the EU will the sphere of influence shift dramatically in Europe in a more easterly direction than in the past?</p><p>  What is Mr. Staunton's view on the United Nations, its architecture, its make-up at Security Council level and its ineffectiveness in many respects when dealing with many of the humanitarian disasters that occur, unfortunately, on a regular basis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1641" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis Staunton" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014011600005#E00400"><p>Deputy Smith suggested the possibility of representation for the diaspora.  It is a good idea and there is no question but that in the networked world in which we operate now, having more than 2 million people, or thereabouts, who hold Irish passports and who live abroad is advantageous.  Having such a vast reservoir of potential contacts and networks is remarkably valuable.  However, we cannot keep taking from these people and yet not offer them some kind of say or representation.  We cannot keep telling them that they are altogether important to us and yet make no concrete gesture to show that this is the case.</p><p>  Deputy Smith spoke of the value of representation in the EU institutions.  It is true that we have people picking up expertise and bringing it back but it is also useful for a country to have its nationals represented in those institutions because they are points of contact.  They can help to pursue our interests, while not in any sense compromising their primary loyalty to the institutions they serve.</p><p>  Deputy Smith is correct to ask whether any shift in EU enlargement tends to shift the centre of gravity to some extent.  However, it appears to me that Turkish accession is some distance away.  Therefore, I do not believe the period this policy review is dealing with, that is, the medium term, is one we will have to think about too carefully in that regard.</p><p>  Reference was made to outreach to the diplomatic corps based in Dublin.  There is no lack of enthusiasm on the part of Irish diplomats.  It is simply a lack of resources; there are not enough staff to do the job.  Let us suppose we are dealing with a small country where, perhaps, we have a one-person embassy.  Then we have two major points of contact.  One is our embassy there and the other is that country's embassy here.  If we are not exploiting fully the opportunities offered by that country having representation here and engaging with the people concerned, then we are missing an opportunity.</p><p>  The Chairman referred to our network in the USA.  He is correct to suggest that Texas would be a good place to start in terms of expansion and there are other places we could go as well.  However, the most important and acute need is in Washington.</p> <p>Not only is the Administration there with all its departments, there are also more than 600 members of Congress.  Many of these issues are very complicated and time-consuming.  If, for example, Ireland were to be designated a tax haven by the US Congress, which has not happened partly due to successful Irish lobbying in Washington, for the sake of paying for an extra couple of diplomats or officials over there, would that be a prudent saving?  I do not think it would be.</p><p> Finally, the Chairman asked, in respect of expanding in Asia, whether it was better to have a large number of embassies or to have a certain scale.  I think it is possible for an embassy to be too small.  Some of the very small embassies we have in Europe are probably too small to function as full service embassies.  Any Irish representation will have a duty and an obligation to take care of any Irish citizen in trouble, and there is an important reporting and representational function where EU matters are concerned, so that does not leave much capacity to do much more if an embassy consists of one person and one member of local staff.  In fact, it does not provide much capacity to do even that.  If we are planning any expansion of embassies, then the experiences of other small states, most of which have got better funded and better resourced foreign services than we have, are that embassies can be too small.</p></speech>

I think it was a mistake to close the embassy to the Holy See.  I do not think that these embassies should be opened or closed for sentimental reasons.  I think it is a matter of national interest.  The reason given was that it was a question of cost.  It is difficult to argue that if people say that was the reason it was closed.  However, given the influence the Catholic Church continues to exert in our society, regardless of whether one likes that, it seems to me to be a good idea to have one of our representatives there to let us know what is going on.</p></speech>

It is a critique and that is very welcome.  It is not a lot of blather, and I welcome the fact that <i>The Irish Times</i>continues to sustain a network of international correspondents around the globe.  It has thinned down a bit over the past while, but it is very welcome and I would like Mr. Staunton to pass back to the newspaper that the committee welcomes this continuation.  So many newspapers, including <i>The Irish Times</i>sometimes, have gone in the lifestyle direction and they are more about how to get fat or thin, what to cook or how to go skiing and so on.  Some people might be interested in that, but I certainly am not.<br />One of the things that is most important is the question of language training.  That is fundamental, even as a question of courtesy.  People welcome so much the fact that our diplomats will have taken the opportunity, the time and trouble to learn the language.  If diplomats are there for communication, how can they do it efficiently if they do not have the language?  It should be a prerequisite.  This committee might draft some kind of resolution, if people agree, that we strongly support the Minister if he is looking for extra money and some of the other-----</p></speech>

The next thing is the observation that people thought they were going into the machine age and that everything would be done by twiddleometers, as it were, and other things.  I am delighted Mr. Staunton indicated that human contact is vital.  We are losing it all over the place.  We are losing it in our banks.  They do not want people; they want machines and more machines all the time.  It does not work and it alienates people.  That must be also true in the case of diplomacy.<br />Mr. Staunton spoke very effectively about our representation in Washington and how valuable it was, and that we have this idea that just because we are lovely, chirpy people, we are loved everywhere, which is all rubbish.  It is hard work by diplomats and so on.  However, I find that every time there is a change of Government, the Opposition will criticise the visits, the costs, the expenses and so on for days like St. Patrick's Day.  I think they are immensely valuable and I wonder if we could make that clear and ask people who are in the Opposition not to be harping on about this for their own personal and party political gain, because it is a really valuable thing.  Mr. Staunton mentioned the diaspora.  We all have had appeals from people in the diaspora, including in Argentina.  They have their own newspaper and an old hurling club.  They have ached to get involved in Ireland and we have spurned them.  They are a resource.<br />I agree 100% with Mr. Staunton's idea of establishing a policy unit, and it would be worthwhile engraving on our notepaper the statement that although economic diplomacy is increasingly important for Ireland as well as other countries, it is a mistake to imagine that activities that have no apparent commercial benefit, such as promoting human rights, supporting efforts at disarmament and playing a full role in multilateral institutions such as the UN and the OECD, are purely altruistic.   It is in our interest.  That is a very important point.  We should bear that in mind.<br />Due to that statement and the network of people in <i>The Irish Times</i>, would it not be appropriate to concentrate a little bit more on situations that are delicate, such as Tibet?  Tibet is such a huge issue, not just in terms of human rights and the self-immolation of the Buddhist monks and so on, but also in terms of the utter destruction of natural resources.  Now might be a good time to do this, because the Chinese are relaxing some of their policies on forced labour camps and re-education.  If there is a space in <i>The Irish Times</i>-----</p></speech>

There was another committee meeting on at the same time.  I read Mr. Staunton's submission and the points he made are important in the context of the review which is taking place.  The references to the diaspora are important.  While I do not agree with the suggestion on voting, something we discussed over many years, I strongly agree with Mr. Staunton's point about identification with the diaspora in a way that is seen to recognise their position, and in a way that is helpful to them rather than exploitative of them.  Anything we do in that area is recognition of some degree of responsibility for them.  That is the way it should be, because if were running our show in the way it should be run, we would not have had such a large diaspora accumulate over the years.  One of the things we need to learn is how to plan our economy in the future to ensure fewer people are forced to go abroad.  If people wish to go of their own accord, then in the modern world we must provide for that.</p><p>  One of the things we have learned in recent years is that the diaspora have become very influential abroad.  It was in the recent times of difficulty that we recognised the full extent of their importance.  It was acknowledged by the former President Mary Robinson that we needed to recognise the existence of our diaspora and that we had an ongoing responsibility for them, rather than resiling from them and pretending they did not exist until we unexpectedly heard from them at Christmas and such times.</p> <p>It is crucially important that is done.</p><p> On the issue of embassies, I have always held the view that the diplomatic service has an important role to play.  It reflects the image of the country, the integrity, role and values of the country and can impart those values on the international arena in a way which is beneficial to the country and also in a way that nobody else can.  It is important to remember that we have been blessed with the calibre of the people who know their job and do it well.  Internationally, they are recognised easily.  Anywhere one goes one will find recognition for the Irish diplomat in a way that is not always evident and obvious with others.  </p><p> The role of the diplomatic service now in the context of foreign policy will be greater than in the past.  The world is a much smaller place.  Travel times have shrunk enormously.  What happens here in the morning happens in a couple of hours' time in another part of the globe.  We need to gear ourselves for the modern era, the digital era for want of a better description, in terms of our foreign policy.  </p><p> I mentioned previously about Ireland being a neutral country.  Once upon a time we used to preface all our remarks that Ireland was a neutral country as if we were second-class citizens.  I am glad to note that, generally speaking, we do not do that any more.  There is a significant improvement in that area.  We have a very important and meaningful role to play on the international stage and that can be done by simply stating our case as we are and being positive on the global stage.  That can be done in terms of trade, for which the Department has responsibility, to a greater extent.  I recognise it was stated yesterday by Mr. Noel Dorr that was always the case, but there is a greater emphasis on it now, and there has to be because the greater need arose in the past few years.  As a result of that greater need, it gives us a great opportunity in this review to push all the buttons, in the type of situation referred to by Senator David Norris and others, and to point out all the areas in which we think we can improve and raise the bar that little bit more.  That would be hugely beneficial to ourselves as a country, our diaspora and the international community. </p><p> I mentioned yesterday that our peacekeeping forces were recognised worldwide.  They are recognised as being experts in that particular area.  In the same way our trading sectors have shown in the past couple of years that when called upon, they can do as well as anywhere else in the world and better.  Instead of being negative and resiling from the situation that presents itself, each Department, the diplomats and the progressive sectors of the media have all risen to the occasion.  I will not refer to the individual medial outlets other than to congratulate them.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Norris for his remarks about <i>The Irish Times</i>coverage.  I am sorry he does not like the skiing sections.<br />With regard to St. Patrick's Day, he is absolutely right that it is an extraordinary opportunity.  I was in Washington for four years.  There is not a single other country, even its largest and closest allies, that has an annual appointment with the President and with the Speaker of the House.  The number of hours the Taoiseach spends with the President that day is utterly ludicrous.  Years ago, I recall speaking to a lobbyist in Washington and asking how much he charged to arrange that and he said he charged $2 million but that he would not be able to deliver it.  It is something that money cannot buy.  The idea that we should complain about our officials going there, given that, through no fault of our own, it is something from which we benefit, seems absurd.</p></speech>

I mention the fact that one of the difficulties is that even if a decision were to be made, say, to send somebody away for a year for full-time training in Arabic or whatever, because of the staffing shortage, it would be quite difficult to find somebody to do his or her job here or wherever the person was located.  The other issue is that of valuing diplomacy as a profession.  It is a very good thing that people from the Department of Foreign Affairs spend time in other Departments and people from other Departments spend time in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The fact is that diplomats require a particular skill set which is unique to the job they do and they are not interchangeable with other public servants.  It probably does involve more than simply funding the language training.  The British Foreign Office recently increased its language training budget by 30% and has reopened its language school which it had closed down.  There is no reason we could not benefit from the fact that it has a language school nearby and available to us and, perhaps, that is one of those areas of British-----</p></speech>

We have a responsibility towards people who are not influential and who are connected with us.  It is also the case that those who were not influential can be influential in the future.  One of the occasions I remember that - it was most moving - was during one of the visits by Mrs. Mary McAleese to the US when she visited Butte, Montana, where many Irish people had gone to work in tin mines a century or more ago.  These people sent money back to Ireland for many years.  After the Second World War the tin mines closed and in the past few decades the place has become quite impoverished.  She arrived at a town that was defeated and demoralised.  Her presence there, even though the people were not terribly influential, was so effective, so powerful, and so welcome and made me feel very happy and proud as an Irishman.</p></speech>

I have read his paper.  I will start with the last part, which states that none of what he says is of any use unless financial resources are available.   He was critical of the decision to close the embassy in the Holy See.  We also closed the embassies in Timor and Tehran.  I am concerned that we may quickly forget the economic crisis experienced by this country and the obligation on a Department to take its portion of cuts, just as every other Department did, and that this is the background to the closures.  To this day, it still strikes me as incongruous that we have an embassy in Rome but for some silly old formula, applied by the Vatican, one cannot use the same building for servicing the issues of the Holy See even though we have an embassy in Rome, right beside the Vatican.</p><p>  One will notice, as politicians around this table, particularly at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, more in the past than at present, that they have worked closely with the committee around the Irish Aid end of things and the poor blacks in Africa suffering from starvation and how we respond to world events, emergency aid and so on.  The Irish Aid element was more prominent in the past that it is now.</p> <p>With the add on of trade to responsibilities of the Department of Foreign Affairs - we are all politicians, none with a business background -  none of the staff who manages this committee is a specialist in trade, does Mr. Staunton have an opinion on whether the discussion on restructuring and policy review might eliminate the trade element?  One is reading in the newspapers every other day of the week reports of those on trade missions.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, is on a trade mission, the T&aacute;naiste is also out on trade missions.  Everybody is on trade missions.  Is there an umbrella?  Are we the umbrella?  Who is handling trade?  Is the trade portfolio appropriate to the work on foreign affairs?  I know there is a very important link between trade activities and embassies run by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Call a spade a spade, I do not think those of us around this table focus very much on the trade element of the structure of the &quot;Joint Committee of Foreign Affairs and Trade&quot;.  What is Mr. Staunton's opinion on that?<br />Mr. Staunton's paper was fascinating in so far as for the first time I have discovered that those whom I hold in the highest of esteem are the diplomatic corps, having interacted with them throughout the world.  When we had an embassy in Tehran, the ambassador spoke Farsi, in our embassy in Beijing, the ambassador speaks Mandarin, but they receive no incentive payments.  That is absolutely disgraceful.  If we are considering a policy review, I argue most strongly that the ability of our diplomatic corps to work in countries that speak Spanish, French and Asian languages is that staff go to the personal trouble of learning a language on top of their duties as professional diplomats.  They then should be rewarded.  It is an important stage in the development of Ireland <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the rest of the world because it has been pointed out that the West and America are in decline.  I have argued this point before.  The area of economic growth is Asia, mainly led by China.  Our education system must be seriously at fault.  We have bilateral agreements with many countries and invariably embassy officials will tell us about the quota of 500 students who may go to Mexico and <i>vice versa</i>.  Almost all non-English speaking countries with which we have student exchange programmes are taken up by the non-English speaking students.  Ireland is abysmal in sending our quota of students to these countries.  I often use as a comparison the parallel between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the international office in Dublin City Council.  It might be worth noting that Dublin City Council is twinned with Beijing.  As part of the memorandum of understanding three officials from the Beijing local authority have worked in Dublin City Council for ten weeks.  They have just returned home.  I would hazard a guess that it will be impossible for Dublin City Council to send three local authority staff to Beijing.  This is what should be done.  We must do it.<br />I have engaged with the OSCE as a short-term election monitor and am familiar with some of the countries that we often criticise around this table.  Let us take Ukraine as an example.  So many of these countries that are learning democracy give their citizens a vote through their embassies overseas.  I used to think simplistically that would be the solution to our engagement with the diaspora.  Let me put a question because the witness suggests that nothing can happen unless extra resources are available.  How do we use the resources?  What resources are we to use to engage with our diaspora?  What would it cost to try to facilitate the Irish in America to partake in a voting system?  The paperwork is significant.  The embassies are already undermanned.  Would that be the best approach, or should we adopt the French system, where by a French citizen in Ireland, Ms H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Conway-Mouret would have engaged with the French in England and Ireland and was elected to the Senate initially and now a Minister?  Is that a better way or should we be resourcing and supporting the GAA, which has a phenomenal engagement with the diaspora throughout the world?  I remember being in Milwaukee which has and a major Irish musical festival.  Should thaspora?e concept of working through Irish organisations abroad be encouraged as the way to look after our diaspora?<br />We have been debating the question of where to target resources for a long time.  We keep mentioning the BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia, India and China.  The members of this committee will visit India sometime this year.<br />A decision was taken on economic grounds to close three embassies.  It is vital to build up a network.  Are we trying to be bigger than we actually are?  Is it possible to develop in the way we desire and build a network of well resourced embassies in the present climate?</p></speech>

I will be careful not to overly repeat what has been said already.  I believe the activities of all of our embassies are very important in presenting an image of Ireland abroad.  I can give examples of how important this role is.  The importance of making links at government level with other member states helped to bring about some positive developments for this country.  That was actively done by the Government.  One can generalise that argument in a broader sense in terms of our international relations with other countries and other people, not alone for trade but for other policy areas, such as human rights and international relations.  There are sensitivities.  Quite often we experience the need for delicacy.  Last week we had a trade delegation to the Middle East and there was some controversy around it.  There are sensitivities around it as well.</p><p>  The representatives of the chambers of commerce were very emphatic when they appeared before the committee that no Minister should be in Ireland to celebrate St. Patrick's Day.  It offers such an opportunity to promote trade and business with this country.  Does Mr. Staunton have a view on whether the embassy in the Vatican should be reopened?  We have much contact with the Republic of China, Taipei.  Obviously we do not have diplomatic relations, as there are international reasons for not having them, but there is a friendship with their very good diplomats.  Has Mr. Staunton a view on how that relationship could be developed?  Has he information on how relations are developing between the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China?</p></speech>

Will they consider what role Parliament could have and, in particular, a role for this committee?</p></speech>

We have no negative colonial past.  People seem to like our sense of humour and our music.  We are not seen as a threat or not perceived as people with a hidden agenda.</p><p>  It can be argued that we have a small pot of money to invest in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It is a question of how best to use the available resources.</p> <p> People spoke about the three embassies which were closed, ostensibly for financial reasons but I would argue the Iranian closure was probably more to do with global politics rather than financial reasons.  The closure of the Vatican Embassy was probably due to other reasons also.  I suppose a way around that would be an opening in the Vatican.  That would probably be the simplest way around it and it would save a lot of money.  One could probably argue there are historical links with the building there but at a time when this country is supposed to be on its knees financially, perhaps it is one of the buildings we should consider selling off and perhaps investing in something else.  There is an advantage to owning rather than renting.  However, this country faces fiscal problems.  I do not know how people would feel if we started to open embassies all over the world if there is not some sort of financial benefit, trade benefit or otherwise.  It must be done sensibly and slowly and explained to people.</p><p> The United States, St. Patrick's Day and the amount of work involved was mentioned.  I was there recently and spoke to different groups, some of which were quite critical.  In the past, the embassy - this probably applies not only to the embassy in the United States - was not doing enough in terms of outreach.  We were relying on the same individuals, such as the "Ted Kennedys" in the United States, and we needed to reach out to the new kids on the block, such as the Tea Party, and that we need to build up a profile.  I suppose that is one of the positives we found in terms of immigration reform.  We are pushing right out and are going to the mid-west, the south and into virgin territory in terms of Irish connections.  There is the Scots Irish connection also.</p><p> Could we do the same in other countries?  We have a large diaspora in Argentina, where there are people with German and Spanish backgrounds.  We need to use that goodwill and the diaspora as perhaps a listening posts in terms of what is happening in countries in regard to politics, the economy and so on.  Is there any way to tie them in?  Again, there would not be a huge cost factor.  </p><p> What was said about language jumps out.  There should be opportunities but I am not sure about the monetary aspect.  If people have languages, I would like to think they would move up the ranks more quickly in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  There needs to be a mechanism for people to learn languages but I would be horrified if I thought somebody in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had to pay for language classes.  If that is the case, it needs to be looked at.</p><p> I refer to the Scottish issue and the unpredictable consequences in terms of settlements and so on.  I would be more worried about a passive approach from the British and Irish Governments in regard to the North than the possible break up in regard to Scotland or Wales.  I would be interested to hear Mr. Staunton's views.</p><p> The importance of European matters was mentioned.  In terms of scrutiny, there is so much material coming out and one would not be able to go through all of the documents.  We are supposed to scrutinise such material.  A greater role for the Seanad in regard to scrutiny was mentioned yesterday.  Does Mr. Staunton have any ideas in regard to that? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1675" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014011600009#J00200"><p>Mr. Staunton may have covered some of the points I will raise and, if so, he can tell me and I will check the record later.  Through my membership of this committee and as head of the Irish section of AWEPA, I have had a number of dealings with our embassies in African countries, including Sierra Leone, Lesotho, Ghana and Mozambique, and I acknowledge and compliment the Irish embassy staff in each of those countries.  I am not saying anything about the other countries but they are the four about which I know and I have seen at first-hand the work they do.  Certainly in the case of Mozambique, several members of the staff in the embassy speak Portuguese which is a real advantage to them.</p><p>  I was part of the delegation which has just come back from Iran.  All those we met pointed out how disappointed they were that the Irish embassy closed.  It would make things much easier in terms of trade and human rights, which we discussed, if the embassy was reopened as soon as possible. </p><p>  The first question is a general one about Mr. Staunton's time working abroad.  How does he think Ireland is seen as an international actor?  I was interested in what he said about tax havens.  We have been seen as a tax haven and I do not think we are doing enough on the tax justice issue or have a strong enough voice for countries, in particular in Africa which are at the mercy of multinational companies which, for a variety of reasons, are not working the terms of agreements as they should to the benefit of those countries.  Sometimes it is due to lack of capacity but other times it is because of corruption.  We could be a stronger voice when it comes to companies paying their corporate tax.  </p><p>  On the debt issue, we have seen very immoral deals between African countries, the IMF and the World Bank, which have decimated native industries in some of those countries and have left them in really precarious positions.  Are we a strong enough voice in that regard?</p><p>  Yesterday, I asked Mr. Dorr if human rights and trade are compatible.  Do we ignore human rights when we look at trade agreements?  Should there not be an obligation on us, when we are negotiating trade agreements that, at the very least, workers' rights are included, whether decent working conditions or a decent wage?  They should be part of it.  I know it is something which the President, Michael D. Higgins, was very strong on when he was a member of this committee.  One hears the argument that if we are to trade, we have to forget about human rights.  I do not think we can but I would be interested to hear Mr. Staunton's opinion on that.</p><p>  We discussed the UN yesterday and I think the general conclusion was that it is the best we have got but its ineffectiveness is seen more and more, certainly on the political side.  We saw what happened in Bosnia and we said it would never happen again but it happened in Rwanda and again we said it would never happen again.  Look at what is happening in Syria now.  Where are the voices on that?  Ireland is on the UN Human Rights Council but can we do more?  I would be interested to hear Mr. Staunton's response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1676" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1159" speakername="Mark Daly" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014011600009#J00300"><p>I welcome Mr. Staunton.  He made some very valid points on the diaspora.  We seem to aim at the well-off and well-to-do and seem to have a policy of extracting as much as we can out of them and other than St. Patrick's Day, that is about it.</p><p>  I would like Mr. Staunton's view on extending the vote, on which he touched.  The Constitutional Convention seemed to pose a radical proposal to extend the vote in the presidential election.  However, of the 115 countries which give votes to their citizens overseas, only eight restrict it to presidential elections.  Of those eight, they are all executive presidents.  What Ireland proposes to do - I do not think we will do it in the lifetime of this Government - is to give the lowest expression of democratic representation to its citizens in the North and overseas in a presidential election.  The role of the President is largely ceremonial.  We talk about extending voting rights to our diaspora, and possibly a reformed Seanad would be a way to do that.  I do not believe Members of the D&aacute;il would allow membership to be decided on by anybody living outside their constituencies.</p><p>  I refer to the concept of a Minister or a junior Minister for the Irish overseas and the diaspora, possibly tied into trade.  Other countries have one.  Israel has moved that ministry into its prime minister's office, such is the importance it places on its diaspora.</p> <p>Countries with a large diaspora such as India and China have ministers for the diaspora.  We have one of the largest diasporas in the world, yet we do not have a Minister for the diaspora.  We have a Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade who deals with every issue in the world.  We have what Kingsley Aikins referred to as a national asset, yet we do not deploy enough resources to it.  We do not have a co-ordinating Minster who would be a touchstone for the diaspora.  If someone has an issue in Boston, he or she to go to the consulate, the consulate might have to refer it to the ambassador, the ambassador will bring it to the foreign affairs and Irish overseas sections, which might bring it to the Secretary General who might bring it to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Every citizen should have direct access to a Minister who is representing him or her.  Does Mr. Staunton believe that is something that should arise out of this White Paper, which would be a solid commitment by this Government, or any future Government, that Ministers would not just show up at meet and greet events on St. Patrick's Day?  I have always said that we should send out every Minister and every Minister of State on St. Patrick's Day.  As the witness would know in Washington, we have an opportunity that countries would give their first born to have in terms of our access to the American system but also the systems in Australia and New Zealand, which always welcome us.</p><p> I raise a smaller issue which the witness might respond to given his experience in Washington.   The Haass negotiations in the North have not been successful.  For the past two years we have not had a counterpart ambassador here.  Ambassador Rooney was an excellent ambassador who travelled to all counties.  I know there are many issues in Washington that have little to do with us and over which we have little control, but what effect is the lack of an appointment of a United States ambassador to Ireland having on us in terms of trying to resolve the issues in the North, and what effect is it having on investment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1678" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis Staunton" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014011600010#K00200"><p>To start with the last point, I am not sure it has made all that much difference whether a US ambassador is appointed.  From what I understand, and I am not there now but on the basis of visits I have made to the US and conversations I have had with people, I do not believe it has any meaning.  A number of other countries, including some large and important countries close to the United States, did not have an ambassador appointed for over a year.  It has been about two years here, and that is an unusually long period, but I do not believe it says anything about the US attitude towards Ireland.  Given there is a fairly effective US embassy in Dublin, I do not believe the lack of an appointment has made that much difference in terms of investment or anything like that.<br />On the general issue of the diaspora and the suggestion made by Senator Daly, and the various options Deputy Byrne and Deputy Crowe spoke about, I am not sure what the answer is with regard to what Ireland should do.  Many of the ideas put forward are very good.  It is a question of first evaluating, perhaps in this foreign policy review, the importance to us of this network of people and how we can best engage these people and give them some sense of ownership of what is happening here as well as calling on them to help us.<br />That brings me to the bigger point, and as Deputy Byrne suggested, it is the most difficult issue, namely, the business of money.  I would argue that we must have a whole of Government approach to the fact we are a country that exports everything we produce and imports almost everything we consume.  It is operating in an environment where global capital is not only global; it is mobile.  Everything is moving so fast in this particular way that it will be impossible for us to pursue our interests properly or govern ourselves as well as we should if we do not invest more in foreign representation.<br />To give the Senator another example, leaving aside issues of trade, there is the business of representation in European Union capitals.  Since the economic crisis, we have seen a massive and dramatic integration and pooling of sovereignty in the European Union, particularly on economic issues.  That simply means we share the mastery of our own fate with other people, and the voices of people in Tallinn, Riga, Prague, Copenhagen and Lisbon matter as much as the voices of those in many other countries.  I would argue that we should administer ourselves efficiently in the world we live in today.  We cannot operate the kind of budgetary policy with regard to foreign affairs that we would have operated 50 years ago because we live in a different world.  More of our world is connected with the rest of the world.<br />Deputy O'Sullivan spoke about the way we are perceived.  There is no question, and Deputy Crowe mentioned it, that we are fortunate in terms of the way we are perceived, generally speaking, around the world.  To those who are aware of it, the issue of tax, not just the traditional issue of the level of our corporate tax, and the discovery that major digital giants have been able to use our tax regime to effectively escape paying tax anywhere on vast sums, is damaging to our reputation.  I am pleased the Government has taken some action with regard to easing some of the most grievous elements of that regime but it is something of which we must be aware.<br />At the same time, the Deputy is right that our engagement in terms of development aid is to our benefit, not only in terms of the way we are perceived as a responsible actor in the world but also because many of the countries that have been our traditional aid partners are becoming more economically developed.  Without trying to tie our aid to trade, we can be beneficiaries of the fact that we have been investing resources within that area.<br />With regard to the embassies, if it were up to me, I am not sure I would have closed the Tehran embassy, but on the issue of the Holy See, there is curiosity with regard to the Vatican's rule whereby it insists we must have a separate ambassador.  I imagine that is because it expects if it did not, it would not have an embassy as countries would appoint the ambassador to Rome.  However, other countries have taken ingenious approaches to reducing the cost of having this embassy.  It is important, and it is not a question of how one views the influence of the Catholic Church in Ireland, that we should be in a position to monitor what is happening in the Vatican as closely as possible.  That may be more true now than ever that the Vatican appears to be going through something of a change.<br />To return to the question the Chairman posed on the role of parliamentarians, it is a very important one.  This committee plays an important role in holding the Government to account with regard to foreign policy but also in exploring issues such as those we have been discussing today.  The members also play an important role on behalf of the people in terms of their travels to other countries where they can learn first-hand what is happening, particularly in some of the more obscure countries that are under-reported, even in <i>The Irish Times</i>, and from where it is difficult to report in many cases.  It is also the issue the Chairman mentioned earlier about members making themselves available to representatives of other countries here.  That, too, can enhance our relationships with important partners.</p></speech>

I am not sure but on balance it is probably a welcome move to combine trade and foreign affairs.</p> <p>Sometimes one needs to get the embassy involved if one wants to make a trade deal.  Our relationships with many of the countries with which we trade are complicated.  What one does not want is somebody bulldozing in with some kind of commercial proposition which can upset a delicate balance that may be more important to our interests.  All in all, if they are not together, and I do not think that there is a problem in their being together, they need to work closely together.</p></speech>

I have distributed my paper, which is quite extensive.  I will speak to it rather than read it in full.  I listened carefully yesterday to some of the comments by Mr. Noel Dorr and Professor Ben Tonra and today to Mr. Staunton.  I hope their comments and mine will form part of the committee&rsquo;s submission to the review to be submitted in three weeks&rsquo; time.</p><p>  The three speakers before me have gone through the different elements of foreign policy on a broad spectrum.  I will focus on one issue, the parliamentary oversight and scrutiny by the Oireachtas, this committee and the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  There is no lack of appetite at this committee to be more involved in foreign policy, which is important.  When making the submission, there is no point in the committee&rsquo;s asking to be more involved if the committee is not willing to do the work that flows from that.</p><p>  I have brought here today the last White Paper the Department produced, in 1996.  It was the first and it has been 18 years since that review.  As the Chairman pointed out, I was quite young when it was produced.  It was entitled Challenges and Opportunities Abroad.  It is 350 pages long and references to the Oireachtas, the D&aacute;il, Seanad and committees are relatively few and far between.  There is one short chapter at the very end entitled Democratic Accountability of Foreign Policy.  At the end of last year, when the Department issued the public consultation document for the new review of foreign policy, although it was relatively short it did not refer to any new insight into parliamentary involvement in Irish foreign policy.  I hope that is not a sign that in the next White Paper the Department intends to move away from that, rather that it will incorporate it throughout the next document instead of sticking the parliamentary oversight into one chapter.</p><p>  I noticed from the 2012 work programme for this committee that &ldquo;the committee is committed to a constructive contribution to the committee system in the Houses of the Oireachtas and to continue to assert the proper oversight and accountability role of the Legislature in respect of the Executive&rdquo;.  This is very important for the committee.  This review is the perfect opportunity to move that expression forward.  The speaker before me pointed out that there are several things the committee already does, such as engaging in the scrutiny of EU proposals and communications, discussing policy issues of the Department and going through the long-term strategy goals.  It is involved in the protection and promotion of human rights, the accountability of the Irish Aid programme, the annual Vote allocation for the Department as part of the budgetary process, engagement with fellow parliamentarians from other EU member states and from states around the world, and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade comes here before the Foreign Affairs Council meeting to discuss that meeting.  The committee does all these things, which is much of what the Government policy document envisaged it doing, as set out in Chapter 16 of the last White Paper.  This committee had been formed only two and a half or three years before the White Paper was published, so it was in its infancy at that time.</p><p>  The new White Paper, whether it lasts for ten or 20 years, provides a good opportunity for the committee to envisage its involvement in the future and for setting out new ideas for what it could do, while continuing to do what it does already.  Yesterday, the Government produced its legislative programme for its spring and summer sessions.  There is no foreign policy legislation coming forward, which is not unusual.  Foreign policy is distinctly different from other public policy areas in that it is not based on legislation.  It has to be examined and scrutinised in other ways and this committee has a role in that scrutiny.  Foreign policy is Executive-dominated and so has to be scrutinised in a different way.</p><p>  My paper is approximately 7,000 words or 28 pages long.  I will pick a few items from it that I think the committee should prioritise.  First is the time between the dissolution of the D&aacute;il and the setting up of the committee in the next D&aacute;il.  Sometimes this can take six months, for example, in 2011 there was a change of Government.  The D&aacute;il was dissolved in January 2011.  The general election was held in February and the new Government was formed in March 2011.  There were Seanad elections in April, and in May some of the Senators were appointed.  The committee structure was set up in June.  It is not unusual to have a period of six months during which foreign policy, which is not based on legislation, does not have proper parliamentary oversight.  The problem that creates is that, although the Parliament may not be conducting its oversight, there is a Government throughout that period, the Civil Service continues its work, the EU does not stop working &ndash; it has 27 other member states to deal with - so there must be a new way to scrutinise foreign policy during those periods.  This affects other policy areas too, but because there is no legislation in the foreign policy area, it is particularly important.</p><p>  In the referendum tied in with the presidential election in October 2011, it was proposed to constitutionalise the Oireachtas committees.  As we all know, that was defeated for several reasons which I will not go into today.  The only reference in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann to Oireachtas committees is to the committees on privilege in each House.  There is absolutely no reference to a committee such as this one, a joint committee.  That makes them inherently weak if they do not have a constitutional base, which is quite different from the situation in some other member states.  The committee could consider this in the long term.  In Denmark, not only are some of the committees constitutionalised but also, since 1953, the foreign affairs committee has been enshrined within the constitution.</p><p>  We all know that the Minister comes in here before meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council and engages with members on upcoming proposals from some of his colleagues in Brussels or Luxembourg.  The Minister does not have to receive a mandate.  There is literally an exchange of views between members.  The committee cannot mandate a Minister or the Government to hold a position on certain things.  He can take the committee&rsquo;s advice on board and go with it or discard it.  After the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council, generally, the Minister does not come back into this committee and report on any of the workings or compromises he has made or on developments in particular areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1686" nospeaker="true" time="15:40:00" ><p>That does not happen.  Again, that is very different to the position in other EU member states in that they have to come forward and update members on some of the progression.  At the moment, after the Foreign Affairs Council meets once a month, the Minister comes in and talks about what will happen at the next meeting as opposed to what happened the last time.  It is different.  I know this poses some practical difficulties for the committee in terms of time, and there would be a lot more meetings.  For example, there are more committee meetings in this D&aacute;il term than ever before, which poses a problem, although nothing that cannot be looked at.</p><p>The other proposal which I believe should be prioritised is engaging ambassador-designates.  This is a new idea but it is standard practice in many other democracies.  For example, the committee spoke earlier about the way there has been no US ambassador to Ireland.  Of course, in the United States, when an ambassador is appointed to a country, that person has to appear before the foreign affairs committee of the United States Senate to be confirmed.  It is a good accountability mechanism and, in general, most people are confirmed without particular problems.  There may be some diplomats in Iveagh House who would choke at this idea of having their ambassadors appear before this committee before they are appointed, but I point out that this idea is not dissimilar to current Government policy where chairpersons-designate of State boards and public bodies appear before the respective sectoral committees.  It is not so much a confirmation process but an exchange of viewpoints before the person takes up his or her position.</p><p>It is something the committee could explore.  Again, there are practical issues.  Ireland has some 50 embassies, seven or eight consulates and a number of delegations to international institutions.  Obviously, it is not practical to have an exchange of views with every single one in public session, but there could be a starting point here for selecting a few important international institutions, like the EU and the UN, or some important trading partners that Ireland has close ties with, like the United Kingdom and the United States, in order to start the process.  It is nothing unusual and it might ruffle a few feathers, if anything.</p><p>The next point I will make is in regard to committee resources.  Over time, committee resources have generally increased.  In other member states there are some parliamentary committees that have resources to back them up that are as powerful as the Departments they oversee.  We all know this is not the case for the Oireachtas and, of course, the comparability of the Oireachtas is quite weak in all sectoral areas for oversight and scrutiny of the Government.  Things have changed, however.  There is the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, which does excellent work and is well placed to support the committees in the work they do.  Of course, there was a time when there was no permanent committee secretariat, and this has changed for the better.  However, recent Government initiatives such as longer D&aacute;il sitting hours, combined with a reduction in the overall number of staff working in the Oireachtas, can hamper the work, and, of course, the current financial circumstances do not permit additional resources to be given to any committee at this time.  However, that will not always be the case.  I know there might be a case for administrative officers joining the Houses of the Oireachtas next year and, of course, when more financial resources are available over the next period of the White Paper, the committee should look at attaining further resources to complement the work the existing committee staff do.</p><p>While it is not coming immediately, there is likely to be treaty change in the future.  The Lisbon treaty has been in place for some four years and the European Council has not even put together an intergovernmental conference to look at new treaty change to replace the Treaty of Lisbon.  However, when such a move does take place, this will have implications for foreign policy, both in the European Union and for Ireland.  Before the Lisbon treaty, there was the constitutional treaty that was defeated in referendums in France and the Netherlands in 2005, which ultimately postponed the referendum in Ireland.  Foreign policy was to have substantially changed under that treaty.  However, when it was reformulated into the Lisbon treaty, a lot of the foreign policy elements were watered down, which gave us the new role of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy which, of course, also has the double-hatted role of also being Vice President of the European Commission.  This watering down is likely to re-emerge when the next treaty comes forward in the sense that there is more than likely going to be a push by some member states to move this role of High Representative all the way up to a Union foreign minister, to have something comparable to the US Secretary of State.  That empowering of the position in the future is something this committee should take account of, including in regard to the implications it will have for the abilities of the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to be an actor throughout the world.</p><p>Much has been achieved in terms of oversight and the committee is doing more than it has ever done.  However, member states of comparative size do it a lot better.  This review of foreign policy and external relations is a great opportunity for the committee to seize.  I take it the committee will be putting together a submission and, indeed, it made one in 1996.  While I do not have that submission to hand, I am sure it fed very well into some of the Chapter 16 proposals that were contained within that White Paper.</p><p>I would love to continue on some of the other elements but I have included them in my paper.  I thank the committee once again for the invitation and I look forward to the questions.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to go through his paper in detail but I look forward to reading it later today.  I have several comments.  How does Mr. Butler see the European External Action Service developing?  Does he see it impacting on our foreign policy in the future?  It has not been a great success to date but there have been some recent improvements.  For the longer term, how does Mr. Butler see it evolving?</p><p>  We will never have effective scrutiny of EU legislation unless there is a specific role for Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The reality is that the workload on Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and on committees is very onerous and there is not the opportunity to give EU legislation the scrutiny it deserves.</p><p>  Mr. Butler mentions on page 9 of his paper that "the Irish Parliament, historically at least, has demonstrated disinterest in EU and international affairs".  I do not agree with that.</p></speech>

Strength of our parliamentary system and our political system is that, by and large, the political system supports the Minister and the Government of the day while they are on international business, whether it is at EU level or otherwise, although that is not to say we do not have our nuances and some differences of emphasis.  By and large, however, the Minister doing business abroad on behalf of the State gets the support of the political system at home, which is the way it should be.  I remember one European Commissioner saying to me that it was the first time he was in a parliament where the Government was supported by all of the Opposition parties in regard to particular issues, which he said was most unusual.  That has its strengths.</p><p>  Does Mr. Butler consider we should be putting a message out about the need to review the international organisations, in particular their workings and their architecture?  He listened to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan speak earlier in regard to the UN, about which I also spoke yesterday, including how it is structured and how, sadly, it has not been effective enough.  Should we be more vigorous and more bullish in regard to putting a message out that we would like to see the international organisations, to which we subscribe and are members of, play a more effective role in many of the huge challenges and difficulties that face people in many countries, particularly where there is hunger, starvation and poverty?</p><p>  On another issue, in my experience, climate change does not get much address in foreign policy.  Is it an issue that should be brought to some extent under our foreign policy?</p></speech>

I like the idea of bringing the ambassadors before the committee.  This is the first occasion on which that suggestion has been made.  Not only would their coming before us be helpful for the ambassadors, it would also provide the committee with an overview in respect of various matters.  There is a need to recognise the sensitive nature of the diplomatic job which ambassadors do, but it would be positive if we extended invitations to them to come before us.  For example, we could invite the US ambassador to appear before us to discuss immigration reform or those from Brazil, China and Russia to discuss improving trade relations.  We would not have to subject them to a grilling, rather our proceedings could be framed as a conversation designed to allow us to get to know one another.  It would be very useful if ambassadors from the countries to which Ireland gives aid came before the committee in order that we might have oversight with regard to what is happening and be kept abreast of developments.  I am definitely in favour of the suggestion.</p><p>  On the Minister of the day coming before the committee, that is the norm in many European countries.  It is also the norm in such countries that the chair of the foreign affairs committee is a member of the Opposition and that there is a balance in the context of composition, namely, that there are equal numbers of Opposition and Government members.  Would our guests see it as a positive move if we were to follow the example of our European neighbours?  I am of the view that it would probably make Parliament more democratic if that were to happen.  People may frown upon the idea that the Opposition might have a majority on this committee.  However, it must be remembered that the number of occasions on which matters are put to a vote at meetings of this committee are few and far between.  I am of the view that following the example of our European counterparts would be a positive move.  Is Mr. Butler in a position to provide positive examples of member states where that is the norm?</p><p>  I agree with the suggestion that membership of Oireachtas committees should be open to MEPs, particularly in the context of their knowledge with regard to European legislation, etc.  MEPs are allowed to attend our meetings-----</p></speech>

In my opinion, they should be allowed to attend meetings of all committees and not just this one.  On the subject of MEPs, perhaps those in the North could also be invited to attend.  A relationship exists and we tend to sell Ireland on an all-island basis.  Even if they never took up the option, it would be a positive move to invite MEPs from the North to attend and take part in our meetings.</p><p>  Mr. Butler referred to the fact that there is no Irish representative on the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the European Parliament.  All Irish MEPs are members of various groups within the Parliament which have representatives on that committee.  Perhaps we could invite people from some of those European groupings to come before the committee to discuss particular matters.  I thank Mr. Butler for what is an extremely interesting paper.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1696" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014011600013#N00400"><p>I thank Mr. Butler for such a comprehensive paper.  In the context of his comment that "the Taoiseach is the highest representative of Government and, accordingly, has a strong input into the formulation of Irish foreign policy and its delivery", will Mr. Butler outline his views on the Taoiseach's remarks in respect of the separation of trade and human rights during his visit to Saudi Arabia?  Were those remarks both predictable and clumsy?  I have also discussed this matter with Mr. Noel Dorr and Mr. Denis Staunton in the context of whether it is possible to align trade interests and human rights.</p><p>  Asylum and migration are two of the great humanitarian causes of the modern era.  I wonder how we will be judged in respect of our efforts in respect of both.  A recent report indicates that Sweden has taken in the largest number of refugees from Syria.  Ireland is very low down in the context of the number of refugees it has taken in from that country.  Will Mr. Butler indicate how he thinks Ireland will be judged with regard to its efforts in respect of asylum and migration?</p><p>  Mr. Butler is based in Denmark.  Professor Joseph Lee, the historian, voiced an opinion about Denmark and Ireland to the effect that the former was pursuing a much more independent and co-operative small farming social model than Ireland.  I know that Denmark is a member of NATO and I am not advocating that Ireland should follow its example in that regard.  Where does Mr. Butler see Ireland and Denmark in the context of a comparison of their approaches to human rights?  My impression is that Denmark is more vigorous than Ireland in respect of this matter.</p></speech>

The fact he has received such support from the Danish embassy to this country is very instructive, as is the fact that a senior member of the diplomatic staff of that embassy was here with him until very recently.</p><p>  I have not had an opportunity to read the extended version of the paper but I did read the abbreviated version.  Mr. Butler refers to the fact that the committee has been doing all right, that it is not contemplated within the terms of the Constitution, etc.  The reason for this is that successive Governments were against it.  Those in Iveagh House went mad when this committee was first established - a development in which I was deeply implicated - because they did not want amateurs fooling around in their area.  Mr. Butler states that Ireland does a reasonably good job but that other countries of comparable size do much better.  That is a very valuable comment, particularly if he can substantiate it and provide examples of what such countries do that is better.  If we can learn from the foreign affairs committees of other nations, it would be a very valuable lesson for us.</p><p>  With the greatest respect to my old friend, Deputy Smith, this business of the Seanad scrutinising EU legislation is a load of balls that arose during the defective referendum on the abolition of the Upper House.  During the campaign on that referendum, the Government told nothing but lies and the Opposition was split all over the place until the final ten day.</p></speech>

Some of it is completely mad.  I do not like English newspapers - I do not like those in Ireland very much these days either - but at least some of them got it right when they laughed at square sausages, round bananas and similar drivel.  We have had experience of that legislation in this country in the context of the move to equalise the actuarial risks relating to motorists.  For the sake of equality, women had to be charged as much as men for car insurance even though there is statistical proof to the effect that they are better, safer and more careful drivers.  Everyone involved, including feminists, voted in favour of the legislation to which I refer and I could not believe that.  I would not hold out any great hopes in respect of the Seanad scrutinising EU legislation.</p><p>  During the referendum campaign on the Seanad, I continually outlined my concern to the effect that this suggestion is a sneaky trick on the part of the Government.  If it can impose a job on the Upper House which that House cannot do, at which it would be incompetent and which would oblige it, as a result of a lack of time and resources, to neglect its other responsibilities, that would be a very good argument in favour of getting rid of it.  The Seanad could possibly scrutinise EU legislation if it was properly resourced.  If, for example, a system of bureaucracy were put in place to refine the list of legislation in order that the Upper House would only scrutinise that which is appropriate to it, then it would probably work.  However, the ordinary work of the Seanad would be completely overwhelmed if it were to take seriously the scrutiny of EU legislation in the absence of adequate resources and support.  As matters stand, what is proposed would make a farce of the Seanad.  Under the Constitution, the Upper House's primary responsibility - and what it has done damn well, actually - is to introduce legislation on social issues and so forth, as many of my colleagues have done, and to correct Government legislation by amendment in instances where it is wrong.</p><p>  No one should be under the illusion that working Senators - I do not refer here to the part-timers - do not put in at least as much time as any Member of the D&aacute;il whom I have come across during my 27 years as a Member of the Upper House.</p> <p>I note that it was somebody else and not the Chairman who said that.</p></speech>

I believe that the Seanad has a specific role, namely, it is a Legislature.  As such, offering it step-down facilities and responsibilities is rubbish.  It was never intended to work that way.  It is a second House, the purpose of which has been correctly outlined by Senator Norris.  Legislation can be initiated and improved in the Seanad.  As such, the Seanad does serve a particular purpose.  I acknowledge its members are elected by a different electorate in the form of an electoral college and that it comes at legislation from a different perspective and with different views.  The Seanad plays an important role, which should be recognised.  As the Chairman is aware, that has been my view for many years.</p><p>  In terms of scrutiny, I believe that the Seanad is not the appropriate route to go in terms of scrutiny and that the appropriate route in this regard is a dedicated committee, be it the Joint Committee on European Affairs or Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I believe also that a proper scrutinising system will remove red herrings and so on, thereby reducing wasted time and so on.  That is how such issues were addressed previously.  The old system was replaced with a new system a number of years ago.  It was believed that the new system was better because it would operate across all committees.  However, it did not work.  The reason it did not work is because Ministers were choosing which committees they would and would not appear before.  I have experience of this, having seen it happen from both sides of the counter.  I believe that a dedicated committee is the way to go, there is no better.  Another reason the dedicated committee system is best is because members of that committee will develop an authority on the subjects before it, which nobody else will have.  It is important all other committees while focusing on the issues relevant to them are required to reference matters of scrutiny to the dedicated committee.  There should also be a reporting system to identify the issues that need to be tackled first.  Also, that committee should be independent of Government.  Whoever takes on the job will be doing important work.  </p><p>  I would like to correct a point made earlier.  There is in place a system whereby the T&aacute;naiste or Taoiseach reports to the Houses of the Oireachtas, through the D&aacute;il, prior to and following European Council meetings.  The problem that arises is that there is only limited participation in such debate by Members of the House.  While the leaders of the groups are given an opportunity to speak during such debates ordinary back benchers are excluded from commenting.  Perhaps that is a good thing: I do not know.  Previous Ministers for Foreign Affairs were relatively good in terms of appearing before this committee and the Joint Committee on European Affairs to outline what they proposed to do at general council meetings and so on.  They also reported to committees following such meetings.  We are well served in this area.  I would not fault the T&aacute;naiste or previous Ministers for Foreign Affairs in that regard.  There were a couple of previous Ministers, who shall remain anonymous for the benefit of this exercise, who were reluctant to appear before any committee with a view to explaining what they were doing at Council meetings and so on.  It is important that is mentioned.  </p><p>  Reference was made again to Mr. O'Halpin's statement that "The Irish Parliament, historically at least, has demonstrated disinterest in EU international affairs.  This can be shown by a number of factors, including the electoral system".  That is rubbish.  The reality is that there are several other parliaments throughout Europe and the world that have inherited systems which they are improving over time.  The problem is that we, politicians and the public, tend to act out a different role when it suits us.  We pretend we are not part of the European Union.  We pretend it is a case of "them" and "us" and that we are somehow offshore and have a different role to play.  This is the biggest mistake we have made.  To be successful in any business one must integrate oneself into it and take ownership of it.  While it is okay to be disinterested in particular issues, we should not resort to euroscepticism, calling for reform because Europe does not work.  That is rubbish.  The parliamentary system of democracy has existed for hundreds of years.  Even the Romans had their own version of democracy, although it was fairly abrupt in certain circumstances.  The French also had their version of democracy, as did the Greeks, the Egyptians and so on.  Genghis Khan could have had his own version of democracy, although it would probably not be one we would readily go along with.  It should be emphasised that there is nothing as old or as successful as democracy.  Everybody accepts it should be reformed and improved.  Historically, a few people - I will not mention names but they are well known - have tried to do so.  At least one person tried during the last century to introduce his own version of democracy.  He received huge support for the changes he sought at that time.  </p></speech>

However, it was populism in its worst form but it was fully supported by the people.</p><p>  We need to get back to basics and to recognise the fundamentals of the democratic system.  We need to improve and respond to the issues that present to us and we need to make it work.  There is no sense in opting out of the system and pretending that somebody else is the causing the problem for us.  Sonny Liston, a famous boxer, once said something during a fight between him and Cassius Clay, which was a miniature international bout that was and is world famous, in which he was clobbered a number of times.  When he was told by his trainer on going back to his corner, "Keep on in there, he's not laying a glove on you", his response was, "Would you keep an eye on the referee: there's somebody hitting me".</p></speech>

It is different to submissions we have received from others to date in so far as he appears to have researched ways and means of this committee being better empowered in terms of holding the Parliament and the Executive to account, which is very refreshing.  Mr. Butler has touched on many issues.  I note from the quotations he referenced that he is an academic.  However, there is nothing wrong with that.  I married an academic.</p><p>  Mr. Butler has raised important questions about the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Common Security and Defence Policy, which issues were previously discussed at COSAC conference in Dublin Castle.  While it was interesting that so many people had come together under one roof, the average delegate was unable to engage in a serious way on the issues on the agenda.</p> <p>This leads me to the role of the High Representative, Catherine Ashton, and our role, as a small committee in a small country, <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the European Union.  Deputy Durkan disagreed with Mr. Butler's view on Ministers coming before the joint committee.  Perhaps we could tease out the degree to which Ireland compromised in respect of its relationship with the other 27 member states at the COSAC conferences.<br />I highlighted our interest in European and international affairs.  We heard about what Mr. O'Halpin said.  While I do not know anything about Mr. O'Halpin, I note the excitement in the contribution made by my colleague who has just left the meeting.  Was Mr. O'Halpin criticising the Irish electoral system for promoting clientelism through multi-seat constituencies?  Serious people argued at either this committee or the Committee on European Union Affairs that the single transferable vote system was not serving us well.  Perhaps I am misreading Mr. O'Halpin.  I disagree with his view that there is little interest in the European Union and international affairs.  I believe we have been to the fore at all levels in this regard.<br />I congratulate Mr. Butler again on his report which I assume will be read by administrators.  I refer especially to his views on how we should grasp the opportunity to reinvigorate ourselves and become more involved in the power structure.  Perhaps it is coincidental that he repeatedly argued that Denmark has a different and better system given that he may know the Danish system inside out.  The paper makes a statement to the effect that the Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs is directed by the Danish foreign affairs committee.</p></speech>

That is a very interesting concept.<br />I congratulate Mr. Butler on being so quick off the mark.  I was shocked to learn from a press statement covered in <i>The Irish Times </i>that the Government planned a review.  This returns me to Mr. Butler's point about the Minister being able to determine policy alone.  For example, he can issue a press statement announcing a review.  We had to place this issue on our agenda to ascertain what the hell he was talking about.  That is the reason we are having this discussion. <br />I do not see anything wrong with the notion of ambassadors appearing before the joint committee when they are being appointed.  We would not deprive them of their jobs but it would be nice to find out, for example, from an ambassador being appointed to China or a Spanish-speaking country, whether he or she can speak Mandarin or Spanish as the case may be.  This is basic information which we could elicit at such a meeting.  The joint committee would have a more important role to play if it acquired greater status.  Is this the start of a debate that will result in a White Paper?<br />The committee's relationship with Members of the European Parliament was raised.  The relationship between the committee and the EU High Representative, Catherine Ashton, is very weak.  How much do we compromise our national view on global developments when we engage with the European Union given that Ms Ashton subsequently acts as the spokesperson for all 28 member states?<br />I enjoyed reading Mr. Butler's paper and I thank him for encouraging the committee to grasp the nettle by empowering ourselves, acquiring greater responsibility and respect and assuming a role of parliamentary oversight.</p></speech>

The review came at the right time.</p><p>  On the role of Seanad &Eacute;ireann in scrutinising the European Union, I strongly concur with Deputy Durkan's comments on the role of a second chamber.  I am not sure, however, if the correct approach would be for one committee to take responsibility for all oversight.  I agree that scrutiny at parliamentary level, whether by one committee or all the sectoral committees, must be independent of government.  This function has expanded considerably.  A protocol attached to the Lisbon treaty dealt specifically with national parliaments.  The practice of issuing communications seeking an input from national parliaments through their early warning mechanisms is a very good way of having political dialogue with the European Union.  Committees that are independent of government can make a substantial contribution by submitting its thoughts about how a particular proposal should proceed.  </p><p>  Deputy Crowe referred to the European Parliament committee on foreign affairs.  None of our 12 MEPs are on that committee in the parliamentary term from 2009 until 2014.  As there are 22 sectoral committees of the Parliament, it is impossible for 12 Irish MEPs to cover them all.  That three Irish MEPs sit on the agriculture committee is indicative of where the interests of Ireland lie in Europe.  Elections to the European Parliament are imminent and I will not say that no Irish MEP will sit on the foreign affairs committee in the 2014 to 2019 term, notwithstanding the decline in the number of Irish MEPs from 12 to 11.  I would love to see one MEP on the committee but it is not certain that will be the case.  The manner in which this committee would engage with any Irish MEP appointed to it could be quite interesting.  Members of this committee should have some idea of the type of working relationship they would have with an Irish MEP on the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee. </p><p>   Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan asked a question on the human rights element of trade missions.  I listened very carefully to the comments made yesterday by the former Secretary General of the Department and I agree with him to some extent.  From my examination of Ireland's engagement at the General Assembly in New York, I found that while we have a strong record on human rights in terms of reforming international institutions, we also know that this is not the most effective way to achieve results.  The UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, which has only been in operation for a few years, is already experiencing major problems as a result of the voting blocs on the council.  Some of its members do not have a great human rights record.  I am not making charges against any particular state because the problem is global.  The European Union has a seat as an observer at the UN General Assembly and each or the 28 member states is also a member of the UN.  There are 192 or 193 UN members, which means EU member states are in a small minority in the world order.  The existence of a forum to deal with human rights issues does not necessarily mean that a Minister visiting a country with a poor human rights record must raise human rights issues on every single occasion.  However, countries must be made aware of Ireland's position on some matters. </p><p>  Senator Norris stated Iveagh House did not like the idea of a joint committee being established.  Foreign policy is traditionally conducted behind closed doors.  An argument is made that foreign policy is about deal making and should not have a public light shone on it.  While this may have been the case previously, it is no longer acceptable either nationally or internationally.  The communications revolution has made all information more accessible.  It is also empowering citizens to find out more about parliamentarians, governments and foreign policy.</p><p>  I am pleased the joint committee takes such an interest in foreign affairs.</p> <p>Deputy Byrne mentioned the conference on Common Foreign Security Policy, CFSP and the Common Defence and Security Policy.  That conference is separate from COSAC.  COSAC comes under the European Affairs Committee.  This new conference happens with the Presidency.  I presume the Chairman will be going to Greece soon for the next conference on CFSP and CDSP.  The committees tend to send a great many people.  With 28 member states each sending three or four delegates to these conferences one will have roughly 150 people which is equivalent almost to the size of the D&aacute;il.  It is a good way for parliamentarians to engage with each other on these issues, but it is impossible for these people when they come together in an once-off forum every six months to engage in proper oversight of the High Representative, Ms Catherine Ashton when she is accountable to the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament itself.  The European Parliament would be more of a correct forum for proper oversight of her role.</p><p> Returning to the point on the European External Action Service, there are ways for Ireland to engage with the European External Action Service.  I think there are seven Irish diplomats coming down on secondment to the European External Action Service, but that is less than 3% of the total make-up of the European External Action Service.  The European External Action Service, EEAS, got off to a rocky start, as Deputy Smith pointed out, although it is developing.  We now have EU delegations across the world and in some places, as Professor Tonra mentioned yesterday, that when the EEAS was set up there were great ideas that they would share premises with some member states with EU embassies  in which all the different cultures would have their operations.  That has not happened.  EU embassies might flourish with the next treaty into the future, but we do not know what will happen yet.  Although it is still a developing organisation, there is some institutional conflict between the role of the European External Action Service, EEAS, in foreign policy and the office of the permanent president of the European Council which have split competencies in foreign policy.  Of course, that will probably change in the future but again we do not know.</p><p> A number of members mentioned the quotation from Mr. O'Halpin, which I used in my paper.  I double-checked the reference, the quote I used was from 1996 in which Mr. O'Halpin was providing an historical context to the role of the Oireachtas as opposed to the-----</p></speech>

May I give my opinion to my good colleague Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on the Taoiseach's visit?  She mentioned it was a clumsy response, but I do not agree.  The Taoiseach was there at the invitation of Enterprise Ireland.  It was not organised by the Department of the Taoiseach or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The trade mission was organised by Enterprise Ireland and was focused on 80 to 90 companies doing the business.  Clearly the Taoiseach did not want to get distracted by other human rights issues because members who went to Iran last week will have seen that journalists were more concerned about the way one shakes hands and what one wears than about the content of what we were doing.  </p><p>  The Taoiseach was correct not to answer questions because it would lead to other questions and other issues and sidetrack the whole trade mission, which was very successful and resulted in new contracts worth approximately &euro;5 million for the many Irish companies that work extremely hard.  In my opinion that was the reason.</p></speech>

Witnesses are directed that only comments and evidence in respect of the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I now call on Ms Dolores Kelly, MLA, to proceed with her opening statement.</p></speech>

Given that my mother was from Creeslough and my wife is from Carndonagh, I claim that privilege of being a neighbour of the Chairman.  Of course, we know each other in other respects as well as in respect of cross-Border transport.</p><p>  I have been in the Assembly since 1998.  It is worth recalling that the civic forum was created under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and made up of members of various civil bodies.  It has, of course, no legislative or governmental powers and fell into abeyance in 2002 after the suspension of the assembly.  Following the flags protests in 2012, my colleague, Ms Dolores Kelly, MLA, wrote to the members and various groups of the forum and we were overwhelmed by the response we received from them.  It was clear that there was a need.  On a personal basis, as an elected representative who has served in the assembly since its beginning, I know something that the Northern Ireland Assembly needs is missing.  </p><p>  We are in every respect a fledgling democracy.  It is foolish if not arrogant to believe that the political parties can really create a broad spectrum of democracy without the involvement of the wider community.  The civic forum did not last for very long but I remember it as something that was absolutely critical and essential.  One of the reports in which I was particularly interested was the one on literacy and numeracy because we have that serious problem.  That report was superb.  Any legislative assembly or government would have been proud to have received it.  Sadly, that did not happen.  </p><p>  In recent times, the SDLP has put forward motions on two occasions to bring back the civic forum, both of which were passed.  It has not happened.  There is a report sitting in the office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister since 2007.  There has been no response.  I suspect that report is a very positive one that sets out very good reasons why the civic forum should be reconstituted but we have not got it.  Recent events in the North indicate that a broader body of opinion is badly needed so that we can create a truly participative democracy and give a strong voice to the wider community.  I am sure all political parties in the North are concerned that the level of participation in voting is constantly dropping, which we believe is an indication that the wider community has lost interest.  Those of us who are nostalgic remember the difficult work that was done leading up to the Good Friday Agreement and getting over 90% of people in the Republic and over 70% in the North to support it.  It is crazy to take that tier away.  In my introduction, my impassioned plea is to ask to every support not just because we want a civic forum and it is a wider spectrum of democracy but because it is if we are to shore up, which is possibly the wrong term, and continue the struggle to make sure democracy stays alive.  </p><p>  We do not spend all our time talking about flags, placating paramilitary groups, throwing money at them and all the other things have been going on.  We need the civic forum for good reasons and I am sure we will have the opportunity this morning to spell out in greater detail why we believe that without the civic forum, we have a real problem in the North.  The assembly - the big house on the hill - on its own is an isolated place.  It does not encapsulate or relate to the wider community in the same way as would happen in a normal democracy where there is consensus.  At this point, I am pleased to hand over to my colleague, Ms Kelly, MLA.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1747" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dolores Kelly" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014011600003#G00600"><p>I want to put on record our party's thanks and appreciation to the T&aacute;naiste for his recent remarks in support of the party's call for the implementation of the Haass-O'Sullivan talks and his commitment to opening Government records relating to any mechanism that might be established in dealing comprehensively and ethically with the past.  It is important to note that at the outset.  The committee may know that in respect of the Haass talks, there was an overwhelming amount of response right across civic society from individuals, trade unions and other community and voluntary organisations.  This is an example of where civic society has sought to engage.  There will be a call for a compromise rally in Belfast city centre this Sunday.  This rally wants to see the parties engaging and dealing with those contentious issues of parading, flags and the past that have not yet been dealt with.</p> <p>Another aspect of the civic forum is that there would be an all-Ireland consultative forum to partner with a similar body in the South.  That remains an unfulfilled promise and commitment of the Good Friday Agreement.  As members will know, equality and human rights were at the core and, indeed, a compromise of that agreement which is an international treaty between two sovereign governments and the British and Irish Governments are co-guarantors of that agreement.  We believe that more needs to be done and more pressure applied to the Executive and in particular to the Unionist parties in the Northern Ireland Executive.  <br />The victims' groups in particular have been very powerful over the past number of months.  Despite their differences of opinions and their different experiences of the conflict they have spoken with one voice in their demand for a mechanism to deal with the past in order to address issues of concern with regard to justice and for finding out what happened by means of truth recovery.  Their voices have been very powerful and the victims have stayed on the same page, so to speak, in their call and their commitment to the process overseen by Richard Haass and Megan O'Sullivan.<br />Those are examples of how civic society can put pressure on the political parties.  It was anticipated that dealing with the past would be the most potentially contentious issue where there would not be agreement at the Haass talks, yet it is the issue on which there is most agreement about the mechanisms.  That is a very fine example of how civic society can play a role in setting the agenda for political parties.<br />The North is still very much in recession with high levels of unemployment.  We have a housing crisis and a health crisis.  Civic society is at a loss.  As John Dallat, MLA, commented, some opt to be increasingly disengaged from the political process.  It would appear that our society is being held back by the interests of select interest groups.  In our view the civic forum could provide an opportunity to allow the voices to be heard of those who believe themselves to be marginalised.  <br />I did not attend the initial civic forum and we acknowledge that there were flaws in its mechanisms and how it was to be established.  The people who responded to our letters asking for their views on whether the civic forum should be reconvened, said as much.  However, they agreed with the principle that there was a role and a place for such an institution.  The fact that the review of the civic forum has not been published is a very poor decision which suggests to me that the review recommends that the civic forum should be re-established because what has one to fear from publishing the report.  This week in the Northern Ireland Assembly the First Minister made light of the civic forum when he said it was not an issue which was raised with him on the street.  This attitude does an injustice to those people who want to see a greater participative democracy.<br />I will give an example of how accountable participative democracy can work, an issue which is also pertinent to the South.  I refer to Mapping the Rollback? - Human Rights Provisions of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement 15 Years On, recently published by the Committee for the Administration of Justice.  I suggest this committee might wish to hear from that committee about its work.  It refers to accountable participative shapes of governance as envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement being very possible.  Good participation leads to good outcomes.  We have seen it in mental health where the participation of service-users and carers in a Belfast mental health rights group led to the implementation of the card-before-you-leave appointment card system across accident and emergency departments in Northern Ireland.  As a result of this initiative, 160 people every month who are in mental health distress now get follow-up appointment and support which they would otherwise not have.  That is an example of how participative democracy can make a real difference to the lives of people.  I will conclude by quoting from Inez McCormack who when speaking to an American audience about the MacBride principles, said:<blockquote>We can all deliver the rhetoric which offends nobody but the dispossessed.  For those who have can always argue that tomorrow is the right time for change.  For the have-nots, today is not soon enough and we can only hope for their generosity of spirit in forgetting their yesterdays.</blockquote></p></speech>

I thank them for presenting this initiative to reconvene the civic forum.  I congratulate them for successfully raising the matter in Stormont.  The civic forum is a commitment in the Good Friday Agreement.  It crossed political boundaries and ensured that the pressure from political parties was avoided.</p><p>  Members of this committee visited Belfast before Christmas in 2012.  We went to the Newtownards Road for the opening of the Skainos centre and we had meetings with various groups.  We were quite convinced that everything was okay.  Martin McGuinness, MLA, and Peter Robinson, MLA, addressed that huge attendance in what is loyalist east Belfast and in my view this was a cause for celebration.  However, less than seven days later, all hell broke loose on the same streets which shows that it is a very difficult situation.  I cannot see any reason the civic forum could not be reconvened.  </p><p>  What powers has the civic forum?  Are the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister supportive of reconvening it?</p></speech>

I fully support the establishment of the civic forum and hopefully we can have the North-South consultative forum established as well.  I have tabled numerous parliamentary questions in the House in order to keep it on the agenda.  Before the delegation came into the meeting, Conor Murphy, MP, made the point that demonstrates why there should be a civic forum.  We were discussing the importance of the Haass talks, the progress made and the disappointment that the process has not been completed.  He outlined the importance of the Haass-O'Sullivan talks and he referred to the fact that up to 600 submissions were made by individuals, groups and organisations.  These submissions demonstrate that civic society wants to be involved.  It is very remiss and if it is a matter of the competence of the Executive then it is a scandal that the forum has not been re-established.  I understand that the re-establishment may be a matter for devolution.  I wish the delegation well in its work to have it re-established.  We need the involvement of civic society.  It can suit the public services well to have fewer fora to answer to.  I am not making a political point but the abolition of town councils and other bodies is ideal from the point of view of the public service.  I mean no disrespect to members of the public service who work in the Oireachtas but I believe it suits the public service to have fewer fora to service and to answer to.  The delegation has made a very good case for the need to re-establish the civic forum.</p></speech>

It seems that we shared a train together from Newry only a couple of hours ago.</p><p>  Several serious issues are involved.  I come from a position of strongly supporting the re-establishment of the Civic Forum for Northern Ireland and the North-South Consultative Forum.  It is important that we view civic democracy as having an important contribution to make.  People felt that they were silenced when the civic forum fell and the institutions were dissolved in 2002.  The Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, OFMDFM, has steadfastly refused to publish its review of the civic and consultative forums.  Could Ms Kelly, who served on the Assembly's OFMDFM committee, throw some light on these possible refusals?</p><p>  I wish to make a couple of points about Deputy Smith's statement on the role of civic society in the Haass talks.  Some 600 submissions were made.  What role would the civic forum have in supplementing the work of the Assembly, the Executive and other Northern organisations and how would that tie in with the consultative forum?  Too often, civic society feels silenced on many matters to do with the past, parades, contentious issues and wider issues, for example, health and education, in which respect Ms Kelly rightly stated that there was a chaotic situation.  Civic society is good in terms of North-South work, as there are many common denominators.  The political classes can learn from what civic democracy and civic society are telling us.</p></speech>

This committee has undertaken to perform an audit of outstanding matters, including the all-Ireland consultative forum and a Bill of rights.  As a consequence of the St. Andrews Agreement, Acht na Gaeilge is another outstanding matter.</p><p>  The reality is that unionism has been hostile to the idea of a civic forum, an all-Ireland consultative forum, a Bill of rights and a review of the North-South implementation bodies and has used its position in the Executive and the OFMDFM to veto any development in or discussion of these matters.  This is where the problem lies.  There is an appetite in civic society across Ireland-----</p></speech>

There are other vehicles for that, but the Good Friday Agreement envisaged a formal role linked to the working of the Assembly and, through the consultative forum, the all-Ireland arrangements.  It is necessary to bring the civic forum back and the consultative forum into existence for the first time.</p><p>  This is the nub of the problem.  Unionism has been hostile to these bodies, including the North-South bodies even though it continues to operate them, for example, the North-South Ministerial Council.  Unionists have used their positions in the Executive to stifle any development, discussion or production of a report in respect of these bodies.  Pressure needs to be applied by political representatives, the two Governments, which are the guarantors of the international agreement between them, and civic society North and South to the effect that we want a forum, a space to have a formal input rather than just an informal input that is requested by various bodies as situations arise.  We want a formal arrangement under which we can develop ideas and make a contribution to politics in the North and the development of its society.  This problem needs to be shifted.</p></speech>

We must determine the position on this matter.  They asked whether there was an appetite for reconvening the civic forum.  In the last vote held in the Assembly on this matter, a small majority was in favour.  In this lies the answer.  The SDLP, Sinn F&eacute;in and Independent groups want the civic forum, yet the Unionists are failing to grasp this desire, which is overwhelmingly supported by the number of submissions made to the Haass talks.  In all of the committee's visits to Northern Ireland and in my visits through my political party, the one thing that the groups we met all wanted was to be able to explain their positions and to have them understood.  If we stymie that, we will stymie the aim of all of this, namely, the joining together of two communities for the betterment of both and with knock-on effects for the political process.</p><p>  The Good Friday Agreement was heralded worldwide and everyone was on board with it.  As such, it is disappointing to see that the civic forum will not be a part of it.  We must use every mechanism available to us, be it the consultative forum or the North-South Ministerial Council, to pressurise the Northern Irish system, which steadfastly refuses to address this issue.  The civic forum's initiation cost &pound;500,000 or &pound;750,000.  Compared with the costs being incurred by other ongoing problems, for example, the flag dispute, the civic forum's initiation was value for money.  It gave various groups an opportunity, be they communities, political entities or sporting bodies.  Each community has many different aspects.  We should give them all an opportunity to participate, offer their opinions and work together to get us across the line.</p><p>  I support the trend at this meeting.  I will refer to my party leader, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the concerns and words that have been expressed and ask that we put the civic forum's reactivation on the agenda of any talks he has with the Secretary of State or Westminster.</p></speech>

When we discussed the Haass-O'Sullivan draft report, I spoke briefly in support of the reconvening of the civic forum.  The Assembly voted in April 2013 to recall it.</p> <p>In 2011, the First Minister in response to a question about the civic forum said:<blockquote><br />There was no widespread desire for a return to the structure of the size and expense of the civic forum as previously operated.  Accordingly, there has been no meetings of the civic forum during this Assembly mandate, which has also resulted in considerable savings to the public purse.  </blockquote>He then said that a meeting had been convened with people who were claiming expenses, etc.  Perhaps Ms Kelly would say if it is the First Minister who is holding this up now?</p></speech>

This is the purpose of the forum.  One of the weaknesses of the peace process was the lack of civic involvement in the negotiations in that regard.  I have no doubt that had the negotiations been widened out to include civic society the peace process we would have a much more inclusive process and we would be much further down the road in that regard.</p><p>  We all accept that the Assembly is not seriously tackling the issues of poverty, equality, inclusivity, housing, welfare reform and so on.  Everybody thought the peace process would be a new beginning in that regard.  I agree that the greater the involvement of civic society the better.  The naysayers will point to the cost factor and say the forum is only a talk shop.  However, as elected representatives are elected by their communities they know what issues are important to them.  I presume that is the only argument against it.  I believe the consensus in this room, and, perhaps, across society, is that the civic forum is a good thing.  </p></speech>

I would like to dispel some of the myths articulated, particularly by Unionism, in relation to the cost of the forum and the view that it is a talking shop.  That is an absolute nonsense.  Millions of pounds is being spent on the dysfunctionality of our society because of a failure to get to grips with a shared future and reconciliation or with the issues around parades, on which issue the Haass-O'Sullivan talks had hoped to make progress.  The cost of not doing anything is much greater than the half million budget initially set aside for the civic forum.  I believe that the issue of costs can be appropriately addressed by a reconvened civic forum.  As stated earlier by Mr. Dallat, MLA, many people in society are, unfortunately, becoming increasingly disconnected from the Assembly.  Some see it as a very expensive talking shop, from which there has been a lack of legislation coming forth owing to the dysfunctionality of the Executive, particularly the OFMDFM committee.</p><p>  On Deputy Feighan's question in regard to the powers of the civic forum, it does not have any governmental powers or powers of legislation.  It was envisaged it would have a role in testing various government policies.  For example, the chaos around education and the proposals around welfare reform are two good examples on which there could have been contributions from civic society, including community volunteers, trade unions and business.  Business communities in the North favour all-Ireland business proposals.  InterTradeIreland is seen as one of the North-South bodies that is making progress.  There is widespread support across a wide range of community partners for such proposals.  </p><p>  The will of the Assembly is that the civic forum be re-established.  This is borne out by two votes.  Deputy Ferris spoke about the Unionist veto.  The First Minister and his party - this relates back to the point made by Mr. Murphy, MP, in regard to the bill of rights - and others appear to be frightened by the participative democracy proposals.  They constantly run to the courts in relation to decisions by the Executive, such as the finance DUP Minister taking the Agriculture Minister to court last Christmas in relation to the transfer of funds from farming to rural development.  As the judge said in that case, this is occurring because of political failure.  There is widespread frustration not only among political parties and anoraks but across civic society.  This was borne out by the number of people who found their voices during the Haass-O'Sullivan talks and put forward proposals which were of a concrete nature, particularly the victims' groups which made good submissions in relation to how to deal with the past on an ethical, comprehensive and moral basis.  </p><p>  The civic forum has a North-South dimension.  We are seeing a great deal of roll-back within Strand 2 of the Good Friday Agreement.  I believe the two Governments as co-guarantors of the Agreement need to hold to account the First and Deputy First Ministers in terms of their particular responsibilities in relation to all-Ireland institutions.  For example, we still do not have the parliamentary cross-Border councils or assembly associations envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement and there has been a dilution of some of the North-South bodies.  At a time of economic recession and challenges these issues should be being grasped on an all-Ireland basis.  This is resulting in disengagement by wider society with the Assembly and an increase in street violence during parades.  I participated over the Christmas period in the Haass-O'Sullivan talks, during which I learned that a small minority of the population in Northern Ireland, namely, people within the Orange Order and retired police officers, have the most say.  This is where we are seeing the hold-back.  Political parties are looking to a small constituent group of the Protestant Unionist population in terms of Northern Ireland is being moved forward rather than to a greater number of people for the greater good.</p></speech>

I am old enough to know the price paid by Ireland as a whole following the last collapse of the process in the North.  I do not want to be emotive or to suggest that the dark clouds of storm are gathering again.  Ms Kelly, MLA, referred to parades.  I represent east Derry where the paramilitaries are re-engaging and carrying out punishment beatings in increasing numbers.  They are filling the gap that is being created by the failure of the Assembly to engage the wider community.  Just as we discovered in 1998, after 30 years, there is no greater weapon against violence and a breakdown in society than engagement with the widest spectrum of people.</p> <p>Those who are engaged, the architects of the Good Friday Agreement, acknowledge that, which is why these structures were provided for.  I am the longest serving member of the Public Accounts Committee which, like its Oireachtas equivalent, looks at the historical blunders of Departments.  Would it not be great to have an advisory body that was able to identify where Departments need to improve and bring forward initiatives that address the problems in health, education and a spectrum of other services that are not functioning properly?</p><p> Ms Kelly, MLA, has covered the issue of expense.  What price does one put on one person losing his or her life?  What price does one put on 4,000 who lost their lives, with practically every graveyard in the North containing the remains of somebody who died as a result of failure?  Members of the SDLP are not here today to preach doom and gloom.  However, we are being responsible by highlighting the awful vacuum that is being created.  The former Minister for Finance, Mr. Sammy Wilson, MLA, recently said in the Assembly that he would neuter every cross-Border body.  That goes back to the old days of Unionism, which believed it could do it on its own.  It cannot do it on its own; two parties cannot do it on their own.  The five principal parties cannot do it on their own without involvement because the North is not a normal society but one that needs to be nurtured an awful lot to engage that wider community.</p><p> Along with Ms Kelly, MLA, and Ms McNeill, I am making an impassioned plea to all elected representatives, North and South as well as wider afield, to recognise that a serious vacuum is developing in the North and it is being managed by huge sums of money spent on increased policing and so on, which is not the answer.  The answer lies in the wider community feeling ownership of what we have.</p></speech>

Does anybody wish to expand on how we can move forward on the suggestions made today?  I believe the SDLP representatives have reiterated what has happened in recent months.  There has been an appetite in Northern Ireland to get involved in the Haass-O'Sullivan process.  Without going into the nuts and bolts of that, it is significant that there were more than 600 submissions and with the vast majority from civic society it has identified an appetite for civic engagement.  In private session we agreed that we would contact the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach to follow up post-Haass outlining the committee's feelings.  We can include today's SDLP submission as part of that communique.  We can also include the full contribution because many people made observations today.  I will let the members contribute to add their own input.</p><p>  I call Senator Jim D'Arcy followed by Mr. McDonnell, MLA.</p></speech>

I know representatives of victims groups will appear later and the committee will hear more about that.  Those kinds of what would seem very sensible provisions were being railed against in any proposals on dealing with the past and improving the powers of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

However, I wish to make a background point.  While I do not want to bash anybody here today, unionism is reneging on many of the things agreed in the Good Friday Agreement.  The DUP Members will individually and collectively tell us that they never signed up to the Good Friday Agreement.  Many of us are suspicious that they would like to dismantle as much of it as possible.  The rest of us believe the Good Friday Agreement is the only compass we have to try to sort out our society in the North.  There is a need for openness and we need to allow people in to participate.  The civic forum allowed the churches, business community, trade unions and some representation from each of the political parties and various others to have a status and an input.  It was not nearly as powerful as the distinguished Seanad, but it was a sort of senate behind the Assembly in a greatly diluted form that allowed issues to be raised.</p><p>  That is the point I make to colleagues around the table.  That wheel - it was not just a cog - was taken out of the system and there is deep frustration among civic unionism that those who wish to be progressive do not have the space or opportunity to create and influence potential progress.  There is deep frustration among civic unionism that the Unionist political parties did not support Dr. Haass's effort because many of the people - both individuals and groups - want to see progress and stability and a degree of prosperity emerging.</p><p>  That is the nub of this.  The Chairman asked for proposals.  This committee is the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  The civic forum was a core wheel in the machinery of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Good Friday Agreement will not function to completion and to its ultimate potential without a civic forum in some shape or form.  While I would like to see it in the shape and form that existed ten or 12 years ago, even a civic forum - dare I tempt fate - in slimmed-down form would allow people to give an input.</p> <p>The disillusion that is setting in because of the dysfunction around some of the politics in the North will ultimately create space, as Mr. Dallat, MLA, has rightly said for the loyalist paramilitaries who are rummaging around Coleraine.  It will gradually go to the point where it could blow up again and none of us want to see that.</p></speech>

Mr. Maskey and Senator Moran have indicated.  Everyone else got a good hearing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1787" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Maskey" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014011600008#M00300"><p>The committee has been up on several occasions speaking to members of the loyalist community.  To me, the stumbling block is with mainstream Unionism, it is not with loyalism because loyalists will tell me every day of the week, no matter how often I meet them whether in constituency offices or at different fora, that they have no representation.  They have cried out in recent years for some sort of representation.  I believe a civic forum would be a good way of going about that.  The question is who to put the pressure on to ensure a civic forum comes to fruition.  That is one of the main challenges faced by all of us in society, including this committee.  I agree with the approach and we need to ensure that the Governments put as much pressure on Unionism to do that.</p><p>  We should possibly write to Office of the First Minister and the Office of the Deputy First Minister as well to ask for their views and thoughts because the decision has been passed by the assembly.  We should ask when the decision will be implemented and what the views are.  It may come back that there is no agreement or we might not get a letter back.  It might be blocked because of the veto from the DUP.  I believe we need to put pressure on to see if we can get some sort of feedback and establish what that is.  Then, let us take it from there.  It is clear to me that when the audit is done on the Good Friday Agreement this area will definitely show up as one of the elements missing.  We need to clearly decide how to get the pressure on people.  It may be that we should ask the people we have engaged with from the loyalist community for their views on whether they want a civic forum.  I believe that some of the people who we have met in the past from the loyalist community may want to accept that as well.</p></speech>

This has been a very good discussion.  Like everyone else, I fully support the establishment of the civic forum.  As Deputy Wall noted, it is part of the Good Friday Agreement.  From visiting places I have found the most beneficial aspect to be engaging with the different community and religious groups of all the different sides.</p><p>  It is striking how much we are suffering.  It is to the detriment of this committee meeting today that there are no Unionists present and that is a major shame.  The evidence exists that people want to engage and it has certainly been our experience that people want to engage.  People want the opportunity.  The matter of the costing, sadly, seems to be an excuse.  Rather then go on - I realise we could discuss this all day - the question is how best to move on from here.  Many of us on the committee are also on the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association.  Is there something that we can do through that body to move the position on or through the various other groups?  Certainly, we will all be going back to our party leaders today urging for full support, which I know we have.  Rather than keep talking, it is a question of what constructive actions we can use now.</p></speech>

We must be brutally frank and honest with the Irish Government and explain that we are seriously concerned about a vacuum that is developing in the democratic process which needs to be filled.  One excellent way of filling it is through the civic forum, which was a vital part of the Good Friday Agreement.  It was put there because there was a recognition then, as there is now, that we need the widest possible spectrum of people involved.  We must put that to the British Government because the Unionists simply will not do anything if the pressures are not there.</p></speech>

Justice for the Forgotten was formed in 1996 to represent and support the bereaved families and survivors of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  We have gradually extended our remit over the years to include the families of other bomb attacks in the South during the 1970s, including the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973 as well as the Belturbet, Dundalk and Castleblayney bombings.  We also represent the families of the Miami Showband and several families whose relatives were killed in single incident attacks.  Justice for the Forgotten, JFF, is the only dedicated organisation working with victims in this jurisdiction and is best placed to deliver services that are supportive and sensitive to the needs of victims.  Our services are available to anyone bereaved or injured as a result of the conflict, regardless of political or religious affiliation.</p> <p>Our work in the past included assisting the efforts of the late Judge Henry Barron during his inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan and other bomb attacks.  Justice for the Forgotten made 52 submissions to Judge Barron during the course of his investigations; we carried out our own inquiries and we interviewed people with information.  Uniquely for an NGO, we were authorised by the judge to suggest lines of inquiry for the inquiry to pursue, signifying our authoritative knowledge and experience of the cases before him.<br />During the lifetime of the Remembrance Commission, we assisted the State extensively by identifying and locating many victims' families and survivors.  We were responsible for channelling at least &euro;1.5 million of the commission's fund to victims.  The Remembrance Commission was established as a result of the recommendations of the late former victims' commissioner, John Wilson, in his report, <i>A Place and a Name, </i>published in August 1999.<br />We were centrally involved in the procurement of permanent memorials in the State.  We approached and liaised with councils and the Remembrance Commission in this regard.  To their credit, the councils contacted responded enthusiastically, providing partial funding for the memorials, the core funding for which came from the funds of the Remembrance Commission.  As a result of these efforts, memorials were erected in Belturbet, Castleblayney, Dundalk and in Dublin for the Miami Showband.  Memorials had already been secured in Talbot Street and Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin, and in Monaghan for the 1974 bombings.  A memorial for the victims of the 1972 and 1973 bombings was set into the pavement in Sackville Place, with financial assistance from Dublin Bus.  The unveiling ceremonies of these memorials were very moving occasions, when the relief and joy on the faces of the families that their loved ones were being given official recognition was evident, and whole towns came out to commemorate with the families.  This experience brought home to us the importance of physical structures of remembrance, not only to families and survivors, but to the wider communities in which they are placed.  We provided counselling and holistic therapies where requested, but we found that the focus of the majority of those we represent was in recovering the truth of what happened to their loved ones.<br />We were funded for a decade by the Government from 2000 to 2009.  When the Government withdrew our funding, and we failed to procure an alternative despite strenuous efforts on our part, we were forced to close our doors in July 2010.  However, the Pat Finucane Centre, based in the North, came to our rescue and managed to secure limited funding for us as part of its organisation under the PEACE III programme.  As a result, we were able to re-open in December 2010.  The funding covers just one salary, travel and room hire expenses.  Funding to run a Dublin office was refused because we were and are outside of Special EU Programmes Body's remit.  This limited funding will end in June 2014.  Much work remains to be done.<br />Although the Barron inquiries provided a considerable amount of new information, giving much solace and comfort to the families concerned, the outstanding thorny issue remaining, ten years after the publication of the Dublin and Monaghan report, is the failure of the British Government to co-operate in any meaningful way with Judge Barron's investigations.  In his report on Dublin and Monaghan, the judge said that the value of information provided by the NIO was reduced because of the reluctance to make original documents available and London's refusal to supply other information on security grounds had resulted in the scope of his report being limited.  The British Government has, so far, failed to comply with two D&aacute;il motions passed unanimously on 10 July 2008 and 17 May 2011, calling on it to make the undisclosed files available to an independent, international judicial figure for assessment.  Over the past year we have been in discussions with the British ambassador on how a way forward might be found, but despite some hopeful signs, no positive outcome has yet been achieved.  We hope to continue our discussions with him in the coming months.<br />We had a significant breakthrough recently when the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland accepted that our complaint regarding the RUC's investigation into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings fell within its remit.  Its historical directorate's investigation is due to begin this year.  Another single incident case, whose family we represent, was also accepted by the police ombudsman in November.  We have submitted a complaint on behalf of the Dundalk families and are awaiting a decision on that case.  We will be submitting further complaints in respect of the other bomb attacks in the coming months.  The Miami Showband case was accepted more than a year ago, but those murders occurred within the boundary of Northern Ireland.  We view the investigation of deaths that occurred in this jurisdiction by a Northern Ireland statutory body as very significant progress, as the remit of the historical enquiries team was confined to Northern Ireland.<br />We are liaising with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about the Belturbet bombing case, for which the chief superintendent for the Cavan and Monaghan division has recently taken direct responsibility.  I confirmed this morning that I will be meeting with him next week to discuss the Belturbet bombing.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Monaghan is also reviewing another single incident murder case, at our request, for any new evidential opportunities.<br />Justice for the Forgotten, along with the Pat Finucane Centre, has been centrally involved in researching archival material over many years in both the National Archives of Ireland and the UK National Archives in Kew.  Some of the results of this research have been included in Anne Cadwallader's best-selling book, <i>Lethal Allies, </i>on which she will brief the committee shortly.<br />A decade of commemorations has begun during which the centenary of many key historical events in our country will rightly be remembered.  This year also marks the fortieth anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in which 34 people lost their lives, the greatest loss of life in a single day of the entire Troubles.  We intend organising special events to commemorate this significant anniversary and would welcome any suggestions or assistance the committee may be able to provide in order to make this a truly memorable one for the families and survivors.<br />As I mentioned earlier, the cost of funding a Dublin-based office was refused under the PEACE III programme because we are outside of the Special EU Programmes Body's geographical remit.  From the outset, that body's remit was confined to the social and economic development of the six northern counties and the six counties immediately south of the Border.  However, although we recognise that the development of economic and social conditions are very important, the most tragic and continuing legacy of the past is the impact on families and communities of the loss of life of family members and friends and the injuries and trauma suffered by survivors.  We face a situation at the end of June 2014 when the PEACE III programme ends, of once again being placed in the position in which we found ourselves in 2010.  PEACE IV funding will not come on stream before 2016, which may provide us again with limited funding.  A new service, the Victims and Survivors Service, has been established in Northern Ireland, which will provide funding for victims' organisations within Northern Ireland.  However, it has no remit to fund victims organisations outside of Northern Ireland.<br />We are bound to ask why it is considered that victims of the same conflict, but who were killed outside the territory of Northern Ireland, have a lesser need than those killed within its boundaries.  Some 120 people were killed in the Republic during the Troubles - 51 of them in Dublin alone.  Additionally, some families who lost loved ones in Northern Ireland subsequently moved to the Republic.  The Victims Commissioner for Northern Ireland, Ms Kathryn Stone, invited us, along with representatives from the Tim Parry and Jonathan Ball Foundation in Britain, who are in the same difficult position as ourselves, to meet with her recently to discuss our funding problems.  The meeting was also attended by representatives from the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and the Victims and Survivors Service.</p> <p>The Victims' Commissioner expressed her concern at the exclusion of organisations outside of Northern Ireland from funding opportunities.  At a recent conference in the Stormont Hotel, Mr. Kenny Donaldson of Innocent Victims United appealed for equal funding opportunities to be made available to victims' organisations in the Republic of Ireland and Britain.  </p><p> While we acknowledge the funding and support we received from the Government in the past, there now seems to be a general amnesia, in the media, in civil society and even in Government, that there are victims of the Troubles in this State.  While we readily accept that the great majority of victims are within the North, nevertheless it has to be recognised that victims here have continuing needs too.  It is only fair to point out that the Government does fund the Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains and also provides assistance for a defined number of injured survivors who need medical aids such as prostheses, hearing aids, etc., but the greatest need for the majority of victims is in the area of truth recovery.</p><p> Any truth recovery process has to be inclusive of all victims of the Troubles.  While it is our view that the proposals of Drs. Haass and O'Sullivan were constructive and worthwhile, the amnesia to which I have referred is, unfortunately, evident in the proposed Haass agreement of 31 December 2013 as denoted by its final published draft.  The draft tells us that the proposed historical investigations unit would "take forward the remaining caseload of the HET and the conflict-related cases before the PONI".  This fails to take into account the many cases in the Republic which would not be eligible to be brought before police ombudsman and the remit of the HET has, since its inception, been limited to Northern Ireland.</p><p> The response by Amnesty International to the failure of the Haass talks reinforces this sense of amnesia.  The executive director of Amnesty International Ireland said: 'We are disappointed the parties failed to reach an agreement on dealing with the past, but determined to press for truth and justice for all victims in Northern Ireland."  He should, of course, have said: "for all victims of the conflict."  We appeal to the committee that, in the event of the Haass proposals being taken forward in the future, to make representations to the relevant parties to ensure that all victims are treated equally.  This may necessitate the passage of specific legislation.</p><p> On the issue of funding, where there are structures in place including the North-South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, it cannot pose an insurmountable problem to find a way to provide very modest funding for a small organisation in order that it may continue the work I have outlined to the committee today.  Dublin, Westminster and Stormont should be able to reach agreement on this issue.  We appeal to the committee to use its influence in this area also.</p><p> Failure to treat all victims equally is discriminatory and, in the absence of equality, talk of reconciliation rings very hollow indeed.</p></speech>

Some members may remember me from my previous incarnation as BBC correspondent in Dublin for five years in the 1980s and later as <i>Irish Press</i>political reporter in Leinster House at the end of the 1980s.  It is great to be here as a participant and not just as a journalist.  I am here specifically to speak about the book we have just published, <i>Lethal Allies</i>.  In case anybody thinks, because it is a best seller, that I am about to retire and move to Bermuda, I am not getting any funding from it.  Any money we make in profit will be ploughed back into the PFC because, as Ms Margaret Urwin said, our funding runs out in June.  After that, who knows what will happen?  However, it will keep us going for about a day and a half.<br />Some of the reviewers of the book have used the term that the Pat Finucane Centre is a campaign group for republican victims.  I want to correct that.  There is nothing wrong with being a republican - far from it - but we are really defenders of everybody's human rights and we are also involved in an outreach to the Unionist community which, for obvious reasons, we cannot go into in too much detail.  We help anyone who comes and asks us for help.  We are named after Pat Finucane.  The Finucane family is well capable of campaigning on its own behalf.  We believe, as he did before he was murdered, that the best way of upholding human rights is through the law, through the imposition of the law with fairness and equality on everyone.  <br />A third of the people killed, whose deaths I detail in <i>Lethal Allies</i>, were killed south of the Border and most of them in Dublin.  Let us eschew any partitionist mentality in our brains.  The violence affected everyone in the 32 counties of Ireland, North and South, and everybody should be treated equally.  <br />It is interesting to note that most of those murdered in the North were not republicans - in fact, only one was a republican.  He was killed just south of the Border, probably by some undercover British execution squad.  Most of those killed were civilians, non-combatants, and included civil servants, shopkeepers, farmers, a pharmacist, a metal fabricator, musicians, the Miami Showband, an ambulance driver and so on, while six were members of the SDLP, which was their only involvement, and some were members of the GAA.  Others were probably killed merely because they were successful and were part of that new generation of upwardly mobile Catholic well-educated middle class and it was decided they had to be intimidated and some of them had to be killed.  That is what happened.<br />There is much accusatory talk at the moment about people trying to rewrite history.  There is nothing wrong with rewriting history if one is rewriting it accurately.  The PFC, unashamedly, says we are involved in trying to rewrite history.  What we have discovered from our research is that it simply does not fit in with the history, the dominant narrative, as it is called by academics, of the conflict that has so far been told.  It is in everybody's interest to reject propaganda and speculation and any inaccuracies from wherever they come and focus on facts.  As Dr. Haass put it in his proposals, the time to rise to this challenge is now.  We do not have the luxury of putting it off any longer.  We must ensure the past does not overwhelm the present and the future.<br />I wish to speak about <i>Lethal Allies.</i>The book has sold more than 12,000 copies so far.  We are travelling to Brussels later this month and to the US in March.  Most of the real investigative work was done by my colleagues before I joined the PFC.  I put it all together which was a difficult task.<br />What is different about <i>Lethal Allies</i>is very simple. It is based on fact.  There is nothing in the book that has been challenged since it was written.  Nobody has come back to tell us we got something wrong.  That is not to say it will not happen in due course but so far, thank God, it has not happened because everything we wrote was checked and rechecked and is factual.  It was so important to get facts out, not opinion, not speculation.  <br />The book came about because there was a story to tell - the story about the wasted lives of 120 people.  It is a story about the failure of both the British and Irish states to defend the lives of their citizens.  The key lesson to be learned from <i>Lethal Allies</i>is that collusion fuelled the conflict.  Did collusion bring the violence to an end a single day earlier than it did?  No.  Did collusion save a single life?  No.  As Father Denis Faul put it, collusion taught Nationalists that they could not trust the police, the UDR or the courts.  Confidence in the rule of law collapsed.<br />There may still be people even sitting in this room who believe that collusion is both propaganda and did not happen, that it is made up.  It is true the word has been overused like a political sledgehammer.  Both sides of the community and those who live in the South have much to gain from understanding its nature.  Facing up to the past is going to be like looking at one's own face in the mirror after a hard night, sometimes not the easiest of experiences.</p> <p>It all started off with my colleague who works with me in Armagh, Mr. Alan Brecknell whose father was shot dead and blown up in an indiscriminate attack on a bar in 1975.  His family were told not to come to his funeral because they would be attacked by the IRA, which was far from the truth.  When he discovered that was a lie, because his father was killed by loyalists, he started investigating, and enlisted the support of the Pat Finucane Centre, PFC.  The PFC spent many years working hard on investigating what went on.  That was helped immensely when the then Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, whatever his other failings, supported by the Oireachtas, ordered the inquiry under Mr. Justice Henry Barron.  His work resulted in vital forensic evidence about the so-far hidden links between perpetrators and ballistic and forensic links coming into the public domain.  He had the facts.  His final report prompted the joint committee to conclude that it had no doubt that collusion between the British security forces and what it called terrorists was behind many if not all the atrocities considered.  The joint committee said the British Cabinet was aware of the level to which the security forces had been infiltrated and its failure to respond had allowed the problem to grow.<br />The Mr. Justice Barron inquiry stepped up the process a gear or two and then the Historical Enquiries Team, HET stepped it up another gear or two when it began work.  A critical fact for us was that the HET officers had access to what in our sphere of influence was considered the Holy Grail, the RUC secure depository of files in Carrickfergus.  They were security vetted so they could get the files.  At the start, many officers were sceptical about collusion as they regarded it as propaganda, but when they saw the files, they began to talk not about alleged collusion but about collusion.  I am tempted to describe what they found as a goldmine, but that would be gilding the lily.  One senior officer described to me that they had discovered a cesspool, as it was referred to.  Individuals were making a significant difference.  Meanwhile the PFC and Justice for the Forgotten were also continuing the work of investigating the national archives in London, finding much of interest, including the fact the British knew as early as 1973 that the UDR was hopelessly infiltrated by loyalist paramilitaries but did nothing about it.  We also found that weapons were disappearing routinely from UDR armouries right, left and centre, month after month and were being used to kill people.  As the HET's reports began to emerge, families began to understand what had been kept from them for more than three decades.<br />I will give an example.  Members will be aware of Mr. Eugene Reavey and what his family went through.  The three brothers of Eugene Reavey were killed almost exactly 38 years ago on 4 January 1976.  One gun that was used to kill them was a Sterling sub-machine gun.  Five months after the murder of the Reavey brothers, the same gun was used in a gun and bomb attack on the Rock Bar in south Armagh, in which each and every single assailant was a serving RUC officer.  It had been stolen from Glenanne UDR base and it was used to murder eight other people, including SDLP branch chairman, Mr. Denis Mullen, an elderly farming couple, Alan Brecknell's father, Trevor, and two others in the same incident, including a 14 year old boy.  A tenth man was shot dead, after which the gun was recovered.  The gun had killed 11 people in 11 months, leaving 19 children fatherless, orphaning five children, yet the HET could find no evidence on an investigation into the disappearance of this gun.  A second gun, a Luger used to kill the Reavey brothers had also been used to kill Se&aacute;n Farmer and Colm McCartney, a cousin of Seamus Heaney, as they returned home from an All Ireland semi-final at Croke Park.  It was also used in the attack on the Rock Bar.  The guns were being shared and swapped and taken from the UDR and were used by both serving RUC officers and loyalist paramilitaries.  It did not matter.  They got the guns and used them to kill people.  This was never investigated.<br />Another example is when four serving police officers were involved in an attack on the bar called the Step Inn.  It was known about in advance and it could have been stopped by the stroke of a policeman's pen.  It went ahead and two people were killed, the mother of three young boys and a young plumber who played GAA.  The RUC special branch knew all about it and knew about the involvement of four police officers in that attack, yet did nothing to prevent it.  When it happened, they did nothing to investigate it.  Those families have only recently discovered the facts and are on the brink of taking legal action, which they are very reluctant to take for obvious reasons.  However, how else can they make accountable those who failed to uphold their rights?<br />There are questions about the role of Mr. Robin Jackson, possibly the most prolific killer during the entire period of the Troubles.  He probably killed between 50 and 100 people.  It has been established beyond any shadow of doubt that he was an RUC agent.  He was allowed to continue.  He died of natural causes.  There are many people in the North who lost their relatives as a result of his work.<br />The families we speak for, and all other bereaved families, have an inalienable right to the truth.  They are the real losers in the conflict.  The wider society in Britain and Ireland also needs to discover the truth about collusion.  In a normal crime context, the police gather evidence - forensic, admissions, eye-witness evidence.  If that crime is collusion, who is there to seek evidence?  Those directly involved hardly qualify.<br />In an article in the current edition of <i>History Ireland</i>, Professor James Hughes of the London School of Economics writes that the British Army's abuses of human rights in the North were not &quot;merely low-level tactical excesses by undisciplined and racist troops but ... institutional, systematic, and approved or covered-up at the highest levels&quot;.  Professor Hughes and others, point to more current disasters in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The British Government currently faces a complaint on behalf of 400 Iraqi families at the International Criminal Court alleging they represent thousands of people tortured, shot, hooded, sexually assaulted and subjected to mock executions.  In recent days, the British Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, has ordered an investigation into claims that the SAS was involved in the storming of the Golden Temple at Amritsar in which between 400 and 1,000 people were killed.<br />We owe it, not just to our children but also to grandchildren, to continue this work, because the work we have done shows we can establish the facts about the violent past, and when the past is honestly faced up to and examined, it has a reconciling quality.  We owe it to people living far away in current theatres of war, and those yet to come, that we must learn from the past.  Otherwise all we can say is that we do not learn from the past, which would be a tragedy.  That is a tragedy we are trying to prevent.</p></speech>

Ms Cadwallader has done the public a service in the publication of the book <i>Lethal Allies</i>.  As the Chairman said it is chilling to read the stories.  Some months ago, I heard the former Deputy First Minister, Mr. Seamus Mallon, recall in graphic detail some of the atrocities that were carried out in parts of Armagh.  Some months ago, we had the opportunity to listen to Ms Denise Mullen and Mr. Eugene Reavey giving their account of the atrocities that were committed against their families.  I have been familiar with the work of the group Justice for the Forgotten for some years through Ms Urwin, with particular reference to the atrocities and murders that were carried out in my constituency in Belturbet, Monaghan and Castleblayney.  It is most disappointing that the British Government has so far failed to comply with two D&aacute;il motions that were passed unanimously in 2008 and 2011.  This committee should send a unanimous recommendation to the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and directly to the British ambassador reiterating our concern that the British Government has failed abysmally to take into account the concerns expressed unanimously by a sovereign parliament.<br />Ms Urwin mentioned the celebratory occasions, which is probably not the right word, when monuments were unveiled.  I was very glad to be able to participate in the unveiling of the memorial in Belturbet.  It gives official recognition to the desperate murder of young people on that night in December 1972 in Belturbet.</p> <p>In my dealings with the families, the only message I got from them was that they wanted the truth.  None of them ever wanted revenge.  I compliment the families, Justice for the Forgotten and the Pat Finucane Centre on the dignified manner in which they have worked and on their commitment to advocating on behalf of the bereaved.  I am glad that some of them were able to be present today.  I know some of the names that were read out, having attended the commemoration of the Dublin bombing on Talbot Street each year.  We should send a firm request to the Taoiseach or the T&aacute;naiste asking him to seek British Government co-operation again.  We should also send that request to the British ambassador, given how our guests have been in discussion with him for a considerable period.<br />When <i>Lethal Allies: British Collusion in Ireland</i>was published, I read it immediately.  It does a public service in outlining the campaign of murdering innocent people that was assisted by so-called state forces.</p></speech>

I had the courtesy of Ms Cadwallader's presentation in the House of Commons a couple of months ago.<br />I support the need to find the truth so as to ensure that the elements of the Haass outcomes dealing with the past are implemented by way of legislation.  This matter builds on the Eames-Bradley report.  Collusion fuelled the conflict.  People are looking for truth, some measure of justice and accountability from the British and Irish Governments.<br />I take Ms Urwin's point, which was re-emphasised by Deputy Smith, about the two D&aacute;il motions that the British Government has failed to recognise or acknowledge.  Those of us who are Members of the House of Commons have a duty and responsibility to pursue the British Government in this regard.  We will do so.<br />Recently, we learned courtesy of <i>The Guardian</i>that the British Government had Ministry of Defence files at Swadlincote in Derbyshire, many of which related to the North and state collusion.  As late as June 2013, the Historical Enquiries Team, HET, did not know that these files were available or what they contained.  We must force them out into the open.  As has been stated, there could be information in them that relates directly to what happened in the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and could be of help to Justice for the Forgotten.  The committee could pursue this matter and make overtures to the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the British ambassador.  We in the House of Commons will follow it through.  A colleague of Ms Cadwallader's, Mr. Ian Cobain of <i>The Guardian</i>, is also anxious to pursue these matters.<br />Ms Cadwallader has done us all a significant service with <i>Lethal Allies: British Collusion in Ireland</i>.  She has shone a light where others were afraid to do so, namely, on collusion, its impact and how weapons that belonged to state forces were used and misused to kill innocent people in many parts of the North.  I know some of their families well.  Those people eschewed violence.  All they wanted was to be a part of the democratic process and bring about a shared and reconciled society in the North and on this island.<br />As Deputy Smith stated, it is important that the Irish Government put pressure on the British Government to bring this necessary truth and justice forward so that we can put to bed once and for all the terrible atrocities of the past.  Of equal importance, we must examine the element raised by Ms Urwin, that being, the Haass talks did not consider other victims.  A light must be shone on this as well.  The other elements of the Haass talks must result in implementation, legislation and resolution, since these are the most important issues.  We must never forget the trauma, pain and suffering of all of the victims and survivors.</p></speech>

I thank her for the work done by Justice for the Forgotten.</p><p>  I am encouraged that the Barron inquiry provided a great deal of new information and has supported Justice for the Forgotten.  What more could this committee do?  I am a member of the North-South Interparliamentary Association.  If we could be helpful, please let us know.</p><p>  The Troubles were difficult times.  Our State did not forget, but it occasionally did not want to remember much of what happened.  The Dublin-Monaghan bombings are not remembered in the way the State should.  My observation includes myself, in that I may have been remiss.  Sometimes, we have not been sent invitations.  This matter should be further up the list.  More than 50 innocent people died on that day, but they have been forgotten.</p><p>  I thank Ms Cadwallader for her work.  It was shocking.  We have met Mr. Eugene Reavey and I am familiar with the Glenanne area.  When one drives through Markethill or Bessbrook, the nearest village is Camlough.  Within a mile of each other across fields are two completely different communities.  Given that such murder and bloodshed occurred in small rural communities across the island, it is shocking that this information is only coming out now.</p><p>  Has the HET been helpful and where should it go?  It has been established, but I have heard that some of its investigations have not been helpful.</p><p>  I come from Boyle, County Roscommon, which has not been at the coalface of the Troubles.  One tries to understand them, but it is difficult to do so, as one did not go through them.  Forgive where I am coming from.  We all want to see solace and truth for the island and its people who suffered.  What would be the best way forward?  Would it be a truth commission?  Politicians are grappling with this issue and want to do what is right.</p><p>  I thank our guests for their submissions.  As Ms Ritchie stated, they have shone a light where we have all sometimes feared to tread, as doing so could be inconvenient.  </p></speech>

It is an all-too-familiar story.  Deputy Feighan mentioned the village of Camlough, where I was born and reared and still live.  It was bombed indiscriminately twice during the period described by Ms Cadwallader.  Indeed, a neighbour of mine was picked up at our front gate, driven half a mile up the road and murdered.  Those responsible reversed over him as well to ensure that he was dead.  It was widely believed at the time that the people involved were local RUC personnel from the neighbouring village of Bessbrook, where their station was.</p> <p>That was a familiar pattern.  It was not just the involvement of people in the actual events but it was the fact the areas were cleared.  Helicopters disappeared.  There was a level of co-ordination beyond just those involved in the actual shootings, which ensured attacks could be carried out in villages and bars in Nationalist areas generally and on individual families.  It also ensured those involved were not interrupted in their endeavours.  Those above that again ensured there was no proper investigation and, right up to Cabinet level, people were aware all this was happening and took no action in regard to it.</p><p> What happened in Ireland was a familiar pattern which developed in many other colonial sites of conflict that Britain managed over the years, including in Kenya, Aden and other places.  It simply perfected and professionalised it more as it went through the conflict in Ireland in regard to collusion, shoot to kill, arming and providing intelligence to loyalist paramilitaries.  It was a very familiar pattern.  None the less, I think Ms Cadwallader's book has done a great service not just in repeating the facts which we, as a community, knew them to be but in using what limited investigations there were into them to nail down those facts.  That has been a great service.</p><p> I refer to two issues, including the resource issue for Justice for the Forgotten that seems to have fallen between two stools as the Special EU Programmes Body remit does not stretch that far.  The committee should support the mainstreaming of resources for the Justice for the Forgotten group from the Government in this jurisdiction.  It provides a very valuable service to victims as well as to the ongoing pursuit of the truth in or around the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.</p><p> Ms Richie alluded to the fact that in the implementation of the Haass proposals, in particular dealing with the past, if there is a gap or a weakness, even though the origins of these attacks which took place in this State were from the North, which generally speaking is the area in which I live, the victims were from and the attacks took place on the southern side of the Border.  If that proves to be a gap in the systems proposed out of Haass, that is something we need to address through legislation to ensure we do not leave people behind.  As Ms Richie said, the conflict did not just affect the people in the Six Counties but people across the island.  Attacks took place across the island, even beyond the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  Dublin was attacked again in the 1990s when Martin Doherty was killed trying to prevent the bombing of a pub.  We must ensure that if we get to the stage of implementing the Haass proposals and looking at legislation, there are no gaps in that legislation so that all incidents are covered and all victims are supported in that regard.</p></speech>

I do not want to go over what was said but I support what Mr. Murphy said in regard to funding for Justice for the Forgotten.  If our sincerity means anything, we must allow the group to continue its work without concern about finance.  It will continue that work, irrespective of funding.  Its determination in regard to this sad piece of history is wonderful.  It is great that people care and understand the trauma experienced by and worries faced by the families.  We must ensure funding is put in place and that we make the strongest recommendation possible to the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste to allow the group to continue its good work without any concerns.  When one is doing research and so on, one must be able to hire people and incur costs.  All those things are pragmatic and they must be addressed.  I hope this committee agrees to make those representations in order that those concerns of the group will be put to bed once and for all.</p><p>  People spoke about Ms Cadwallader's wonderful book.  It is wonderful in that it underpins the thoughts and ideas which were out there.  Further pressure can be applied on the British Government by those in a position to do so, such as ourselves, ministerial committees, etc, to get it to assist in regard to any records or otherwise it has.  Ms Cadwallader has underpinned the truth.  That is what these meetings and this committee are about.  They give people the opportunity to state their case and enable us to move on.  There is no use in us just listening.  We must take action as well and apply pressure on Departments or Ministers to move this on to the next stage, which is the British Government making these records and so on available.  I hope we will move this on to the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and that we will ensure the concerns about the funding of the group are not in any way undermined and are resolved.</p></speech>

I pay special tribute to Ms Urwin on the tremendous work she and her group have done in keeping that terrible injustice alive and in the public eye and on the work they have done trying to highlight and get justice for the families of those who died, and I think it was said 150 people died in this State.  Great credit is due to them.  What is embarrassing, from a political point of view, is that the Government has failed to give any funding towards the continuation of the good work the group is doing.  Like everybody here, we will make a representation that I hope does not fall on deaf ears, although that happens to be the case in many instances.<br />I read Ms Cadwallader's book, on which I commend her.  She has done a tremendous service to truth and justice by putting pen to paper in this regard.  What is striking and very annoying when one reads part of the 2003 Barron report is that the Irish Government showed little interest in the bombings, and when information was given to it suggesting British authorities had intelligence, namely, the bombers, it was not followed up.  Again, a huge question mark surrounds the lack of follow through on information given to the Irish Government.<br />I read <i>Lethal Allies</i>over Christmas.  During the 1970s, in particular, Raymond Murray, Denis Faul and Cardinal Conway continually outlined what was happening in that area, which was known as the murder triangle, and brought it to public and political attention, but there was continuous denial about was happening.  All of that has come to pass.<br />Robin Jackson, Ted Sinclair, James Mitchell, Kerr, the Somervilles and all those who were actively involved in killing innocent people, mainly of the Catholic persuasion, all had an association at one time or another with the so-called security forces and were allowed to continue to operate and carry out the killing of a large number of innocent people.  They targeted people because they were Catholics.  I read where the GOC encouraged people to use the UDA to protect their communities, irrespective of what it had done.  What it was allowed to get away with was disgraceful.</p> <p>People highlighted it at the time.  I remember vividly that it was continuously brought to the attention of the Government here by Fr. Raymond Murray and the then Cardinal Conway.  As documented in Ms Cadwallader's book, several meetings took place with the cardinal and members of the British Government at the time, yet nothing was done.  It was allowed to continue.  I will quote a passage from Ms Cadwallader's book regarding Robin Jackson:<blockquote><br />Everything people have whispered about Robin Jackson for years was perfectly true.  He was a hired gun; a professional assassin.  He was responsible for more deaths in the North than any other person I knew.  The Jackal killed people for a living.  The state not only knew he was doing it, its servants encouraged him to kill his political opponents and protected him.</blockquote>It is a major indictment of the British political system that nothing was done to stop this person.  It is not that they did not have evidence.  He had been arrested.  They had raided Sinclair's house, one of the farmyards used in the killings in that area.  They had found a silencer with his fingerprints on the gun.  They had stopped him in a car and found a loaded gun in the car that was taken from a raid on a UDR station, yet they allowed him continue.  To this day the British Government, as is the case with the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and other killings in the South, has not come clean about what happened.  It has shut the door on it.  As it leads right to its doorstep, it was sanctioned at the highest level that these people were allowed continue.<br />In one of our last meetings just before Christmas representatives of Families of the Disappeared came before us.  One man had lost three brothers, the Reavey brothers who were killed.  He met us individually and told us that a very senior RUC officer supplied the weapons that killed his brothers, and he continued to operate for many years after that incident.  These were hired killers working for the state, in collusion with the state, to kill either political opponents or to terrorise a Nationalist Catholic community into submission.  That is what this was all about.<br />I have one question for Ms Cadwallader.  Regarding her research on which tremendous work was done and on which I understand she got a great deal of support, did she get any help from the Government in the South or from agencies of the Government in the South?  It is a personal question but we are coming up against a blank wall.  Everybody knows what happened.  Everybody knows that the bombers left Mitchell's farm to come to bomb Dublin.  Everybody knows that.  Everybody knows that Billy Hanna was the main person involved in that.  Robin Jackson was involved in that but nothing has been done about it.  That is from the mid-1970s when Weir and McConnell went public on it.  Colin Wallace went public on it in 1997 or 1998 and named those involved in it, but nothing has been done about it.  Despite the fact it has been asked to co-operate by two motions passed in the House of the Oireachtas, the British Government has done nothing about this.  I would like Ms Cadwallader's comments on that.  I thank both witnesses for the tremendous work they are doing and ask them to keep it up because the truth will surface eventually.</p></speech>

I congratulate Ms Urwin on her presentation, which brought back memories for me.  I was a student the evening the bomb went off in Dublin and I know how scary and dangerous it was and how bewildered people were at the time.  I would commit to doing anything to ensure they get justice, which I will come to shortly.  I congratulate Ms Cadwallader on the success of the book because it has been a tremendous asset to many of us in tying together the threads of collusion that were running through many events.  While the Historical Enquiries Team, HET, had done some useful individual work, it took Ms Cadwallader to pull it all together in her book.  I have found it immensely useful.</p><p>  I want to put on the record that from my perspective, surviving victims, and by that I mean the injured, and surviving relatives of the innocent people who were killed, need and deserve the truth.  There is an onus on us all, whether we are operating in the North or in the South, and particularly those of us in public life, to ensure the truth is delivered.  We have to do all we can in that regard.  Funding for Justice for the Forgotten is a small aspect of that and I urge colleagues on the committee to support any effort that can be made to ensure some funding is given to this group to sustain it because it is doing a very useful job, fulfilling a very useful role and it should not be allowed reach a point where it cannot function.</p><p>  There is a great deal of information to be absorbed and dealt with and I am grateful to the two people who presented to the committee for informing and educating us across the entire victims and survivors spectrum.</p></speech>

I am humbled by Ms Margaret Urwin's continuous drive to get justice for the forgotten.  What she has done on her own is awesome.  I thank her very much for that.  I concur with my colleague, Deputy Frank Feighan, that it would be appropriate, and this is not a criticism of the commemoration of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, that we would put pressure on the Government in this regard.  People have empathy with and understanding for this particular group of people, but we should try to engage with the broader Irish community.  That is not a criticism but the Irish people should know about this.  Over the years, if one ever suggested there was collusion, people would think one was off the wall; they would not believe it.  What I found in Ms Cadwallader's book is that at long last it dealt with facts.  Like Ms Urwin, Ms Cadwallader is a true Irish patriot.</p><p>  In the summary of her book Ms Cadwallader states that an agreed truth recovery process is needed not only for the families of the people in the North but for both communities to try to learn from the past.  What type of truth recovery process would Ms Cadwallader suggest?</p><p>  I record that my former colleague in the Seanad, Tony Kett, told me many times that Tony Blair, who I believe should be in The Hague, along with George W. Bush, for all the crimes they have committed and the lies the two Governments told about Iraq where people continue to be killed every day, told the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, that they would not open up any inquiry in this regard or on the Pat Finucane issue.  I spoke here to the best friend of the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, who is a friend of mine also, and he told me Blair has insisted he will not allow any transparency in terms of what has happened.  That is a fact.  I thank the two witnesses.</p></speech>

I have met families whose relatives were killed over the years, and some of my friends have been killed, but one of the most important things we can do here today is come up with recommendations on how we can move the process forward.</p> <p>I would like the witnesses to outline their recommendations on how to deal with this area.  They have made the point about the ones they have investigated from the South.  What are their recommendations for the South?<br />Ms Urwin spoke about funding ending in June.  Where will Justice for the Forgotten go from here?  She also spoke about the Ball and Parry families.  Could she suggest a way forward for the different Government bodies?<br />For those listening at home, how would the witnesses respond to the simplistic narrative of those who say we should forget the past and move on?  Some people say that the historical enquiries team is unfair, that it  focuses on loyalists not republicans and that it is time to put that to bed, to forget about it.  They say that it does not help the process of peace and reconciliation on the island.  How do the witnesses respond to that narrative?<br />We hear the idea that there were a few bad apples in the UDR and the RUC who were generally the best of men and women.  There is no doubt that there were good people in those organisations, who were there for their own fine reasons.  Do the witnesses believe that there were a few bad apples or do they believe that it was part of a British Government strategy?  When I was younger I read Frank Kitson&rsquo;s book, <i>Low Intensity Operations</i>which dealt with the counter-gangs involved in the war in the North and the mobile reaction force, MRF.  People talked about communities living side by side, Protestant and Catholic, with no tradition of conflict or tension and the impact that many of these killings had on those communities.  It seemed to be a deliberate policy to try to create tension between communities.  The recent book about the MRF described taking pot shots and killing people and so on.  It also killed people on the loyalist side, Protestants, as well as Catholics, and tried to kill republicans.  It was a negative influence.<br />The narrative we hear today is that when the Brits were there they were honest brokers.  The appalling vista is that a Prime Minister would know about a shoot-to-kill policy.  There was a pattern in many of the killings to secure the area, those who engaged in the killings were allowed through road blocks and so on.  I do not think that the narrative that Ms Cadwallader offers in her book will take off.  There is an agreed, accepted narrative about the conflict in the past.  That is one reason why many of those opposed to dealing with the past do not want a method for dealing with the past.  Maybe that is why the previous contributors spoke about the Haass proposals.  There are people fighting the war in the background.  They do not want their own past to come out.  When the truth does come out, and hopefully it will sooner rather than later, that will move peace and reconciliation forward on the island for all of us.  A structure for this has to be established.  I would be interested in hearing the witnesses&rsquo; views on what that structure should be. </p></speech>

I appreciate the time constraint so I will be brief.  I congratulate and commend both witnesses on their contributions today.  Ms Cadwallader's book sounds chilling.  The truth and statements contained in it are absolutely overwhelming.  It is unbelievable.</p><p>  I met Ms Urwin in Monaghan and concur with her that we must do whatever we can.  When I met her two years ago funding was a big issue.  I am sorry that she is back here two years later and that we have made no progress on that.  She is to be commended on her work.

I thank Ms Urwin and Ms Cadwallader for their contributions.  I have met Ms Urwin many times.  She is a Trojan worker.  I do not know how she keeps it up because it is a huge task and a demanding one.  I have not read Ms Cadwallader&rsquo;s book yet but I hope to do so soon.</p><p>  I have been a republican all my life.  I have been involved in the republican struggle.  Like many republicans I have always believed that there was a British Government agenda, a huge behind-the-scenes influence on the conflict as it unfolded.  Living in the South I saw that many people did not fully understand that.  I believe the Irish Government and the State were happy enough that people did not get the proper information.  In my opinion the Irish Government was aware of much that was going on, that there was a lot of collusion.  The Governments during that period were in contact with the British Government and its security services, passing information.  The Irish Government has questions to answer about those who were in government at the time.  That this was going on has passed under many people&rsquo;s radar.</p><p>  People in the nationalist and republican areas knew this was happening but it did not seem to come across and there did not seem to be any big outcry.  I happened to be in Dublin on the night of the bombings.  I was going to a stag party and got off the bus in North Frederick Street when I heard the explosions.  Unfortunately, that remains in my memory.  The truth has to come out and there has to be a mechanism found for everybody to speak out.</p> <p>It does not matter whether a person is republican or loyalist.  Whoever was involved in what happened and unfolded, it is better the truth comes out.  We have members of families who need to know what happened to their family members.  We need to have closure for the many people who have been affected.  I hope, in time, whether it is through a truth commission or otherwise, that we will get a full picture across the board of what happened, how things unfolded and what happened to people's family members.  That is what I hope to see in the future.  I look forward to finding a proper mechanism to do that.</p></speech>

I was asked whether I think the historical enquiries team, HET, should continue or not.  We were terribly lucky that we got HET officers who worked with us and who were very courageous, but it should not just be down to a question of luck.  The guys we got were prepared to stand up to the hostility and the discouragement from others not to dig too deep.  They had the courage to stand up to them and they did a good job.  However, it should not rely on individuals.  The HET itself is now hopelessly compromised, no one is co-operating with it, its day is over and we need something new.<br />I was also asked what the new process should look like.  With some tweaking and some changes, Haass is certainly the basis of what would be an acceptable process.  Having said that, there would have to be a few changes, but that is up to the political parties.  At the moment, the whole thing seems to be unravelling, unless anybody has heard anything different.  That would be a shame because this is going to be an intergenerational thing.  There is no doubt that the children and grandchildren of those people who died are affected by this.  Conflict will start up again, not exactly as it was, but it will continue, whatever about the need for truth of the bereaved families.  There is also a duty on the state to try to prevent pressures building up, and there must be a process.<br />Deputy Martin Ferris asked what help we had from the Irish Government, and I will defer to Ms Urwin on that.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe referred to Kitson and to the architects.  Even though it may sound a bit conspiratorial, and members may all think I am crazy, I actually think there was a policy in the 1970s to intimidate those people who were asking for civil and constitutional rights, and it was not just a question of a few very evil men.  I think there was a policy from London, but I will not go into that here because it is very complicated.  It is worth reading the book, where I go into that a bit.<br />I want to talk very briefly about the Smithwick tribunal.  When the Smithwick tribunal found that, on the balance of probabilities, there had been collusion in the murders of Harry Breen and Bob Buchanan, there was an immediate and contrite apology from the Irish Government and from the Garda Commissioner.  We have shown in <i>Lethal Allies</i>there is a mountain of evidence in the files that there was wholesale collusion in the murders of more than 120 people.  Far from an apology, far from contrition from the British authorities, they are trying to ignore it.  They refuse to meet us, they have not apologised, they have not shown any concern and they have made absolutely no statement whatsoever.  It is frankly outrageous that this is the situation.<br />I am a Brit.  I am not Irish.  I was born and brought up in the home counties of England.  My father was in the British Army, as was my mother and my sister, and my brother was a policeman.  I am not Irish but I am deeply, deeply ashamed of what my country has done here.  However, it was not done in the name of the ordinary British people.  It was not done in my name, it was not done in the name of anyone I know and it certainly was not done in my father or my mother's name.  There are guilty people there, not the whole British nation.  However, as a Brit, I suppose I have a special interest in all of this because I want to make my country own up to what it did here, so we can all move on together in a new spirit of friendship.<br />I believe the priority of the British Government during this conflict was, above all, to preserve its reputation internationally as an honest broker between these two crazy warring Irish tribes.  They still, I think, try to promote their reputation as that, which is why they will fight tooth and nail to avoid facing up to the evidence we have provided in <i>Lethal Allies</i>and elsewhere.  It will be a hard, hard battle.  The officers we work with in the HET lifted up a corner of the carpet briefly.  We saw what was underneath but, believe me, they are going to try to nail that carpet down again as hard as they possibly can to avoid anybody ever again seeing what they have got hidden.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1836" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margaret Urwin" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014011600016#U00500"><p>Deputy Frank Feighan asked what we could do in the future.  Deputy Brendan Smith suggested what the committee can do in terms of bringing pressure to bear on the British Government to honour the D&aacute;il motions that were passed in 2008 and 2011, which is very important.  Those committee members who were on the North-South and east-west bodies, the British-Irish interparliamentary Assembly or the British-Irish Council must emphasise to their colleagues from the British side the importance of honouring and complying with these motions.</p><p>  We met with the Taoiseach in July.  We had sought a meeting for a long time and we got our meeting in July.  He promised that he would keep raising this with the British.  It probably needs to be done in a more public way to try to somehow bring more pressure.  I do not think it will be done in private or in one-to-one meetings, certainly not solely anyway.  Pressure has to be brought to bear.  If this committee can put forward a proposal to the Government on that, it would be very welcome.</p><p>  With regard to commemorations, I can assure the committee that every Deputy and Senator will get an invitation to the 40th anniversary commemoration this year.  Senator Mary White mentioned the fact the Irish people are not engaging with it.  Sometimes the media does not even cover it.  I have on occasion rung RTE to say it has not even been mentioned on the day of the anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, even though a press release will have gone into RTE the previous day.  We are dependent on the media to let the general public know about the commemorations but, hopefully, this year being the 40th anniversary, that will not present such a problem.</p><p>  In regard to funding, I was asked why our funding was withdrawn.  We do not know why our funding was withdrawn.   The Irish Government had funded us for a decade, as I said, and the Barron report had been held and so on.  We presume it was because the Government felt it had done enough and had given enough money, and it withdrew it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1838" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margaret Urwin" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014011600016#U00700"><p>No reason was given but I would assume that was the reason.  As members know from my presentation, an awful lot of work remains to be done, particularly now that cases have begun to be accepted by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.  We definitely need help to continue to support the families in that.</p> <p> On a truth recovery process, we are in favour of the recommendations in the Haass proposals, provided all victims of the conflict and all deaths are included.  Mr. Murphy indicated that all deaths that originated in Northern Ireland should be included.  That would not be sufficient because many of the killings in the Republic did not originate in Northern Ireland.  While we do not represent all of the families concerned, the families of all of those who were killed as a result of the Troubles have the right to know the details and the truth about how their loved ones were killed.  The 120 people who lost their lives in this State, regardless of whether they originated in the North, have the same right to the truth.  In the great majority of cases where Justice for the Forgotten represents the victim's family, the killing originated in the North.  I am speaking for other victims who we do not represent when I state that they, too, have the same rights.  </p><p> Deputy Crowe asked for our response to those who argue that we should forget the past.  Forgetting is not an option.  The families of the victims want and need to know the truth if they are to move on.  This has been proved in other areas where conflicts have occurred.  For example, people in Spain are demanding the truth about what happened to their loved ones during the Spanish civil war when, for example, many people were disappeared.  Forgetting about the past or sweeping it under the carpet does not make it go away.  It must be faced and dealt with.  </p><p> Deputy Crowe also referred to the Military Reaction Force, MRF.  A "Panorama" programme on the MRF was broadcast before Christmas.  If the Deputy is interested, I can provide him with a copy of a little booklet I published on the issue last year.  Copies are also available online.  </p><p> To return to the issue of funding, Justice for the Forgotten's funding requirements are very modest because we no longer have a city centre office.  I work from home, which is fine and has significantly reduced our financial need.  If the joint committee would like an expenditure budget for the organisation, I will be very pleased to provide one.</p></speech>

If those in the Visitors Gallery would switch off their mobile telephones as well, it would be most appreciated.  This is one of our quarterly meetings at which we get an update on health issues.  It is a bit like Groundhog Day.  We seem to be here again.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  I thank them for being here this morning.  I thank Mr. Tony O'Brien and his officials for being here as well.  Apologies have been received from the Minister of State, Deputy White.</p><p>  Members have submitted written questions and the responses to these questions have been circulated.  I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister and Mr. O'Brien that members of the committee are concerned that the responses were not given to them until yesterday, which was a very late stage ahead of this meeting.  We would prefer to receive replies five days in advance of the meeting, which is what happens in the case of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  We did not get them until yesterday, which was a bit late for members.  If the process could be streamlined to ensure we receive responses five days in advance, we would appreciate that.  Perhaps Mr. Goodman might bring that back to the Department and Mr. O'Brien might bring it back to the HSE.</p><p>  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected to the matters under discussion should be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice and ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  I apologise for our late start.  We had to deal with some private business.  I ask the Minister to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1850" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014011600003#D00300"><p>I apologise for the responses to members' questions being delivered so soon in advance of this meeting.  We will certainly endeavour to ensure this does not happen again.  The members of this important committee should have time to consider the responses they get.</p><p>  I am grateful to the Chairman and the committee for inviting me to discuss health services here today.  As the Chairman pointed out, I am accompanied by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and by senior officials from my Department, including Mr. Fergal Goodman and Dr. Siobh&aacute;n O'Halloran, who is the chief nursing officer.  This is the first time a chief nursing officer has been appointed at the level of assistant secretary in the Department.  It is important for the health services that the voice of nursing can be heard at the highest level in the Department.  I am also accompanied by Mr. Tony O'Brien and his team, including Ms Laverne McGuinness, Dr. &Aacute;ine Carroll, who is the clinical director, Mr. Ian Carter, who is the director of hospitals, Mr. Stephen Mulvany, who is the director of mental health, and Mr. Pat Healy, who is the director of social care.</p><p>  Earlier this week - less than 48 hours ago - we discussed the 2014 Health Service Executive service plan.  It is clear that 2014 will be a very challenging year.  Perhaps it will be the most challenging year for the health services we have yet had to deal with.  Despite the many challenges we have faced up to now and will continue to face in the future, it is important to reflect on the considerable progress that has been made, especially in the essential task of reforming our health services.  I remind the committee that just over a year has passed since I launched Future Health, which is our blueprint for the reform of our health services.  As members will know, the Government's policy is to end the unfair and inefficient two tier health system and to introduce a single tier system supported by universal health insurance.  Future Health provides the blueprint for the steps on the road to universal health insurance.</p> <p>Among the many measures in Future Health, we stated we would establish hospital groups.  This has been done and last year we published the reports which set out how the groups would be organised.  Considerable work was done to ensure agreement on the composition of the hospitals groups.  I thank all those involved in the process, including officials of the Department and of the Health Service Executive and Members of the Oireachtas.  We have appointed chairpersons for each group and we are recruiting chief executive officers, with interviews taking place as we speak.  Work will continue in 2014 to fully establish the groups on an administrative basis.</p><p> The creation of hospital groups is a critical step in improving hospital performance and, ultimately, patient outcomes.  In the short term the groups will harvest the benefits of increased independence and move away from the traditional command and control style of the HSE.  We want to devolve as much independence as possible to those who best understand local needs and conditions.</p><p> In 2013, we published Healthy Ireland, our strategy for improving the health of people and enhancing our health and well-being.  This is an ambitious strategy which aims to embed health and well-being across public policy and services.  In 2013, as part of the Healthy Ireland framework, we published Tobacco Free Ireland, our strategy for making Ireland tobacco free by 2025.  A general scheme for the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2013 was approved by Government on 19 November last.  I was particularly pleased that at European Union level, the tobacco products directive was agreed during the Irish Presidency.  This is a significant development and was a priority for me during our successful Presidency.  The directive is a crucial step in protecting public health and harmonising the marketing of tobacco products at EU level.  I am aware of the joint committee's close involvement in this issue and members will be aware of my particular interest in making progress on it.  I note also that the committee will hold further hearings on the legislation later this month.</p><p> In 2014, we will establish a Healthy Ireland council, for which we have invited expressions of interest for membership.  We will also establish a research and data plan, an outcomes framework, a positive ageing implementation plan and a national physical activity plan.</p><p> In July 2013, we established the directorate of the health services under the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act, which also abolished the HSE board.  We started the process of bringing the HSE Vote back to the Department with the publication of the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Bill.  A finance reform board is in place and a chief financial officer has been appointed in the HSE.  The individual in question attended a meeting of the joint committee two days ago.  A new financial and cost management system has been identified and is being costed.  We will progress the legislation and continue to work on the management system during 2014.</p><p> In 2013, we published the phase 1 report of the chair of the consultative forum on health insurance.  The chair is proceeding with phase 2 and will report back to me in three months.  As members are aware, we must continue to address issues in the private health insurance market as a basis for the introduction of universal health insurance.  They will also be aware of my concern about the high cost of private health care.  I have received a draft of the White Paper on universal health insurance which I hope to publish shortly.  Universal health insurance is fundamental to the reform of our health services and goes to the core of Future Health.</p><p> At the same time as focusing on the future of the health services, we are focused on making a real difference to people today and tomorrow.  We have made good progress in addressing the costs of drugs and medicines.  With the passing of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, we have a robust system of reference pricing and generic substitution.  We have reduced the cost of atorvastatins by approximately 70%, with more reductions set to follow in 2014.  This saves patients and taxpayers money and allows us to focus on maintaining front-line services.  I read a newspaper report this morning which indicates that pharmacists are taking this matter into their own hands and becoming much more competitive in terms of the mark-up being applied in their businesses.  This is a welcome development. </p><p> Another key element of Future Health is the concept that money follows the patient.  The introduction of the new funding system on a phased basis lays the foundation for universal health insurance.  Following a pilot study in 2013, the system is being introduced across the health services on a phased basis in 2014.  The money follows the patient principle will provide the funding framework for improved and enhanced outcomes for patients as well as the professionals who serve them.  Put simply, if there is no patient, there will be no payment.</p><p> Despite the challenging financial circumstances, as part of budget 2014 we will introduce free general practitioner care for children aged five years and under.  In 2014, work will continue on the development of options for the provision of a GP service without fees to the entire population by early 2016.  Those who query the wisdom of providing free general practitioner care for children while there are wider difficulties with the medical card system fail to see the overarching importance of the move.  The Government is committed to a major enhancement of primary care services as part of the move to universal health insurance.  This step of a phased introduction of free GP care must be seen in that context.</p><p> We must move away from the current over-reliance on hospital care and make proper use of primary care given that all available evidence shows the latter can meet 90% of medical needs.  The true significance of providing GP care without fees to children under six years is the commitment it represents to enhancing primary care services in general.  We will develop more dynamic and efficient health services with better outcomes through universal health insurance.  The Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, is unable to attend because he is chairing a major conference in Dublin Castle.</p><p> In December, we published the Health Identifiers Bill and launched our e-health strategy.  Technology can enhance health care, improve outcomes and drive efficiency.  To implement the strategy, e-health Ireland will be established, initially in the Health Service Executive, and will be headed by a chief information officer for the health service who will be recruited through an open competition.  Priority areas for initial development include e-prescribing, online referrals and scheduling, telehealth and the development of summary patient records.  Again, on a day-to-day basis, the judicious use of technology brings greater efficiencies.  In the long term, the use of technology gives us more information and enables us to make better health care decisions, thus saving lives and money.</p><p> Health service staff are high quality, dedicated people.  The Chairman, members and I are always at pains to point out the great work done daily by the women and men working in the health service.  They deserve high quality, dedicated facilities to support them in their work.  Despite the significant financial challenges we face, the Government has, since 2011, progressed 34 primary care centres and a further 12 have been approved for building.  As resources permit, this network will be expanded.</p><p> Our aim in respect of the national children&rsquo;s hospital remains to secure planning permission by December 2014.  As to the relocation of the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, to the St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital campus at Elm Park, a project team has been appointed and we expect a design team to be appointed shortly.  We are also making progress with the relocation of the Central Mental Hospital from Dundrum to Portrane.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, wishes to say a few words on that issue.</p><p> The Minister of State also published a national positive ageing strategy in April 2013.  This is being implemented.  Regulations to allow for the registration and inspection of residential services for older people with disabilities were signed on 30 October 2013.  The Health Information and Quality Authority is now empowered to register, inspect and monitor such services.</p><p> As well as looking to the future, we sought to address legacy issues.  In particular, the State Claims Agency is implementing a redress scheme for women who had been excluded from the 2007 Lourdes scheme on age grounds alone.  I commissioned a research report on symphysiotomy and Judge Murphy has been appointed as mediator.  When she reports, I will consider her report and bring proposals to Government for approval.  I thank all members from all parties for their support and role in helping to address these issues, which have caused so much pain to so many.</p><p> Since taking up office, I have been driving improvements in unscheduled care targets and hospital outpatient performance.  While these winter months bring an increase in demand in emergency departments, it is clear that we have made significant progress in reducing the numbers of people on trolleys and waiting lists for appointments.  In 2014, we will continue to reduce maximum waiting times and develop better information systems, including the unscheduled care information system for hospitals.  As I noted, we are joined today by the director of hospital services, Mr. Ian Carter, who can discuss these issues in much greater detail.  Linked to this, the patient safety agency will be established on an administrative basis and a licensing system for public and private health service providers will also be developed.  I thank the Chairman and members for their attention.  We will be pleased to take questions.</p></speech>

Given that we were together just 38 hours ago, I will limit my opening remarks to issues that were not covered the day before yesterday.  In regard to service plan activity, my remarks relate to the first 11 months of 2013 as we do yet have the fully validated data for the full 12 months.  Those first 11 months saw the HSE maintain or increase levels of service activity compared with 2012 despite the significant challenge of maintaining the budget and reducing employees.  The overall waiting list growth trend seen in the first half of the year had been reversed by the end of November, with a 5% reduction in the total number of patients waiting for admission compared with July.  A significant effort has gone in to increasing the number of new patients seen at outpatient departments and the numbers have increased by 5% in that period.  Emergency admissions for the 11 months up to November numbered more than 350,000 and were broadly in line with the previous year.  A total of 945,836 elective admissions, inpatient and day, were carried out in our acute hospitals during those first 11 months of the year.  Some 25 intermediate care vehicles and 73.4 whole-time equivalents have been introduced into the National Ambulance Service in 2013.  GP out of hours contacts, at 882,000 up to the end of November, were slightly ahead of 2012 nationally, but there was a significant increase in activity in the north east which is over 6% ahead of their expected level of activity.  This service plays a very important role in pre-hospital emergency care.  At the end of November, 1,983,572 people were covered by a either medical card or GP-visit card.  In that month 23,833 long-term public and private residential places were supported under the nursing home support scheme compared with November 2012 when the figure was 22,985.  More than 14,000 referrals were received by the child and adolescent mental health teams, nearly 1,000 or 8% more than projected in the national service plan for 2013, and 70% of those referrals were being seen within three months.</p><p>  There have been reports recently in the media in relation to delays in ambulance response times.  The continuous improvement in ambulance response times is a key priority for the ambulance service and a performance improvement action plan is in place focusing on a number of key areas as follows: call taking and dispatch, use of intermediate care vehicles for inter-hospital patient transfers, introduction of a single national control centre, and turnaround times at emergency departments.</p><p>  A review of recent incidents has shown that at some emergency departments ambulance vehicles have been delayed for longer than the 20 minute target time.  This in turn has an impact on response times.  An enhanced escalation procedure is being developed in relation to delays beyond 20 minutes.  This enhanced escalation procedure will provide for an RAG, - red, amber and green - rating whereby such delays can be treated as an adverse incident.</p><p>  During 2013 and 2014, there has been significant investment in ambulance services.  Last year, &euro;25 million was allocated, which included capital investment to provide for a single national control centre as well as for the purpose of 25 new intermediate care vehicles.  These new intermediate care vehicles are now in place.  This year a further &euro;3.6 million has been provided to progress the single national control centre.  These investments will allow for significant improvements in response times as well as being able to cater for an increase in the volume of emergency DELTA calls which are currently about 10% more than the same period last year, the equivalent of about 1,000 extra calls per month.</p><p>  Turning to 2013, the deficit for the HSE prior to the application of supplementary funding of &euro;219 million was &euro;205 million, a &euro;14.1 million Vote surplus after supplementary.  This compares with a Vote deficit of &euro;337 million for 2012, prior to the application of supplementary funding of &euro;360 million.  This deficit is also inclusive of any once-off savings, mainly in pensions, available in 2013 which will not be available to the HSE in 2014.  The deficit is a reflection of the overall challenge within the HSE in 2013 when account is taken of the risks that were set out in the national service plan for that year.  These included the Haddington Road agreement, HRA, which took effect from 1 July 2013, the potential value of the risk in terms of projected deficit which has undergone a detailed review, and an assessment of the likely 2013 savings that are expected to be delivered.  Some &euro;46 million of the HRA target has not been achieved in 2013.</p><p>  The private patient charges provisions were originally due to take effect on 1 July 2013 and generate &euro;60 million for the latter half of the year.  These measures took effect on 1 January 2014 and therefore there was no generation or collection benefit in 2013 to the HSE.  The financial impact of the delayed implementation of the legislation started to materialise in July 2013, with an increase in deficits being reported by relevant hospitals. This deficit includes shortfalls in the four key risk areas which the HSE had previously identified as follows.  In the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, where the target was &euro;353 million, a deficit due to the delay in implementation of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, regulations amounted to &euro;41 million.  A dental treatment service scheme had a deficit of &euro;13 million.  A shortfall on a non-FEMPI target of &euro;303 million amounted to &euro;49 million.  A reduction in the number of items claimed on medical cards has offset these deficits.  The PCRS is expected to deliver a final deficit in the region of &euro;70 million.  The effect of the delayed implementation was to increase deficits by 2013.</p><p>  Unusually, today, HSE officials are appearing simultaneously before two Oireachtas committees.  With the Chairman's permission, it might be worthwhile to say a little about that.  Obviously the Committee of Public Accounts is focused on the follow-up to the audit carried out within the HSE in respect of remuneration of section 38 organisations.  That is obviously the subject of an inquiry by the committee and is receiving considerable attention.  The committee will also be aware that in 2013, for the first time, we required section 39 organisations to return to us details of the pay levels of all personnel above grade eight and, consequently, a full validation process is under way in relation to the information received.  A question has been tabled today on that issue.  Clearly, the issue of appropriate compliance with public sector pay policy by section 38 organisations, where personnel are fully public servants, and section 39 organisations, where they are not public servants, is a key issue for us at the moment.  The organisations are asked for full disclosure and to have due regard to public pay policy.</p><p>  From a financial performance perspective, when account is taken of the four key risk areas which I have mentioned for 2013, which were outside the direct control of the HSE, a break-even position on direct services, that is, hospital and community services, was delivered.  This is after the application of once off surpluses which primarily related to lower than expected retirements in 2013.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1857" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014011600005#F00600"><p>I will be very brief.  The most significant development so far as my areas of responsibility are concerned would have been the appointment of the two directors in recent months, Mr. Stephen Mulvany, who has sole responsibility for mental health, and Mr. Pat Healy, who has responsibility for disability and older people, all very sensitive areas.  In recent months, since their appointment, the level of inquiry and engagement between the services and the directors has been incredible and has made an enormous difference to how we will plan to deliver service into the future.  In terms of mental health, the question has always been asked about posts, and rightly so.  We need people with a particular expertise to work in the system.</p> <p>I have found over recent months that while we are concentrating on the professional side of the service, we must also look seriously at administration.  People cannot deal with the person sitting before them and simultaneously be expected to write up the report and develop that part of the service.</p><p> The 900 people working in the mental health service are very important and I believe we would face a far more difficult task without them, particularly if we had to bring in all new people.  These people are the bedrock of the service and other people coming into the service must fit in with them and into the new structure.  Mr. Stephen Mulvany will speak about this later.  One of the important issues facing us is the need for a structure in the area of mental health.  We need an IT system that will provide information on where people are working, what they are doing, what we want them to do and how the service is being delivered.  The barriers to effective working need to be removed.  Achieving this will be a key role for the director.  If we succeed in this, we will have a service that will be robust enough to stand alone, no matter who is in charge.  This would be a significant legacy.</p><p> In regard to older people and to disability, we are developing a clear view of what direction we want to take.  The budget for this area this year is &euro;1.5 billion.  Mr. Pat Healy has set out what we need to do for those aged from birth to 18 years, where most development needs to take place.  We also need to provide for school leavers.  I am sure members have heard me say that we cannot come in here every May, June or July to discuss the issue of people due to leave school or their training places.  This does not happen because it is a crisis, but because of the lack of foresight.  Now, for the first time ever, we have a budget and a plan in place to deal with people who will need to move to a different space.  I try not to use the jargon that has been used in the past in discussing disability and mental health.  Language is important and we should try to move away from the kind of language that defines people.</p><p> The two major developments in the area of disability and mental health are the appointments of the two directors.  Senator van Turnhout has consistently spoken out about the importance of a director and I am glad to say that the appointments have brought all the benefits we thought they would and I am convinced they will continue to bring benefits.</p><p> Despite the circumstances in which the country finds itself, we continue to make developments.  When the country was awash with money, we did not know what to do with it other than give it back to people in the form of tax relief.  We should have been putting infrastructure in place then, but we are beginning to do that now.  We will have a new Central Mental Hospital in Portrane and it is well advanced in terms of planning and design.  We will also have four new emergency care units, ECUs, throughout the country, in order that patients from the Central Mental Hospital may be able to move nearer their homes to make visiting easier for their families.  Our plan is not just to examine the service, but to develop it and move forward.</p></speech>

I wish to focus on some key areas.  In the Minister's opening statement, he outlined progress to date and the strategy since the Government came into being in 2011.  One of the key issues is universal health insurance and its roll-out and we await the publication of the White Paper on universal health insurance.</p><p>  When the Minister published Future Health in 2013, hospital groups were to be established and chairmen and CEOs were to be appointed.  There is concern in the community about this.  We have the small hospital frameworks and the primary care strategy and now the hospital groups, but there is a concern behind all of this.  People fear that when hospital groups are established and budgets are squeezed and under pressure, there will be pressure on them to reconfigure and streamline services.  However, talk about streamlining and reconfiguration of services is often a coded message for the downgrading of services in a particular area.  How will we be able to monitor this?  We have seen the amalgamation of some services and yesterday mention was made of shared services and streamlining of back office services.  This practice often creeps into front-line services.  We have seen this previously in some areas, for example, in Nenagh and Ennis, where there was to be a beefing up of certain services in these hospitals following reconfiguration in the mid-west, but this did not happen as progressively as it should.</p><p>  Anything that makes services more efficient is welcome, but there are concerns.  For example, in the area of maternity services, there is concern in some communities that some of the maternity hospitals will not be considered fit for purpose and that following the reconfiguration and the establishment of hospital groupings, they will see a closure or downgrading of some of these hospitals.  We must remain conscious of this concern and must be honest and upfront in regard to what a hospital group is, what it means and its obligations, particularly when we move to more independent type budgeting when boards are established.  Who will monitor these individual trusts to ensure they provide the services expected, as opposed to being profit driven and self-financing?  Who will ensure they will fulfil their obligation to provide care?</p><p>  We do not want to be constantly critical of Ministers, so I compliment the Minister on the initiative he is pushing of a tobacco free Ireland and a European directive in this regard.  This is positive. </p><p>  The Minister mentioned the Healthy Ireland council and also highlighted the issue of obesity.  We must all do more to reduce obesity.  If we look at the figures from Britain, it is alarming to see the rate of increase in obesity, in particular childhood obesity.  While we have talked about the issue, we must address the issue of the foods we eat and target and focus on the issue.  My age generation is probably a little overweight and should be targeted, but we need to target young people in particular and do more to address this issue.</p><p>  The Minister mentioned that primary care will be the bulwark for the provision of health services in the years ahead and said it is the most efficient and cost-effective way of delivering health care.  I am not quite sure whether the Minister is aware, but from speaking to individual GPs and communities, it appears GP services are in crisis.  Making this statement is not being alarmist.  This is a statement being made by the various organisations that represent GPs.  It is also evident that many of these services and GP practices are on the brink of financial collapse, which will leave gaping holes in some communities.  Also, many younger GPs are leaving this country.  Emigration of GPs only happens when they see no future in general practice.  We must be very conscious of this as we could quickly end up in a position where we will not have enough consultants to lead our clinical care teams or enough GPs to provide the primary care that is so much talked about by the Minister.  It is politically populist to point out that doctors are making large sums of money and are doing very well, but the reality is very different and the witnesses must accept that at this stage.</p> <p>This is not about representing doctors, something I was accused of by the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, but about ensuring we have a primary care resource in communities providing the best of care.  Without general practitioners that is simply not going to happen.  While the Minister refers to rolling out primary care centres and the primary care strategy, the fundamental principle is to have teams that are GP-led in communities.  By any stretch of the imagination that is beginning to dismantle in front of my eyes and, I imagine, with the Minister's previous knowledge of general practitioners and having advocated for them, he must see that as well.  This must be addressed.  I recognise the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation cuts are hitting hard and that we expect everyone to carry their fair share, but we do not expect the people to carry the burden of the difficulties.</p><p> If we have a downgrading and the closure of GP services in rural Ireland, people will suffer.  Unfortunately, what will happen is that we will end up with people being referred back into the acute hospital setting, despite that we are all trying to reverse that trend.  The Minister must examine that in a detailed manner to ensure we have a young cohort of GPs coming into practice, that we have a sustainable primary care service and that we do not end up with the type of service whereby there is nothing in rural Ireland, areas deprived in a socioeconomic sense will have fewer GPs and GP services will become the preserve of those who can afford it again - all this despite the Minister talking of rolling out free GP care for everyone.  We must examine that in the round.</p><p> The Minister has made proposals for those aged five years and younger.  We all welcome the fact that the Minister is trying to make health care accessible.  However, in making health care accessible to one cohort, he is denying another cohort.  This is an area that we must consider.  We have fundamental disagreements on this.  Anyway, I wish to put on the record again that the Minister has stated there has been no change in the eligibility for medical cards granted on a discretionary basis.  I fundamentally disagree with the Minister and Mr. O'Brien on this matter.  There is a large cohort of people, who, previously, had discretionary medical cards and which have since been removed.  There is another group of people who have the same illnesses, needs, diseases and requirements as those who previously had discretionary medical cards but they cannot access them now.  They include children with Down's syndrome and people with profound physical and intellectual disabilities, including motor neurone disease and many other cases.  The idea that the Minister takes from those who need it to give to those to whom the Minister wants to give is not a coherent policy.  While we have limited resources, the policy must be based on need as opposed to the way the Minister is going.</p><p> The Minister referred to the fair deal and the positive ageing strategy of 2013.  I have concerns about whether a large cohort of older people, who are in the nursing home support scheme and who have medical cards, are receiving other types of treatment, including physiotherapy, speech and language therapy and many other secondary benefits, to which they are entitled under the medical card scheme.  I do not believe they can access the services to which they are entitled.  I am not pointing the finger at nursing homes.  I simply do not believe the services are available.  I suggest, in the context of carrying out audits on nursing homes and places where people with intellectual and physical disabilities stay, that the Health Information and Quality Authority should also carry out an audit not only on the physical infrastructure and the services immediately required but on the obligations on the State to provide the services as well.</p></speech>

I wish to get off on a good and positive note.  I wish to record my absolute welcome for the provision of the &euro;3.2 million for the bilateral cochlear implant programme.  I raised the matter again this Tuesday past and I welcome the reply provided among the replies received only yesterday.  However, I am especially thankful to Ms Laverne McGuinness, who gave more information on Tuesday than was even in the written reply we got yesterday.  I urge the Department to take that on board.  It is not a criticism because we are simply trying to do our job and information is altogether important.  What Ms McGuinness put on the record at the committee on Tuesday should have been and could have been in the written reply to the quarterly question.  Mr. Tony O'Brien indicated a range of areas that were not included in the current year because of the difficulties and challenges.  In the light of all that and because information is important, I emphasise how welcome it was that this start has been made.  My only ancillary question is to ask the Minister to use the opportunity now to confirm that this will be a programme year on year for the future and that there will be continued funding for the bilateral cochlear implant programme for 2015 and every year thereafter to meet the needs of young people with hearing challenges.</p><p>  The second issue is symphysiotomy.  My understanding all along has been that what the victims of symphysiotomy sought and continue to seek primarily is truth and justice.  I do not believe the indicators suggest this is where we are going to arrive.  I am concerned about the terms of reference for Judge Yvonne Murphy.  I am concerned that the Minister repeatedly refers to the women having choice and that they can take their case to the courts if they so wish.  Some can, but the reason I have campaigned on this issue for years, in conjunction with colleagues across all political opinion in these Houses is because I know that a significant number of those victims cannot do so because of the statute bar situation.  It is a fact of life.  I am deeply disappointed given all the work we have invested in it, and I use the term "we" absolutely.  I happen to have been the chair convener but there are colleagues on the committee who serve in both Houses of the Oireachtas and who have invested significant effort not only since 2011 but in previous D&aacute;ileanna.  I call on the Minister to consider the position.  Last April, we passed Second Stage of the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill 2013.  It has not been facilitated to come to committee.  Despite all assurances that there is great concern and a wish to bring closure for the women concerned, we must face up to the fact that women have a right and a choice to make.  Some may accept the type of formula the Minister will present but I know, from listening to many articulate and committed women who have suffered grievously, that they want the option of being able to present their case through the courts.</p><p>  I appeal to the Minister again to revisit the matter in the context of all that he is considering and not to set it aside.  I understand that at a meeting last August with the representative groups for victims of symphysiotomy, the Minister indicated several points.  For the record, I wish to establish if these points represent the position and I call on the Minister put his position on the record now.  I am advised that the Minister told the representative voices of survivors, a group which would have included survivors among their number, that any compensation or restitution, call it as we will, would fall far short of the range specified by one of the groups of survivors of symphysiotomy and that the Minister was in no way considering anything in the ballpark they were arguing for.  Furthermore, I understand that any restitution or compensation would be paid in instalments.  We should be mindful of the fact that the survivors of this terrible and brutal procedure are a rather aged cohort of women.</p> <p>Finally, I understand that the women would be denied public funding for legal representation in circumstances where they would wish to have it.</p><p> They are victims of a health service of its time.  We, and the Minister most especially, are guardians of that health service today and we have inherited much.  I acknowledge that we have inherited this situation but that does not in any way mean that we do not have a responsibility to face up to and address it and to employ all the compassion necessary in doing so.</p><p> I know several of the women and their families, many in the north east, some in my constituency.  They are not people of means.  Even at this late stage in their life the prospect of providing for independent legal representation is a big problem for them.  That could corral people into accepting a situation that falls far short of their due.  Will the Minister elaborate on those points and advise us exactly of the situation?  I welcome the fact that he has included the women over 40 in dealing with the Neary scandal.  We need the same compassion to address this issue.  I believe the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill deserves to be progressed through the Houses in order to afford the women that choice.</p><p> My last point concerns the National Ambulance Service.  I raised this during our private session.  The committee has agreed to address this more fully during its work programme in the early part of this year.  The reply that I received presents carefully constructed sentences and statistics which almost suggest that there are improvements in the service.  There may be improvements but there is a regular series of real tragedies where the ambulance service does not respond within the required timeframe and consequently in many cases lives are lost.  I am told that not all emergency vehicles have satellite navigation systems, that they are directed to the call-out point by the central service in Dublin.  It has been suggested to me that the satellite navigation systems are not being rolled out because of the possible postal code change and a reluctance to expend moneys in the interim.  A pittance is required in real terms when one considers that lives are involved and tragic outcomes need to be avoided.  Why do all vehicles not have satellite navigation systems?  Will the Minister ensure that they are installed?  I know of instances in which ambulances have been going around and around but could not locate the address for the call-out.  That is terrible on our small island.</p></speech>

In particular, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s emphasis on the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill.  This is a fundamental issue for public health and for the health service.  The committee has set aside several weeks from next Thursday until 13 February to deal with submissions on this.  I look forward to the Bill's speedy progress through the Oireachtas.</p><p>  On Tuesday, I asked the Minister for clarification on the appointment of the boards of the hospital groups.  I understood him to say that the appointments were imminent.  While he refers to the groups in his opening statement, he does not refer to the appointment of the board members, apart from the chairperson and chief executive officer.  Is that imminent and, if so, how soon will it happen? </p><p>  There are particular pressures on the health service in certain locations.  The national service plan acknowledges that and it sets aside &euro;30 million for additional capacity in areas within the acute services which are experiencing increased demand, such as emergency departments, inpatient day care and outpatient department, OPD, services.  Some hospitals appear consistently to have trolleys in emergency departments.  One of these is South Tipperary General Hospital.  It is a very modern, progressive hospital where staff and management work together as a team, and with regional HSE staff, attempting to solve this problem.  As the service plan acknowledges, there are particular pressures in some areas and this is one.  The budget for that hospital has been reduced by approximately one quarter over the past few years.  It has lost a considerable number of staff.  Remaining staff have made a huge effort, working above and beyond the call of duty, and additional activity and throughput has been gained.  Will some of the &euro;30 million that has been set aside be designated for South Tipperary General Hospital to relieve the pressure on its emergency department?</p><p>  On Tuesday, I also asked Mr. O&rsquo;Brien about the &euro;56.5 million and &euro;7.5 million for general hospital savings and reconfiguration of services.  He explained that this referred to back office services and general day to day expenditure.  He also suggested that a review is forthcoming this year regarding reconfiguration of services generally.  Will he clarify and expand on that statement? </p><p>  Do we have the figures for agency costs?  I am told that the agency cost of a non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHD, can be a multiple of the cost of a directly employed NCHD.  That has serious implications for budgets within hospitals.  It also has implications for the recruitment of non-consultant hospital doctors.  There is &euro;1.3 million in the plan to deal with a sustainable approach to recruitment of NCHDs.  What are the agency costs and what is earmarked to receive the &euro;1.3 million?</p> <p>My view and that of the public in general that there has been no change in the policy on access to discretionary medical cards is completely at variance with both the views of the Minister and of Mr. O'Brien.  That is a situation which neither I nor the public accepts.  It is quite obvious to me and to many Members on both sides of the House that there has been a significant change in policy in this area.  We see it every day in our clinics.  I had a call before I came to the meeting this morning about the very issue.</p></speech>

I have some supplementary questions to those I submitted about the establishment and progress of the hospital groups.  The response to my questions provided details about the appointment of chairpersons and the ongoing recruitment of the chief executive officers.  My predominant concern is about the hospital group for the south west and what it will mean for Waterford Regional Hospital.  I refer to the difficulties associated with the recruitment of non-consultant hospital doctors and the difficulty in retaining them.  I am also concerned that consultant posts are not being filled in a timely manner.  I ask what is the national situation.  The IMO indicates it is concerned that it is becoming more difficult to attract consultants particularly in the perceived high-risk areas of maternity services, for example.  There seems to be a great number of vacant consultant posts in Waterford Regional Hospital.  The model of care to which we aspire is a consultant-led model but some specialties in the hospital have no permanent consultant.  At one time, the ophthalmology department under Dr. Condon at  Waterford Regional Hospital was one of the leading departments in the country.  Currently, the hospital has no permanent consultant in that specialty.  This is a concern.</p><p>  I am pleased to note that an additional seven posts will be given to the Waterford Regional Hospital team.  We were told that the hospital grouping proposal would mean that consultants would deliver the service as close as possible to the patients concerned.  However, in the past six months, outreach maternity services have ceased as have ophthalmology outreach services.  I understand these services are to be reinstated in January and this is welcome.  However, this is in direct contrast to what we were told would result from the establishment of hospital groups.</p><p>  I have spoken at the committee meetings on many occasions about retrieving moneys from private health insurance companies.  I note that the chief financial officer, Mr. O'Byrne, has taken a personal interest in this matter and he has a team which is focusing on improving the submission of claims.  However, &euro;150 million is outstanding from private health insurance companies.  This amount would fund the National Ambulance Service five times over.  A total of &euro;98 million is awaiting payment from insurance companies with &euro;52 million pending.  That is a considerable sum in light of the service plan and the difficulties associated with its provision which we discussed just 48 hours ago.  This is revenue owing to the HSE and I ask what more can be done to ensure it is collected.  We must ensure that money is reclaimed.  In cases where insurance companies do not pay out, the bills are the cause of great distress for the patients.  I presume Mr. O'Byrne is attending the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  He spoke about health insurance companies requiring photographs of patients on beds to be submitted with claims.  Has this practice been addressed?  Can we ensure that money owed to the public purse is paid in a timely manner?</p></speech>

I will address Deputy Kelleher's questions first.  He is concerned about a downgrading of services as a consequence of hospital grouping.  On the contrary, the hospital groups will have local knowledge and autonomy which will enable them to decide where the services are best placed in an individual area for the people whom they serve.  He is quite correct and I do not wish to be confrontational.  The plan for the mid-west region was a good plan at the time but it was not executed properly.  With respect, the previous Government removed the services from Nenagh and Ennis before the supporting services were in place in Dooradoyle.  We have been at pains to avoid that and to ensure simultaneous exchange of services so that the replacement services are in place simultaneously and the capacity is in place to deal with the consequences of the removal of services.</p><p>  I will give an example of the current situation; no one has raised this example but I am happy to refer to Navan.  There are accident and emergency departments within a short radius in Cavan, Drogheda and down the motorway in James Connolly Memorial Hospital.  I have made it very clear there will be no change to that accident and emergency department until the capacity exists in the other accident and emergency departments to take the additional workload.  That remains the position.  Deputy Kelleher referred to issues relating to the maternity hospitals.  The KPMG report indicated that maternity hospitals should be co-located with adult hospitals in the interests of the safety of pregnant mothers.  That is also my view and we are pursuing that policy.  A maternity hospital will be co-located with the children's hospital.  Holles Street hospital will be relocated to St. Vincent's hospital.  The Rotunda hospital will be relocated as will the maternity hospital in Limerick and maternity hospitals elsewhere.  There will be a need to review the overall number of maternity hospitals and the services they provide.  Deputy Kelleher asked who will monitor these trusts to ensure they are held to account.  The Minister for Health and the Department will be answerable to the Oireachtas.  More work is required on the question of what is to replace what I regard as a democratic deficit that currently exists with the removal of the health boards.  I was concerned about this issue long before I was involved in politics because I could see the value of politicians being able to hold the system to account at local level.  </p><p>  Deputy Kelleher and other speakers referred to Tobacco Free Ireland.  I take the opportunity to thank everyone for their support.  My personal, political and professional views are well known.  We know this is a killer product which kills one in two persons who use it regularly.  This is an astonishing bald fact which we cannot ignore.  We cannot resile from this fight which we must take to the tobacco companies.  We must protect our children from ever taking up this habit.  As I have pointed out previously, once one is addicted, one is unable to exercise choice.  I commend and congratulate the courage of Mr. Gerry Collins and the current television advertisement.</p> <p> On the issue of obesity, I see Mr. Chris Macey of the Irish Heart Foundation, is in the Gallery today.  He has spoken about the impact of obesity in terms of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, strokes, heart attacks and so on.  Obesity shortens people's lives.  Again, we have a duty to put in place systems to protect children in this regard.  One example of this is the Healthy Ireland initiatives which we have introduced right across Government.  The Department of Health cannot do this on its own.  As I mentioned the other day, we are the first Government to appoint a civil servant at principal officer level to oversee this issue and ensure there is co-ordination between the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  It is an issue that will require continuous innovation and new initiatives to address it.</p><p> In terms of primary care, people are very fond of saying that a particular service is in crisis.  In this instance, we are told that GPs are leaving the country in their droves.  The reality is that there was always a certain number of doctors leaving the country.  In fact, I suspect that more left in the past than are doing so now, because they could not avail of a GMS contract.  We are the first Government to address that restriction by ensuring that any suitably qualified physician can take on medical card patients, rather than having to wait five years as was the case previously.  Since that initiative was implemented, 246 new GPs were brought in under the scheme.  Indeed, the overall number of general practitioners has increased in recent years.  As at December 2012, there were 2,600 in active practice, full and part-time, and some 300 working as locums.  Of these, 2,353 were contracted to provide services under the GMS scheme.  This compares with a figure of 2,098 on 31 December 2008, some 2,136 in 2009, and 2,258 in 2010.  In other words, there has been a steady rise in numbers over that period.  We do not have the up-to-date figures for 2013 but, as I said, an extra 246 doctors have come into the scheme under the new regulations.  In addition, and in fairness to the previous Government, the number of GP training places was increased in 2010, an initiative we support.</p><p> There is no question of a financial collapse in general practice.  I am aware that some practices are in difficulty because they invested heavily in new premises.  They were right to do so and are deserving of support.  Nobody wants to see those practices fail and we will do everything we can to support them through new models of practice and a new GP contract which rewards those new practice models.  We must bear in mind, however, the OECD report published some years ago which showed that Irish GPs were the best paid of all the countries that returned figures.  Notwithstanding the reductions in remuneration under the various financial emergency measures in the public interest, I am given to understand that a forthcoming updated report will show there has been no substantial change in terms of the relative position of Irish GPs when it comes to remuneration.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1874" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014011600010#L00500"><p>I did not quite catch that comment, but I got a sense of it.</p><p>  At the end of November, 1,983,572 people in this country were in possession of either a medical card or a GP visit card.  In fact, the numbers in receipt of both have risen by 500,000 in recent years.  In other words, more people than ever have access to GP care under the GMS scheme.  I am engaged in discussions with the Minister of State, Deputy White, regarding a new GP contract not just in respect of patients aged under six years of age, but in the context of the overall spread of free GP care at the point of delivery.  Nobody is pretending that this type of provision will not be costly, but it is a question of ascertaining how we can best achieve value for money.  In many cases, patients' needs can best be met by their GPs, and the local practice is usually the most convenient location and closest to home for patients.</p><p>  As it stands, we have doctors doing work that nurses could be doing, nurses doing work that health care assistants could be doing, and consultants doing work that allied health care professionals could be doing.  I have referred on numerous occasions to the screening that is being done by physiotherapists of referrals to orthopaedic surgeons, which has resulted in 50% of patients not needing to be referred because they can be dealt with by the physiotherapist.  In the area of mental health, for example, GPs whose patients require counselling but cannot afford to avail of it privately are obliged to refer those patients to a psychiatric clinic.  The psychiatrist's time is being taken up to refer such patients to the counselling service in the public sector.  That is utter madness.  These types of practices need to change, and that is what we intend to do.  I see a much greater role for nurse practitioners and a much larger number of same working in a new model of general practice, where chronic illness prevention and care will be a major feature and where nurses can screen the patient to see whether they need to consult the doctor.  If we keep doing things the way they have always been done, we will keep getting the same results.  Changing that is a major part of our planned reform of the system.</p><p>  There has been a great deal of concern in regard to the provision of medical cards.  The reality is that no medical condition ever entitled a person to a medical card; provision was always by reason of financial hardship.  Clearly, many illnesses and conditions create financial hardship for citizens.  There is no question about that.  However, instead of looking to the medical card, which has strict rules attached to it, effective change requires legislation and is a policy issue on which I have not thus far received a directive from Government.  Nobody in this room wants to see any person experiencing hardship or those with life-long conditions being further disadvantaged.  I have asked the Health Service Executive to put together a small review group to examine how we can best meet the needs of these people.  It is about finding a different approach and examining what supports are required.</p><p>  In regard to nursing home treatment and medical cards, I do not want to be adversarial but the issue of nursing home care and the additional care given under that system was always problematic in the past.  It is an issue we are examining.  For example, we are in discussions with the HSE regarding methodologies for getting allied health care professionals out into the field.  We have fine young men and women who, having studied very hard to achieve 555 points in their leaving certificate, go on to spend four years studying physiotherapy in Trinity College and elsewhere.  These young people are very well qualified but do not have sufficient experience to go out on their own into the community.  Some of them end up working in McDonald's or leaving the country.  We are considering an initiative whereby these graduates could avail of an intern year that would give them the work experience to be able to go out into the communities where they are so badly needed.  As a GP of 30 years' experience, I would be very keen to have a physiotherapist attached to my practice.  In some cases, for instance, it might not be necessary to send a patient for an X-ray because the physiotherapist can deal with the problem.  When the facility is there, people will use it.</p><p> I thank Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for his support for the cochlear implant fund.  It is very much our intention that no child should turn seven years of age without having received the bilateral implants he or she requires.  After that age, the opportunity is lost for these children.  We are having to play catch-up in this area in the same way as we did with the cervical cancer vaccine.  Our plan is to ensure that no child loses out and none is prevented from achieving normal hearing where that is possible.</p><p>  In respect of the Deputy's concern regarding the Statute of Limitations as it relates to those women who underwent symphysiotomies, the Attorney General's advice is very clear that to make a change in this instance would have all types of ramifications and unforeseen and foreseen consequences.  As such, she is completely opposed to what the Deputy has outlined.  In the case of many of the women who have suffered so much as a consequence of this procedure, the person who carried out the operation is deceased.  Some of the women do not even know the name of the doctor who performed the procedure on them.  They have no access to medical notes because those notes are gone.  Many will incur huge cost and endure enormous delay by taking their case to court.</p> <p>If we change the Statute of Limitations, the insurers will state that we have changed the game and that they have no further culpability.  I wish to place on record the fact that we are not letting the insurance companies off the hook on this matter.  They have an obligation in this area and the State will play its part too.</p><p> There are some specifics to which the Deputy referred as occurring at the meeting.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, was present at that meeting with me.  I do not have the contemporaneous notes from that period but I do know that I did not determine what would be the scale of awards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1876" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014011600011#M00200"><p>We did not discuss it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1877" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014011600011#M00300"><p>I did not talk about staged payments at all.  There is no question that anybody would be denied legal representation.  What I did say, however, was that I wanted to ensure that any funds we could procure in order to compensate for the pain, hardship, hurt and distress caused would go to those who suffered and not to members of the legal profession.  That is one matter about which I am very clear.</p><p>  The next point I wish to make is that it would be very wrong of any member of this committee or others to mislead people into believing that the awards they might obtain would be at the very top end of what was obtained by a woman who has indicated, in very clear terms, that she had an open-and-shut case but who was obliged to go through several years of proceedings and who nearly lost her house.  The woman in question stated that during the final appeal she woke up one night in a cold sweat and realised that she could lose her house.  She had an open-and-shut case but there were several legal points which could have derailed matters.  The matter was eventually settled by the Supreme Court not after one, four or nine years but rather after 11.  I do not want many more of the people who suffered as a consequence of what occurred pass away before we get to rectify the position for them.  That is why I am taking the most expeditious approach possible.  Judge Murphy is an individual of considerable repute who has form in this area and who was also involved in dealing with matters relating to childhood abuse.  She is very skilled, knowledgeable and full of compassion.  With the agreement of the women concerned and their representatives, she will do her best to come an arrangement that will help bring about some sense of closure for them.</p><p>  A great deal of concern has been expressed about a number of recent incidents involving the national ambulance service.  I am also concerned about this matter.  HIQA was due to carry out a review of the ambulance service in the second quarter of the year.  I have spoken to both the chairman and the CEO of the authority and they have agreed to expedite matters carry out the review as a matter of urgency in order that all relevant matters might be investigated.  I appreciate the concerns of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who inquired about the use of Sat Nav.  The HSE does not operate Sat Nav devices because they are not sufficiently safe and do not contain maps for Irish townlands.  The HSE ambulance services operates GeoDirectory mapping combined with digital automatic vehicle location, which allows control to direct a vehicle to the scene of an incident.  The HSE can probably elaborate on that matter for the Deputy.  We must accept, however, that much and all though we strive for perfection, it is something which eludes us.  Things sometimes can happen, the wrong information can be transmitted and vehicles can be directed to the wrong location.</p><p>  I am very concerned about instances outlined to me of four ambulances parked outside accident and emergency departments, especially on days when TrolleyGAR and Trolley Watch indicated that there was no particular issue with regard to trolleys.  We all serve the public best by insisting on transparency.  When there is transparency, it is then possible to have accountability and, with that, we may get some fairness.  I am very happy for HIQA to carry out a very thorough review of the situations in question and of the entire service and to indicate where the problems exist.  We will address those problems because the safety of citizens must be paramount.</p><p>  Deputy Healy referred to the boards of the hospital groups and appointments thereto.  Those appointments are in train at present.  I wish to make my position clear in respect of this matter.  The Tallaght report threw up a great deal of material, some of which is being dealt with in a neighbouring committee room in the context of other issue.  I will make one comment on that matter and I assure the Chair that I will not cut across the matters with which the Committee of Public Accounts is dealing.  On foot of the Tallaght report, it was determined that we needed a uniform approach to appointments to the boards of hospitals and that such appointments should be based on competency and should not be made on the basis of on with whom one went to school.  The relevant competencies would be legal, human resources, HR, financial, managerial, etc.  That is what we are doing.  We have a grid in place in respect of appointments to boards and we can look at this in respect of any individual and assess which boxes they tick.  I agree with Sir Keith Pearson who made the point that no member of staff should be on a hospital board because that is counterproductive.  Staff can be members of the wider board of governors but they should not be on the board which supports the management and the executive.</p><p>  In the context of the issue to which the Tallaght report gave rise in the context of a second stream of payments being made to senior executives in hospitals.  There is only one instance of which I am aware where the same individual is the CEO of both the public and private hospitals.  I am of the view that this is a conflict of interests and that it is unsustainable.  Knowledge of that situation by no means confers acceptance of it.  That goes for many other things that have been happening and of which we may have had some knowledge.  Those things to which I refer are now being addressed by means of a cogent and coherent mechanism which has regard to due process.  I am sure Mr. Tony O'Brien will not want to say too much on that matter because it is being dealt with by the Committee of Public Accounts.</p><p>  Mr. Ian Carter can address the problem with people on trolleys in hospitals in south Tipperary in a comprehensive matter.  It is important to state, however, that overall trolley counts are down this year on last year.  That is the case - believe it or not - even though there was a spike during the week.  There will be pressure in the coming weeks but such pressure always arises in the first six to eight weeks of the year.</p><p>  I fully agree with Deputy Healy in respect of the costs relating to agency doctors.  This is a matter of serious concern for me, as is that which relates to the cost of agency nurses.  That is why we introduced the concept of the "nurse bank", a matter in respect of which Mr. Tony O'Brien can comment further.  We promised to obtain figures in respect of the overall cost for the Deputy but I do not know if it has been possible to do so.  Mr. Tony O'Brien appears to be nodding to indicate that the relevant information has been procured.</p><p>  The issue that arises relates to the recruitment and retention of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs.  This is also a matter of grave concern to me.  Some time ago I informed the committee of my belief that it is both wrong and morally questionable for us to recruit doctors from the Third World, particularly when we train our own doctors here.  I accept, however, that the latter can sometimes leave the country when they have completed their training.  We undertook to discover why we cannot recruit or retain NCHDs.  I am aware of anecdotal evidence of why the latter is the case.  It is because NCHDs do not feel respected, are of the view that they do not have a clear career path and feel they are not treated with the dignity with which they should be treated.  This matter is being addressed by Mr. Brian McGrath's group.  Mr. McGrath has issued an interim report, which contains timelined recommendations, and will be bringing forward a full report later this year.  I hope to address this issue because I am of the view that we have the finest and the best in this country and we want to keep them here.  If anybody has any doubt about that, they should realise that when our doctors and nurses go abroad they tend to rise to the top of the very best institutions.</p><p>  Deputy Conway referred to a consultant-led service.  I do not wish to be difficult but we want a consultant-delivered service and that is what we are aiming for.  In the past we had a consultant-led service.  I have been examining the position with regard to consultant numbers and associated difficulties for the past two days.  In that context, Mr. Barry O'Brien obtained an up-to-date report for me and it indicates that 93 new consultants have been appointed and that these are already in place.  In addition, a further 71 posts have been approved for filling.  If memory serves, approximately one third of those 93 consultants were employed at the new rate.  I have discussed this matter with both Mr. Tony O'Brien and Mr. Barry O'Brien.  When we introduced the reduction, it was never my intention that somebody who has spent ten years working as a cardiologist in Toronto would be expected to return here and commence work at the starting point on the salary scale.</p> <p>That, clearly, does not make sense.  It has to be modified and whatever needs to be done will be done to address that issue.  In the main, there is not the great crisis chaos that the Irish Hospital Consultants Association would like to paint.  There are many other reasons consultants do not wish to return, one of the main reasons in the past has been the lack of ability to do research - we are very lucky to have Senator Crown here who had led iCore, an Irish Cancer organisation, that does a lot of research in this country through a virtual grouping - but we want to address that through the hospital groups and through involvement of the universities in the hospital groups, etc. </p><p> The Deputy was concerned about the maternity hospitals' outreach services being ceased and that they are to start again, and Mr. O'Brien can go into that in greater detail.  The claims owned by the private health insurance are obviously a concern for us and in the past we had an issue with consultants failing to sign off.  That has not been a problem.  That end of it is sorted in the main and Mr. Tom Byrne, as was said, has visited various hospitals and has been sitting in this room while somebody was in the other room signing forms before he got to them.  That is not the issue.  The issue now is with the insurance companies themselves and delayed payments and we are going to take them to task over that.  The Deputy is right in pointing out that this money belongs to the public health system and should be in the public health system, and that it is badly needed by the public health system.  I will pass over to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.</p></speech>

We have put in place a counselling service for people with medical cards, to which GPs have direct access.  That service is for people with mild to moderate depression rather than they having to go through the whole system in terms of mental health.  That service is working very well.  It is significant that a GP has commented on radio about how well the service is working.</p><p>  I wish to confirm what the Minister has said in regard to symphysiotomy.  I appreciate that sometimes circumstances and occasions can overwhelm people and they get the wrong message but at no stage, and we have no vested interest in saying this, was a sum of money ever discussed.  It was pointed out clearly what would be necessary to have a  successful outcome in the courts.  I do not believe at the two meetings that were held on this that any women raised the issue that this would be her preferred option, even though if someone wants to go to the courts, as the Deputy will know, there is nothing anyone can do about that; clearly, that is the person's choice.  Neither was there any mention of legal representation not being available.  It was never raised as an issue and it most definitely was not indicated from either of the two of us.</p></speech>

There has not been an overall generalised problem in regard to the recruitment of consultants.  Competitions have been successfully concluded but it has always been the case that between a vacancy arising and a replacement being in post, there can be a significant delay.  That is because of the recruitment process, the vetting process and the need for a colleague who is coming into our service to free himself or herself up, often with an extended notice period from elsewhere.  There can be intervals of a year or more and sometimes that impacts on the capacity of a team of consultants in any given location to provide outreach services and sometimes they have to pull back in order to maintain the overall quality of service.  While I am not speaking to the specific instances that the Deputy has raised it is not an unusual feature that from time to time they have to do that.  Mr. Ian Carter may be able to comment further on that.</p><p>  On the issue of billings, one of the key objectives we set for 2013 was to get to a position where, by volume and value, between 70% and 80% of claims throughout the public hospital system would be through claims sure system.  As outlined in the answer, we have got to about 76% by the end of 2013.  We have also significantly reduced the volume of claims that are pending submission.  Unfortunately that seems to be matched by a corollary increase in the number of claims being pended for payment.  While it is crucial for all of us that private health insurers satisfy themselves as to the validity of claims that are pending submission, because that follows through on to the overall cost of private health cover, which is a significant concern, it none the less remains the case that the vast majority of claims will ultimately be paid.  We are currently engaged through Mr. Tom Byrne in a process with those insurance companies to come to a different way of paying.  There should be no reason, given that all these claims are ultimately paid, that we do not have a majority of the payments made within 30 days.  They will always owe us a sufficient amount but if individual claims are found not to be valid, they can be dealt with in the round as we would with any large training entity.  It is also of concern that if the effect of the new legislation that I referenced earlier, which came into effect on 1 January, follows through, we will have an increased dependency.  We are expecting &euro;40 million more from private health insurance this year.  If we continue to see long delays in payment and long pending times, that will have an increased adverse impact.  Private health insurers are not subject to the prompt payment legislation, to which a public body is subject.  Clearly, by negotiation and perhaps with ministerial support, as required, we need to bring them forward to a different way of doing business with us because it has an adverse impact on the overall performance of a health system.</p><p>  Before I pass on to Mr. Ian Carter who will deal with issues related to the European working time directive and the use of the pressures fund, I wish to respond to Deputy Healy who asked me about the broader reconfiguration issue.  It is important to stress that one of the recommendations from the HIQA report into the care provided to maternity patients in Galway last year was a recommendation for a strategic review of maternity services.  One of the possible outcomes of that could be to examine the number of locations and the size of those locations.  The minister has already referenced the Tallaght review which had a specific recommendation about the number of emergency departments - 24-7 - in the greater Dublin area, which by international standards is excessive and probably has an adverse impact on optimal quality and certainly could have an impact on costs.  When we talk about reconfiguration, we mean that there will be changes in the way that some services are provided but they will be done following appropriate reviews and with reference to international evidence.   It is not the case that by the end of this year or next year one would expect everything to remain as it is.  That is not sustainable both from a quality and a cost point of view.  I will pass over to Mr. Ian Carter to comment on the specific issues that relate to his area.</p></speech>

There are a total of 20 posts currently being advanced of which seven are new consultant posts and of those five are starting.  It has proved difficult to recruit consultants to three posts.  I note from discussion on this that the construct of the post is causing one of the issues.  An exercise is being carried out to see how that posting in Waterford hospital can be linked possibly with CUH to see if it can be made a more attractive post.  We are examining that.</p><p>  In terms of south Tipperary hospital, plans are currently being developed to see what can be done to reduce the congestion in the emergency department.  They are threefold.  Some beds are currently closed in the hospital and it ensuring that it can properly staff those funded beds.  There is an issue relating to the staffing levels and configuration in the emergency department and one of the other key initiatives as we move forward is moving from our solid hospital centring approach to try to improve the community services that prevent admission and facilitate far quicker and more timely management of patients back out to the communities.  Those plans as they relate to the hospital should lock on board in the next two to three months.</p><p> On the reconfiguration issue, as has been said, the groups are only just starting to come alive with the CEOs to them, hopefully, being recruited later this month.  The reconfiguration plans will take some time to generate but the key issue is that they are not going to be somehow a secret.  They will be subject to validation but the logical grouping to come up with those reconfiguration plans is the local hospitals working as a cohesive network. </p> <p> In terms of the European working time directive, EWTD, I suppose that needs to be seen as a journey rather than a specific funding initiative.  At the moment the hospitals have been working for the majority of this year on how services can be reconfigured with a higher reliance on consultants and slightly more sensible rosters to ensure there is an overall reduction of the working hours with no service diminution.  Within that framework we are just completing the first phase of the exercise.  It is a joint exercise with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, which is looking at the first milestone to moving to EWTD, that is, the removal of the requirement for non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, to work for longer than 24 hours.  We are just completing that exercise to see where we are.  We have identified some level of funding, as would have been seen from the service plan.  That is for a mixture of investment, as it will translate to a region-by-region basis or a hospital-by-hospital basis in terms of additional NCHDs, consultants and nursing staff.</p></speech>

It confers one set of eligibility.  The discretionary medical cards granted on discretionary grounds build upon the primary entitlement.  Entitlement is not based on medical condition but on financial hardship and in the case of discretionary medical cards we take into account, with input from medical assessors, the costs that arise from a medical condition.  The overall financial means of a family is still the fundamental building block.  The only changes that have occurred, as per budget 2012, are that certain allowances in relation to weekly travel to work and the cost of home improvement grants became disallowed.  The second change which occurred in recent years is that whereas decisions related to discretion were essentially all local decisions effectively, &aacute; la the former health board structure, with centralisation a consistent single set of rules apply.  Those things combined can have the effect, together with the family circumstances, of meaning that while people's medical circumstances have not changed their entitlement to a discretionary medical card may have.</p><p>  We are also conscious that the medical card is sometimes more valuable as a passport to other services than it is in terms of its primary design purpose which is access to GP care and medication.  As the Minister referenced, we are looking to see &ndash; in particular with regard to those with long-term needs in the 0 to 18 category &ndash; what we might do to address those other things which were accessed through the passport rather than the direct purposes of a medical card.  I will ask Mr. Healy to address that as well as aspects relating to the fair deal.</p></speech>

The system is based on assessed need.  It is important that we reassure the public and service users.  We will take the opportunity as we roll out the 0 to 18 programme this year, and using the &euro;4 million in additional development as part of that, to communicate with people to make sure they are aware of the situation and that there is access.  At times one can have waiting lists but it is not an income issue that is the cause of the problem but whether the services are available.  As we roll out the 0 to 18 programme we will deliver a more integrated assessment and intervention service that will address some of the concerns people have in that regard.</p></speech>

It is important to stress that the use of agency-type personnel or flexible employment is an inherent feature of any health care system.  In view of the statistical process control variations and demand, it is necessary to be able to flex up and flex down.  As the Minister referenced, we do, as a result of budget 2014, have a procedure in place to effectively take back some of the costs that are currently resulting from using classic agency employment approaches in both VAT and agency margin.  We will operate, as it were, in-house nurse bank arrangements.  This does require a small piece of legislation under the 2004 Act to empower health authorities to set up subsidiary undertakings to take the place of agency services.  That will have an important impact both on the costs I have mentioned but also on our ability to leverage the provisions of the Haddington Road agreement.  Ms McGuinness has the detail on agency expenditure for the first 11 months of 2013.</p></speech>

At present there is not the technology for that to be in the individual vehicle.  If we were to install sat-navs, safety issues would arise.  From experience I know that the house of a relative of mine who does not live too far from Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in cannot be found on a sat-nav and one would be likely to be taken to the wrong place altogether so the geocoding approach is better for now.  When we have full postcoding and sat-navs that reflect that, it might change the situation but the reason of cost that has been suggested to the Deputy is not the correct one.  The cost of putting in sat-navs is negligible but the risk associated with doing so would be greater, according to the risk assessment that has been made, than using the present geocoding approach through the control centre.</p></speech>

I wish to focus on Questions Nos. 3 and 5.  Question 5 related to NCHDs.  I based my question on the figures made available to me at the time.  The agency cost for NCHDs was approximately &euro;50 million.  I am open to correction but I note that in the reply the hours contracted out to agencies is equivalent to 175 whole-time equivalents.  If one divides 175 into &euro;50 million it works out at &euro;280,500 per whole-time equivalent.  Perhaps we could get clarification on the real cost of agency staff because I base my calculation on the reply I received which is based on the cost of agency provision of junior doctors of &euro;50 million.</p><p>  I am also concerned about the reply to my second question.  I raised the issue consistently since June 2011.  It relates to the fact that more than 2,000 junior doctors are still on six-month contracts.  I accept what the Minister said about the interim report but I am a little disappointed that the final report will not be available until June which means there will be very little real change until January 2015.  We have a huge drain of junior doctors out of the country and that is one of the issues that must be tackled.  The reply I received today said it is not anticipated that the number of NCHDs holding six-month contracts would reduce in the short-term.  I am concerned with the reply in terms of when exactly we will have a reduction in the number of people being offered six-month contracts and moving to at least two-year or three-year contracts.</p> <p>That is my first question.</p><p> My second question is on question No. 3, which relates to the &euro;812 million paid to section 39 organisations.  I note and welcome that the reply states that a letter was sent to section 39 organisations on 10 December, which is a number of days after I had submitted my question, and I am delighted that section 39 organisations will now be required to make disclosure to the Health Service Executive as regards the pay to senior management.  It is disappointing that we are paying out &euro;812 million to section 39 organisations yet we do not have the information on the current pay scales of people in senior management in many of these organisations, and there is substantial funding.  I understand that over 131 organisations are receiving between &euro;1 million and &euro;10 million.  I specifically asked my question on the level of pay.  The HSE is now saying that for 2014 it has to make that information available.  I ask that this information be made available to this committee because when I asked a question about section 38 organisations on 17 October, the information was not given to me but it was made available to the media within seven to ten days and it is disappointing that it was not made available to this committee first.  I ask that when the information on section 39 organisations becomes available it is made available to this committee at the outset rather than being released in the public domain without the members of this committee being made aware of it beforehand.</p></speech>

I fully endorse everything the Minister said about a tobacco-free Ireland and the Healthy Ireland initiative.  I welcome the update from the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, on mental health but regarding the child and adolescent mental health services, social workers have repeatedly told me about their difficulty of engaging and I am fearful that because they will now be in separate bodies under the new agency we may exacerbate that problem in some way.  I would like to see a protocol in place at the earliest opportunity to ensure that does not happen.  A situation that arises frequently is that once the child goes into care, child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, back off and say the child can now get private mental health services.  We need to consider having a joined-up system because that is unacceptable.  We must ensure that engagement is taking place.  We have seen too many reports.  I highlight that issue for the Minister, which I will follow up.</p><p>  My question No. 9 on nurse prescribers came up during the end of life care hearings in this committee.  The reply refers to the Department supporting that in principle and putting in place governance and accountability structures but the reality is that those structures are already in place.  Nurse prescribers carry out regular audits of the medication they prescribe.  They only prescribe from a list of medications approved by the general practitioner who has mentored the prescriber.  There is a collaborative practice agreement in place, which was developed collectively, and when I read the answer I felt it reflected the policy versus practice dichotomy we often face in health care.  The policy is in place.  Could whoever is responsible be nudged to put that into practice?</p><p>  The reply to question No. 10 on cardiac services is disappointing.  It gives the impression that the services being supplied are adequate.  The fact is that the number of patients has significantly increased but I believe that is down to the dedication of the staff and not a reflection of the shape of the services.  It is likely that the staff would see the response I have been given here as using their dedication against them and it might increase their frustration and undermine their morale.  We have to be very careful about that because they have given above and beyond.</p><p>  The survey that listed a number of significant service deficits does not overcome the inadequacies.  It is like having a builder make a virtue of the fact that one's house has two walls but not address the fact that the house is falling down.  That is how I felt when I read the answer.  We must ensure that we record appropriately.  We must record that a service has access to a discipline, even if that access is as low as an hour per month.  We must be careful about overstating the case.  When I read the answer I felt it did not reflect the reality.  It refers to staff vacancies and to maternity and sick leave but the reality is that there has been a constant diminution in staffing levels since 2005 despite the priority for this life-saving service.</p><p>  Question No. 11 is on the neuro-rehabilitation strategy.  It is not my first time to address that issue.  It was due to be rolled out from 2011 to 2012.  We are now half way through its lifetime and the implementation plan is still not finalised.  How long will it take to finalise the implementation plan and is there any intention to speed up this painfully slow process, which will have a huge impact on people's lives?</p></speech>

ReachOut will terminate at the end of this year.  In terms of my experiences establishing ReachOut, it took three years of consultations and meetings of the expert group before it came to a decision.  Some 90% of the recommendations were included in the National Task Force on Suicide, which reported in 2008.  During that three years, the answer to every question asked in the D&aacute;il about suicide was that the Minister was awaiting the report of the expert report.  There were no questions responded to or improvements made over a three year period because they were waiting for a report.  I am not saying that will happen but that issue might be addressed.  It was extremely frustrating during that period because nobody was telling us anything that was going on other than that the expert report was awaited.</p><p>  Regarding question No. 6, the Minister informed us that of the 891 new staff to be recruited to the community mental health services etc. in 2012 and 2013, 514 have already been recruited but 30% have not been recruited, therefore, &euro;30 million of the budget of &euro;70 million for that period has not been spent.  In fact, it is in excess of &euro;30 million because there was recruitment during 2013.  Where is the &euro;30 million that was not spent because the recruitment did not take place?  We know the Minister and the Government made a specific decision to allocate moneys.  Obviously, they felt that was necessary because of the historical neglect and the likelihood that would continue in regard to development of the mental health service.  Is there an incentive in terms of using moneys not spent elsewhere within the health service?</p><p>  Regarding medical cards, and I appreciate what Mr. Healy has said, I want to dwell briefly on the administration of the medical card system in which considerable problems remain.  I will mention a few of them that have been raised with me by general practitioners.  Renewal forms are sent out between two to six weeks before expiry date but it takes six weeks or more to process them.  Can GPs extend a medical card for a period of three months if a decision is not made on a medical card?  Also, application forms are being lost repeatedly.  Most of us in our clinics have come across people who say they sent in the application in October or December and they still have not got the card.  </p><p>  Furthermore, patients are not being removed from lists despite timely issuing of death certificates.  I had a situation where a death certificate was submitted last March and the doctor was still being paid up to recently for that individual.  Also, cards are being cancelled without patients or doctors being informed prior to the cancellation.</p> <p>A patient turns up the surgery only to discover out of the blue that he or she does not have a medical card even though it has not expired.  These are some of the administrative difficulties that still are inherent in the system.</p></speech>

What is the plan to progress this in the next few years to ensure this does happen?  As for the primary care services, I believe 34 primary care centres are progressing at present, while a further 12 have been approved.  How does the Minister find the task of getting qualified personnel to work in these centres?  He should indicate what progress is being made in this regard.  In respect of the &euro;40 million in additional funding for disability services, I note that &euro;7 million has been allocated to provide for an estimated 1,200 additional places for school leavers, as well as people in training and emergency residential placements.  What is the plan for the future in this regard?  How can members track that this is being implemented?  Moreover, how can the &euro;3 million being allocated to provide emergency placing for people with disabilities whose family circumstances have changed, as well as the &euro;4 million for children with disabilities, including autism, be tracked and followed up?  I believe the &euro;30 million provided to help to address the waiting lists will increase access to emergency departments, inpatient treatment, day care and outpatient department, OPD, services.  At present, the waiting time for adults is eight months, for new eye patients it is 12 months and children wait for as long as 20 weeks.  Is this funding to maintain or improve these levels of service?</p><p>  Over Christmas in particular, a lot of old people have no one to look after them.  What plans are in place to look after them?  An issue that I am encountering more often in my clinics is that many elderly people are being abandoned in hospitals.  Their families no longer wish to take the responsibility of looking after these elderly people.  Is money being put aside to look for such people?  They are being discharged from hospitals, are being sent home and so on but they have no one to whom to go home and they are not fit to so do.  Another issue that has received my attention is that of voluntary health insurance.  Premiums for many elderly people have been increased.  Older people tend to wish to opt for the top policy because they are more inclined to get sick and many such policies are increasing by between &euro;400 and &euro;500 per annum.  As they simply cannot afford it, can anything be done to help such people to pay their premiums?</p><p>  I will conclude with a question regarding the national ambulance services as in recent weeks, all one has heard on news reports has been references to delays in ambulance response time.  I have been informed that in 2013, &euro;25 million was allocated, which was a capital investment for a national control centre, as well as 25 new intermediate car vehicles.  There still appears to be a problem.  Can these delays be examined and can one ensure this does not happen again?  It is all down to communications, which will be extremely important in the future.</p></speech>

He notes the full report will not be ready until June and is somewhat disappointed.  I must respectfully say to him that this is the first time this has been done.  It has been a running sore for 30-odd years.  There has been an initial report in order that some changes can take place but to do the full job on this, particularly in respect of creating the clear career path, we must engage with quite a number of groups, including the colleges and universities.  I do not accept that it should take 12 years to become a consultant and in other jurisdictions, it takes six years.  I do not suggest that at six years, one will have the same experience as someone who has been a consultant for ten years, clearly not, but people need to be able to live their lives with some view of the future.  I have asked that consideration be given to two and three-year contracts.  This is a matter that will be addressed in the report as well, namely, the entire issue of retention and I believe a good report will be forthcoming from Professor Brian MacCraith.  He is a good individual, who has an interest in this area and who is the president of DCU, one of the most progressive universities in the country.  I attended a conferring ceremony there recently and noted that one of its alumni now is a worldwide assistant chief executive officer of Microsoft.  Good people are produced from that university and he is a highly progressive individual.  He perceives the need, as does everyone present, to give people a proper shot at life.  If one is obliged to change job every six months, how can one have a marriage or a relationship?  How can one even get a mortgage or a car loan, if one cannot show that one will have a steady income?  All these issues must be addressed.  It is complex and will take time but I believe it will be worth the time spent.  There was one other issue that related to page 11, to which I will revert.  The Senator noted the reply "it is not anticipated that the number of NCHDs holding six-month contracts would reduce in the short term".  As I stated, I do not accept that either.  I accept that it will change in the short term, I want it to do so and like the Senator, I would be concerned if this were to remain the case.</p><p>  On the section 39 payments, I will allow the representatives of the HSE deal with it because there are technical issues in that regard.  However, this all arose from the Tallaght hospital report from HIQA, which has uncovered quite a lot of irregularities in the system.  In the very first public utterance I made on this issue, I made it clear that it would be open to people to come and make business cases for those situations which pertain.  However, they must all be approved by the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is the key and I reiterate we need transparency across the entire system.  I will let the HSE deal with that issue.</p><p>  Senator van Turnhout mentioned child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and I will allow the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to deal with that matter.  In respect of cardiac rehabilitation and neuro-rehabilitation, we are highly fortunate to have in attendance the clinical director, Dr. &Aacute;ine Carroll, and she can address that.  The Senator also spoke about nurse prescribers.  While I will allow the HSE to talk about that too, personally I am highly supportive of this and of a greatly expanded role for nurses, particularly in general practice but right across the system.  I am pleased that with the roll-out of the colon cancer screening, advanced nurse practitioners will be carrying out the endoscopies, not consultants.  We need to think outside the box in respect of how we use the staff we have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1906" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014011600015#Q00500"><p>Absolutely and there is that whole issue around nursing homes where historically, nursing home owners did not want people dying in the nursing homes, thereby giving them a bad reputation.  We are trying to move away from that culture and explain to people that this is their home and most people want to die at their home.  They do not wish to spend the last 12 hours of their lives sitting on a trolley in an emergency department.  While there also will be upskilling for general practitioners, GPs, in this regard, it will mainly be for nursing home staff in order that they are comfortable in this space.  Our chief nursing officer is present and can address those issues in a much more comprehensive fashion.</p><p>  Deputy Neville mentioned ReachOut and mental health staff.  I will defer to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on those issues.  As to whether the GP can extend the medical card for three months my information is he or she can.  While that is from memory, I will have this confirmed by the HSE in a moment.  On the last point mentioned by the Deputy regrading patients not being removed from the list, despite the death certificate being issued, that is not playing the game.  The GPs were given an opportunity to put on their list a newborn child when he or she first presented to the surgery, rather than waiting for the HSE to do it over a period.  In return for this, however, they were to remove from their list people who had passed away or had left the practice.  Consequently, it is a bit facetious for a general practitioner to be trying to present to Deputy Neville the idea they issued a death certificate and therefore the HSE should know.</p></speech>

Consequently, it is up to the GPs, who must play ball in this regard.  The Deputy should not get me wrong, as in the main they are.  I believe this is working well and this is the reason much of the work on the issue of probity etc. already has been done on this.  This is the reason the idea that &euro;113 million could be saved from that process left me highly unconvinced and is the reason I requested and secured agreement from the Departments of the Taoiseach and Public Expenditure and Reform to carry out the validation process, which proved us to be correct.</p><p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick raised a number of issues.  The plans for universal health insurance are on course.  The White Paper will be published, there will be an opportunity for everyone to be consulted and for a constructive conversation to take place across this for all stakeholders, including the public.  The Deputy mentioned that 34 primary care centres have been progressed.  They have actually been completed and 12 more are in the pipeline, as well as others that might enter the pipeline if we can get more interest from GPs to develop them themselves.</p> <p>Whether we develop them or they develop them, whether they are done through direct build or through lease, there is no point in putting a brick in the ground if the GPs are not signed up.  That is why, of the 35, only so many went ahead.  One does not get GP interest.  The last thing we want to do is build a primary care centre and have the GPs sitting outside asking how much they will be paid to be included because that is what would happen.</p><p> On staffing, I am not aware that there is any issue about staffing once the agreements have been reached, but Mr. O'Brien can go into that.  The Deputy mentioned mental health issues, which I will let the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, deal with.</p><p> On the &euro;30 million intervention fund, Mr. Ian Carter who is here might give the committee a flavour of how that might be spent.  It is used to support innovation to improve the patient experience, both in emergency departments, inpatient and outpatient waiting times.</p><p> The issues around the care of the elderly are issues that are common to both myself and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, in terms of the acute sector having facilities in place to allow the frail elderly commence rehabilitation immediately they are fit to do so.  Often what happens is somebody goes into hospital with pneumonia, ends up with the medical problems resolved after 48 or 72 hours, but is clearly not well enough to go home and needs physiotherapy and occupational therapy.  Sometimes such a person does not get this in the hospital and is left lie in the bed so that he or she becomes unable to go home ever, and that is what we are trying to address through the frail elderly programme.  Dr. &Aacute;ine Carroll who is present can talk through many of the clinical care programmes.  There has been astonishing progress made on stroke, which I mentioned already and which Dr. Carroll can go into in more detail, and in congestive heart failure which has been raised by members as well.</p><p> On private health insurance, PHI, the cost of insurance has gone up and I am most concerned about that.  As I have stated before and will say again, I do not accept that this 9% medical inflation should be taken as a given when the rest of the country was in deflation.  It is utterly unacceptable.  We are still paying for procedures that used take two hours at the same rate when now they only take 20 minutes.  There is a host of work to be done here - it will be done - in terms of clinical audit, audit and benchmarking what we are paying and why we are paying what we are paying.  Clinical audit is critically important.  One needs a similar professional to challenge the professional concerned as to why tests are done or why treatments are carried out because there has been much anecdotal evidence of patients having procedures carried out that were not strictly necessary.</p><p> The Deputy referred to the national ambulance service.  We dealt with that earlier through HIQA, which will be addressing that urgently.  I will refer to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1910" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014011600016#R00200"><p>I congratulate Deputy Fitzpatrick for asking questions.  There were a good many but, nevertheless, they all were questions.</p><p>  I will start with the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, Senator van Turnhout raised.  I will ask Mr. Stephen Mulvany to come in on mental health.  In terms of CAMHS, and the service available to children, it is not the same all over the country.  It is not uniform.  That is something we need to do.</p><p>  Also, we are dissatisfied with whether it is up to age of 16 or 18 in law.  Of course, one is a child until one is 18 years of age and, therefore, one would expect all the statutory services to comply with that legal definition.  We are working on that as well.</p><p>  We need to look at a transition aspect in terms of those who conclude at 18 years and must transition into the adult service.  It is not right that someone at 18 years of age falls off the cliff and goes into the adult service even though in some instances in some areas the adult service can be better than the child and adolescent service.  It is something we are looking at seriously.</p><p>  We have a difficulty in terms of recruitment.  It has come up in other areas as well, that one simply does not have persons with the expertise we are looking for available when one needs them.  I will let Mr. Mulvany deal with that.  It is a matter of trying to put in place a system that is uniform throughout the country.  Whether one is in Donegal or Dingle, access should be the same and the service should be the same.  Hopefully, we will have better outcomes as well.  We are working on that.</p><p>  I would agree entirely with Deputy Neville.  When it comes to mental health, we must defer to him.  Deputy Neville was talking about mental health when it was neither profitable nor fashionable.  I always defer to him on these matters.</p><p>  ReachOut took a long time to put together, as did, to a great extent, A Vision for Change.  We are conscious of the fact that it is coming to the end of its life and that, maybe, we need to put a structure in place not to take a look at what is beyond A Vision for Change and what is beyond ReachOut, and whether ReachOut is working.  Are we doing the right things?  I will ask Mr. Mulvany to refer to that.</p><p>  In terms of the recruitment, there have been stops and starts, but we are well on track.  As I stated earlier, those who are already working in the system are as important as the new staff we will recruit.  We need to ensure that they can work as a team, which does not always come naturally.  We have set some funding aside to ensure that teams work in a productive fashion.</p><p>  In response to Deputy Fitzpatrick, I will ask Mr. Pat Healy to deal with the additional funding for disabilities and the &euro;4 million on the nought to 18s, which we see as a crucial element in terms of disability.  We do not want those at the 18 years of age stage coming out of the childhood services and falling off the cliff.  I am not certain that one can call it a crisis if one knows it is coming.  We want to ensure that such does not happen.</p><p>  We have separated out funding from the fair deal scheme to look at exactly the issues in regard to older persons of which the Deputy spoke.  I am not certain that anyone sitting around this room wants to end his or her days in a nursing home, no matter how pleasant or kind staff are.  Some people do not have a choice in that regard where it is the only option available.  If all of the research tells us that each of us would prefer to die not only in our home but, if not, in our community, then we are looking at how we will manage that better, and this is the first year that we have taken steps in that direction.  What we are doing is what we have talked about for so long.  We are now, I suppose, financially, and with the finances, physically, moving in the direction we want to be.</p></speech>

This is its last year.  In the HSE service plan, there is a clear action for us this year to set out a new strategic framework to replace ReachOut.  The intent is to have that complete this year and we do not intend to have a period when there will not be a strategy for suicide prevention.</p><p>  In terms of funding around posts, it is a feature of Government accounting that the funding for a post is given for a full year even though the post will only be recruited at some point in the year.  The alternative would be to have to go back twice to the Department of Finance to seek funding for posts and that would not be recommended.  What happens to any funding is it is either used for the purpose for which it is intended or for the general health service by agreement or it is returned to the Exchequer.  We did not return any funding to the Exchequer, therefore, that resource would have supported the mental health service and the wider overall health service.  This year, in the service plan, we have been more explicit than in any year about the need to phase certain developments and the need to use time-related savings from that to support the overall service and deliver the maximum amount of current and new service, including, for example, the cochlear implants which were mentioned earlier.  I think that covers all the points.</p></speech>

One, there has been an increased demand and there has been increased productivity, but also it is identifying some degree of fragmentation of the services.</p> <p>Some fragmentation of the services is being identified.  Therefore, we will be working this year with the hospital to try to better structure the service so it will not have the disconnects.  That work will be commencing directly.</p><p> With regard to NCHD overtime hours and agency hours, rather than going into detail now, as agreed, we will supply the committee with all the information in a short period.</p><p> With regard to what is being termed "innovation funding", the aim for 2014 is for that funding to apply to both scheduled and unscheduled care.  This is to try to maintain the scheduled care access in relation to the unscheduled access to try to maintain the performance improvement we have seen in the past two or three years.  It will be structured on both a hospital-specific site and a hospital community-specific site.</p></speech>

I confirm for members that the nursing home support scheme will provide 22,000 places this year.  There will be over &euro;939 million continuing in that resource.  At the same time, we have used &euro;23 million from that fund to develop new options in 2014.  Many of them will address the issues that Deputy Fitzpatrick talked about.  For instance, &euro;10 million will be used to develop intensive home care packages.  That will be targeted at people with dementia in addition to others whose only option at present is to enter long-stay care.  We will be targeting cases of the kind exemplified by those who are currently in hospital for a long time and we will be trying to ensure they get better options, not just long-stay care.  We will also be developing new opportunities on short-stay provision, transitional care, rehabilitation and such initiatives.  We will be trying to combine this with home care packages in a more integrated way that has not been achieved in the past.  Thus, our first step will be to ensure that the public providers, in addition to the private and home care providers, start working in a more collaborative way.  Yesterday, we met Nursing Home Ireland.  Over the next year, we will be having more productive engagement with it and the home care providers to ensure that we combine in delivering more integrated services.  Some 56,000 people have been receiving annually home help and home care packages.  This level of provision is being maintained in 2014.  It represents a significant resource of over &euro;315 million.</p><p>  As the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, stated, there are developments amounting to &euro;14 million benefiting the disability service plan this year.  Some &euro;10 million of this is targeted at initiatives to meet the needs of approximately 1,200 young people who are either leaving school or exiting rehabilitation training places.  As the Minister of State said, our intention is to put in place this year a much more focused programme.  This is already under way to ensure that all families, including the children and young people involved, will be advised of the places they will receive by June of this year.  Thus, the challenging issues that arose over the summer months in the past year and preceding years will not arise.  Out of the resource, we will address a number of emergency places that arise during the course of the year.  We will be working with the service providers in that regard.</p><p>  The other key initiative, which I referred to earlier, is the &euro;4 million that will be used to roll out a more comprehensive, integrated programme for those aged between zero and 18.  The detail of this will be included in the divisional plan that will be published later in the month.  The intention is to build on very good work done already in some of the local health offices with local implementation groups and to expand across the 25 local groups to ensure all of them are progressing in an integrated way in rolling out the model of care for this year.  That covers the services.</p></speech>

With regard to the level of investment, the &euro;25 million was put in place to improve response times in the ambulance service.  There are a number of components to this, one of which is a national control centre.  There is to be a control centre, over two sites, that will be able to monitor every single ambulance so the ambulance nearest the scene can be dispatched.  The system will be able to determine where other ambulances are available.  That will be in place by 2015.  As the Deputy will know, a number of centres have already moved to the single site in Townsend Street, which will be monitored in future from Tallaght.  The centre in Navan has moved there.  Those in Tralee and Cork moved in 2013, and others are to go on stream this year.</p><p>  Let me refer to the other important piece of infrastructure that is being put in place.  It was mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in in relation to ICT infrastructure and the geomapping and directory system.  All radio controls are now being upgraded to digital instead of analogue.  There was an investment of &euro;7 million in ICT infrastructure, and this is important.</p><p>  The other significant investment was to put in place intermediate care vehicles.  Twenty-five of those new vehicles were put in place in the second half of last year.  Rather than using an ambulance to transport patients from one hospital to another for inter-hospital transfers, we will be using the intermediate care vehicles with a view to freeing up ambulances so they can get to a scene quicker and on time.</p><p>  The improvements are not as we want them to be.  We set a target response time in 2013 of 70%.  We have delivered on that and we have set a target this year of 80%.  In some regions, we have been hitting a figure of 78%.  Therefore, we have been moving beyond the targets in those particular areas.</p><p>  It is important to note that while we are trying to improve the response times, there are approximately 334,000 calls to be answered every year.  I refer in particular to the high-category calls, which we call the delta and echo calls.  In these blue light categories, we are responding to an extra 1,000 calls per month.  This, in turn, can affect response times.</p><p>  One of the key areas to be addressed is the turnaround time of the emergency departments.  It is a question of how quickly an ambulance gets back from the emergency department.  We have set a target of 20 minutes.  That is not always achieved, so that is being addressed as part of an action plan that is currently in place.</p></speech>

It is a joint initiative between North and South.</p><p>  With regard to nurse prescribing, there is a legal and regulatory framework in place.  It has been in place since 2007.  We currently have 650 nurse prescribers and 425 in training.  There is no doubt that the introduction of nurse prescribing in the nursing home sector can yield the same benefits as in the acute sector, where it is more prevalent.  It can also yield additional benefits in terms of continuity between the acute and nursing home sectors.</p> <p>There is an issue at the moment with nurses accessing primary-care prescription pads for the purpose of reimbursement of medical card patients that we need to resolve.  In resolving that issue, we also need to ensure that the governance of that issue is robust.  In this regard, the Department, through engagement with the HSE, will progress the matter and any other matters that may be slowing down the expansion of this in the nursing home sector.</p></speech>

Since the last time I appeared before the committee, a draft implementation plan has been introduced and I understand that a meeting in the coming weeks will finalise that document.  Since I spoke here before, from a rehabilitation medicine programme point of view, five consultant posts were advertised and by the end of January four of those consultants will be in post, which represents a 70% increase in consultant numbers, which is a very welcome development.  Significant work is under way in the development of three regional units which is very welcome.  Those are key areas contained in the strategy document.</p><p>  A key priority for the directorate as a whole is the development of a specific integrated programme looking at chronic disease prevention and management.  It is important to look at prevention and management together as a whole rather than looking specifically at treatment.  That is another welcome development for 2014.</p></speech>

I will certainly take away what the Chairman is saying and have it examined.</p><p>  On the issue of those, now thankfully rare, instances where a person may remain on a register after having been deceased, this is not a significant issue for us at this stage since a protocol is in place for the recovery of any over payment.  Given that we always owe GPs more than they owe us, it is not an issue of significant concern to us.  We have access to the death events publication service and once an event is formally registered, the primary care reimbursement service will correct any overpayment that may have been made on an agreed basis.  In addition, since the end of 2012 a protocol has been agreed with the IMO that enables general practitioners themselves to renew an otherwise expired medical card if there are circumstances that lead them to believe that should happen.  This gives rise to a further opportunity for any engagement regarding the renewal of that medical card.  So they have that ability.</p></speech>

However, if the Deputy would like a separate letter I am very happy to do that.</p><p>  I wish to address the issue of section 38 and section 39 organisations.  The section 38 review arose from the Tallaght HIQA inquiry.  It went to the HSE board as it then was in July.  For the avoidance of any doubt about public pay policy, a process was commenced including the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which resulted in a restatement on an unambiguous basis of public pay policy at the end of September.  That resulted in communications to the section 38 organisations from the national director of HR confirming that policy and the bringing to conclusion of the audit process against that policy.  That policy also made clear that while section 39 employees are not public servants and are not bound in the same way, there is a requirement for them to have "due regard to public pay policy".  The letter that issued in November was in that context.</p><p>  Regarding section 39 organisations' disclosure, that was written into the 2013 service arrangement or agreement and consequently they have all had an obligation under that agreement to make those disclosures.  We are currently evaluating the completeness and accuracy of those disclosures.  When we are in a position to do so we will be happy to share the data to ensure the committee is made aware of those data.</p><p>  Regarding the provision of the section 38 report to another committee - the Committee of Public Accounts-----</p></speech>

We were appearing at the Committee of Public Accounts on the Thursday of that week - I cannot remember the exact date.  On foot of an undertaking I had given the Committee of Public Accounts in November 2012, I immediately provided a copy to the Committee of Public Accounts.

We met them differentially whether were acute-type service providers or more disability-type service providers because they are slightly different in their characteristics and the nature of their governance structures.  Where we have identified specific issues outstanding from the audit or our interaction with them, we are having one-to-one meetings.  Members will be aware of the outcome of our one-to-one meeting with the CRC.  Shortly the Committee of Public Accounts will be aware of the outcome of our one-to-one meeting with St. Vincent's University Hospital.  There are others which have not yet reached that point.</p><p>  We have also instituted a new compliance statement that will be required as part of the audit process.  This has been arrived at following consultation with the Comptroller and Auditor General, who is not the auditor for most of these bodies.  We will be requiring their boards to actively certify the extent to which they are compliant with a range of good-governance practices, including compliance with public pay policy.  That will be part of the annual process and will be embedded within it.  As members are aware, we have formally taken control of the Central Remedial Clinic following the decision of its board to resign in the context of our communication to it that given what we now knew, there was no basis for us to continue to provide it with public funding.  Consequently,  it has exited and we have put in place an interim administrator.  We will be making arrangements, working with a voluntary body, Boardmatch Ireland, to put in place a board on a competency basis.  It is not a State body so it is not a matter for ministerial appointment.  We expect to complete that within a period of months.  We currently have an interim administrator in there through whom we are carrying out a forensic audit of all matters pertaining to the governance of that service.</p> <p>I must put on record my admiration for the staff of the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, who I visited last week, for the tremendous efforts they have made to maintain vital services at a time of considerable stress for them, the patients and the parents of patients during the course of public disclosure of matters of which they had no knowledge themselves.  I met with some parents and clients who very much value the work of the staff of the CRC and whose integrity should not be brought into question as a result of these disclosures.  We very much hope through this process to rehabilitate the good name of the CRC, as well as the Santa Bear appeal and the clinic&rsquo;s other appeals that have been widely supported over the years.</p><p> Regarding Deputy Fitzpatrick&rsquo;s questions on interventions, yesterday I visited the Louth-Meath hospital group which this year, with specific supports, has made significant achievements in its performance in inpatient-outpatient service provision, elective surgery and trolley waiting time reductions.  It also achieved a 92% rating from HIQA on hand hygiene standards during a recent audit.  All of these developments represent a significant turnaround at this hospital group, led by Margaret Swords, general manager, and Dr. Dominic O'Brannagain, medical director.</p></speech>

Will Mr. O'Brien provide the committee with more detail of the scope and objectives of this strategy, as well as the timelines for kicking and dragging our health system&rsquo;s use of technology into the 21st century?</p><p>  I also welcome the recent announcement of the establishment of a review group to examine the 0 to 18 year old category of people with lifelong conditions, so as to establish how we can best serve their medical needs through devices or access to services they might lose by losing their medical card.  This is particularly welcome given the media attention on children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome who have lost their medical cards over the past several weeks.</p><p>  Bringing forward the HIQA investigation into ambulance response times is an acknowledgment that we have an issue in this area, be it a public perception or real one.  What will be the scope of the investigation?  When will it start and finish?  How quickly will we respond to its recommendations?  If there are particular hotspots where the accepted call-out time for 70% of ECHO calls is not achieved, will factors around these be fed into the scope?</p><p>  The public deal announced by Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien solving a particular issue at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital is due to the fact that the gentleman in question will be completely paid out of private funds.  This fixes the issue arising for section 39 bodies.  The Minister said this morning, however, that he found it wholly unacceptable that one person should be the chief executive officer of both hospitals as it causes a conflict of interest.  Will the Minister reconcile this with the HSE&rsquo;s announcement that fixed that situation several days ago?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-16a.1956" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014011600019#U00400"><p>I again welcome my colleagues.  With respect to my previous question on accountancy numbers which was very technical, I am very happy with the written answer provided and do not require any further clarification on the matter.</p><p>  I would welcome a little discussion on the graduate nursing scheme, with which I am slightly troubled.  It appears to be implicit in the philosophy behind the scheme that there was some type of deficit or lack of experience among the nurses coming into the system.  This was to be remedied by these candidate nurses coming into the graduate scheme through an intermediate job where they will get additional education.  When was this first flagged as a problem, as it is certainly not one that was obvious to me?  If the logic of the scheme is that it is remedying an experience deficit, then surely the logic of the scheme extends to the point that when they achieve the experience, they stay in the system in full jobs as fully experienced and trained nurses.  If, however, they rotate out of the jobs, as will happen, to be replaced by additional graduate scheme nurses, then we will just have a continuously rotating pool of people coming in without experience.  If we are trying to address an experience deficit, it seems to me there is a failure of logic in that approach.</p><p>  There is another interpretation which can be put on this.  By having a continuous pool of graduate nurses coming in on a different payscale, who are doing the same work that fully trained and experienced nurses were doing before, we are recalibrating the lower market salary scale for nurses.  In fact, this is attempting, by fiat, to distort the normal market for nurses coming into post.</p><p>  In addition, there is a real corollary to this.  If these posts are different from the full posts which occur following completion of the graduate scheme, then they should have a substantial educational component.  In talking to and canvassing the opinions of nurses in the scheme to date, there is a perception that this is not the case as yet.  Will the Minister clarify for me what the exact extent of the scheme was and what are the plans to firm up the educational arrangements?</p><p>  Is Mr. O&rsquo;Brien happy that the board structures of many of our hospitals which provide a service in the public sector, particularly our voluntary hospitals, are elected and comprised in an appropriate fashion?  Alternatively, are they self-perpetuating oligarchs which act to represent the interests, partly, of the institution but, partly, of other interests who no longer run the institutions?  The latter is my perception.  Will there be any attempt to get a match between the actual accountability of the board structures of our public hospitals and those who actually pay for them?</p></speech>

To whom or to what agency will the hospital groups be accountable when they are established?  The Minister has stated he hopes planning permission for the national children&rsquo;s hospital will have been secured by December 2014.  How long will this delay the completion of the project?  When will the GP-visit card for the under-fives card be rolled out?</p><p>  The national screening service is expecting 140,000 women to attend for breast screens this year.  The mobile clinic serving Drimnagh and Crumlin will be withdrawn at the end of this month for two years.  The staff of this unit told me they have no funding.  Crumlin, Drimnagh, Inchicore, Ballyfermot and south-west inner city Dublin are the most challenging health areas in Dublin city and they are serviced by this unit.  Women in these areas have been told to attend clinics in Tallaght and Clondalkin, which will be a significant inconvenience to them.  We should be targeting those areas where people will not normally want to attend these clinics.  Will this be reviewed?</p><p>  On Monday last, my brother was taken seriously ill at my local primary care centre and he needed to be brought to hospital by ambulance.</p> <p>When he arrived there, he was in a distressed state but the staff were wonderful with him.  I was told about five minutes later that it would be an hour before the ambulance could take him to the local hospital, which is St. James's Hospital.  I was asked by the doctor who was his GP at the time whether I would mind taking him in the car to St. James's Hospital, which I did.  This took on average a couple of minutes but they were very important minutes because he was very stressed, in a lot of pain with his chest and had a number of other issues that needed to be dealt with.  From the time I entered the accident and emergency department, he was dealt with straightaway and taken into resuscitation and, thank God, he is still in hospital and doing well.  </p><p> The reason I am raising it is because of the delay of an hour.  The doctor has suspicions that he could have had a heart attack or really bad respiratory problems.  Waiting in the accident and emergency department, I witnessed three ambulances that were stationary out in the area.  I happen to know somebody in the medical team who arrived in one of them who said it was a constant reminder that each time they entered the accident and emergency department in St. James's Hospital, they could be anything from 30 to 40 minutes waiting to receive a trolley back.  I am raising this because on that day, I can only say that the work I saw doctors, nurses and aides do was unreal.  I have never seen anything like it.  There were 72 patients in cubicles, ten on trolleys in the corridor and another 62 waiting in the accident and emergency department.  Over 100 people were in that accident and emergency department.  Is there any other way?  We are talking about a turnaround time of 20 minutes.  I heard what Ms McGuinness said.  A number of other people have raised issues.  Only that I witnessed it, I would not have believed that anybody with chest pains would be asked to wait an hour for an ambulance to come.  I was lucky that we lived so close to the hospital.   The doctor said that but for the fact that we lived so close to the hospital, she would not have allowed him to be taken from the primary care centre.  What delays ambulances departing from the bays is the fact that they are unable to retrieve their trolleys.  That is a fact, not a myth or a story.  I witnessed it myself.  Perhaps somebody might be able to address that.</p></speech>

I want to ask some supplementary questions.  In respect of question No. 23 and the money follows the patient model, how will this work in terms of non-elective and emergency activity?  It will be more difficult to predict what is emergency and non-elective.  How will that element of funding be adjudicated on and costed?  Will the Minister confirm that the money will actually follow the patient?  I raised this issue on a number of occasions.  In the past two to three years, the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar has received a reduction in its annual budget despite the fact that its activity has increased.</p><p>  In respect of question No. 38 about dermatology services in the midlands, I note that plans are being developed for the provision of this service in the region.  When will those plans be published?  Can the Minister indicate whether he would be willing to consider re-establishing a full-time consultant position within the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar because there was a full-time consultant for this service from 2007 to the end of 2010?  This service is now being shared with St. James's Hospital.  At the end of last year, urgent cases are taking eight to nine weeks to be seen.  There were 1,052 routine cases at the end of December 2013 and a waiting list of two years and four months in the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar.  Patients from this area are being asked to visit a consultant in St. James's Hospital who comes down to Mullingar two days a week.  Will the Minister explore the possibility of re-instating that consultant on a full-time basis in the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar?</p><p>  In respect of question No. 22 and funding for maternity hospitals, I do not expect the Minister to have this information today but perhaps he could furnish me with the ratio of maternity staff to patients for the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar?  According to my information, it is not comparable to similar maternity hospitals.  Again, the Minister talks about carrying out a plan and strategy.  When will he furnish the project plan for this strategy and can he indicate a clear timeframe?  He talks about review and evaluation of current services.  Will there be a review of the viability of some maternity hospitals or units?  If so, what criteria will be used?  </p><p>  In respect of discretionary medical cards, I am sorry I missed some of the meeting.  I acknowledge there is a reduction in the targeted savings but there still appears to be a targeted approach to decline medical cards to achieve savings.  I, and I am sure other members, deal with a variety of constituents and they have to fight so hard to obtain a discretionary medical card which they had up to now.  Their circumstances have not changed and in some instances have deteriorated and they still find it extraordinarily difficult to get their medical card so I would welcome the Minister's opinion on that.</p></speech>

I can come back to Deputy Regina Doherty about scope and objectives regarding e-health and give her a very detailed answer.  This is a hugely important initiative and we have nearly finished our ICT strategy, which will be ready in the next few weeks.  It is critically important for the reform of the health service.  I was astonished to hear the other day that there are 1,700 different IT systems within the health service.  They do not all rate the pay but they are all different little systems that have grown up for different purposes.  We must address that and are doing so.  We will have a very cogent and coherent plan for that.  It is important to say that there has been a history of near trepidation and fear of anything to do with IT ever since the PPARS fiasco but this is a nettle we must grasp.  I am very pleased to say that very good people in the HSE and the Department are working on this.  The new chief information officer will be critically important in this regard.</p><p>  In respect of HIQA, it is not an investigation but a review.  It was a standard review to be done in the second quarter but I want it done now with immediate effect insofar as that can be achieved.  Obviously, it must make some preparations to do it.  It should not take a long period of time.  It will be comprehensive and will certainly focus on the areas that have been highlighted here such as the issues in Letterkenny, the issues mentioned by Deputy Catherine Byrne in St. James's Hospital and issues that have arisen in Drogheda and the north east.  It will be right across the system to see why we have had problems.  As I said earlier, it is certainly not acceptable that an ambulance should be held for an hour outside an emergency department.  If nothing else, they should give them a spare trolley and let them go.  The patient in need lying at the side of the road must be looked after and looked after quickly.  </p><p>  I will let Mr. Carter address the area addressed by Deputy Catherine Byrne in a more comprehensive fashion.  Sticking with Deputy Regina Doherty, Mr. O'Brien can clarify the issue of the top ups but my position is that I am talking about best practice in terms of the management of a public hospital and any perceived or real conflicts of interest that might exist through being CEO of both a public and a private hospital and what that might mean.  What Mr. O'Brien was alluding to was compliance with public sector pay but I can let him talk further about that.  </p><p>  In respect of Senator Crown's question, the graduate nursing scheme will continue.  I was very much involved with and supportive of this scheme.</p> <p>It offers job opportunities outside the employment control framework imposed by the Government and it gives nurses a chance to stay here while developing their skills.  A range of areas, such as wellness screening and prescribing, as well as procedures like intravenous cannula insertion and catheterisation, would be invaluable not only in a community setting, whether a nursing home or general practice, but also in hospitals.  While we cannot guarantee people jobs when their two-year term has been completed, if they are employed it will be at the full rate.  In my view they will be highly sought after and, as general practice expands to cope with an increasing workload, much of the work will be carried out by practice nurses.  I would like to see every GP employing at least two practice nurses to deal with the amount of work coming their way.  I ask the chief nursing officer to address that issue in more comprehensive detail.</p><p> In regard to the current constitution of voluntary hospital boards, the comments from the director general preceded what we found in Tallaght and we have been addressing anything that has happened since then with the new competence based regime.  The director general can address that issue more comprehensively.  In regard to who is responsible, the trusts will be answerable to the HSE in the interregnum until the new health commissioning agency is established.  At all times they are ultimately answerable to the Department of Health, the Minister for Health and the Oireachtas.</p><p> I do not have details on the mobile clinic in Crumlin and will refer the issue to the HSE.  The roll-out in respect of children under the age of six years will take place in the middle of the year.  A number of contractual issues have to be resolved and it will be necessary to consult stakeholders.  Legislation is also required.</p><p> I apologise to the committee for indicating in my opening statement that planning permission for the new children's hospital will be dealt with by the end of this year.  It will actually be spring of next year.  That will not delay construction, however.  We have appointed a children's hospital board which is working well.  One of the key issues is to ensure that the mindset of the board, management and those who will staff the hospital regard it as a virtual hospital even before it is completed so that all the problems we encountered over 17 years in Tallaght and when Beaumont Hospital was set up will not arise in this instance.  Even though there was a close relationship between Beaumont and the former Richmond Hospital, as a local GP I can attest that it was a long time before the hospital got its act together.  We want to make sure the problems are addressed long before construction is completed in late 2018.</p><p> Deputy Troy asked about the money follows the patient model in respect of emergency departments.  It was never intended that the money follows the patient model would apply to an emergency department because it would be too complex to achieve.  Emergency services will be funded centrally.  He referred to Mullingar in particular, which is a great hospital, and asked about the dermatology plan for the midlands.  I will revert to the Deputy on that.  We can examine the question of reinstatement and see what it throws up.  I agree with him that it would be a useful exercise to investigate the funding and staff ratios of maternity hospitals, including Mullingar in particular, and I will revert to him on that.  We continuously review what happens in our hospitals, particularly our maternity hospitals, and are actively considering the question of co-locating maternity and adult hospitals.</p><p> Members' questions on medical cards were addressed earlier.  I acknowledge the concerns that have been expressed about the ability of those with lifelong conditions to access services.  We will be putting in place a small review group within the HSE to investigate how we can best address the needs of such individuals.  As Mr. Healy addressed that issue in some detail, Deputy Troy will forgive me if I do not rehearse his comments.</p></speech>

All of our nurses and midwives now undergo a four-year degree programme, on completion of which they are eligible to register with An Bord Altranais.  Once they register with the board they are nurses.  They can practice within the full scope of practice of a nurse and are held accountable to the full code of conduct.  There is no difference between any nurse who registers in Ireland in terms of what he or she can practice or for what he or she can be held accountable.</p><p>  The graduate nurse programme was introduced as a separate employment initiative.  In stringent times, it was designed to give opportunities to up to 1,000 nurses and midwives to gain experience.  It includes two additional elements, namely, the capacity for nurses undertaking this programme to get a variety of clinical experience to add to their portfolio and access to three modules of an educational programme approved by An Bord Altranais.  It is entirely separate from the programme for registration and it does not in any way undermine the programme.  It can also be offset against higher and future educational qualification, such as at masters level.  Where substantive vacancies arise the HSE may chose to recruit to fill a vacancy and in such instances graduate nurses may apply in the same way as any other nurse.  There are currently 358 graduates on the programme, with a further 305 in process.  Overall, there are 1,049 applicants for the programme.</p></speech>

We spoke about the employment guidelines but both the departmental guidelines and the graduate nursing scheme come from the Government.  This could be construed as an attempt to lower the bar of competition for the pay and conditions of nurses.</p></speech>

I do not know if I am in a position to give the Senator a cast iron guarantee that it could never happen but it was not designed for that purpose.  It was designed for a number of reasons, as outlined by the chief nursing officer.  It was a means of getting around the employment control framework so that additional staff could be made available.  Along with the nursing bank, it also removed the need to depend on agency staff.  In that regard, it is not intended that the jobs be seen as replacing full-time, full-pay jobs.  That is not the case.</p></speech>

Not only is there no plan but there is no reason for us to pursue one.</p><p>  In regard to the discussion on St. Vincent's University Hospital, I am conscious of the Chair's directions on Standing Orders and I am doubly conscious that currently my nominee and Corkonian cousin, Mr. Barry O'Brien, is before the Committee of Public Accounts to discuss the issues arising.</p></speech>

I have met with representatives of the board of St. Vincent's on three occasions between just before Christmas and as recently as Tuesday, and I have made clear what elements are required for us to be able to regard them as being compliant.  As of the last time I was appraised of the matter, they had not been in a position to confirm this.  Perhaps they have now done so before the Committee of Public Accounts.  For this reason, I want to be careful in what I say.  In regard to a specific question on the matter, we would not regard good governance being in place if a single individual was the chief executive of both the public and the private hospitals.  If those roles are to be separated, it is important that the chief executive of the public hospital and the general manager of the second public hospital report to a public interest committee of that board rather than to the group board directly.</p> <p>Obviously, they would have a relationship with the group board, as in any situation.</p><p> Senator Crown asked about general governance issues.  It is clear that there are some anachronistic governance arrangements.  I will explain how we have sought to deal with them.  We are requiring all boards of directors to commit to adherence to a new governance protocol by the end of this month.  The protocol will be embedded in the audit process of each institution.  It will include a clear statement that the functions of the board of a publicly funded health care provider are to act in the best interests of the users of its services, its staff and, more generally, the body it oversees; to ensure appropriate clinical and professional governance arrangements are in place; to lead and direct the organisation's activities; to provide strategic guidance; to monitor the activities and effectiveness of the CEO and the management team; to ensure effective systems are in place for identifying and managing risk; and to ensure the adequacy of internal financial controls, particularly in the interests of accounting accurately to the State as the primary funder of its activities.</p><p> We are also requiring that the membership of the board should reflect diversity in terms of gender, skills and areas of competency and that the size of the board should be large enough to take account of its full range of duties but small enough to perform those duties effectively.  We are saying that unless otherwise set out in statute, the membership term of each board member or director should not generally exceed three years and the number of terms should be limited.  We are also saying that the rotation of board members should occur on a phased basis from now to ensure there is both change and continuity.  We have reserved the right to appoint a named individual to work with the board and the directors in resolving any unidentified governance or performance issues, and indeed to appoint a public interest director should the need arise.</p><p> With due respect to the many fine individuals who serve voluntarily and without pay on the boards of various section 38 and section 39 bodies, the vast majority of whom are not the subject of the current issues of concern, it is clear that the issue of compliance with public pay policy has become somewhat totemic.  There is now a focus on the general compliance of these boards with good governance in terms of their structure, their rotation and some of their decision-making processes.  We want to work with each of the boards to bring them to a different place that is informed by a contemporary approach to good corporate governance.  It is absolutely at the forefront of our efforts that this process should serve the interests of those whom these institutions are designed to serve, as opposed to the interests of those who may own them now or may have owned them in the past.  The straight answer to the Senator's question about whether I am satisfied that all of those things are now universally in place is "No".</p></speech>

We will encourage all of them to introduce an independent dimension.  In the case of the Central Remedial Clinic, for example, the HSE, as the entity with responsibility for re-establishing the board, is working with Boardmatch Ireland as part of an external, independent and competency-based approach.  We will offer support to encourage all of these boards to use that type of process for the reinvigoration of the boards.  Each corporate entity will have a process laid down under company law that governs how board members are formally appointed.  That is of less concern to me than the process by which they are selected.</p></speech>
