    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-21a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1270" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2016072100002#A00200"><p>I have received apologies from Deputies Se&aacute;n Crowe and Darragh O'Brien.  I welcome Deputy Lisa Chambers who is substituting for Deputy O'Brien.</p> <p>  Before commencing today's business, I express my sympathy and that of the committee and extend our condolences to the families of those killed and injured and also to the people of France and those countries whose citizens were affected by the terrible attack in Nice on 14 July.  It is very sad for such a heinous event to occur and, in particular, be thrust upon innocent people on a day when they were celebrating their country's national day.  It is up to the people of Europe and the world to stand together to ensure that a solution is found to stop other future tragedies from occurring.  I have already written to the French ambassador, H.E. Mr. Th&eacute;bault, to express my condolences and those of the committee to him and the people of France.</p> <p>  The main business of this meeting is the resolution of the D&aacute;il that was passed on 7 July.  That resolution requested this committee to invite the ambassador of the Arab Republic of Egypt, H.E. Ms Soha Gendi, to appear before it to address the repeated delays in the trial of Mr. Ibrahim Halawa and to request her to convey to the relevant authorities in Egypt this House's concern that Mr. Ibrahim Halawa should be released and allowed to return to Ireland as soon as possible.</p> <p>  I propose that we invite the ambassador, H.E. Ms Soha Gendi, to appear before the committee next Thursday.  I am anxious that we deal with this business before August.  Is that proposal agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Our convening here this morning was to enable to us to forward this request to the ambassador.  Once it is agreed, we will send that request immediately and we have decided on next Thursday as a suitable date for the ambassador to attend.  Hopefully, it will be a joint committee meeting.  I believe that Seanad &Eacute;ireann was to finalise its nominees last night and that will enable us to convene a joint committee meeting.</p></speech>

Of course, we are hoping the ambassador will accede to our request to attend the committee meeting.  The indications our officials have is that the joint committee will be formed before next Thursday.  However, if it is not, we will proceed in select committee format.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

Will members leave it with the clerk, the adviser and myself to come back to each member in that regard?  Hopefully, the ambassador will be available to attend the meeting.  If not, we will discuss with the members as to whether we will proceed with a meeting.  We will revert to each member as soon as we have a response from the ambassador.</p></speech>
