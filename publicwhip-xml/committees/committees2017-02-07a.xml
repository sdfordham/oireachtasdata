On the occasion of our previous attendance, in March 2015, AHI had just published its strategic plan for the period 2015 to 2017, and we availed of the opportunity at that meeting to set out in some detail for the members our ambitions for the next three years.  As we move into the final year of the current strategic planning cycle, it is opportune to take stock of the progress that has been made and the challenges that remain to be addressed.  My following remarks will provide an update on the AHI priority programmes: the bovine viral diarrhoea, BVD, eradication programme; the infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, IBR, eradication programme; the dairy cow mastitis reduction programme, CellCheck; the Johne's disease, JD, control programme; and the national abattoir surveillance programme, Beef HealthCheck.  I do not propose to go into detail in this opening statement on our other priorities set out in the strategic plan, which deal with matters relating to the general corporate development of AHI, particularly our funding and governance models, but I remain at the disposition of the committee over the course of this session to respond to questions members may have on any aspect of our business.</p> <p>  The objective of the BVD programme is to eradicate BVD from the national cattle herd by the end of 2020.  BVD is a disease of considerable economic importance to Irish farmers.  A cost-benefit analysis commissioned by AHI places the losses associated with this infection at &euro;102 million per annum.  The compulsory phase of the programme, which began in 2013 following a successful pilot in 2012, targets the identification and removal of animals persistently infected with BVD virus from the national breeding herd through the testing of samples of ear tissue collected during the routine tagging process.  Over the four years of the programme to date, this has resulted in a 75% reduction in the prevalence of PI calves born, from 0.66% in 2013 to 0.17% in 2016, translating into a benefit to farmers of over &euro;65 million in that year after programme costs are taken into account.  The proportion of herds with positive results has declined in parallel, from 11.3% in 2013 to 3.2% in 2016.  Over this period, the proportion of the national breeding herd that has been assigned BVD status on the programme database has increased to almost 100%.  This, together with the reduction in prevalence, has allowed 80% of the 83,000 breeding herds to acquire negative herd status, NHS, with the majority of the remaining herds only requiring test results for small numbers of animals to also acquire NHS.  This is an important steppingstone toward national freedom, which, in addition, rewards herd owners through their ability to access lower-cost testing.</p> <p>  While the programme has made good progress to date, it has faced a number of challenges, which the members of the BVD programme implementation group continue to address.  Principal among these has been the retention of PI animals by a minority of herd owners.  The negative impact of this behaviour has been demonstrated in a number of studies and in the outputs of a sophisticated model that has been developed to inform the decision-making of the BVD technical working group and the implementation group.  Based on recommendations of the technical working group, a number of changes have been made to the programme for 2017.  These include a continuation of tag testing in 2017; an increased level of financial support for the removal of PI calves, but a reduction in the period for which these are available; automation of the placing of restrictions on herds that retain PI animals for more than five weeks, and notification of their neighbours to allow appropriate biosecurity measures to be put in place; a requirement for confirmatory testing to be conducted on blood samples collected by a veterinary practitioner, with the cost being met by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; and the requirement for all herds with positive results to undergo an investigation by a trained veterinary practitioner as part of the targeted advisory service on animal health, funded under the rural development programme.</p> <p>  A programme for the eradication of a highly infectious animal disease, such as BVD, requires a co-ordinated whole-of-island approach in order to be effective.  In this regard, I am glad to say AHI has been in close collaboration with colleagues in Animal Health and Welfare NI and other relevant organisations in Northern Ireland since the inception of the programme in this jurisdiction.  The BVD eradication programme in Northern Ireland, which entered a compulsory phase in 2016, shares the same design features as our programme, and there is a regular exchange of technical information between the two programmes.  This close co-ordination creates a sound basis for the eradication of this damaging disease from the island of Ireland as a whole, within the timeframes to which I referred.  Furthermore, it provides a template from which we can draw in designing and implementing programmes for the control of other economically important animal diseases on a whole-of-island basis.</p> <p>  The objective of the IBR programme is to eradicate IBR from the national herd, subject to a positive cost-benefit analysis and a mandate from AHI stakeholders.  The IBR technical working group has previously developed a number of resources providing best practice on controlling and eradicating IBR at the individual herd level, and it is currently developing options to be included in a cost-benefit analysis of a national programme.  In addition to the losses arising from both clinical and sub-clinical disease in dairy and beef herds, the current absence of an approved national programme poses a threat to live exports as other countries continue to put approved programmes in place and receive additional guarantees from the European Commission as a result.  Most recently, the acquisition by Belgium of approved programme status has led to the almost complete cessation of Irish live cattle exports to this market.</p> <p>  The objective of the national dairy cow mastitis reduction programme, CellCheck, is to facilitate the Irish dairy industry to continue to improve milk quality such that 75% of the milk supplied by Irish farmers will have a somatic cell count of 200,000 cells per millilitre or less by the end of 2020.  One of the priority activities of the CellCheck programme has been the establishment of a national bulk tank somatic cell count database.  This database now contains data accounting for approximately 93% for the national milk pool for the three years 2013, 2014 and 2015.  Analysis of this data shows a positive trend in the udder health of the national herd.  The proportion of herds with an average somatic cell count of less than 200,000 cells per millilitre in 2015 was 60%, while the proportion of milk meeting this standard stood at 64%.  In 2013, the analogous figures were 39% and 46%, respectively.</p> <p>  CellCheck farmer workshops have been included as one of the compulsory elements of the dairy knowledge transfer, KT, programme, a measure within the current rural development plan, with a target to deliver approximately 270 workshops within the first 18 months of the programme.  Since the KT programme commenced in October 2016, approximately 120 workshops have been delivered.  A second phase of delivery, which will commence once the spring calving peak has passed, should see the remaining workshops completed before the end of 2017.  These workshops are designed to create an active learning environment for small groups of farmers.  They are farm-based and interactive, with the delivery being provided by teams of CellCheck-trained local service providers.  Participant feedback from these workshops has been very positive to date.</p> <p>  Training of additional service providers continues, with the objective of increasing the capacity of the programme to engage with farmers on mastitis control and to expand the network of service providers trained to deliver CellCheck farmer workshops.  AHI is also working on the development of additional training modules to facilitate continued upskilling of service providers.  Challenges for the future of the CellCheck programme include defining the role that the programme will play in contributing to Government action on the major societal challenge of antimicrobial resistance.  This and a number of other key issues are currently being discussed under the chairmanship of AHI in the CellCheck implementation group.</p> <p>  Next is the JD control programme.  A major pilot programme for the control of JD, led and co-ordinated by AHI, ran for three years, from 2014 to 2016, with the objective of determining the feasibility of establishing a future national voluntary control programme for this important disease.  At the conclusion of the pilot programme, 1,214 dairy herds were enrolled.  Farmers who participated in the pilot phase of the programme undertook a number of actions aimed at reducing the risk of the disease entering their herd, or at controlling its spread within their herd if the infection was already present.  The principal actions undertaken were the completion of an on-farm risk assessment, led by veterinary practitioners who had been trained and approved by AHI, and the carrying out of annual testing of the eligible animals in the herd.  In the pilot programme, the cost of the risk assessment visit was met in full by the Department, while participating milk processors provided a financial subsidy to partially offset the cost of testing.</p> <p>  Following a period of consultation, hosted by Animal Health Ireland in the final quarter of 2016, and subsequent meetings of the JD implementation group, there would appear to be general support among stakeholders for the continuation of national efforts to mitigate the risks relating to JD in Ireland.  AHI has developed a draft business plan for such a programme and in an imminent meeting of the JD implementation group will seek the agreement of stakeholders on its commencement.  The draft objectives of the programme are to provide additional reassurance to the marketplace regarding Ireland's effort to control JD and to mitigate against antimicrobial resistance; to enhance the ability of participating farmers to keep their herds clear of JD and to clear infection from their herds, if present; to improve calf health and farm biosecurity on participating farms; and to reduce the requirement for antimicrobial usage on participating farms, consequent to improvements in animal health and biosecurity.</p> <p>  The Beef HealthCheck programme, which was formally launched in 2015, has two objectives.  The first is to develop tools to assist farmers and their veterinary practitioners to control losses due to liver fluke and pneumonia through the capturing, analysis and reporting of abattoir data.  The second is to contribute to the development by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, of economic breeding indexes that incorporate health and disease data.</p> <p>  Working closely with the Department, Meat Industry Ireland, Veterinary Ireland and ICBF, AHI has developed a harmonised system for recording liver and lung lesions in slaughtered cattle and reporting the information back to farmers.  Relevant information is captured in meat plants by the temporary veterinary inspectors, who record it on touchscreens situated at the veterinary inspection points on the factory floor.</p><p>For several months now, the information generated by the system has been reported back to farmers by means of colour-coded paper-based report.  The paper-based reports are now being supplemented by a new system, hosted on the ICBF database, which allows farmers to view the Beef HealthCheck information for their herd online.  This information can also be shared with the farmer's veterinary practitioner, facilitating herd health planning.  The scope of this programme, currently covering 65% of the national beef kill, and its ability to report key animal health outcomes in close to real time, provides Irish farmers and their vets with a unique facility, unmatched, to my knowledge, in any of the countries with which we compete in the international marketplace.</p><p> I acknowledge the financial and other support AHI receives form all its members and stakeholders, without which we would be unable to deliver on behalf of the industry.  I am proud of the strong record of achievement of this organisation over the years since its establishment in 2009 and I believe that the continuing support of our stakeholders bears testament to the fact that AHI has demonstrated a real contribution to the national effort to make farming and the agrifood sector in Ireland more profitable and sustainable.  I and my colleagues look forward to engaging with the committee on any of the matters outlined in my opening remarks and any other aspect of our work.</p></speech>

Even though the organisation was only established in 2009, it has had a remarkable effect on the agricultural industry.</p> <p>  I wish to speak about the BVD eradication and the Johne's disease issue.  BVD eradication has been a remarkable success.  From the farmers' point of view the ease of tagging has worked out very well.  There was great concern about the PIs staying on farms.  The change in the past few months regarding farmers being notified of a PI on a neighbour's farm has helped somewhat because that had to happen.  It made no logical sense for PIs to be left on farms and defeated the whole purpose of the programme.  Given the success of the BVD eradication programme, one would be hopeful that we will be BVD free by 2020.</p> <p>  The other side of the coin is the Johne's disease issue.  I will not speak much on the Johne's disease issue, which is one of the key issues in the dairy industry.  I know co-operatives such as Carbery in west County Cork have been very proactive in trying to deal with this.  It is key to get buy-in right now so we have a national programme.  Education is key for calf rearing.  We need to work to ensure we do not spread that disease through the national herd.  I ask Mr. O'Flaherty to outline the next steps in introducing a programme similar to the BVD eradication programme.  When does Mr. O'Flaherty believe the national herd will be free of Johne's disease?</p> <p>  Has there been any input from the Northern Ireland authorities regarding an all-island approach to Johne's disease, given the amount of milk that flows in both directions in the Border counties?  It is one of the major issues facing the agriculture industry.  We need to learn from the pilot programme, but it was only a pilot.  The next step is to put in place a national programme.  How confident is Mr. O'Flaherty that Animal Health Ireland will be able to get the funding to establish a national eradication programme with a view to being able to declare ourselves Johne's free?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-07a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017020700002#D00400"><p>I welcome the delegation.  In another life I was involved when Animal Health Ireland was trying to get off the ground.  As Senator Lombard said, it has achieved a considerable amount in a short timeframe.  While I hope I do not come across as being over-critical, some issues could have been handled better and we need to learn from some of the mistakes made in the initial programmes undertaken by Animal Health Ireland.</p> <p>  There has been huge progress on BVD eradication, we were told we were on a three-year timeframe for the eradication of the disease and that farmers would have to pay for the test for three years.  We have gone past that timeframe.  Hopefully we can see the end of the road.  When does Mr. O'Flaherty believe we will reach the end of the road?</p> <p>  The Department has let us down regarding PIs.  The retention of PIs on farm drove farmers around the bend.  One farmer might have done everything by the book, but a neighbouring farmer might have been retaining PIs.  There has been resentment among farmers who had no PIs for a number of years and then in year three or four of the scheme, they find three or four PIs, which they blame on the retention of PIs.  If we are embarking on a scheme in the future, animals need to be removed and that has to be backed up with legislative powers.  It is no good relying in the goodwill of farmers to remove these animals.  That has not worked well and has left a sour taste.  We need to learn from that.  If we are operating such a scheme in future, there should be legislative power requiring animals to be moved.</p> <p>  With brucellosis in the past, Northern Ireland was three or four years behind us.  When we were trying to get brucellosis-free status, we were a long way ahead of Northern Ireland.  There is only a ditch separating farmers from farmers in Northern Ireland.  The same seems to be the case with BVD eradication where we seem to be three or four years ahead of Northern Ireland farmers.  We should try to co-ordinate it.  As we are going to operate a scheme here, Northern Ireland should move in unison with us.  When we get to a stage of being able to declare that we are free of BVD or any other disease, we should not be looking over our shoulder in case an outbreak will come from Northern Ireland and hinder the progress we have made.</p> <p>  I ask the delegation to elaborate on IBR.  What plans are in place to tackle IBR and move that scheme forward?  Obviously there would be huge economic benefit if we could control IBR.</p> <p>  Huge progress has been made on somatic cell count.  The farmers' workshops are working extremely well.  With the increasing demands of the marketplace we need milk with a somatic cell count below 200,000 cells per millilitre.  We have made huge progress in that regard.</p> <p>  There has been a pilot programme on Johne's disease.  On the cost and reliability of the test, we need to see where we are going.  Johne's disease is a serious issue on many dairy farms.  There is always a threat to the product we are producing given that other countries are making inroads on Johne's disease.  I would like more flesh on the bones regarding the test for Johne's disease in the first place.  When a farmer is engaging on a testing programme on his herd, his confidence in that test is of paramount importance.  I would like more information on the reliability and cost of that test.</p> <p>  On the health check and getting information back from abattoirs, that is a low cost way to get vital information back to farmers about how their dosing regime is going with regard to liver fluke and lungworms.  That is a very welcome development that can bring vital herd-management information to farmers.  We should try to move that forward.</p> <p>  Many of us are using many different vaccinations on our farms at the moment.  Does Animal Health Ireland have a view on salmonella?  Many dairy farmers are using salmonella vaccinations.</p><p>Is there any way we can test whether that farm needs to continue that vaccination programme indefinitely?  I was talking to a farmer the other day who just had a breakdown with salmonella.  There were abortions in his herd.  When one finds out that there is a salmonella outbreak, it is too late for that year.  One is going to have significant losses.  Must people who are vaccinating keep doing it for forever and a day?  Is there a way of showing people who are not doing it that they are exposing themselves to significant potential risk?  A lot of work is being done but one can never have enough done for animal health.  On the bovine viral diarrhoea, BVD, issue, we need to learn that when starting a scheme in the future, we need to have all the i's dotted and t's crossed.  The scheme for Johne's disease, JD, will last for a number of years when we embark on it.  We need to be sure that something we say at the start does not turn out to happen as the scheme goes forward in order that farmers' confidence is not undermined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-07a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017020700002#E00200"><p>I welcome everyone here today.</p> <p>  Many farmers have seen tremendous benefits over the last number of years from the work Animal Health Ireland, AHI, has been doing, and the BVD eradication programme has really made huge advances.  Much of it has been said already but we need to see when we can expect to have some conclusion on that.  Deputy Cahill said many vaccinations have been used on many farms for many years.  Is there any possibility of some of those becoming defunct or coming to a stage where they are no longer going to be able to provide the cover they do?  I live in a Border area and I am very conscious of the trade that crosses the Border, not just in animals but in foodstuffs and everything else.  We need some kind of an all-Ireland status.  We need an all-Ireland animal health organisation that could work seamlessly together to ensure that we can try to move things forward.  I would be interested to know the views on that.</p> <p>  One advantage we have is the network of veterinary laboratories across the country, which has been very useful and has provided a great advantage and service to many farmers.  There is one near me in Sligo.  I am concerned to hear there may be some rationalisation of that or a change whereby some of them may close or may move to one or two central locations.  A lot of people in the farming community and other places would be very concerned about that because it would mean that an animal that needed to go to a laboratory somewhere for tests would have to travel across the whole country.  That brings to mind foot and mouth and all that.  The current system is working well, has stood the test of time and should be kept in place.  I would be interested in the witnesses' views on that.</p></speech>

It is recognised that the primary reason for this has been the retention of persistently infected, PI, animals, albeit by a minority of herd owners.  The implementation group has sought consistently over the years of the programme thus far to reinforce and refine.  There is recognition of the additional measures that have been brought in this year, including notification of neighbours in order that they can put in place biosecurity measures, more prompt imposition of restrictions, refinement of the financial supports and the timescales available for them.  We are very hopeful that we will see further benefit from those measures through the course of 2017.  On foot of the partial introduction of a number of those measures in 2016, we have seen a marked improvement in addressing retention issues.  The rate of progress of reduction of PIs in 2016 was much greater than in previous years as that retention issue has been addressed.  Looking to the future within the programme, one piece of work that has been very useful for the implementation group and that increasingly is informing its thinking has been the development of a national level model of the disease within the country.  It allows us to interrogate that model and to ask a series of different questions about the impact of different measures.</p> <p>  On times to eradication, the outputs of that modelling indicate that is feasible by 2020.  The challenge remains for all stakeholders to continue to do the right thing.  There are increasing measures and there is the scope for the implementation group to agree and to seek more stringent measures still to address those.  To some extent, some of those still remain at farm level and need to be implemented there.</p> <p>  I will address where we are with IBR briefly.  For each of the programmes Animal Health Ireland has, it works through or gets its scientific input from technical working groups that support the programmes.  The IBR technical working group has been working initially on developing resources that operate at individual farm level and is now moving forward to seek to put a programme or options for a programme in place at national level.  Within the EU there is legislation that puts certain constraints on the shape of our programme if we wish to have it approved by the Commission.  The implementation group undertook a study visit around 12 months ago to look at programmes which have approval in Belgium, as well as the Dutch programme, with a view to trying to identify the most cost-effective way that we can take that forward.  That work is coming close to completion at this stage and can then move to the next stage.  There is also ongoing work within Teagasc, looking at the disease cost to inform the other side of that cost-benefit discussion.  The goal over the next months is to bring the two elements of that together and to bring that forward for consultation using the same model as we followed with BVD at the start of that programme.  I will end my remarks there unless there any further or follow-up questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-07a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe O'Flaherty" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017020700002#E00600"><p>There are a number of questions on Johne's disease, and I offer my apologies that my colleague Lorna Citer, the programme manager, is not available to be with us here today.</p> <p>  There were questions on the programme which AHI, together with the stakeholders, is attempting to establish at the moment.  The pilot programme ran for three years and finished at the end of last year.  We learned a considerable amount from that programme in which between 1,200 and 1,300 farmers participated.  The challenge now is to take that to the next level.  As a nation that exports as heavily as Ireland does and is as heavily dependent on exports as is Ireland and particularly for a nation that has such skin in the game in terms of value added commodities or value added products like infant formula, it behoves us to be as ambitious as possible with our future Johne's disease control programme.</p> <p>  Having said that, there are certain constraints around Johne's disease and Deputy Cahill mentioned the test sensitivity there.  That is one constraint.  The tests that we are using in the programme in Ireland are the same tests used in programmes internationally.  Programmes internationally have demonstrated real progress in reducing the prevalence of JD.  While the tests are not by any means as sensitive as tests for BVD, for example, they are a sufficient tool.  For JD, one has to think of the test as a support for management.  The key intervention for JD is the management on the farm relating to the treatment of the young calf and the interaction between the dam and the calf.  Testing is an adjunct to good management.  The BVD scheme on one side is a programme based on a really high class, very sensitive, specific test which allows one to identify animals and remove them from the herd.  Handling Johne's disease is much more about good management, with testing being an adjunct to good management.  In that context, the test has been shown internationally to be sufficient to make progress.  The other significant constraint on Johne's disease is that fortunately we have quite a low prevalence relative to other countries internationally and that is a good thing.</p><p>On the other hand, that low prevalence translates into a very weak economic driver for the farmer to control the disease because if there is one positive result out of a 100-cow herd, the economic impact of that is quite limited.  There is not a strong economic driver at the farmer's level to control this disease in the same way as there is for BVD.  There is a challenge in respect of the test and the economic drivers.</p><p> We have a draft business plan with our stakeholders which we intend to present to them at a meeting next week, and the way we have sought to take this forward in it is to take our lead from some of the progress that has been made internationally regarding JD and expand the scope beyond the disease.  Questions were asked about salmonella control.  We know that the measures put in place on a farm to control JD will also contribute to controlling a disease like salmonellosis.  There are synergies to be built from the JD programme with disease control in the context of other issues, between JD control and farm biosecurity and between JD control and reducing antimicrobial usage on farms.  The view that has been taken, which is largely supported by stakeholders, is that by broadening out this programme, we can make it more sustainable, more attractive to farmers and more financially viable, particularly if we can continue to attract in some support from both the State and private sector stakeholders.  The business plan in front of stakeholders at present proposes that there would be support for farmers from both the Department and the private sector to encourage them to stay actively involved in the JD programme.</p><p> Senator Lombard asked some questions on timescales for eradication and so on.  We need to be thinking of Johne's disease in the context of control rather than eradication.  To my knowledge, Sweden is the only country in which JD is absent.  In countries where JD has been established or has become endemic, the disease has remained.  It has not been possible to eradicate but it can be substantially controlled.  Our objective in Ireland would be substantially control Johne's disease.  We can do that by getting participation in the programme up to the highest possible levels.  In terms of the current year, the level of ambition needs to be moderated.  We will seek to grow participation in the pilot programme but for 2017, assuming that we can get agreement from stakeholders.  However, we would not be expecting, for example, to double the level of participation in the first year.  That would certainly be our ambition for 2017 and to go beyond that in subsequent years.</p><p> On the Senator's question regarding the interaction with Northern Ireland, we are very fortunate to have very close and warm relations with Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland.  My colleague, Dr. Graham, contributes their BVD eradication programme and their chief executive officer, Dr. Sam Strain, has contributed significantly to our Johne's disease control programme.  While I take the Deputy's point with regard to Northern Ireland lagging behind the Republic of Ireland in respect of BVD somewhat, we are at least in a position where the technical design of the two programmes is practically identical.  In the context of the BVD programme, we are looking at a technical design that is identical.  There is very good cross-pollination from one jurisdiction into the other.  On those grounds, I think we can be reasonable optimistic that we will develop an all-island approach to JD.  In the context of BVD, the objective is all-island eradication.  As Dr. Graham has said, our modelling work shows us that 2020 continues to be the point by which we can achieve eradication.</p><p> Finally, returning to Deputy Cahill's reference to the three years of tag testing, it certainly is the case that the programme was initially promoted as involving three years of tag testing followed by three years of surveillance, which was intended to be blood-based surveillance and, for dairy herds, milk-based surveillance.  Due to a change in the facts on the ground and the level of prevalence of the disease not reducing as quickly as had been anticipated, largely due to retention of persistently infected animals, the modelling work and the work of the technical working group indicated that it would have been imprudent to move away from tag testing in the time frame that we had originally indicated.</p><p> On the point of legislation to oblige the removal of infected animals, there is certainly a lesson to take forward into other programmes but we should bear in mind that, constitutionally, the obliged removal of an infected animal from a herd would trigger compensation by the State.  At the time of our early discussions with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the drawing up of legislation, there was not an appetite to go down the route of compulsory compensation as would be typical in the TB or brucellosis eradication programmes.</p><p> I will conclude my remarks.  I think our chairman would like to comment on the point of vaccinations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-07a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Magan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017020700002#F00200"><p>I was gratified by the comments from the members in supporting where we have got to and equally being frustrated with the lack of complete progress on BVD.  As Mr. O'Flaherty has explained, there are reasons for this.  Naively, we expected farmers to do the right thing and get rid of a persistently infected animal but human nature is strange and complex and people do things for a variety of reasons.  I have no doubt that we will complete the job.  On the point of vaccinations, farmers spend a lot of money on vaccinations every year and we would like to think that success in a programme like BVD will ultimately mean that vaccination against it will not be necessary and will be one of those that we will be able to drop.</p> <p>  On the general point of vaccinations, and one of the members referred to salmonella, co-ordination around vaccinations is a prudent thing for which to aim ultimately.  Over time, it would be good if we could get national coordination on what is happening on vaccinations, who is vaccinating and when.  IBR will, for example, more than likely be the subject of a vaccination programme.  This IBR programme, as already pointed out, will be crucial to the success of Ireland's continued export of, for example, quality weanlings from the west of Ireland and Dairygold calves from the south of Ireland.  These are areas where we just cannot leave ourselves disadvantaged.  Vaccinations are crucial at one level but equally, if we are successful in some areas, we can hopefully drop off some of them and yet use them sensible as a tool for eradication in other cases.  It needs to be coordinated and we would like to look to a committee such as this for support in and around some of those programmes in the future, because we have enormous challenges ahead in herd health and when we work together we can do so much more.  A committee such as this, with the power that it has, would be very helpful to us and we would love to talk further, perhaps with the chairman, as to how we could harness that collective power.</p></speech>

We share the general view that there are a lot of unknowns out there and that we are still in a fairly fluid situation.  One potential cause of concern would be a divergence of the regulatory standards on the two sides of the Border.  As we with diseases that initially were non-regulated, though BVD now is a regulated disease, we operate somewhat outside of the regulatory framework, but it is still important and it still guides us.  In terms of mitigating that risk, Animal Health Ireland will certainly continue to work very closely with our colleagues  in Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland.  I was interested to hear a comment from one of the earlier contributors regarding to all-island bodies that might address these issues on an all-island basis.</p><p>One could not discount such a development in the future and it would certainly have merit in terms of maximising resource use.  It is a conversation that has not progressed to date, however.  We are very conscious of the risks posed by Brexit, particularly in respect of the issue of divergence of standards.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-07a.29" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cecil Beamish" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017020700002#G00600"><p>I thank the members of the committee for the invitation to meet with them today to discuss the management of aquaculture licensing.  This opening statement is intended to provide committee members with a broad overview of the aquaculture licensing system and how it operates.  I will be glad to take any questions from the committee members afterwards.</p> <p>  An aquaculture licence is required by law for the cultivation of finfish, shellfish and certain marine plants such as seaweed.  Some aquaculture takes place on land but the vast majority of aquaculture activity takes place in the marine environment on the foreshore.  In Ireland, almost all foreshore is in public ownership and aquaculture activity therefore requires both an aquaculture licence to conduct operations and a companion foreshore licence to lawfully occupy the area of foreshore in question.  Even in the rare case of private foreshores, an aquaculture licence is required to engage in aquaculture activity.  In effect, aquaculture and foreshore licences are a package.  The foreshore effectively grants property rights to state land and the aquaculture licence determines what one can do on the land.</p> <p>  The foreshore is measured from the high water mark out to 12 nautical miles and is approximately 39,000 square km in overall size.  It is roughly equal in size to just over 50% of the land area of the State.  However, the areas suitable for aquaculture represent a small fraction of the foreshore and, in the case of finfish cultivation, are exclusively on the western seaboard.</p> <p>  The Department considers all applications for aquaculture licences in accordance with the following legislation: the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997; the Foreshore Act 1933; the EU habitats directive 92/43/EEC; the EU birds directive 79/409/EEC; the consolidated environmental impact assessment directives 2011/92/EU; and the public participation directive, the Aarhus Convention.  The licensing process involves consultation with a wide range of scientific and technical advisers as well as various statutory consultees.  The legislation also provides for a period of public consultation.  In addition to the above legislation the Department must adhere to a wide range of regulatory requirements and other legislation which impact on the licensing process.</p> <p>  The public participation directive has emerged as a crucial factor in the roll-out of the licensing system as it applies to individual cases.  The key aim of this directive is to grant the general public specific rights regarding access to information in governmental decision-making processes on matters concerning the local, national and transboundary environment.</p> <p>  There are three broad types of aquaculture licence applications: applications for finfish or shellfish cultivation in the marine environment, which are approximately 94% of applications; applications for land-based aquaculture activity, making up approximately 5% of applications; and applications for aquatic plant cultivation, mainly seaweed, which is approximately 1% of applications.  It is important to note that the harvesting of wild seaweed is licensed by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  Within this typology there are a number of subsections including applications for the cultivation of multiple species in the one production area, known as multitrophic aquaculture.  A small number of licences for research purposes are in place.</p> <p>  A key component of the aquaculture licensing process is a series of measures designed to address the impact of aquaculture on the environment.  This series of measures is known as the appropriate assessment process.  The appropriate assessment process arose from a European Court of Justice case against Ireland in 2007.  The ECJ declared, in case C418/04, that by failing to take all the measures necessary to comply with Article 6.3 of the habitats directive in respect of authorisation of aquaculture programmes, Ireland had failed to fulfil its obligations under that directive.  The EU habitats and birds directives led to the designation of certain bays by the National Parks and Wildlife Service as special areas of conservation and-or special protection areas for birds.  These are known as NATURA 2000 sites and most aquaculture takes place within them or adjacent to them.</p> <p>  In the negotiations from 1997 onwards to address the ECJ judgment the Department agreed a process with the EU Commission and NPWS which would govern the State's processing of aquaculture licence applications.  This became known as appropriate assessment and includes various steps.  One is data collection in relevant bays, which can be quite comprehensive and involves the collection of data on benthos, the sea bed, the bathymetry of the bay, the substrates on the sea bed, the fauna and communities living in the bays, migratory animals coming to the bays and the birdlife around the intertidal areas of the bays.</p><p>There is then detailed analysis of the raw data when it is collected.  In some cases, multi-year data is needed.  The setting of conservation objectives by the National Parks and Wildlife Service has to be done in respect of each of the sites.  Following that, the appropriate assessments are carried out to assess the aquaculture sought or being undertaken in that bay against the conservation objectives.  That is done by the Marine Institute.  The final situation is the determination of licences based on the outcome of the appropriate assessment process.</p><p> In broad descriptive terms, it is possible to say the appropriate assessment phase of the application process represents the first major environmental challenge or hurdle for any licence application.  The AA process is therefore an essential precursor to the further consideration of most aquaculture licence applications.  The AA process is managed in the main by the Marine Institute via environmental-scientific contractors commissioned by the institute to carry out the necessary field work and desk analysis.  To date, the Marine Institute has submitted appropriate assessments to my Department in respect of 21 bays.  I have provided a list of those, which I do not propose to read out, in my opening statement.</p><p> Following completion of the appropriate assessment for a given bay, the licensing consideration process has been estimated to take between 43 and 81 weeks in the case of shellfish aquaculture.  It should be noted that the indicative timelines do not relate to finfish licence applications in respect of which a separate environmental impact statement is mandatory under European law and can require a lengthy timeline for completion by the operator.  My opening statement sets out the various steps to be gone through in the processing of shellfish licence applications.  The steps are in the statement for viewing by the committee.  </p><p> Some of the key figures that may be of interest to members of the committee are set out in my opening statement.  We had the court judgment in 2007.  We also had legislation in 2007 which allowed people engaging in aquaculture at that time, whose licence was running out due to the effluxion of time and who were seeking a renewal, to continue their aquaculture licensing activity pending a determination on that renewal.  People were able to continue their aquaculture licence activity through this period.  Between 2007 and 2011-2012, the process of working out how to cope with the judgment was put together.  This included working out how to gather the data that was required across the bays, which, in some cases, was multi-year data if it involved bird life or migratory animals; analysing that data; having the National Parks and Wildlife Service draw up the conservation objectives for that bay; and carrying out the appropriate assessment.  All of that process was put together in the 2007 to 2011 period.  After that, we began to get to the point where we could begin to start the licensing process.  The figures for the number of licensing determinations made since 2012 when that process kicked off are set out here.  There were 492 licence determinations made, that is 492 aquaculture operations licensed since 2012.  In terms of applications currently on hand, we have a mix of continuing renewals in some of the bays that have not yet been appropriately assessed or where licence determinations have not been made and new applications coming in.  That figure is there.  There are 612 licence applications currently on hand.  It is important to note that in those applications on hand which relate to renewals that have occurred simply because of the passage of time, the operators are allowed to continue their operations pending a determination on those applications.  </p><p> On 20 December 2016, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, appointed a three-person independent review group to conduct an independent review of the aquaculture licensing process and the associated legal framework.  The Minister set out the terms of reference for the review having regard to existing Government policy for the sustainable development of aquaculture as outlined in the Food Wise 2025 report and the national strategic plan for sustainable aquaculture development.  The review group will aim to identify changes required to the aquaculture licensing process and its associated legal framework that will deliver licence determinations in a timely manner, having regard to international best practice; support achievement of the actions and priorities in Food Wise 2025 and the national strategic plan for sustainable aquaculture development; facilitate enhanced transparency in the licensing process for all stakeholders; and ensure legally robust licence determinations having regard to EU and national law.  The independent review group is currently holding a public consultation to invite submissions on matters relevant to the review, which will run until 10 February.</p><p> I hope this statement is of some assistance to members and I will be happy to respond to any questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-07a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1400" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017020700002#H00300"><p>I thank Dr. Beamish for coming before us today.  I have a number of questions.  On the independent review, it is my understanding there has been a number of reviews carried out in the past into the licensing system.  Will Dr. Beamish outline what the recommendations were from those reviews?  I assume he has some of those recommendations to hand.  Were they implemented?  My understanding is they were not implemented.  The public cannot have confidence in reviews unless an organisation has a history of implementing reviews.  Will Dr. Beamish outline the reviews he is aware of in the past number of years?  If Dr. Beamish bears with me a second, I will locate the specific name of the review I am referring to.  I understand there has been number of reviews.  The Cawley report was carried out in 2006.  What were the recommendations that Dr. Beamish recalls?  Were they implemented and, if not, why not?</p><p>I recommend that the committee sends a copy of the transcript of this meeting to the independent review to feed into its process because we are ahead of the deadline.</p><p>We had a situation in Donegal where there was an application for an oyster farm in the Inishowen peninsula.  The oyster farm in question got planning permission in the Linsfort beach area of Inishowen.  It got planning permission and virtually nobody in the local community had any knowledge of the application.  The reason for this was the company in question, which had applied for this licence, was advised by Department officials to put the advertisement in the <i>Donegal Democrat </i>newspaper.  Anyone present who knows the geography of Donegal will know the Inishowen peninsula is quite distinct from the rest of the county and very few people in the Inishowen peninsula read the <i>Donegal Democrat</i>, perhaps those from the south of the county who have come to live in Inishowen.  There are three newspapers that cater for the Inishowen peninsula and not one of those was requested by the Department to run the advertisement.  The advertisement that was published in the <i>Donegal Democrat</i>did not specify the location.  It said it was on the shores of Lough Swilly.  That could have been anywhere on either side of Lough Swilly.  It could have been anywhere from Fanad Head down to Ramelton, Rathmullen, right round to Clonmany at the very top of Inishowen.  It could have been anywhere.  It was Dr. Beamish's Department's instruction to put it into a newspaper that would not have been read by the local people who may have been interested and did not give specific information about the location.  Even though that was the case, when people found out about this in the area and had objections and concerns, they were rejected.  There was no acknowledgement of wrongdoing or a failure to ensure appropriate consultation.  The Department just said no, that it would not open it up again and that was the end of the story.  That is totally wrong.  Whatever view the Department may have on oyster farms or aquaculture licensing, it has to ensure a fair process.  That did not happen in this case.  People are very angry about that in the area.  </p><p>There is another aspect.</p><p>The company which applied for the oyster farm did no wrong.  It was a legitimate business which had every right to apply.  It took a hell of a lot of abuse up there because it was seen that it had done things by stealth.  However, when I investigated the matter, the company advised me that everything it had done had been on instruction from the Department.  I need an explanation as to how it happened.</p><p> There are people who have concerns and are not happy with the process and how it is carried out, but at the other end of the spectrum the people in the industry are not happy.  Departmental officials talk about Food Harvest 2020, aquaculture and its role in creating jobs, and the Department has had companies out to markets across the world.  However, the Department is not making decisions in an acceptable timeframe and is not accountable for the timeframes in place.  The Government is bringing companies out to these countries in Asia to make those new business deals and create jobs in Ireland.  How can a company do that if it does not know what licence it will have and where it will operate from one year to the next?  It cannot plan.  Why is there not a timeframe in place?  Whatever decision the Department makes, to grant a licence or take on board the views of objectors and refuse a licence, which is the Department's business, can it not do so in a reasonable timeframe?</p><p> The Department is failing the industry.  The industry is not happy with the Department at all.  It is not happy with the licensing process and how long it takes.  On the one hand, communities are not happy with how they are consulted with and the process and the fact they are not being listened to.  On the other hand, the industry is not happy with the Department and feels it is failing them.  They feel the Department is regulating rather than facilitating job creation and the development of the industry.  On all levels, the Department is getting it wrong.  That is why the review is welcome.  Will the Department implement the recommendations in the review?  It has not done so in the past.</p></speech>

We should try to be factual.  I am not aware of any reviews of the licensing process during the period in which it all changed, which was after the European Court of Justice judgment in 2007.  I am fully aware of the Cawley report, which was not a review of the aquaculture licensing process but on how to develop the seafood sector.  It made a range of recommendations on issues in 2006 under Noel Cawley's chairmanship, and many of them have been implemented.  It was a development report on how to develop the seafood industry and how to drive value.</p> <p>  Food Harvest 2020, Food Wise 2025 and the National Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development have all been taken forward since then, but they are all development reports.  They are routes to development.  Licensing is important in the context of development.  However, after the Cawley report we got the ECJ judgment and the new legislation.  Things changed after the Cawley report.  The Cawley report was not a report into aquaculture and licensing but into the development of the seafood sector.</p></speech>

They include Food Wise 2025, which was produced 18 months to two years ago.  The relevant recommendation was to carry out the review on licensing, which is on the way.  There was the National Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development, which was produced just over a year ago.  It also had a recommendation on the review of licensing, which is under way.  There are no other reviews that I am aware of.  They were not specifically reports on the licensing process, which they did not go into.  They were about the development of the sector.  There are no reviews in the time period which we have not implemented.</p> <p>  It would be useful for the Deputy to try to understand the process.  Then he could understand the timeframes.  After 2007, there was no possibility to license aquaculture in a manner compliant with the judgment and the EU directives.  The reason was that the infrastructure did not exist to do it.  We did not have the scientific data on the bays that had just been designated, the conservation objectives that were to be protected in the bays or the ability to do the appropriate assessment.  All the infrastructure had to be built.  The licences in question were given during the ten years that followed the 1997 Act, mostly between 1998 and 2000.  The industry got licences for ten years.  In 2007, 2008 and 2009, we had an ECJ judgment and it happened that those licences were falling for renewal during that crucial period.  There was no ability to make a decision.</p> <p>  The Commission has not progressed in taking daily fines or requiring the aquaculture to be taken out of the water on the basis that the future licensing will be done in compliance with the habitats and birds directive.  The national guarantee existed from the 1997 legislation to allow the operators to continue operating.  People have not been stopped from operating.  They were there and they continue to operate.  What was required was that any decision that was made on a renewal of a licence would be done in a manner compliant with the requirements under European legislation.</p> <p>  There were discussions with the Commission in 2008 and with the NPWS and others who had roles in it as to how we could reach a position in which we had the machinery to consider licensing.  In the meantime, everybody who had been operating could continue to operate.  The only way forward was if the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine took on the full role of collecting all the data in the Natura 2000 sites, and that is what the Department did.  The data are as valid for anybody else who wants to license something else in a Natura 2000 site as they are for aquaculture.  They are a national asset for anybody else who wants to do licensing in those areas.  They can use the data.  The data detail what is in the areas, what is to be conserved, where it is to be conserved, etc.</p> <p>  The Department started what is probably the biggest data collection in the marine environment that has happened anywhere right across all the relevant bays.  In some cases where we were dealing with protection areas for migrating birds that may arrive for only two to four weeks in the year, we had to build up a time series of data.  We could not make a judgment on whether putting oyster trellises in a certain area would affect a particular species of bird.  There was no way of speeding up the process.  To be compliant, we had to collect the data.  The data had to be built up over a period.  Only when we had an adequate amount of data could we get the conservation objectives specified by the NPWS.  Then we could do the appropriate assessment.  This understanding must be taken on board.</p></speech>

In the meantime, renewal applications rested and could not go anywhere.  For four years, they just built up.  Given that they had all been licensed during the period 1998 to 2000, and they were all ten-year licences, they all dropped into it, as it were.  However, they could all still operate.  This is the crucial point.  Nobody was stopped from operating and we kept the industry going through that combination.</p> <p>  The appropriate assessments started and the determinations could start to be made.  The members have the figures in front of them as to what happened in the years as we, one by one, worked through the bays.  There are 22 bays done in terms of appropriate assessment and there are 35 bays to be assessed in total.</p><p>That is where we are in terms of the first stage of the process.</p><p> We have outlined in our opening statement the steps to get from the point where the appropriate assessment is completed to determinations.  There are 23 steps for a shellfish case.  In the meantime, other legislation has been added to the obligations such as public participation, the Aarhus Convention and environmental legislation.  Other legislation elsewhere comes up when we conduct a statutory consultation, as we are required under the legislation, with a range of other players.  For example, the people who work in the natural heritage sector say we have obligations to underwater archaeology.  When one wants to put oysters somewhere or if there are oysters in the area and one is considering renewing them, we will be asked to conduct an underwater archaeology survey to see if there is something archaeologically important underneath.  We must do many different things for various parts of the State as a result of this process, all of which take time.  The steps have been set out.  We have been very transparent about what is involved.</p><p> The independent review group is now considering the process of getting to the point where one has an appropriate assessment and one can begin the licensing process.  This work has taken up the bulk of the time but the process is two thirds complete.  The group is considering the process from that point to the point of determinations and deciding what can be done.</p><p> Aquaculture all over the EU has either been static or declining.  The European Commission has conducted a report on the matter.  Aquaculture outside of the EU is advancing pretty rapidly.  Ireland would like its aquaculture to advance.  We are building a completely new licensing framework and structure that will stand the test of time once completed.  Once we get through this batch of licences, people will have ten-year licences or longer.  We will not have to go through the same procedure again.  </p><p> Senator Mac Lochlainn has stated the Department is not accountable in respect of the timeframe set in place.  No timeframe has been set in place and the reasons are as follows.  If one stops in the middle and one needs an environmental impact statement, EIS, then the operator must get one.  Various points are raised by statutory consultees.  One arm of the State is in the process of handing over State land to one user for ten years or something similar and they have property rights.  It is only right when doing so that other users have an input and a say in the process.  The Senator will know from the debates on aquaculture licence applications that different users have different sets of interests and all must be accommodated. </p><p> In terms of timetables, we certainly are not the fastest.  We work under a judgment laid down by the European Court of Justice while others do not.  Sooner or later they may end up working under one of those judgments.  We want to keep the industry in place, keep it going and make it fully compliant.  We must work under the arrangements with which the Commission is comfortable while a negative judgment is in place.  We must work in the context of a negative judgment.</p><p> Does the Senator want me to talk about the oyster farm at Linsfort?   </p></speech>

The Department has adhered to everything that was required by the legislation under which we must work.  All of the statutory requirements were adhered to in that case.  I will not go into all of the details on an individual basis because we have hundreds of cases.  The legislation requires that we advertise in a newspaper that is circulated in the area.  The requirement is as vague and as general as that.  We do not necessarily know which newspaper does best in a particular sub-part of a county.  In this case we advertised in the <i>Donegal Democrat</i>.  There is also a statutory consultation process that went through in full.  As the local authority is part of that statutory process, as are all of the other statutory consultees, one cannot say that the local authority was blind about this process.  The Department fully adhered to all of the legislative requirements.<br/><br/>There is a possibility to appeal the decisions made and lodge an appeal with the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board, which is completely independent of the Department.  If people, for some reason or other, did not participate in the licensing process, which mostly we have been told has too much consultation and takes too long, they then have the possibility, once a decision is made, to go to the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board.  Nothing has been lost.  People can have a second bite at the cherry, if they so wish.  </p></speech>

The advertisement was published in a newspaper read by very few people who live on the Inishowen Peninsula.  Indeed, the local authority in the county and in other countries stipulates which newspapers can carry advertisements for planning permissions.  Donegal is a large county and there is a great distance between Killybegs, where Deputy Pringle is from, and the top of the Inishowen Peninsula where I am from.  There are 15 or 16 newspapers that cover the county of Donegal.  A bit of basic research would have led people to realise that the <i>Donegal Democrat</i>was entirely the wrong newspaper to carry the advertisement.  The advertisement did not specify the location.  Legislation stipulates that the location must be stipulated.  Only the shores of Lough Swilly was mentioned but the location of the oyster farm was not specified.</p><p>Dr. Beamish has told me that people have a right to lodge an appeal.  How can people exercise their right of appeal in 28 days if they did not see the advertisement in the first place?  </p></speech>

There are a number of perspectives involved.  The Department's perspective is determined by the legislation.  We do not enact the legislation but we are obliged in law to implement it.  It is not open to us to depart from it as it would be a breach of the law and would amount to maladministration.<br/><br/>The case was on my desk for a long time last year so while I am reasonably familiar with it, I am recalling it from memory.  Therefore, if I make a mistake in my statement I shall correct it quickly afterwards.<br/><br/>The question of the newspaper became a topical issue.  The legislation stipulates a newspaper circulating in the area.  The <i>Donegal Democrat</i>, as a matter of fact, does circulate in the area and we checked that it can be purchased.  It is general for us to use that particular newspaper in Donegal, as it is with other local newspapers in other regions.  At the time we received some comments that we should have used a number of other newspapers, one of which was published outside of the jurisdiction.  There is a question here of what is practical and reasonable.<br/><br/>I should also point out, as Dr. Beamish has, that the statutory consultees, including the local authority, were consulted in this case in the normal way.  Also, the Minister's decision, when it was taken, was published in the normal way.  Again, the opportunity for going to the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board, ALAB,  is 28 days or one month.  I am open to correction about the time but it is about that length of time.  That, too, is set out in legislation.  <br/><br/>The Department cannot - I repeat cannot - depart from what is said in legislation because it is there to protect the public and the individual member of the public who has applied for an aquaculture licence.  If the Department had departed from the legislation it rightly would have been held to account either through ALAB or a judicial review of procedures.  I know that because of the interest that existed at the time, an enormous amount of examination of the Department's procedures took place.  They were not found to be at variance with the legislation.  I hope my explanation has been helpful.  </p></speech>

Dr. Beamish is telling me the legislation guides the Department whenever it is identifying the location of an aquaculture licence so that all it had to say in respect of the application in Linsfort outside Buncrana, County Donegal, for example, is &quot;The shores of Lough Swilly&quot;.  Does Dr. Beamish know how extensive the shores of Lough Swilly are?  Nevertheless, the Department does not have to specify where the licence relates to along those shores.  That is the legislation according to Dr. Beamish.  Dr. Beamish referred to a newspaper outside the jurisdiction, the <i>Derry Journal</i>.  He should check its circulation in Inishowen versus the circulation of the <i>Donegal Democrat</i>.  By the way, they were both owned by the same umbrella group.</p><p>I put it to Dr. Beamish that the Department did not ensure there was full consultation with the local community and made a mess of the situation up there.  I find the failure to acknowledge that here incredible.  There is no degree of regret or any sense that the Department failed the people up there.  Indeed, the Department failed the business because it left it in bad stead with the local community.</p></speech>

An assessment of newspaper circulation in the area should feed into any review process.  It is one thing to say a newspaper is available in an area but a separate issue is whether it is widely circulated.  Comparison wise, the <i>Donegal Democrat</i>might sell one copy in Buncrana whereas the <i>Inishowen Independent</i>or <i>Inishowen News</i>sell hundreds of copies.  That is just for the information of the committee.</p><p>In regard to the applications assessment programme, the fisheries division of the Department is responsible for the licensing of aquaculture as well as for the development and growth of aquaculture and fishing industries across the country.  Does the Department see any potential conflict of interest between the fisheries division processing aquaculture licence applications and its role as a development body or policy-setting body for aquaculture within the State?  At least two of the statutory consultees, BIM and the Marine Institute, are funded directly through the fisheries division as well.  Is there a potential conflict of interest there in terms of their freedom to express views on aquaculture licensing?</p><p>As with all other planning processes, environmental impact statements are required to be completed in this context by the operators.  I have yet to see an EIS which recommends that a development should not take place.  I have a very strong sense that he who pays the piper calls the tune.  If I commission somebody to do an EIS on my development, that EIS will come down favourably on my side.  Is there merit in the idea that the Department should fund environmental impact statements rather than the applicants and charge applicants for that in the application process?  It would be a far more robust system and more compliant with European law on aquaculture licensing.</p><p>Dr. Beamish said 25 bays had the appropriate assessments set for them and that 35 bays in total have to be done.  Is that 35 bays which already have aquaculture?  As I understand it, there are 90 Natura bays in the country all together which require appropriate assessments.  I could be wrong.  In regard to that process, there will be a need to update the data that has been gathered since 2008 and 2009 on the environmental measures within those Natura bays.  Is there a process to go back and update that data and will it be an ongoing process into the future?</p><p>A number of determinations were made very recently in regard to Braade Strand in Gweedore Bay, County Donegal.  Some nine licences covering over 100 acres of the bay have been determined.  In my view, there is a need for a management plan for the bay to set out all the criteria.  Does the Department simply accept continuously licence applications for a bay in a piecemeal fashion?  Would it not be appropriate to prepare a strategic management plan for the bay highlighting appropriate areas for licensing rather than having a free-for-all process where anybody can apply for a licence within a bay?  Is that not something that would figure in the management system as well?</p></speech>

The delegation might be reassured to hear that.  Looking at the document here before us, there were 492 determinations with 612 outstanding.  It is simple to calculate that if it has taken the Department four years to determine 492 applications, one is looking at five years to deal with the other 612 applicants unless there are big changes.  That is not even taking into consideration ongoing renewals.  Dr. Beamish said in regard to renewals that people can continue with production where there is a lapsed licence on foot of a delay in the Department.  As such, it is not putting people out of production.  What monitoring of their practices and the terms and conditions of the original licence takes place during that consideration?  I was thinking when Dr. Beamish said that about people being allowed to drive on the roads without licences if local authorities were not able to renew them because of red tape or other delays.  It is hard not to make that comparison.  What monitoring is done on those outfits which are operating without licences during that term?</p> <p>  In answer to Senator Mac Lochlainn, Dr. Beamish said aquaculture was static or declining across Europe.  Is that because of the inefficiencies in licensing?  If there was a faster, more efficient and appropriate licensing process, would the industry be thriving?</p></speech>

Many concerns have been expressed by anglers and their associations who are fearful of damage to wild salmon and other wild fish stocks.  Inland Fisheries Ireland has expressed concern too.  When one hears those concerns being rightly expressed, one wonders to what extent they are proven to be founded.  From what Dr. Beamish has said, however, it appears we are only in the process of establishing the environmental implications with appropriate assessments only having been carried out in 21 bays.  I would be interested to hear the number of bays that remain to be assessed.</p><p>Dr. Beamish highlighted 492 determinations.  What does that mean?  Were some of these refused?  How many were refused?  How many were granted licences?  Once the Department gets this information on the different bays, for example, the 12 bays, does the Department look retrospectively at some of these installations and fish farms to see what the environmental impact is and what steps towards mitigating an adverse environmental impact might be undertaken?  We must be environmentally responsible.<br/><br/>We heard a presentation recently from Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, and I have discussed the matter with it.  Aside from issues around sea lice, it sounds as though these salmon can have a devastating impact on wild salmon, including through interbreeding with them.  They do not seem to follow the pattern or course as wild salmon and, ultimately, do not end up reproducing in the same fashion.  It seems like we must take protective measures.  I know it is not Dr. Beamish's field but there seem to be other issues around high levels of mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins in farmed salmon and the fallout in areas with salmon cages.  Obviously, the Department is not considering the issue of human health.  Why, when it seems to be the best course of action scientifically to mitigate the impact of these fish farms, are people not being asked to put them onshore?  Steps must be taken to reassure the public, which has legitimate concerns about the environmental impact, that we are managing it as best we can.  Could Dr. Beamish identify how many applications have been refused?  What applications are refused on environmental grounds?  Are they basically all being refused on environmental grounds or, as has been raised here, because of the other procedural issue?  Are some applications being refused on procedural grounds?  <br/><br/>I agree with Deputy Pringle.  What we tend to do offshore seems to be very <i>ad hoc</i>, be it aquaculture or renewable energy.  Do we not need a more schematic approach in the same way as we have a development plan regarding granting planning permissions and national planning guidelines?  Seeing as we have so much territory offshore, we need a better plan than what is there currently so that we can all subscribe to the direction in which we are going and appropriate environmental protections are in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-07a.73" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cecil Beamish" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017020700002#M00200"><p>I will respond in reverse order.  Senator Mulherin raised the impact, or lack thereof, of salmon farms on wild salmon.  This issue has been subject to much discussion.  The primary area of concern over the years has been sea lice.  Sea lice, which are naturally occurring parasites in the marine environment that have been there for hundreds of millions of years, can build up on salmon farms as a host.  Therefore, there is a danger of cross-infection of wild stocks.  Alternatively, they may initially get the infection from wild stocks and it builds up.  Ireland has a system for monitoring the level of sea lice on every salmon farm.  There are 14 inspections every year on every salmon farm.  Those inspections are carried out by the State and the results are put on the web and are available for anybody to see.  There are trigger levels, which are at a low level by international standards.  If the number of sea lice on the animals on the farm is higher than those trigger levels, a formal notice to treat all the animals on the farm is issued to bring the level below the trigger levels.  This process is transparent and open.  Ireland is the only country I am aware of that has fully transparent system operated by the State.  In other countries, it is the operators who report.</p> <p>  Salmon is a food.  It is grown as a food and must be safe as a food and we are concerned about that so it goes through all of the regulatory procedures that food goes through to be safe.  Senator Mulherin mentioned some of the substances she thinks might be in farmed salmon.  I do not think farmed salmon producers would be very happy with that.  It is not the case.  Norway, which is not a country known for environmental despoliation, produces 1.2 million tonnes of farmed salmon and hopes to increase that to 2 million tonnes.  Scotland is growing about 160,000 tonnes of farmed salmon and Ireland has been producing about 12,000 tonnes.  A figure of 12,000 tonnes relative to the Norwegian figure is 1.2 million per year so we need to keep a perspective.  Almost all of Ireland's salmon farms have organic status and get a premium in the market by virtue of retaining their organic status so it is very important for them that quality is high.  On the basis of the scale at which we are producing relative to competitors, they survive on the basis of going for that organic niche.  They apply organic standards to that.  All the other residue testing is done as well in terms of food production from those farms.  We are still not producing enough to meet all the processing requirements and we still have processors importing salmon to smoke it and so forth so we are not even meeting that demand but salmon farm production is growing again.  We should be very careful in respect of our statements about the organic farmed salmon we produce here, which is of internationally high quality and gets premium product on the market.  </p> <p>  All finfish farms must carry out an environmental impact statement, EIS, before they can be licensed.  Any EIS that is produced goes through a full assessment by the statutory authorities as to whether it stacks up so it is not just a case that somebody produces an EIS and nobody looks at it.  It is assessed by the statutory authorities as part of the licensing process.  </p> <p>  Forcing all salmon farming to go on shore is premature.  There is a technology known as recirculating aquaculture systems that has been developed on a trial scale and involves the question of whether one would grow salmon on tanks ashore.  The vast bulk of salmon grown around the world is grown in open pens at sea.  Ireland has a high energy cost environment and relatively warm temperatures for salmon growing.  I do not think Ireland would be the easiest place to bring in a recirculation system.  If Ireland did that, it is almost certain that farms would lose their organic status and, therefore, their niche in the market.  That would make them particularly uncompetitive.  It is a matter for the applicant to decide-----</p></speech>

He uses the word "organic".  Is it not the case that these salmon are still in cages?  They are still in the same environment.  It is just that what they are being fed is not the same.  They get certified as organic on the same basis.</p></speech>

Stocking density requirements are lower.  There are a variety of other things they need to get to meet the organic certification.  It is not as simple as the food but the food is part of it.  In any event, it is the applicants who decide whether they can viably undertake an operation of a particular kind.  It is a commercial activity.  There are applications and operations in place for sea farming in Ireland as there are in Norway, Scotland, Canada and other competitor countries.  Salmon production here is small relative to the other countries we spoke about.  It may be the case that this technology may evolve and become better and that it will show advantage.  It is not there yet.  BIM and others are looking at that and keeping track of it to see whether it becomes a viable possibility but it is not a proven commercial alternative at this point.</p></speech>

It is not that IFI is operating in some completely separate sphere.  It is a contributor to the licensing process and it makes its views known and they are considered in the context of those decisions.</p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly asked about 492 determinations made since the beginning of putting in place the new structure for licensing.  The Senator quite reasonably asks how long will it take to get the other 600.  The target number we are working to go through this year, if everything comes right, is 235.  There is a speeding up of the process.  The appropriate assessments etc., are beginning to come through.  That is what we are working to go through this year.  Hopefully, in two to two and a half years, everybody who had ten-year licences which have come up for renewal will have gone through it.  It is not likely to continue like that.  Once the industry has gone through a licensing round, it will be ten years before the first of those return for a licensing decision.  In the meantime, there will be some new applications coming in and those will have to be dealt with in the intervening period.</p> <p>  Senator Daly asked whether aquaculture is static or declining and whether licensing is a determinant of that factor.  Licensing is one issue but, as I said, everybody who had a licence is able to continue operating.  They have not been stopped from doing the operations that they had been doing prior to the expiry date on the licence.  It is like a kind of extension to the licence.  They are still subject to the same terms and conditions under which they operated the licence during that continuing period and they are not totally free to do anything.  They operate under the same terms and conditions.  If they break those terms and conditions, they could fall into a different status and the guarantee is effectively not there.  There is ongoing monitoring of aquaculture operations, whether they are in the period originally stated on the licence or in the continuing period.</p> <p>  Deputy Pringle talked about a fisheries division and a conflict of interest.  There is no fisheries division.  There is a marine side of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which contains five different divisions that do distinct things.  There is one division, which is under Mr. John Quinlan's leadership, which does aquaculture and foreshore management.  The division engages in licensing on the aquaculture and the foreshore.  They do not have any developmental role other than the aquaculture and foreshore management role.  The main developmental role rests with Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM.  It is the development agency.  It is a statutorily independent agency.  The scientific adviser, the Marine Institute, is statutorily independent and gives advice on that basis.  In the same way that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine generally has a developmental policy and a regulatory role, one can say that about a lot of different Departments.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine hosts both of those.  It does so, on behalf of BIM, in the same way.  The reality is that there can be no development without good regulation.  These both are intertwined.  This is the production of food from clean seas.  If the seas are not clean, the food is not clean.  If the food is not of a quality, it does not make the markets.  It does not survive.  The regulatory and the developmental are not two separate arms.  In this area of food production, they are heavily interlinked and we do not see them as two completely separate issues.</p> <p>  I addressed earlier the issue of the EIS and who carries out the EIS in the context of Senator Mulherin's comments.  The EIS is done but the EIS is subject to assessment then by the statutory consultees, such as the Marine Institute and others.</p> <p>  As for the facts on the bays, there are 21 bays where the appropriate assessment has been done.  There are 35 of the Natura 2000 bays where aquaculture is an issue.  A larger number - it is a matter for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, to give the committee the exact number - are Natura 2000 but do not have any aquaculture in them and, therefore, do not come into play in this.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised, and put down parliamentary questions on, the issue of updating of the data.  Most of this data have only been captured in the past couple of years.  With a lot of the data - the mapping of the bays, the bathymetry of the bays, the sub-straits that are in those bays on the seabed on which things grow and the communities that are growing on those bays - often one is talking about whether one allows one type of activity to happen on top of something, for example, eelgrass or a reef area.  That world will not change with time - not in the human time that we are dealing with.  Once we have mapped that, and mapped all the communities producing very detailed maps, we have effectively done a form of planning because we have found out where the areas one is trying to conserve are within the bay, what areas are suitable for aquaculture and what areas are not from an environmental perspective.  A lot of this does not need to be updated.  Others will need to be updated but that will be done on a rolling basis going forward.  The issue now is to get all of the bays to that initial level of appropriate assessment where one has all of the data on the seabed, the communities and everything else and where one has identified all the conservation objectives.  One will then know what it is we are conserving in those 35 bays and then one will make judgments with all the technical and scientific advice on which areas of those bays would be suitable for what.  That is a form of planning.  It is a different form of planning because it is scientifically driven but it is a valid form of determining the suitable areas.</p> <p>  On the wider issue of marine spatial planning, of course, the sea area that Ireland controls is ten times the land area.  It is an enormous area.  It is much bigger than the foreshore.  There is a discussion ongoing in the Government - not in our Department but in another Department - on whether to bring forward marine spatial planning legislation.  Such legislation would seek to set out in a more directed way how that whole marine estate might be planned and plan-led.  It is, of course, much more complex than terrestrial planning.  Everybody is used to and knows land use planning which is a two-dimensional exercise.  This is a three-dimensional exercise.  One has 200 m of water column, what is on the seabed, what is under the seabed, what is in the water column and who uses the surface of the water.  These are all different uses and there is a variety of consenting and international legal authorities that govern that.  For example, the Common Fisheries Policy determines what is done with the living marine resources that are in the water column or on the seabed and it determines, through a range of other processes, how they will be managed, which areas will be protected, etc.  That is an international process.  There is a range of international operators.  Ireland is not the biggest player in terms of the impact on those, as Deputy Pringle, from Killybegs, will be aware.  Similarly, there are rules about what is done underneath the seabed in terms of extraction of resources, exploration etc. for which there is an entirely different governing framework.  There are rules about traffic and transport, who can move across different sea areas and everything back to the by-laws that the local authority will have on the near shore.  It is not as straightforward as terrestrial planning and that is why it has taken longer.  However, there is an ambition to try to move to a greater degree of marine spatial planning, not only for aquaculture but generally.  It will happen over time.</p> <p>  In the meantime, in the Natura 2000 areas where most of the aquaculture is happening, there is a much more detailed framework happening now as to what can be done where without damaging a particular area or interest.  We should have brought along some of these maps to show the committee.</p><p>The maps show in great detail what is in the various places within the bay, what area must be avoided or have a buffer zone placed around it, what area is safe for bottom mussel farming, oyster or whatever, and that drives the licensing process.</p></speech>

Will the licensing continue until the area available for licensing is filled up?  When examining an application, what consideration is given to the residential amenity of the people living on the bay and who use the bay for recreational purposes other than that it does not physically obscure them walking on the beach?  Is that a factor in the determination or do the appropriate assessments deal mainly with the flora and fauna, the coral structures and so forth in the bay?</p></speech>

The appropriate assessment is about the natural environment, so it is driven by flora and fauna, migrating animals and so forth.  The licensing process takes account of the wider set of operations such as navigation, safety, safety on the beach, lighting, existing users, fishing, leisure and so forth.  The consultation process is intended to bring up and include all of the wider concerns people have.  In the case of one licence, there were 1,700 objections or submissions.  They bring up all of the wider areas that must be considered.  It is like another planning process where the views, walking rights and all of the other user conflicts can be put on the table and considered.</p></speech>

That could cover all sorts of things, such as exploration for minerals, dredging, dumping at sea, fishing and so forth.  Any of the activities that can impact in any way would be covered within a marine spatial planning approach.  It would be likely that any such approach would have to take on board the other legislative processes in place.  For example, what is being done in the Natura 2000 sites is going to be the infrastructure on which one decides on the natural environmental impacts in a given area and how one might zone that area for an activity.  However, we are not there yet.  We do not have the primary legislation yet and we have not built the plan.  That is being examined by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government at present.</p></speech>

However, I wish to give the context for it.  As the process is so long and thorough, many of the issues are screened out along the way.  If they get to the point where a determination is put to the Minister, many of the problem issues have been resolved at that stage.  They are predominantly, although not always, favourable determinations, but they are not how they started.  Today's meeting is a precursor to the committee's meeting with the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board.  The members will find from the board that the Minister's determinations can be varied, rejected or accepted.  There will be examples of all of that in the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board report.  That is a second round determination of the issue.</p></speech>

Somebody could apply to licence all of this room, for example, but they might only get a licence for this part of the room because there are many things in the other part of the room that have to be protected or are not appropriate.  The determination is not exactly the same as the application.</p></speech>

The process is so lengthy that the application can change slightly through the process.  It can be reduced, but it will not be expanded.  Under the legislation it can be reduced.  As a result of the statutory consultation process or the public consultation process. mitigation measures could be put in which would substantially change the nature of an application.  For that reason, there would be very few refusals by the time they reach that stage.  It could be on environmental grounds but there can be other important reasons for refusing.  They can include navigation issues in the area in question or other public policy areas such as outstanding fees in a renewal application or company law issues relating to the establishment of the legal entity that is applying.  There can be multiple reasons beyond the environmental concerns.  The licensing process is hugely driven by environmental concerns because of the protection of the foreshore, but many other serious public interest concerns are comprehended by the licensing process.  It is correct that the refusal could be due to environmental concerns but, in practice, it could be for some other reason as well, such as fees, navigation issues, sites being outside licensed areas and a multiple of business related issues where the Department would seek to make a negative recommendation to the Minister.  In practice, as we approach a negative recommendation, an applicant will largely comply with what the Department wishes so it is ironed out strictly in accordance with the legislation and we are in a position to make a positive recommendation, but perhaps not for everything the applicant wants.</p></speech>

The Minister would not seek to extend anything.  It would be reducing a footprint, tonnage or something of that nature and there is no requirement in that case.  For example, anybody who is going to object to X number of hectares is unlikely to object to something smaller.  Certainly, if there a material change that would make the application bigger in some way, that would be the subject of a new application process which would definitely have to go to public consultation.</p></speech>

That is certainly not the intention.  The opening statement contains a reference to the licences that have been determined through each of the years from 2012 to 2016.  They will fall due chronologically within the ten years so it does not mean they will all fall due within the one year, plus we will not be back in the same situation in which we found ourselves in 2007, with a negative European court judgment and having to build the entire infrastructure from scratch, as was required.  The system is in place.  The licences will roll in on that basis, plus whatever new licences come in at that time.  It should not happen that we will face a full backlog, as was the case in 2011.  Everything had built up so that by 2011 and 2012 the entire industry, which in effect, was in Natura areas needed to be licensed and that is what we have been working through.</p></speech>

The existing section states &quot;The tariffs for each postal service or part of a postal service provided by a universal postal service provider in the provision of a universal postal service shall comply with the following requirements:&quot;  I propose a change to the wording whereby &quot;universal postal service shall comply with the following requirements&quot; will be replaced with &quot;that postal service shall comply with the following requirements&quot;.  It is a technical amendment to ensure all the various postal services provided by An Post comply with European postal regulations so they are grounded in costs, transparent on pricing and non-discriminatory.  While it is a small technical amendment, is to ensure the universal postal service and other services provided by An Post come under the same under the European standard of cost recovery, transparency and non-discrimination.</p></speech>

Section 28(1) requires that postal tariffs meet certain standards, including that they be affordable, transparent, non-discriminatory and related to costs.  ComReg's powers under section 28(5) need strengthening.  The Bill proposes the repeal of the very considerable and specific powers under section 30 of the 2011 Act.  This is a corollary to that.  Section 30 established the price cap to control postal tariffs where no effective competition exists.  While recognising the Minister of State's intention to issue a policy direction at this time, nevertheless it is felt strengthening the statutory position is necessary to ensure at least minimal controls are in place where there is a lack of effective competition.</p></speech>

These principles are enshrined in Article 12 of EU Directive 97/67/EC as amended by EU Directive 2008/6/EC.  It provides the terms must be inter alia affordable and cost oriented.  These directives were transposed into Irish law by the 2011 Act.  Article 12 of the directive provides member states shall ensure the tariffs for each of the services forming part of the universal service comply with the tariff principles.</p> <p>  The requirements are clearly intended to apply only to the universal postal service and it was on this basis the 2011 Act was drafted.  Extending these provisions beyond the universal service would represent a significant change in policy and would require detailed consideration and analysis as well as consultation with stakeholders.  In any event, regulatory measures are generally introduced to address issues arising in a particular market and should only, in line with the principle of proportionality, be introduced when necessary.  There has been no signal from the market on the need for regulatory measures in terms of tariffs outside of the universal postal service.  In these circumstances I cannot accept the amendments proposed by Deputies Dooley and Ryan to section 28(1) of the 2011 Act.</p></speech>

He is right with regard to the original provisions of the Act on providing an exclusive universal postal service.  In a sense, the thinking behind it was that competition would develop and people would have choices.  In truth when looking at the business there is effectively no real competition in the widespread range of postal services in a market of Ireland's size and given the nature of the postal services.  It is not just in the universal postal service provision this effective monopoly takes place.  There are sections of the processing system that may be contracted out but it is not an entire alternative service system.  It was on this basis the argument was made on applying closed tariff requirements, recognising the reality there is not really effective competition in the vast majority of the market in which An Post operates.</p></speech>

In any event, going down the road of regulatory changes would require detailed consideration and detailed consultation with stakeholders.  This is, effectively, emergency legislation to get An Post over the impasse it is at, until such time as the various reports, including the McKinsey report, are implemented with regard to cost savings.  This is to ensure An Post, as was said on Second Stage, gets over the present impasse and does not run out of money.</p></speech>

I want to address the inclusion of the phrase "may fail".</p><p>While I understand the wish to see the powers of the regulator strengthened, widening their scope to include the determination that the universal service provider may fail is too subjective.  It is difficult to see how ComReg could judge that a universal service provider may fail in its obligations to comply with the tariff principles.  In considering this amendment, the Minister consulted ComReg, which agreed on this point.</p><p> The Minister is cognisant of the impact that this measure might have on consumers in the SME sector.  In this regard, he has issued a policy direction to An Post instructing that price increases introduced following the repeal of the price cap mechanism must be subject to prior consultation with ComReg and have due regard to the tariff principles set out in section 28 of the 2011 Act as well as the interests of personal and SME users of the postal services.</p><p> Regarding the substitution of "shall" for "may", it is not appropriate to make the issuing of a direction obligatory.  A direction referred to in section 28(5) is an enforcement mechanism that may be used by ComReg and detailed procedures around the issuing of such directions are provided for in section 51 of the 2011 Act.  There may be some instances under section 28(5) in which a normal direction of this nature is not appropriate or necessary.  Therefore, it is important that ComReg retain discretion.  For these reasons, I am unable to accept the proposed amendments.</p></speech>

Deputy Lawless may have a similar point to the one that I am about to make.  Our purpose and wordings are similar.  We have been speaking to similar people with an interest in the area.</p> <p>  The point about not removing completely the capability of ComReg to have oversight is a valid one.  In some ways, the Minister recognises this.  If I heard the Minister of State correctly, the Minister has issued a direction that An Post, in any removal of the price cap and setting of new prices, would need ComReg to run the rule over its plans.  What the Minister intends to do is similar to the intention of the amendment.  The words are "shall" or "may", but the key point is that ComReg would maintain its oversight.  That is valid.</p> <p>  Our regulatory system is there for good purposes.  Even if An Post needed to raise revenue quickly in an emergency, it would be unfortunate if ComReg did not avail of its oversight role.  ComReg is well placed to assess the company and provide regulatory oversight.  The amendment provides for that.  In some ways, the Minister of State is saying that the Minister will do this but will not, or is reluctant to, accept the amendment, which would provide for the doing of it.</p></speech>

Perhaps the wording might be amended.  I take the point about "may fail" being subjective.  That is always difficult in law to enforce.</p> <p>  However, the point of the amendment holds.  As Deputy Ryan pointed out, the Minister of State has expressed the intention to issue a policy direction, but a statutory footing is much stronger than a policy direction.  That is the intention behind introducing the amendment.  We will return to the matter on Report Stage.  That is a sensible basis on which to proceed.</p></speech>

It was comprehensive and aimed at speeding up the process for price increases.  We have reached this cliff because management at An Post has not actively monitored this situation and managed it properly in the past decade or longer.  That, and the reduction in mail volumes, has brought us to this point.  To use the Minister of State's term, we are in an emergency situation.  Sinn F&eacute;in recognises that and it is the reason for our amendment.  I am disappointed that my amendment, which would have allowed for some oversight to be retained and accelerated matters, is not being included.  Being able to handle matters quickly would help An Post.  I will revert on Report Stage with an amendment on these themes.</p> <p>  Our intentions may have been misconstrued by some who may have a different agenda that has nothing to do with the future of An Post.  I am not interested in that.  Will the Minister of State clarify what could be done on Report Stage were I to submit an amendment on the basis that this one has fallen?</p> <p>  I also seek clarification from the departmental officials on another question that may have already been asked, but I was not 100% clear on what the answer was because we did not get a clear answer.  If a price increase is sought currently, ComReg does its work.  We all agree that this process takes too long and can inhibit a company from acting quickly enough to deal with what is happening in the real world.  After ComReg has undertaken public consultant and so on, must the Minister still sign off on the matter?</p> <p>  I will table an amendment on speedier reviews on Report Stage, so I wish to clarify whether I can do that.</p></speech>

It is simply not appropriate to ask it to adjudge that An Post may fail.  Deputy Stanley's amendments were ruled out of order.  As outlined on Second Stage, the repeal of the price cap mechanism has been identified as the most viable option for supporting An Post in the short term while the restructuring plan arising from the McKinsey review is implemented.  This decision was not taken lightly by the Government.  An in-depth review of the company took place in recent months on behalf of the shareholding Minister.  It confirmed the seriousness of the situation facing An Post.</p> <p>  While I understand where Deputy Stanley is coming from, the fundamental problem is the profound structural change in the mail business in Ireland and internationally.  Electronic substitution has had a significant impact on that business.  This is particularly apparent in respect of large volume postal customers such as banks and utility providers.  This business is becoming increasingly unstable, with volumes fluctuating on a month-to-month basis, making it difficult for An Post to plan.  In such circumstances, it is impossible to predict with certainty what the future holds in terms of volume decline.  As this information is central to determining the cap for pricing, current market conditions make it difficult to implement an effective and appropriate price cap mechanism.  In drafting the Bill, the Minister has considered whether an alternative regulatory structure around pricing could be provided for but, given the urgent need to address the challenges facing An Post, this was not possible in the time available.</p> <p>  The Minister is cognisant of the impact that this measure might have on consumers in the SME sector.  For this reason, the Bill provides that ComReg will undertake a review of the repeal of the price cap mechanism after a two-year period.  He has issued a policy direction to An Post instructing that price increases introduced following the repeal must be subjected to prior consultation with ComReg and have due regard to the tariff principles set out in section 28 of the 2011 Act and the interests of personal and SME users of postal services.  This will ensure that An Post does not abuse its position.  Following the repeal, the Minister will continue to monitor closely the activities of An Post in terms of stamp prices, but he does not have the final say.</p> <p>  The Bill's purpose is to repeal the price cap, but Deputy Stanley's amendment was to reintroduce it in another way.  There was no time to reintroduce regulation.  If we wanted to do that, it would require consultation on the matters in question, but there is no time to do so at the moment.</p></speech>

The amendment would require ComReg to undertake a review of the charges on An Post for international inbound mail into Ireland.  Section 29 provides that terminal dues shall be transparent and non-discriminatory and related to costs.  It is felt that this requirement is not being met adequately at present. ComReg reported that &euro;67 million has been lost by An Post on this service over the past five years and has proposed action to address this matter.  Addressing this would greatly improve the financial health of An Post and have a favourable impact on its ability to deliver the universal service.  There are multiple competitors in this space in terms of how inbound international mail can arrive into Ireland, many of which can bypass the postal service.  A review of this would be welcome, would make sense and might put An Post in a more favourable competitive position.</p></speech>

As recently as June 2016, ComReg published a review and assessment of An Post's terminal dues agreements.  Terminal dues are rates paid for delivery of international inbound mail items.  This review, which was conducted with the assistance of Frontier Economics, was a useful exercise as terminal dues do have an impact on An Post.  I should advise that the Minister was open to the inclusion of a provision along the lines of that proposed by Deputies Dooley and Ryan.  In this regard, officials have been liaising with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  However, the Office of the Attorney General has advised that an amendment of this nature would create legal uncertainty and likely impact on ComReg's existing powers under the 2002 Act.  It could also leave previous actions undertaken by ComReg on terminal dues open to challenge.  Having regard to the Attorney General's advice, I cannot accept the amendments proposed.

If, however, they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise that any submission or opening statements the witnesses make to the committee will be published on the committee's website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Today's meeting follows a call for submissions on a full media merger examination of the proposed acquisition of Celtic Media by Independent News &amp;amp; Media plc, INM, by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland under the terms of the Competition Act 2002, as amended.  I welcome our witnesses, who include academics and experts.  We are joined by Professor Colum Kenny, who is attending in his capacity as emeritus professor of communications at Dublin City University and as a former member of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, now the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI.  He was a member of the media mergers advisory group, whose report he co-authored.  We are also joined by Dr. Michael Foley, emeritus research fellow from Dublin Institute of Technology, Dr. Roderick Flynn, school of communications, Dublin City University, Mr. Frank Mulrennan, CEO of Celtic Media Group, and Tadhg Carey, editor of the <i>Westmeath Independent</i>and <i>Offaly Independent</i>.  Representing INM are Mr. Robert Pitt, CEO, and Mr. Gerry Lennon, managing director of INM regionals.  From the National Union of Journalists, we have Mr. S&eacute;amus Dooley, secretary.  It is proposed that the witnesses speak for five minutes and they will be followed by questions by the members.  Questions must not exceed three minutes.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I call Professor Kenny.</p></speech>

I sought some further information but I understand the documentation is very sparse and we have no firm details on the proposed takeover.  Neither has the committee.  There is no advisory group report although I understand one may be in the process of being written for the BAI.  In these circumstances, it is extremely difficult to give an informed opinion on this matter.  I can only say that, in these circumstances, one has to look to the first principles.  I draw the members' attention, in particular, to the form available for applicants in media mergers or takeovers.  It is very practical and arises in some respects from the report of the media mergers advisory group, on which I sat.  It gives concrete indicators of diversity such that when one is examining a potential takeover, one may have regard to a broad range of impacts, including prior performance of the media organisation proposing to make a takeover, including its employment policies.  This is, perhaps, a way of assessing what any organisational impact might be.  In the case in question, for example, one could consider the manner in which INM parted company with a particular correspondent in regard to the Garda whistleblower affair and decide whether that raises questions about the positions of staff in the organisation to be taken over.  One could also examine a broad range of employment matters, including the likely impact on diversity in regard to such aspects of media as the representation of minorities and gender balance.  There are far too many factors and concrete indicators for me to rehearse here in five minutes.  I strongly refer the members to the forum I have mentioned, which is of very great value.</p> <p>  Some people regard this kind of takeover in personal terms.  I do not although I must say I have some difficulties appearing before a committing looking at a takeover by INM, on which Deputy Michael Lowry sits.  I am here anyway at the request of the committee.  I believe there is a conflict of interest.  I do not see this in personal terms.  I believe that INM could be taken over tomorrow by the organisation that includes Fox News or Breitbart News, for example, just as TV3 could be bought by Silvio Berlusconi.  These are matters of public interest.  It is terribly important at this time that we protect the freedom and diversity of the media.  We can see from the United States that when the fairness doctrine was abolished, the media there went on a slippery slope.  We have now arrived at a position in which there seems to be difficulty in distinguishing between fact and alternative realities.  It is up to the members to make the decisions that matter in these cases.</p> <p>  It is ultimately a political, moral and aesthetic decision on the part of the people who control media policies as to what kind of media we have.  It is not a mathematical formula.  No competition authority applying sheer statistics in regard to readership, audiences or percentages of ownership can arrive at a satisfactory solution.  The kind of media and policy environment we have is one of choice.  It is the responsibility of people to make that choice based on the kind of society we want and the kind of media we want.</p><p>That will not change.  No amount of balancing statistics can replace the decision the D&aacute;il must make.</p><p> The procedure is very awkward.  I do not quite understand how it came about that at the end of the day the Joint Committee of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is asked to consider the matter before the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, has considered it and without having access to a report from an advisory council.  It puts the committee in a very awkward position, but it can certainly affirm the need for diversity, having regard to the various concrete indicators of diversity that I have mentioned and are in the form that the applicants have to provide to the committee.  </p><p> I have provided a written statement which goes into much more detail, but I was asked to limit my oral contribution to five minutes.  I have spoken for five minutes.  I thank the Chairman for the honour of the invitation to come before the committee today and I am available to be of further assistance if I can be.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-07a.184" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Michael Foley" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017020700002#E00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for inviting me to address them.  It is a great honour to be here.</p> <p>  I draw the members' attention to a number of reports, looking at Ireland as well as many other countries in the world, which concentrate on media ownership.  Reporters without Borders, RSF, describes the concentration of media ownership in Ireland as a major problem.  The American human rights organisation, Freedom House, which reported on Ireland in 2016, said in reference to press freedom that a "high concentration of ownership affects plurality and competitiveness in the sector".  A recent report for the European Commission conducted by Dr. Roderick Flynn showed that Ireland was high risk in terms of concentration of media ownership.  </p> <p>  In another report commissioned by Sinn F&eacute;in's Ms Lynn Boylan MEP, Ireland was described as having one of the most concentrated media markets in any democracy.  The issue of the concentration of media ownership is well known and well documented.  We are aware that a media whose ownership is highly concentrated is seen as damaging for democracy and it has been assumed for nearly 200 hundred years that multiplicity of media outlets is the lifeblood of debate and ensures citizen can receive as a wide a range of views and opinions as is possible, whether it is about politics or the economy as well as other aspects of life, including education and culture.  The more concentrated the market is, the more exposed it is to the lack of variety and content.</p> <p>  Coming to the issue before us, it is assumed in the legislation that media is not like other business endeavours.  The whole reason we are here is because media differs from other types of commercial activity.  The reason that the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 passed responsibility for media mergers from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources reflects that point.  The Minister can now determine whether a proposed media merger would be contrary to the public interest in protecting the plurality of media.  That is stated quite explicitly in the guidelines, which I will not read as members have probably seen them.  It should be noted that when the guidelines were issued by the then Minister, Mr. Alex White, there was criticism that they and the legal changes were too little and too late and nothing could be done retrospectively.  There is a Bill before the D&aacute;il, sponsored by Deputies Catherine Murphy and R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, that hopes to address that retrospective issue.  In the meantime, there is no doubt that if Independent News &amp;amp; Media Holdings Limited, INM, is allowed to acquire the Celtic Media newspapers, it will strengthen INM's already dominant position and mean that INM will be by far the biggest single player in the regional newspaper market.</p> <p>  Cross-media ownership and plurality impact very directly on the people who live in the areas served by Celtic Media.  They currently have access to an independent newspaper, produced in their locality.  After a takeover, those same people might be receiving their national news, local news and possibly radio news all from the same company or from media organisations linked to one another through shareholding.  INM has suggested the takeover of Celtic Media is nothing more than a business or commercial decision, with no further implications.  The deal would lead to possible synergies, according to INM, as I have read, which in itself is worrying.  Synergies could mean the outsourcing of some editorial functions, such as sub-editing as has happened with INM titles, or even one newsroom serving a number of titles, thereby reducing the number of reporters and impacting negatively on the gathering of local news.  This has happened already with radio stations. </p> <p>  As stated, if INM's acquisition of Celtic Media goes ahead, it will control 28 regional newspaper titles in addition to its five national titles.  The radio sector is also a factor, given that the Communicorp Group, which is owned by the same major majority shareholder as INM, controls Newstalk, Today FM, 98 FM, Spin 1038 and Spin South West, or 20% of the radio market.  When one looks at the Dublin, one will see a larger figure, where Communicorp radio stations are higher than RTE.  It is essential when looking at media ownership in Ireland that the cross-media ownership by INM and Communicorp Group is considered at the same time.</p> <p>  The Government's case is that nothing can be done retrospectively about media ownership because of the constitutional protection of private property which could, of course, be tested if Deputies Catherine Murphy and R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall's Bill is allowed to proceed.  However, if dealings with media ownership retrospectively is impossible, it would be unwise at this stage to allow a company to expand in the face of almost universal agreement that there is a problem with the degree of media ownership concentration in Ireland.  The signal the Minister would be sending is that the Government has no intention of addressing a major issue facing Irish democracy.</p></speech>

I think the reason I am here is because in addition to this being a research focus, I am the Irish rapporteur for the media pluralism monitor, which as Dr. Foley has pointed out, identified the Irish communications market in terms of concentration as constituting a high risk.</p> <p>  It might be helpful if I briefly rehearse how we got to this point.  Some 22 years ago, the Irish Newspaper Commission, among other things, looked at the question of the degree of pluralism and diversity in Irish media.  It concluded that there was sufficient diversity at that point, that is, in 1995, but that any further diminution in competition and consolidation of ownership would create an issue.  Immediately after that we had a more or less helter-skelter deluge of media acquisitions, starting with the UK player, Scottish Radio Holding and Trinity Mirror coming into the radio and print media markets.  This prompted the Population Communications International, PCI, Media Impact in 2001 to adjust their ownership and control policy.  Under some pressure from the Competition Authority, which was looking for a more relaxed approach to media ownership and as a consequence in 2001, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI, announced a new lighter touch approach to regulation and ownership thresholds, which existed at the time, were substantially relaxed.</p> <p>  Up to that point no individual or firm could own more than 27% of any individual media outlet.  This related to BCI regulated media, that is, to radio stations.  The new limit was no more than 25% of an entire sector, right across the radio sector and, therefore, 100% ownership of up to a quarter of all BCI licensed radio stations was possible from this point onwards.  The BCI's competence at that point did not extend to print media and its new rules made no reference to television but coincidentally in the period after than between 2001 and 2007, there was a deluge of radio and print acquisitions, mainly in the local and regional markets.  These went largely unchallenged by the competition authorities, successive Ministers for enterprise and by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland.  By my reckoning, there were almost 90 media mergers between 1995 and 2008, of which perhaps three were subjected to any kind of extensive scrutiny.</p> <p>  By 2008, a number of groups were emerging in the print sector, including Independent News &amp;amp; Media Holdings Limited, which had been there since the 1970s, Johnston Publishing, Alpha Newspaper Group, Dunfermline Press which becomes the Celtic Media Newspaper Limited and Thomas Crosbie Holdings.  One could add smaller groups, but these are the main players.  In radio, the incumbent players was RTE, Scottish Radio Holdings, which in turn was taken over by Emap, UTV, Thomas Crosbie Holdings and Communicorp Group Limited.</p><p>In 2007, we had the last major acquisition in this phase, namely, the acquisition by Communicorp of Emap Holdings, that is, Today FM, FM 104 and Highland Radio.  I mention this because the acquisition was unusual in that it was subjected to a full-scale investigation by the then Competition Authority.  However, even before the authority completed its work, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland stepped in to announce it would not sign off on the sale of FM 104 as part of the deal as this would have placed both national commercial stations and the two leading Dublin commercial stations in the hands of a single company.  Although the acquisition proceeded, FM 104 was immediately sold off to ITV. </p><p> The net effect of all this is that, over the course of a decade between 1998 and 2008, we moved from a position whereby local media in particular were largely constituted of privately owned and often family owned independent operations to a position whereby all but a handful of commercial radio stations and nearly every local newspaper with a significant circulation had been absorbed into larger media groups.  The scale and pace of this concentration attracted some political attention and in 2008, the advisory group on media mergers, on which Professor Colum Kenny sat, was established to assess whether media merger regulation was up to scratch.  The conclusions of the advisory group were that, although it was ultimately the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment who determined whether a merger should proceed, it was the Competition Authority which performed the assessments informing the Minister's judgment.  The advisory committee noted, however, that the Competition Authority's expertise lay in assessing the market impact - I emphasise that term - of media acquisitions.  By its own admission over the previous years, the Competition Authority was not competent to assess the impact of such acquisitions on pluralism and diversity.  I emphasise that the former is an economic question, whereas the latter is a political one.  Consequently, the advisory group recommended that responsibility for approving mergers be shifted from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the then Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  This was meant to reflect the shift from viewing media acquisitions through a purely economic prism to  viewing them from a political as well as an economic or market perspective.  While it took six years to implement this recommendation, it finally emerged in the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014.  As of today, although the Competition and Consumer Protection Authority still plays a role, responsibility for assessing media mergers is shared with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and, potentially, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. </p><p> Since the introduction of the 2014 Act, there have been six significant media acquisitions, namely, UTV on two occasions, TV3, Setanta, UTV's radio holdings and the acquisition that is currently under review.  In all of these cases, the media holdings in question have been acquired by much larger media groups, namely, Liberty Global, News Corporation, Eir and now Independent News and Media.  If we accept that the media play a constitutive role in the operation of a health democracy - that may be a banal observation but it is also true - it is striking that until the proposed acquisition of Celtic Media Newspapers by INM, none of the recent acquisitions had been subjected to an in-depth examination.  </p></speech>

I am joined by Mr. Tadhg Carey, editor of the <i>Westmeath Independent</i>and <i>Offaly Independent</i>newspapers, which have a proud heritage in providing good journalism and solid community coverage since 1846.  Mr. Carey will make some opening remarks in a few moments.<br/><br/>Having been a journalist for the first 18 years of my career, I have a great commitment to editors having full autonomy in their decision making.  I have secured full guarantees that this editorial independence will continue under our newspaper titles when the sale to Independent News and Media is approved.  For the past 16 years, I have been managing local newspaper titles and I have seen our industry go from the Celtic tiger years when high prices were paid, primarily by British investors, for local Irish newspapers to a position in which, since 2008, the business model in local newspapers is broken.  <br/><br/>Our company and the jobs of 98 colleagues earning more than &euro;4.2 million in salaries almost went out of business in 2012 due to the weight of bank debts and continually falling revenues.  My colleagues were extremely supportive of the management buy-out which I led in 2012 and under which their jobs and 950 years of newspaper history were secured.  It is important to make the joint committee aware that we took the very progressive decision to allocate 25% of the equity in the company from the management buy-out to our editors, sales managers and a production manager.  Mr. Carey is one of the beneficiaries of this decision. <br/><br/>We borrowed &euro;5.5 million in June 2012 in the teeth of recession.  Five years later, we are faced with a broken business model in terms of publishing local newspapers or, dare I say it, newspapers in general.  For this reason, we ask members to approach this sale approval process with an open mind and to ignore the considerable noise around this issue in the national media, which has nothing to do with the job security of my colleagues.<br/><br/>While I have great regard for the contribution of our media academics, I respectfully suggest that the tone of today's contributions would be different if we had an economic consultant or business analyst before the joint committee because we are dealing with tough commercial reality.  For example, since 2008 the regional newspaper industry, the business in which I work, has suffered a 65% fall in print advertising and a 35% fall in circulation revenues.  I take Dr. Flynn's point about the health of the business prior to that time.  Since 2008, however, only one investment has been made in local newspapers, namely, when Johnston Press was sold in 2014.  Nobody else has seen fit to invest in local newspapers since.  While there has been major growth in digital advertising, three quarters of this growth is going to Facebook and Google.<br/><br/>I respectfully suggest that the interests of my colleagues and the future of our newspapers will be best protected through being part of a larger company with funds to invest in a digital platform and marketing.  I know the company in question will provide the editorial independence that I want to protect.  I ask members to bear in mind that this sale was approved by the Competition and Consumer Protection Authority at the first stage because there is no overlap in the titles.  While the sale is very important to the Celtic Media Group, members should note that it only adds 3% to the circulation of Independent News and Media.  <br/><br/>If Dr. Foley will excuse me, I wish to correct a point he made.  The number of titles involved in this sale when it is approved is not 28 but 20 and a good number of the titles are small.  There are two other fine companies in the local newspaper companies, namely, Iconic Newspapers, which as 13 titles, and Landmark Media.  My colleagues are in the process of making submissions to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and do so of their own accord.  I understand our sales team is making a collective submission and that my 20 pre-press colleagues in Mullingar will also make a collective submission.  Others are making submissions off their own bat because they know the future of our company is best protected by being part of a larger company with a digital force. <br/><br/>The titles concerned are the five local newspapers in the group, namely, the <i>Westmeath Independent, </i>the<i>Westmeath Examiner, The Anglo-Celt, </i>the <i>Meath Chronicle </i>and the<i>Connaught Telegraph</i>, as well as our two free newspapers, the <i>Offaly Independent </i>and <i>Forum</i>.  We have seen newspapers close and I want to protect against further closures.  With that, I will hand over to Mr. Carey.</p></speech>

I can honestly state I never thought our small local newspapers would ever be the focus of leader articles in Sunday newspapers, receive so much coverage on the airwaves or the subject of Oireachtas debates such as this.  I am here as an editor and a journalist working in Athlone with a newspaper that was founded in 1846 in the midst of the Famine.  It is a newspaper which has a long, proud and distinguished record of reporting for over 170 years in its community.<br/><br/>While in Ireland there is a unique commitment to provide local news and many of the 76 regional newspaper titles in the Republic are older than the State, the harsh reality is that the traditional newspaper model is no longer commercially sustainable.  While I respect the expertise and knowledge of the three previous delegates and found their contributions very interesting from an overall perspective, I was a little surprised that there was no reference to the difficulties in the sector.  As Mr. Frank Mulrennan referenced, I have seen newspapers in the midlands close, including <i>Roscommon Champion</i>, <i>Longford News</i>, <i>Athlone Voice</i>and <i>Offaly Express</i>, with two of which I previously spent time working.  I have seen significant job losses in this industry in the past 16 years.  The average regional newspaper now employs 50% of its 2000 staffing level.  In my company journalists have taken pay reductions and embraced the changes in how we report news items across a number of platforms.  They have been flexible and adaptable, but we are effectively swimming against the growing tide of digital dominance.<br/><br/>It is vital that the joint committee understand competition does not just come from other newspapers, it also comes from social media, including Google and Facebook, which are swallowing up ever-increasing slices of Irish marketing budgets.  Despite this, we, in Celtic Media, have worked very hard to build our digital presence.  We are proud of having more than 500,000 monthly visitors to our websites and more than 150,000 social media followers of our titles, while continuing to produce quality weekly newspapers.  The reality is, however, that we are not at the races in achieving a decent digital commercial return, certainly anything that will compensate for the decline in advertising and circulation revenues, about which the committee has heard previously.  Only through being part of a larger group that can facilitate a much larger investment in a digital presence can small newspapers such as ours hope to survive in the future.<br/><br/>As I said, I am here as a working journalist and an editor.  I am privileged and honoured to be in the position of editor of two fine regional newspapers.  It is a special role.  I agree fully with Dr. Foley when he says newspapers are not solely a commercial product.  Regional newspapers have a real value and a special place in the rural communities that they serve.  Long-standing newspapers such as my own, <i>Westmeath Independent </i>and <i>Offaly Independent</i>, are embedded in community life.  They are part and parcel of the community.  Each week, with each addition, we hold up a mirror for the community in which to see itself.  For me, if media plurality is to mean anything, it must mean the continuation of local newspapers such as my own, <i>Westmeath Independent</i>and <i>Offaly Independent,</i>in whatever form and securing the jobs these titles bring.  That is my sole driving motivation in being before the committee.<br/><br/>As an editor, it is very much welcome that INM has stated in its written submission to the Minister, Deputy Denis Naugten, that our newspapers will continue as independent publications with editors who will have full and effective independence and that they will continue with dedicated staff on the ground whose function it will be to produce the content needed to serve local areas.  It is also stated in the submission that there is no intention on the part of INM to make material changes to the operating policies of the newspapers following the transaction.  This includes the policies on staff pay, the frequency and size of the publications and the information gathering practices used by staff reporters.  It is these commitments and the imperative for future investment to secure the newspapers that have led me and my fellow editors across the group to support the decision to sell the company to one with the necessary resources.</p></speech>

I will address the committee first on the reasons for the proposed acquisition by INM of Celtic Media Newspapers.  Mr. Lennon will talk about the INM regional newspapers.<br/><br/>The agreement for the sale and purchase of the entire issued share capital of CMNL Limited by INM was executed on 2 September 2016.  In line with media merger requirements, INM and CMNL jointly submitted a notification to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, on 5 September 2016.  On 10 November 2016 the CCPC determined that the transaction would not lead to a substantial lessening of competition in any market for goods or services in the State.  INM believes the proposed transaction will not be contrary to the public interest in protecting plurality of media in the State.<br/><br/>INM is a media company operating in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  All of its operations are based on the island of Ireland and it provides direct employment for more than 800 people and many more indirectly.  Its newspapers far predate its existence, with papers such as <i>The Sligo Champion</i>which was founded in 1836 and <i>The Kerryman</i>which was founded in 1904.  Of its national titles,<i>Irish Independent </i>was first published in 1905.  Other papers are also household names, including <i>Sunday Independent</i>, <i>The Herald</i>, <i>Sunday World</i>, <i>Wexford People </i>and other regional titles.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the last decade the industry as a whole suffered a material decline in revenue.  In 2008 INM announced losses of &euro;161.4 million.  In early 2009 the company failed to reach agreement with bondholders on a figure of &euro;200 million which cast doubt on its ability to continue as a going concern.  Following material support from shareholders, the board, management and staff, the company underwent major restructuring.  Since dealing with these legacy issues, INM's financial position has stabilised.  It remains challenged, however, by the disruption it faces from the growth of digital in the industry.  Nevertheless, investment from its own resources in creating a viable digital future for all of its titles has seen positive growth in this channel.  The indigenous newspaper publishing industry, both local and national, has faced and continues to be challenged by severe disruption.  As a result, it has seen a decline of 62% in print advertising revenues since 2007 and a decline of 39% in circulation volumes since the same year.  Continuing programmes of redundancies across the industry, with the existence of several titles under threat, are also a fact of life in the industry.<br/><br/>The financial challenges which have impacted on the publishing industry have resulted in the closure of many regional and national titles.  The pressures brought on by the recession led to the closure by Alpha Newspapers of three local newspaper titles in Ireland in 2010: <i>Roscommon Champion</i>, <i>Longford News </i>and <i>Athlone Voice</i>.  At the time Deputy Denis Naughten, now Minister, was reported as saying, &quot;The closure of the papers is devastating news for the 40 employees who will lose their jobs, but it is also a major blow for the area.&quot;<br/><br/>A cornerstone of democracy is an independent free press.  To maintain independence, media enterprises must be financially sustainable and capable of survival.  News organisations have faced increasing pressure to remain commercially viable.  As a result, consolidation and collaboration have become commonplace in the global newspaper industry.  In Ireland INM and <i>The Irish Times</i>, INM's primary competitor in the national market, have entered into agreements, whereby <i>The Irish Times</i>prints certain INM titles and Newspread, our distribution business, distributes <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Such collaboration has become essential to ensure publishers remain competitive.</p><p>INM expects collaboration to become more commonplace in the future.  Consolidation has allowed publishers to use centralised back office functions and infrastructure to produce newspapers of high quality, despite falling revenues.  Consolidation is the only real means to ensure the continuation of many titles, the protection of jobs and the survival of newspapers and this actually protects the diversity of views.  The proposed acquisition will benefit CMNL by enabling access to the financial and operational resources of a larger parent company, without any impact on editorial independence.</p><p> By 2015 the financial position of INM was such that the company was in a position to evaluate acquisition opportunities.  INM believes it has an obligation to its domestic market to use its resources to sustain and improve the existing newspaper offer on the island of Ireland and the jobs that are necessary to support that.  The proposed transaction with Celtic Media Newspapers demonstrates this belief.  The transaction is beneficial to regional papers in general and to Celtic Media in particular.  It will provide much needed financial support and will secure the future of Celtic Media's seven titles as well as the associated jobs.</p></speech>

INM is a fully committed publisher of regional newpapers.  We have some of the oldest papers in the country and are very proud of them.  We publish 13 regional titles, including the <i>Drogheda Independent</i>, the <i>Argus</i>in Dundalk, <i>Wicklow People</i>, <i>Wexford People</i>, <i>The Kerryman</i>, <i>The Corkman</i>and <i>The Sligo Champion</i>, in Louth, Wexford, Wicklow, Cork, Kerry and Sligo.  INM takes its role as custodian of these titles very seriously and we have great belief in the future of local press.  Local newspapers provide quality local news for local people.  Social media platforms such as Facebook, although hugely popular and used by almost everybody in the country, cannot provide the professionally produced content presented by our local journalists.  Our elected and appointed officials engage with their community through their local papers and news of what happens locally is vital.  The employment of local people produces a multiplier effect as the wages earned by employees of local papers are spent in the local community.  The importance of local papers was best summarised by the Taoiseach and reported in <i>The Sligo Weekender</i>, a competitor title to ours, in Sligo at the launch of local newspaper week in October 2011:</p><blockquote>Of course, the first duty of local papers is to inform the reader, both on local and national stories, but they also do much more than that.  In fact they are a vital part of the fabric of rural life, serving to cement our links to our communities and always providing an insight into the bustling society of Ireland's towns and villages.</blockquote> <p>Celtic Media Newspapers employs just short of 100 people in Meath, Cavan, Westmeath, Offaly and Mayo.  Approximately 45 people are employed in the company's print plant in Navan.  Like all regional newspapers, the company has experienced some difficulties.  It has had significant investment in a new publishing system and has funded redundancies, allied to ever-declining revenues.  Unfortunately, ever-declining revenues are what we, in the print business, are facing.  The long-term viability and quality of Celtic Media Newspapers could be at risk if the proposed transaction does not go ahead.<br/><br/>The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission determined that, although both INM Holdings and Celtic Media are involved in publishing local and regional newspapers, the proposed transaction &quot;does not give rise to horizontal overlaps in different local-regional areas for the publication of local-regional newspapers based on readership&quot;.  This is demonstrated in a map in the written submission.  If the transaction proceeds, there will be 14 counties in the Republic of Ireland with no INM regional or Celtic Media title.  In each of the areas where Celtic Media and INM regionals currently operate there are numerous other competing titles, which are further detailed in our written submission.<br/><br/>Under INM ownership there will be no change to Celtic Media's current editorial policy and practice.  Editors of Celtic Media's titles, along with INM's regional editors, will continue to have full autonomy over the content of their newspapers.  Celtic Media newspapers will retain their individual editorial standards and these will be exactly the same to the readers of those publications as they are now.  By providing financial support to Celtic Media the proposed transaction will secure the future of Celtic Media's titles and related high quality employment in Meath, Westmeath, Cavan, Offaly and Mayo.  The proposed acquisition will ensure that the distinctive voice of Celtic Media newspapers will continue long into the future.</p></speech>

On my first day at the Roscommon Champion I covered a meeting of Roscommon County Council which Senator Leyden attended, though he may have been Deputy Leyden at the time.  My hand was slapped by a reporter from the rival paper when a political opponent of Deputy Doherty spoke and she said &quot;We don't take him&quot;.  <i>The Roscommon Herald </i>had a policy of favouring one Deputy and it illustrated the importance, at an early stage for me, of diversity and plurality in the regional media sector.<br/><br/>We requested this hearing because it is the only opportunity for public scrutiny of this proposed acquisition.  With me is Bernie N&iacute; Fhlatharta, leas-chathaoirleach of the Irish executive council and a freelance reporter and broadcaster who has worked for <i>The Connacht Tribune</i>, and Ian McGuinness, Irish organiser of the NUJ.  Both of them will be free to take questions.<br/><br/>The guidelines on media mergers provide the framework for the deliberations of this committee.  The work of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has been done and the function of this committee is to examine the issue of media plurality.  The guidelines are a useful starting point for this.  I share the views of Tadhg Carey, a member of the NUJ and a shareholder of Celtic Media, and many of my former colleagues have also been made redundant by Independent News and Media, when it decided to outsource editorial production to Yorkshire.  <br/><br/>The NUJ has a long history of opposing media concentration of ownership.  Our first intervention was in 1973 when Tony O'Reilly acquired Independent Newspapers and when the late Justin Keating advised our future president of the union, John Devine, that no politician would have the courage to take on someone who bought ink by the barrel.  Our opposition then, as it is now, was based on a belief in the importance of media diversity and not on personalities.  If the focus of the debate on media ownership has appeared to concentrate on Independent News and Media, on Communicorp or on Denis O'Brien, it is because successive Governments have allowed a concentration of ownership to develop, directly and indirectly.  The committee is obliged, under the media mergers guidelines, to look not just at the reach of Independent Newspapers but also at Communicorp.  None of the previous speakers from Independent News and Media or Celtic Media mentioned the significant interest held by Communicorp within Independent News and Media but that cross-ownership distinguishes this from other acquisitions.<br/><br/>The issue of ownership is all too frequently assumed to be about direct editorial interference by owners and shareholders on editorial content.  In many ways this is simplistic, as ownership is linked to financial control and determines the priority given to editorial budgets.  It determines business models, wages and payments and conditions.  It determines one's pension, or absence thereof, and the corporate approach to pensions, which was illustrated in the recent developments in Independent News and Media, an issue with which we deal in our submission.</p><p>I point out to the committee that it is entitled to ask Independent News &amp;amp; Media about its failure to honour commitments given to the Pensions Authority of Ireland.  Under the guidelines, the committee has a clear responsibility to ask questions relating to corporate governance.  The committee is entitled to question Independent News &amp;amp; Media on developments involving the proposed sale of Newstalk to it and the circumstances which led to public statements involving the chair and chief executive of the company.<br/><br/>The creation of the post of editor-in-chief at Independent Newspapers in June 2013 marked a new departure.  It is worth noting that the editor-in-chief reports directly to the group chief executive.  Under the merger guidelines, the committee is also entitled to question editorial structures.  The committee and the BAI are entitled to examine the potential of centralised editorial structures and we encourage such deliberations.  They are also entitled to examine not just the current situation, but the implications for the future too.<br/><br/>Our BAI submission outlines concerns relating to the business and editorial model adopted by Independent News &amp;amp; Media and the potential implications for media plurality if Celtic Media is incorporated under the INM regional banner.  I welcome the comments of Mr. Lennon but I regret, however, that he was not in place when Independent News &amp;amp; Media ignored that same logic about local involvement when it closed the titles in north County Dublin and centralised them in Drogheda.  It may seem inconceivable that the editing and production of the titles involved would be centralised but there was a time when it was inconceivable that editorial production of the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, <i>Irish Independent</i>, <i>Sunday World</i>and <i>Evening Herald </i>would be outsourced to Yorkshire, but that is what happened last year.  When the <i>Belfast Telegraph </i>was acquired by Independent Newspapers, commitments were given about the maintenance of editorial diversity.  However, the sharing of copy between the <i>Belfast Telegraph </i>and INM titles is not uncommon.  I draw the committee's attention to the impact on freelance journalists and media plurality by the corporate approach to freelance copyright and we have included a copy of the document which freelance journalists are required to sign in order to secure work.<br/><br/>Obviously, I am answering 20 minutes on the two companies in five.  For illustrative purposes, we have produced a set of maps which illustrate the respective ownership of Independent News &amp;amp; Media and Celtic Media Group.<br/><br/>I believe the role of the regional paper and the role of the national newspapers are important.  We welcomed the acquisition of Celtic Media Group by Mr. Mulrennan and have worked closely with him.  NUJ members have made sacrifices to ensure its viability but those sacrifices were not made so that a larger group could acquire a leaner and cheaper machine.</p></speech>

We will take questions from members in groups of three.  If the witnesses bank the questions as they are posed, I will then revert to them to answer those questions.  I wish to start by questioning our three academics.  As we know, INM publishes the <i>Irish Independent, Sunday Independent</i>, the <i>Evening Herald</i>, the <i>Sunday World</i>and the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i>.  It has a 50% stake in the <i>Irish Daily Star</i>and controls 13 paid-for regional weekly newspapers.  The witnesses may feel they have answered my question already, but I wish to get their definitive reply on it.  In overall terms, would it be contrary to the public interest in terms of maintaining the plurality of the media if this merger were to go ahead?  Perhaps Dr. Foley will address the question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-07a.201" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Michael Foley" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017020700002#J00300"><p>I think it would.  As appears to be the case at the moment, if there is no way to deal sort of retrospectively with the build-up of major media organisations, any increase in the size is contrary to the public interest.  Let me say one thing: I was a journalist for 20 years and have been training and educating young people to become journalists.  I think I speak for all of us when I say that we are as aware of what this means to our graduates as to others when we speak about unemployment in the newspaper industry.  However, we have a particular role here.  We are here to balance, I suppose, what might be a commercial interest with the public interest.  It is a complicated process and I see that point.  I recall one time when I was very involved in the NUJ.  I was on its Irish council and we had to speak to our members in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>because the union opposed the then partial takeover of the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>by Independent News &amp;amp; Media.  Our members there feared for their jobs.  There was a tension between what the union nationally believed was right and in the public interest and the individual concerns of our members.  All of us here are well aware of issues around jobs and the economy, but that discussion is probably for elsewhere.  This is a political forum and the issue is a political one.</p></speech>

It can be in the public interest to have mergers.  I am personally steeped in a family background of advertising.  My grandfather started the first full-service advertising agency in Dublin.  His clients included Arthur Griffith and P&aacute;draig Pearse.  My first job was in advertising and I have invested in media and been a director of media, so apropos of something said by another witness, I am fully conscious that the business of media is crucial.  Ireland may well need bigger media organisations and that can be in the public interest.  The difficulty is that the devil is in the detail.  We do not have enough information to assess the detail in a way that can answer the concerns expressed by the NUJ.  My sense, and one of the reasons I ceased writing for the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, was that the internal organisation of Independent Newspapers was becoming less diverse.  I would have concerns but I cannot make the assessment that the committee will have to make based on what I hope will be a full range of information.  It can be in the public interest, but it may not be.</p></speech>

The implied question is whether there is some relationship between ownership and editorial.  Our problem is that there is very little research in Ireland and internationally on what happens when something gets taken over by an existing media group.  The one piece of research I would point to, and modesty forbids it, is my own, but it is a very small piece of research that is tentative.  It compared Independent News &amp;amp; Media coverage with every other newspaper group's coverage of events relating to the major shareholder over the course of the past few years.  It did not point to a glaring distinction between Independent News &amp;amp; Media's coverage and that offered by other newspaper groups, but it did point to a distinction.  It was a distinction of emphasis rather than a distinction such as "someone is good" and "someone is bad".  It was not remotely that obvious, but there was clearly a distinction.  To me, that tentatively suggests that there is some connection.  If we have a situation, as we already do, where one newspaper group accounts for between 45% and 50% of daily and Sunday newspaper sales, that constitutes some kind of influence, albeit one that is diluted by the increasing availability of other media forms.</p> <p>  The second point is on the emphasis on consolidation being the only way of saving things.  I am a political economist and I know the maths involved.  There were 1.2 million Sunday sales in 2007 and 650,000 in 2013.  That is a collapse.  It is not as bad in the daily market, but nor is it good.  At its peak, Johnston Press spent &euro;300 million acquiring its 18 titles.  It sold 14 titles for &euro;8.5 million.  That is a collapse and I get that the maths are significant.  However, this is our question: is it better to let something go under and not have it exist or to allow it to be part of a much larger media group?</p> <p>  There may be an alternative to consolidation, however.  It is outside the gift of the committee to introduce it but the idea that consolidation might be the only way that we can preserve the vital function played by regional and local media needs to be examined.  We need to seriously contemplate whether this is the point at which we contemplate public funding of not just broadcasting in the country, but of public service media production.  That could involve print and online platforms.  I see no particular reason for the BAI sound and vision fund to be limited to supporting broadcasting.</p></speech>

This is an important issue.  The importance of local media reporting on local issues has been highlighted very well by Mr. Gerry Lennon and others.  The business case and the business element and competition end of it has been ruled on and that has been parked.  That is done.</p><p>It is the question that has been raised.  Concern has been raised about the fact that INM is involved in national newspapers and the business of local newspapers is different.  We are having this discussion because there is public concern.  There is also concern within trade union circles, journalists, former journalists and in political circles.  The concerns relate to three areas.  The first is plurality and diversity.  The second is the public interest, while the third relates to the terms and conditions of workers.  The main concern is the dominance of INM, in particular Denis O'Brien and his influence.  The case will be made by INM that there is not editorial control.  I do not believe someone is holding the hand of journalists or editors but he who pays the piper always calls the tune.  The evidence is in the pages of the newspapers.  When one reads them, one sees the relentless pursuit of a political agenda.  In the <i>Sunday Independent</i>one can see commentaries written by three Deputies from one particular party.  That should be encouraged.  I do not have a problem with that and the party I represent does not have a problem with scrutiny of political parties, including Sinn F&eacute;in.  Scrutiny should be vigorous, but it must also be balanced.  However, the question is whether two or three Deputies from the political party I represent or those from other parties will be allowed to have the same coverage.<br/><br/>Another concern is the use of legal avenues to slap down opposition.  A total of 12 cases has been taken by Denis O&rsquo;Brien against media organisations and there have also been threats of legal action.  I am not interested in personalising the situation but we must look at the issue as it stands.  The newspapers are now referred to as &quot;viewspapers&quot;.  Newspapers should carry views but they should also have balanced news content and that is where the problem arises.  I do not think democracy can function without having a free press.  Any objective read of INM publications will show there is a particular editorial line.  The big concern is around centralised editorial content and consolidation of editorial content in that local editors do not have the same influence as was previously the case.  Former journalists to whom I have spoken said they might not have been told what to write but they knew what not to write in newspapers.<br/><br/>I am interested in the views of Robert Pitt and Gerry Lennon on how we protect the editorial independence of local titles, which are valuable.  I have dealt with Tadhg Carey's newspaper in the past when we had a larger constituency.  Could they comment on how we maintain the plurality and diversity of content, given the sheer weight of the financial interest of a small number of individuals?  I am also concerned about the protection of workers in those titles.  People in the media not just in INM, but right across a range of newspapers, in the past two years in particular have approached politicians to say their terms and conditions have gone through the floor.  They said do not get a chance to research the content of the stories they write, that their work is hampered and the quality of what is being produced is not up to standard.  In tandem, their terms and conditions have reduced.  They are employed on temporary contracts and they are in a very precarious situation.  I do not envy them.  They are the three issues that must be addressed, namely, editorial independence, diversity and plurality of content and the terms and conditions of workers, in addition to how we protect those working in the media in terms of pursuing stories and having the time to research them without being hampered in their efforts.</p></speech>

It was unnecessary for the Minister to refer the matter to the committee and if I were in his position I probably would not have done so.  I made decisions when I was in the Department previously.  So be it; we are here.</p><p>I welcome everyone but I have great memories in particular of S&eacute;amus Dooley, the former editor of the <i>Roscommon Champion</i>who was so fair and impartial.  He ran a great newspaper.  I am sure he must have been very sad to see Lord Kilclooney, the former John Taylor, and Alpha Newspapers take over the <i>Roscommon Champion</i>.  Not only did he take it over, but he closed the newspaper and then he destroyed all the archives.  He had no loyalty to the <i>Roscommon Champion</i>or to the Republic of Ireland for that matter.</p><p>By the way, Mr. Dooley mentioned the interesting times on the <i>Roscommon Champion</i>and the interesting colleague from another newspaper, but it was not the editorial policy of the <i>Roscommon Herald</i>to give a particular person a preference, rather it was an individual journalist who did that.</p></speech>

They have the interests of staff at heart.  I recently went into a small business and I know the pressures on them.  It is unbelievable how difficult it is to create a job in this country.  It seems every barrier is put up against it.  One is paying rates, overheads, RSI and PRSI.  I also understand the quality of newspapers the witnesses represent.  I lived beside the <i>Westmeath Examiner</i>so I know exactly what the situation is and we are very lucky that a newspaper group such as Independent News &amp;amp; Media is prepared to take over those titles and give them editorial freedom.  The <i>Roscommon Herald</i>was taken over by the Thomas Crosbie Holdings Group, which owns the <i>Examiner</i>, and it is working very well.  There has been no interference in editorial control or suppression of individual submissions.  I have no evidence of that.  I find that fairness in all local newspapers.  They take a story and run with it.  That is journalism.</p></speech>

As far as the pension situation is concerned, this is not the forum for such a discussion today.  There are other fora in which to deal with that issue.  I cannot go into that area.  I very much regret that there has been a change in the structure but that is a discussion for another day.  I am under no obligation to anybody - political party or otherwise - but the way I look at it is that when the Competition Authority said the acquisition was within its rules, that is fine by me.  I do not see a queue lining up for the Celtic Media Group.  I am concerned for the 98 jobs.  I am also concerned about the jobs that are spread around the country.  It is very hard to get such jobs in certain areas.  I support the takeover by INM.  That is a personal opinion.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses.  We have had a very informative discussion.  The key issue is media ownership and media survival.  Listening to today's contributions, it is evident that media ownership is one thing but whether the media will survive in the future is the key issue.  When one looks at the reduction in sales, which was 65% in recent years, the main issue is if the merger goes ahead, will all the eggs in the media industry will be in the one basket and if that large conglomerate will survive.  That is my question for the witnesses.  I am concerned about the financial viability of the media industry taking into consideration media platforms such as Facebook and Google.  If the merger goes ahead, how will the media conglomerate survive in the future?</p> <p>  Reference was made to the significant losses in the late 2000s.</p><p>Let us consider this proposed purchase, whatever the figure is.  Is INM in a financial position to take on board the new proposal yet stay afloat?  What are its aims?  If an acquisition takes place and if we put all our eggs in one basket, I worry whether that basket be strong enough to support the industry going forward?  There are 98 jobs at stake.  The acquisition must take place as it is the only financial way to ensure these 98 jobs are supported.  I want reassurance from the main undertaker that it has the capabilities and financial supports to ensure that the jobs survive. </p></speech>

It is obvious that the company has and had financial difficulties for a considerable amount of time.  I note that in 2012 there was a management buy-out that involved &euro;5.5 million of capital being put into the company.  I ask the representatives to explain the finances of the company and what other options were considered.  In the light of having examined those options, what is the alternative?  If there is no alternative, does it mean the closure and loss of the titles?</p><p>It is all very fine for the experts here to tell us about what they would like to see and what we should have in terms of plurality.  When it comes to the crunch this is about business, the economics of the business and whether the business can sustain itself.  I am a very strong supporter of provincial media and local titles.  In my own constituency of Tipperary we have three newspapers, namely, the <i>Tipperary Star, The Nenagh Guardian</i>and <i>The Nationalist</i>.  They fulfil a valuable, important and influential role.  The public has a great attachment to the titles and supports them on a week in, week out.  I am also in contact with those people and I understand the precarious financial position they are in and how difficult it is for them to survive.  Every other week they face declining revenue from advertisements.  There has also been a huge drop in sales revenue due to the influence of local radio, digital and online options.</p><p>When it comes down to it, it is about survival.  I would like the editorial independence of provincial groups preserved because it is hugely important to do so.  Like some of my colleagues, I am not overly impressed with the editorial management of some of our national media over the past number of years.  I am very familiar with how the <i>Irish Independent</i>operated under its previous owners and the kind of standards that prevailed within that group at that time.</p><p>I have a few questions for the NUJ.  The interests of its members were mentioned.  Has the NUJ consulted its membership in the local titles to learn their views?  Are they interested in the plurality of the media or in retaining their jobs?  Would they prefer to see their jobs retained under new management or to see the titles lapse and go out of business?</p></speech>

Senator Lombard sought reassurance that jobs will be supported.  Deputy Lowry asked about the state of finances of Celtic Media, what financial options are available and whether the NUJ consulted its membership in local titles.  I call Mr. Mulrennan or Mr. Carey to commence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-07a.220" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Mulrennan" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017020700002#L00400"><p>I will take Deputy Lowry's question on the finances of Celtic Media.  We borrowed &euro;5.5 million in the teeth of recession from Lloyds Bank.  It was a remarkable achievement to secure funding from a Scottish bank for a local newspaper group in rural Ireland.  Dare I say it, we are very good at what we do.  I am very proud of what we do as a management team.  We have paid back a good deal of the loan.  We paid it back in the teeth of a 65% decline in advertising since 2008 and a 35% decline in circulation.<br/><br/>We have looked at other business models.  Deputy Lowry will know that a very fine newspaper in his own area, <i>The Nenagh Guardian</i>, is a very fine client of ours.  We pre-press, which is a fancy name for graphically design, <i>The Nenagh Guardian</i>in Mullingar.  We provide the <i>The Nenagh Guardian</i>, <i>Tuam Herald, Galway Independent, Cork Independent </i>and other fine newspapers with that service.  We do so because the consolidation of services is crucial in order to take costs out of a business, which is not a bad term.  By taking costs out of a business at that level one provides resources to invest in local journalism, whether it is in Tipperary, Wexford or wherever and to invest in local advertising sales. <br/><br/>Did we consider other options?  Yes.  We have rebuilt our business model in Mullingar, of which Senator Davitt will be well aware.  We have between 20 and 24 people employed in Blackhall Place in Mullingar.  They are great people.  They are very loyal colleagues.  I am very gratified that they will make a submission of their own accord to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  They have worked with me and Mr. Carey to rebuild our business model.  However, we cannot row against the digital tide, so my board of directors and I have given strong consideration to the alternatives.  When Independent News and Media approached us, we gave it a very strong hearing because the only future is through digital and marketing, which takes resources.  <br/><br/>I totally get the discussion around media diversity but I will outline the harsh reality of running a business.  I appreciate what Senator Leyden has said.  We have put our Cavan and Navan newspaper offices on the market and we are going to put our Athlone office on the market.  The Cavan premises, located at Station House from which the old Midland Great Western Railway line ran, is a fine building.  Let us be straight about it, we are selling the building to pay a bridging loan because this sale has been so delayed.  I respect the legislation and the democratic process but I run a business and we are incurring substantial delays and costs and the professional fees around this very small deal are shocking, with all due respect to the professional advisers.  <br/><br/>We are talking about a sale which is worth less than &euro;4 million.  When one subtracts professional fees and the money that my company must repay to the bank, we are talking about a lot less than &euro;4 million.  Nobody will escape to the Bahamas and we will turn up to work on the following Monday when this sale takes place.  I urge the committee to please consider the commercial reality of these jobs in rural Ireland.</p></speech>

I ask them to respond to Senator Lombard's who sought reassurance that jobs are supported.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-07a.222" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Pitt" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017020700002#L00600"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I will also address Deputy Stanley's question about the terms and conditions of employees.</p> <p>  In terms of editorial independence, I can say quite categorically that the editorial function within INM stands alone.  It is solely responsible for the views, tone and direction of the paper.  Obviously, there is structure within that function.  We have an editor-in-chief and editors of the national newspapers who reporter to that editor-in-chief.</p><p>We also have specialists within each area.<br/><br/>Regarding our regional newspapers, our regional editors stand completely independently with their titles and do not report into the editors of our national newspapers or to our editor-in-chief.  The local editors are completely responsible for the content in their newspapers.  The only management interaction we have, and Mr. Dooley referred to the fact the editor-in-chief works very closely with me, is to talk about budgets.  We talk about the plan for the finances of the operation going forward.  We also talk about the marketing support that is necessary to allow those newspapers tell their readers about what will be in the newspaper and why they should buy it.  We also plan circulation with them because we have to procure paper, ink and distribution capacity for them.  I can say quite categorically that the function stands, very proudly, alone within our business.  That is the correct way for it to be.  <br/><br/>Regarding plurality or the diversity of content, it is quite clear within Independent News and Media, INM, that there are already very different voices within the newspapers we publish and offer to readers.  Among out national titles, the <i>Sunday World</i>is a very different newspaper from the <i>Sunday Independent</i>in terms of the reader it speaks to, the content it has and the things that are important to people.  Within the newspapers themselves, the <i>Sunday Independent</i>is a very good example of a newspaper that can have very different views, directly opposite each other.  We have, for example, columnists who would be regarded as quite left-wing, championing people who might not be the typical reader of the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  Those are very welcomes voices in that newspaper.<br/><br/>Among our regional newspapers, the editor of a paper in Kerry reports on very different matters and with a very different tone from the editor of a paper in Wexford might do because they are completely different parts of the country with different priorities, and different issues are important to them.  Unemployment, for example, could be very different in one area from another area.  Infrastructure investment is another example.  We can quite safely say that there is already huge diversity within INM and that the newspapers have the freedom to protect that and to maintain their individual voices.  We guarantee that with the transaction to acquire the newspapers of Celtic Media those newspapers will remain independent.  What will happen is that they will achieve the financial security to ensure they can, without fear or favour, write and talk about the things that are important.  I made the point in my presentation that a strong media is very important.  That strong media, however, has to be commercially viable.  That is very important.</p></speech>

We will stand over the conditions they currently have.  On certain issues, we have improved the conditions of employees in Independent News and Media.  There was a pay rise for employees last year, we have invested in training and we have the only Press Association accredited graduate programme for journalists.  We have put an investment fund into university for people as well.  I think we can be quite proud of that.</p></speech>

I will bring in Mr. S&eacute;amus Dooley from the National Union of Journalists on Deputy Lowry's question on consultation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-07a.227" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. S&eacute;amus Dooley" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017020700002#M00500"><p>I will clarify one or two points as well.  While there was a pay rise, there was not pay restoration in Independent News and Media.  Therefore, regarding the pay cuts, which were suffered, pay has not been restored.  It is worth pointing that out.</p> <p>  On Senator Leyden's comments, I would like to make it very clear that my presentation was a considered point and that the notification form allows the committee, the Minister and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, to take into account issues of corporate governance and the failure or otherwise of an applicant to adhere to standards.  The issues of not adhering to agreements with the Pensions Authority and of failure to consult pension trustees are legitimate questions for this committee, the BAI and the Minister under the terms of the notification form.  The Senator may wish it to be otherwise but that is the reality.</p> <p>  On notification of members, yes, we have consulted all the chapels.  The NUJ is rather quaint in that we do not have branches but we have chapels.  Deputy Lowry is an Independent Deputy so only has to agree with himself but no more than in the Rural Independent Group or in any other political party, there are people who have different views but the settled view of our chapels is that we should oppose this.  Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta will deal with the issue of our branches.  We consulted with our members as recently as yesterday.  I am aware that senior members of management have asked our chapels and our individuals to make submissions against the NUJ policy and that they have decided not to do so.  They have been put in a particularly difficult position because the people inviting them to do so are their managers now and will be their managers in the future.  I understand that there is a strong commitment.  </p> <p>  We are all on the one side here.  We absolutely want the newspapers to survive.  To address Deputy Lowry's comments, by no feat of the imagination can I see how the interests of Celtic Media would be served by closure.  I have seen too many business and newspapers close to believe that would be in its best interests.  I have huge admiration for the dexterity and financial acumen of Mr. Pitt and Independent News and Media.  If this were a basket case and if it were not sustainable, I do not believe that it would be being purchased by Independent News and Media.</p></speech>

One of those was two doors from my own business, with the loss of three jobs at the time.  <i>The Athlone Voice</i>, which had a sister newspaper in Mullingar, has also closed within the last couple of years.  There have been quite a few casualties in that industry in my own town.  I know it was alluded to by Deputy Lowry but if this sale does not take place, would titles close?  Would that be something Mr. Mulrennan would have to look at?  Would there be job losses?</p><p>We have heard quite a bit from Mr. Dooley, who I know well.  I respect him and the work he does.  My understanding from talking to several staff members on the ground, and I made it my business to talk to quite a few of the staff in the <i>Westmeath Examiner</i>, is that they seem to be relatively happy with the sale.  They are fearful for their jobs if it does not go through.  How right or wrong that is I do not know but they seem to be fearful if there is not a change or if something does not happen.  That is my reading of it from talking to quite a few of the staff.  Will Mr. Dooley tell the committee how much that was fleshed out with them?  I know he has touched on it but maybe he could elaborate on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-07a.229" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1397" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017020700002#M00700"><p>I thank the Chairman and I welcome the witnesses.  I have five questions and I will put them as succinctly as I can.  The first two are to Mr. Pitt.  They are effectively around concerns which his &quot;future&quot; employees might have.  Could Mr. Pitt have handled the defined benefit scheme changes differently?  Could he have communicated it to his editorial staff differently and was the way he did it arbitrary?  Should that be a concern to staff in future?  Should there be a concern for staff around the closure of the printing works in the<i>Belfast Telegraph</i>?  I do not say this in a derogatory way but it is my understanding that INM was something of an absentee landlord there when it closed the printing works.  I hope Mr. Pitt will correct me if I am wrong but there would be concern there.</p><p>Could I ask Mr. Mulrennan specifically about the sale of the Station House in Cavan town?  Why is it for sale?  I know he has made reference to it.  I would have understood our publication to be a fairly vibrant one.  Is it for sale to bail out other publications, or is there an alternative?  I would like a commitment from Mr. Mulrennan, and from the proposed purchasers, that the whole operation would stay in Cavan.  I understand from informal conversation with staff members in Cavan that they have an expectation that it would but I would like a very public statement that it would stay in Cavan.</p><p>I would like to ask all the witnesses specifically about community news, the legendary coverage of court cases, council meetings, education and training boards and so on.  That is very important to local communities.</p><p>That kind of thing involves a fair concentration of staff and a great deal of effort.  Will there be no diminution of that?  I would not like to see any.  In fact, I would not support anything that involved a diminution of that important service for local communities.  Linked to that is the question of editorial control.  Can I again be assured in that regard?  It would be very remiss of me not to ask.  While we are all parochial to a degree about these things, I am very concerned about the staff of <i>The Anglo-Celt</i>and its excellent journalists and editor.  We have a lovely community of which they are very much a part.  I want to know that the editorial control of the outstanding editor of <i>The Anglo-Celt</i>is in no way diminished.  How is that assured in the deal and what protocols are in place?<br/><br/>Lastly, I address the jobs question.  I mentioned independence, but I also want to know that the jobs in <i>The Anglo-Celt</i>and the other publications to which I referred are safe.  Of course, I mentioned <i>The Anglo-Celt</i>in particular, but one wants the jobs everywhere to survive as they are so important to the fabric of rural Ireland.  To lose 100 jobs in rural Ireland is the equivalent of losing perhaps 1,000 jobs in a large metropolitan area.  They are irreplaceable.  It demoralises a community to lose quality jobs and people.  As such, I want to know that the jobs will stay.  That is why I addressed to Mr. Mulrennan and others earlier the question of location.  I want the jobs to stay on location.  Can the witnesses provide me with assurances around the jobs and what is in the protocols there?<br/><br/>We are all on the same page here.  We want a diverse, pluralistic and good newspaper service which is accessible to everyone.  We want people working on it.  With the greatest respect to those who talk about State subsidisation, when one looked last night at the fact that we have people with scoliosis and spinal difficulties waiting to get operations for a long time, I am not sure we can subsidise newspapers in advance of dealing with that.  That is a question.</p></speech>

I should say that.  There is a side issue in that I have never had the sense that she has ever been under editorial control.  It would not be easy to manage editorial control over the person in question, but it shows some of the good qualities and tradition of the company.</p><p>I regret that Deputy Lowry has left because I want to quote him accurately.  If I recall rightly, he said that when it came to the crunch, it was all about the business model.  My view is that when it comes to the crunch, it is all about what is in the public interest in terms of the House and how we do our work.  For me, the critical issue is cross-media ownership.  The real concern is that in the fire occurring across all our media at the moment, one cannot differentiate between radio, print, broadcasting and, increasingly, digital, which is to say Facebook, Google and others.  The advertising market is combining.  One of the real concerns is that the largest shareholder in INM is also the owner of Communicorp, which has massive radio interests nationally.  As such, I note that it has been widely reported that Mr. Pitt was in a major dispute with his own chairperson in terms of the potential purchase by INM of Newstalk.  There were different views on the valuation of the company.  Can Mr. Pitt confirm that INM was looking to purchase Newstalk and, following a sub-committee process, did not?  It is around the issue of that value where there were significant differences between the management and the chair.  That was widely reported.  A related question is whether INM is still interested or has a potential desire to purchase radio assets as well as the print assets here.  There is real concern about such cross-media ownership.</p><p>My next question is to Mr. Mulrennan whose comments were interesting.  I learned something useful in our own deliberations where it was Celtic Media that was approached.  The business was not on the market and a sales process had not been started.  When did INM approach Celtic Media and what was the nature of the approach?  Obviously, Mr. Mulrennan runs a good business.  I take on board what he said about his staff and management.  From everything I hear from local representatives, these are very good titles.  However, it colours our consideration that the business was not for sale.  Someone approached the business seeking to purchase it.  That casts a certain light on what we have to do under the Act.  Our timelines are very tight and one wishes one had more time for deliberations.  When was Celtic Media approached?</p><p>Can Mr. Pitt confirm if the reports of significant disputes within INM on the valuation of media were correct?  Was the reporting accurate?  Does INM still have ambitions to purchase other radio stations or media titles as well as the one here today?</p></speech>

INM considered the purchase of Newstalk based on an approach to the business from Communicorp.  We looked at it.  There were different opinions on the value that could be attributed to an asset like that.  We came to the conclusion that we could not reach agreement and since then we have closed down the matter and are no longer looking at radio assets in the island of Ireland.  I trust that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

It would be very arrogant of me to say that we could not.  Obviously, one can always do things better.  Unfortunately, we were constrained in this situation by the legal structure that exists around pension schemes.  We think we did the best we could at the time to handle what is a very difficult issue which has concerns for and an impact on the people.  At the moment, we are still in discussions with the trustees of the pension schemes affected.  We are being very open with them and putting suggestions to them.  We are trying to reach an agreement which will then allow us to bring clarity to each member of the pension schemes regarding the change and what it means for them.  Personally, I understand the Senator's question.  It is a very big change in one's life to hear this and I would always try-----</p></speech>

I have always responded to every single one of them.  I understand their concerns.  We are trying as hard as we can to address that.  In the circumstances, we did the best we could.  One always learns.</p> <p>  I was asked about concern around the BT printing plant.  It was remarked that I was an absentee landlord there.  I assure the committee that the announcement to all the staff that the plant was going to shut down was made by me.  I went up there.  I then attended weekly meetings with the unions to help them understand what process was going on there.  I visit our Northern Ireland business very often.  The major part of the question was whether there was any risk to our other printing plants or printing plants in general.  We have no plans at the moment to divest of any other printing plants in Ireland.  Actually, printing plants are quite busy in the evening time at the moment.  It is driven by the daily papers and the slots that one needs to get through them.  The capacity since Royal Avenue closed down means that there is no need for that question for quite a few years.  To clarify, Celtic Media's printing plant will continue to print the newspapers we are buying.  We are not buying the printing plant, but the jobs are protected because we are leaving those contracts in the plant which will remain in other hands.</p></speech>

I think Deputy Ryan asked a question also.</p></speech>

In Mullingar, we have a very fine competitor in the Topic group.  The owner will not mind me saying we have agreed that we are not really each other's competitors any more but are both in the survival business.</p><p>We are both challenged by the decline in advertising and circulation.  Journalists and editors bring it out each week.  It is hammer and tongs between both papers, but it is a survival business for both.  <br/><br/>I see that Deputy Shane Cassells is in the Visitors' Gallery.  There is a very fine newspaper going to bed at the moment called <i>Forum</i>.  It is a free newspaper in the Dunshaughlin, Ratoath and Ashbourne areas.  We are having serious misgivings over the continued publication of our free newspaper there.  I have already alerted the editor and the sales people involved.  We cannot continue with a loss-making newspaper, so if this sale does not go ahead I would say to Senator Davitt that the huge amount of work that we as a collective - I am talking about the 98 great people in our company - have done, will have been eroded.  Unfortunately - and I say this with due regard to my colleagues - there will be a return to the redundancies that we had to do in 2015.<br/><br/>Many years ago, S&eacute;amus Dooley and I worked together in national papers.  I was a member of the NUJ myself for 18 years.  In our own company we got full co-operation from journalists, sales people and right across the board in 2012 and in 2015.  That is because I present to them regularly.  There is never any shortage of information in our company and they know how difficult it is.<br/><br/>Senator O'Reilly will know from attending business and sports awards where I speak, that I steal a little bit from Carlsberg.  I say that the <i>Anglo-Celt </i>is probably the best local newspaper in the country.  I thank the Senator for his comments about it.  I can confirm that the <i>Anglo-Celt</i>will continue to be published from Station House.  Under the sale transaction with INM, the newspaper will effectively become a tenant of Station House when it is sold.  I am not used to divulging commercially sensitive information because we are a small company.  We run our own gig with all due respects, but I have told the committee that Station House is being sold to pay a bridging loan.  I can be no more honest than that.<br/><br/>The editor of the <i>Anglo-Celt</i>, Linda O'Reilly, is busily putting her paper to bed.  As regards editorial control, in the ten years I have worked with Linda, I have never interfered or dictated what should be in the <i>Anglo-Celt</i>.  Senator O'Reilly knows the reason why.  I do not live in Cavan and, truth be told, I do not really know the Cavan issues.  I might be a former journalist, but the business of running that newspaper editorially is that of the editor. <br/><br/>As regards jobs in the <i>Anglo-Celt</i>, the committee has heard the guarantees.  There are 14 employees in the <i>Anglo-Celt</i>, which are all either involved in news generation in our newsroom - and we have terrific journalists there - or in advertising sales.  As a former journalist I used to think that was the commercial, crass side of the business, but without advertising sales there would be no business.<br/><br/>To take Deputy Eamon Ryan's question, Dublin is a small city and Ireland is a small country.  We went through a painful redundancy process in 2015, which was particularly painful for those colleagues who lost their jobs.  I dealt with each of those individually because I genuinely care about the jobs of the people who are leaving and of those who are staying in our company.  Yes, we were approached by INM but it did not take a genius to realise that even though Celtic Media is a very well run company, we are in an industry which is seriously challenged.  An approach was made and it was dealt with very efficiently.  Robert Pitt is a gentleman to deal with and what more can I say.</p></speech>

That is precisely my point.  It was on a publicly-funded broadcaster which, specifically since the 2009 Broadcasting Act, has to separate out its spending from commercial revenue and public funding.  The public funding goes to news and current affairs, which facilitates precisely that kind of investigative work.  That is why I am promoting the idea that if we take the news and current affairs function of our media seriously, we can no longer rely on a model which the gentlemen behind me have described as dead.</p></speech>

Mr. Mulrennan said that his industry is seriously challenged.  I would like him to comment on my argument.  I think his industry is seriously challenged precisely by the likes of INM who gobble up all of the outlets in digital, broadcast and print media.  Of course he is going to be challenged by a giant of this nature.  At the beginning, somebody made the point that this forum is not about the business model which is at stake here, but rather about examining the plurality of the media and the role of this committee in protecting the interests of the media within our democracy.  Nevertheless, I do think that Mr. Mulrennan has failed to prove to us that his business model is a basket case, as S&eacute;amus Dooley said.  Mr. Mulrennan may feel he is under threat in future, but if it was a basket case why would INM be interested in purchasing it and taking it over?</p> <p>  Mr. Mulrennan also mentioned that there is considerable noise about this takeover.  I am glad there is because one of the academics pointed out to us that between 1995 and 2008 there have been 90 mergers in the media with no scrutiny.  It is therefore about time that the people who are elected to protect democracy scrutinised these mergers and looked at what is going on.  Perhaps it is because we have new legislation that we are discussing it today, but we certainly had to fight tooth and nail for open scrutiny on this issue.  </p> <p>  Earlier, Professor Colum Kenny expressed concern at the presence of Deputy Lowry.  Believe me, I am also very concerned about that.  I do think there is a conflict of interest.  In private session we had quite a debate and an argument about whether he should be asked to absent himself from this process.  Nevertheless-----</p></speech>

I am just agreeing with Professor Kenny.  I would rather state my opinion and then ask him the following question.  At any point during Professor Kenny's own career, was he conflicted by the ownership of the media outlet that he worked for, in terms of stuff that he wanted to write, say or edit?  If he does not want to answer that is fine, but was there any challenge to him in his career by the ownership of the <i>Sunday Independent</i>or anybody within that group?</p><p>We should be looking at everything to do with the plurality of the media here today.  In some cases, there are so many fingers in so many pies that there is bound to be a conflict of interest.  If I was a journalist and, for example, I was worried about the activities of Siteserv within the creation of Irish Water and their role within that, and I wanted to write something about it and I worked for certain outlets, I might be very concerned.  I might ask myself: &quot;Do I want to travel up the structure in this media outlet?  If I do, am I able to make these criticisms?&quot;  I would like the academics to comment on that point.</p><p>On the substantive issue, Independent News and Media is being seen as the saviour of the Celtic Media group.  I absolutely believe Mr. Mulrennan and Mr. Tadhg Carey whom I know from the past.  I know they are really concerned about the workforce and workers' conditions, so they should be really concerned that their workers are going to be taken over by that group.</p><p>I am concerned they will be taken over by a group which will savage the pension entitlements of workers by reducing them by 70%, bringing pensions down to an unlivable scale within a matter of a couple of years.  Is there not extreme concern that it will, in turn, savage the workers' rights and entitlements within that context?  If Celtic Media thinks local media is threatened by the proliferation of advertising moving to digital and social media, how does it think Independent News and Media will guarantee its long-term survival?  It seems to me the move by Independent News and Media to take over Celtic Media is to allow it to start returning dividends to some of its owners.  Some of the richest people on the planet want more dividends from media ownership in this country.  It is not just about avoiding more losses; it is also returning more profits.  I would like a comment on that and also a comment from the National Union of Journalists, NUJ.</p></speech>

The whole issue of plurality of media is very interesting and very timely as is the debate we are having.  I think the world stands at a new juncture in terms of how we consume and disseminate news, fake news and these kinds of phenomena.  It is all the more important we have this debate and that independent quality journalism is respected and supported.  I also note that one of the academic witnesses made a comment, which I thought was very interesting and relevant, that the press is no longer just a check on government but a check on public, private and corporate interests.</p><p>To summarise the debate, we heard the editorial and academic view against the merger and the raising of concerns.  We also heard commercial arguments presented in favour of it.  It strikes me as both a marriage of convenience but also a loveless romance.  In fact, there is an air of the Shakespearean tragedy if I can say that Celtic Media is the poor hapless Juliet and the all powerful INM is Romeo but perhaps that is only in the absence of any other suitor, rather than falling for Romeo in this case.  I  would like to put two questions to Mr. Mulrennan.  My colleague, Senator Davitt, asked whether there would be job cuts or potentially media title closures if the merger did not go ahead but I want to ask that question in the context of the merger going ahead.  Will there be job cuts or potentially media title closures if the merger does not go ahead or if it goes ahead?  I would be very interested in that.</p><p>My remaining questions and comments are directed to Mr. Pitt.  He is ultimately the man at the top of the tree if this all goes ahead.  I think it is fair to say that we can predict the future best by studying the past and in that context it is informative to look at INM to date and the operation of the four titles under its remit, certainly the four national titles.  Mr. S&eacute;amus Dooley of the NUJ has mentioned the outsourcing of INM production to Yorkshire.  It is also a concern.  In terms of the four titles, the<i>Irish Independent</i>, the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, the <i>Sunday World</i>and <i>The Herald</i>, what kind of cutbacks have been experienced at those newspapers to date?  What kind of operational management is there for resources and spread of resources?  Is there overlap of resources between titles?  Does this make it more difficult to get a newspaper out every day?  Has quality suffered as a result of this and how is that management chain working out in terms of resources as opposed to the product, which ultimately is independent quality journalism?  Is that coming under threat, even within the existing titles?</p><p>I ask Mr. Pitt not to take any offence at this but I listened to the other witnesses and I know a bit about his background.  It struck me that he is the only man who is not a newspaper man as such, certainly among the witnesses.  His background, as I understand, is in discount retail.  I know there is a certain pile them high and sell them cheap approach in that type of business, which I would suggest is probably not the same as the media world.  I notice that Mr. Pitt's comments were very much commercial in nature when he talked about the merger.  As a CEO, that is par for the course and is expected.  I would just stress the point and ask how he reconciles that with the needs of this type of business, which is much more than a business and is a standard bearer for democracy.</p><p>In terms of the merger and this not being a commercial product but something so much more than that, how will editorial independence be guaranteed?  What scope will there be for editorial control in local publications?  I mean that both in terms of management intention and direction but also in terms of resources.  Will we see a situation where the editorial clusters?  For example, some titles will pool.  Mr. Mulrennan already spoke about some titles having one editor over two or three publications.  I have seen that happen.  As a practising politician, I deal with local newspapers all the time.  I do not think that model works as it dilutes the proximity to the ground, which is so important for a local publication, so there are huge concerns around that.</p><p>Local newspapers are paramount and are very important to their local communities, as Mr. Mulrennan and Mr. Carey have very eloquently put it.  This kind of cost-cutting approach, including supply chain procurement and logistical management, is a different type of world from the world of local independent newspapers and I ask how those items would be reconciled.</p></speech>

INM has no local titles in our areas.  That was one of the factors that very much impressed the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  Therefore, INM titles did not make life in any way difficult for us.  In fact, through Local Ireland, which is the representative body, we are very supportive of each other in terms of marketing the strength of a local newspaper brand.  INM sits on that along with landmark and iconic newspapers, including the <i>Tuam Herald</i>and <i>The Nenagh Guardian</i>, and ourselves.  There are strengths to it.  There is tremendous loyalty.  The Deputy may have heard about a newspaper that goes back to 1846.  There is tremendous brand strength but the business dynamic is seriously challenged.<br/><br/>INM has not been our problem.  RTE is a bigger problem, in truth.  This committee often deals with broadcasting and communications.  We are finding it awfully hard to make any sort of money from digital because of, for example, a State-subsidised website.  The <i>Westmeath Independent</i>has terrific web traffic for the relatively small newspaper it is.  The <i>Meath Chronicle</i>has probably one of the best trafficked websites and Facebook reach of any newspaper in the country but it is so hard to make money from them because we are competing against Facebook and Google and possibly RTE.<br/><br/>Is it a basket case?  Those were not my words but that the business model is broken.  I have a responsibility to do whatever I can to rebuild that business model and to secure the jobs of the people I work with.  A two thirds decline in advertising and a one third decline in circulation is a huge pressure.  They are our only two cogent sources of revenue because digital is not a great source of revenue.  It is a cost.  I regret the fact that since January, we have halved our investment in digital.  Mr. Carey is actively annoyed with me for that but we have to pull in our cost reins.  The longer this sale goes on, the more things like that I am going to have to do.<br/><br/>I was asked why INM would want to acquire, which is a horrible word, or get involved with Celtic Media newspapers if it is a challenged business model.  The only future for newspapers in this country is through us aggregating our digital strengths.  That is going to take investment.  In many ways, yes, we have great brands.  The <i>Westmeath Examiner</i>goes back to 1882.  <i>The Anglo-Celt</i>goes back to 1846.  The <i>Connaught Telegraph</i>, a newspaper we bought out of liquidation in 2014, when we saved 12 jobs, goes back to 1828.  This is not Romeo and Juliet stuff, with respect.  This is cold commercial reality.</p><p>Independent News and Media needs to extend a digital footprint, which is very important because we need resources to invest in digital services.  We also need marketing resources because we are not spending on marketing.  We have great brands but we are not spending on them.  Far from being a Romeo and Juliet story, this is a matter of survival.  </p><p> On the issue of pensions, which was raised by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, there is no pension issue in the Celtic Media Group or Celtic Media Newspapers.  A defined contribution scheme has been in place in the company for a number of years.  Pension schemes are challenged from time to time but we are far removed from the other issues that have been raised.  We have our own pension scheme in place.  </p></speech>

I had no knowledge of the Celtic Media Group's pension scheme.  Given that Mr. Mulrennan and Mr. Carey have expressed considerable concern about the future of the workforce in the group, why on earth would they trust a company such as Independent News and Media to treat the workforce with respect and diligence when it has only recently savaged the pensions of workers who made a substantial contribution to their pensions throughout their careers and will receive only a tiny proportion of what they paid for and expected to receive from their pensions?  I cited that case as an example of how INM treats workers.</p></speech>

The company has a proud track record.  We make decisions with what we have and we make the right decisions for the people with whom we work.  The deal, transaction, sale or acquisition - call it what one will - with Independent News and Media is supported by my editors and management team and the staff throughout the company.  On my way to this meeting which is, as the Deputy stated, a very worthwhile exercise, I received a call from a relatively new recruit employed in our pre-press area in Mullingar to wish me the best of luck.  I know Mr. Dooley did not mean a certain comment in a particular way.  We are a small company and I know everyone who works in it.  I will be in Mullingar tomorrow.  While I have great regard for the role of company representatives, we talk and there is no cajoling.  This is a free country.</p></speech>

The way we produce newspapers will change and we will have to consolidate many of the back office functions.  These functions do not influence the tone or editorial voice of a newspaper and it was these that moved to York following our decision.  Unfortunately, there is no similar facility in Ireland to which we could have moved.  If there had been such a facility, we would have given it serious consideration and if such a facility were to open here, we would like to have these jobs back in Ireland.  As I pointed out, INM employs 800 people, all of whom are located on the island of Ireland, and all of our business is on the island of Ireland.  We are an Irish business.<br/><br/>Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith described Independent News and Media as a &quot;giant&quot;.  INM is very small compared with other media businesses operating in this country, for example, News UK and Daily Mail and General Trust, DMGT.  We do our best to fight our corner and ensure there is a strong Irish voice in the Irish media.  This sometimes means taking difficult decisions but that is the job with which I am charged and a challenge I need to face.  <br/><br/>Deputy Lawless asked me a question on my background in retail.  I am very proud to have worked in retail for Lidl and Tesco.  I worked with diligent, hard-working people who care in retail and, to be honest, I found very similar people in my current company.  What we in retail bring is not only expertise in supply chain and cost-cutting but a focus on the customer or, in the case of newspapers, the reader.  One can do this by asking how we can make people buy more newspapers.  If one looks at the performance of INM newspapers, we are beating market trends, outperforming others and doing very well.<br/><br/>I also brought a sense of realism to where we are.  The deal under which we print newspapers in <i>The Irish Times</i>owned printing plant and <i>The Irish Times</i>allows us to distribute its newspaper was of mutual benefit and an example of people being very practical.  There are major questions facing the newspaper industry and we need to figure out how to ensure we still have newspapers in ten or 15 years time.  We can and will do this if we are all pragmatic about how we protect the quality of newspapers and if we ensure they remain independent and their content is relevant.  The most important issue is that if newspapers are not relevant and the content is not trusted, people will stop buying them, which will hasten the current trends.  I believe my previous experience has brought something to this. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-07a.260" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Colum Kenny" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017020700002#Q00500"><p>I will answer Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's questions and address a sideswipe that was made at the experts by another member.  Deputy Smith asked about pressures in news organisations.  It is absolutely correct that there are pressures in every news organisation.  Deputy Stanley put it best when he stated we know that he who pays the piper calls the tune.  Every day, journalists come across all kinds of pressures.  They face the pressure of threatened legal action, which is a real difficulty in Ireland when it comes to telling the truth, and there are also pressures from owners and ideological pressures.  Over the years, I have written for the <i>Irish Press </i>Group, the <i>Irish Independent</i>and <i>The Irish Times</i>and I have worked in RTE.  There are constant pressures, which is precisely the reason committees such as this one need to fight to protect the media and media diversity and plurality and make media places where we can hear different voices.<br/><br/>Before he left the meeting, Deputy Michael Lowry stated it was all very well for the experts.  We know what that phrase means; it means experts are not realistic and are academics with their heads in the clouds.  There is nothing more realistic than the issues of diversity and plurality in the media.  These issues have an economic value to the country.  If a country does not have free, vibrant and authentic media, people will not hear the stories that need to be told, whether they are about the banking crisis or the issues that gave rise to the Moriarty tribunal.  The reason one needs diverse and plural media is that this is of real economic benefit.<br/><br/>With due respect, Senator Terry Leyden is here to ask about more issues than he seems to believe because that is what the Act requires.  Under the Act, the indicators of plurality are set out in a formal notification on mergers and acquisitions pursuant to Part 3A of the Competition Act, as amended.  The guidelines make clear that these issues must be addressed.<br/><br/>I have absolute sympathy with Celtic Media and its employees.  My colleagues and I know the economic realities of the workplace.  We have seen students leaving the country because there are no jobs here and we see others entering employment with precarious working conditions in which they are exploited, an issue about which Deputy Stanley spoke.  When working conditions are such that people do not receive proper contracts from organisations such as INM and other media organisations, including RTE, they cannot feel free to do they type of things members want them to do.  This is the reality for working people, not a theory.  Having a gun held to one's head and being told to agree to this merger or jobs will be lost is a very real consideration.  However, other considerations must also be taken into account, which is the reason we have competition regulation and media mergers legislation.  These are just as real, concrete and authentic as other considerations, which is the reason the European Union refers to concrete indicators of plurality.  </p></speech>

For the purpose of linguistic and gender balance I will also ask Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta to elaborate on it.  We have consulted and Ms N&iacute; Fhlatharta will explain our research in that regard.  I know Senator Davitt is concerned over why members of the union would oppose something that on the face of it looks good.  Much of this comes down to the old dictum of "Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me."  The experience of recent developments in Independent News and Media give people pause for thought.</p> <p>  We work very closely with Mr. Mulrennan and Mr. Pitt.  I have called him many things in the past but never an absentee landlord.  We will continue that relationship.  We have a concern over how outsourcing happened and how this acquisition was announced overnight on Twitter.  Trustees of the pension scheme were not consulted.  It was a breach of the Pensions Act.  The chair of the trustees, who is also the company secretary, has described it as something that is neither morally nor legally justified.  On that basis there is a concern about this purchase.</p> <p>  Some of what has been said today and some of the assurances may give people pause for thought and reflection.  I have no doubt people will consider some commitments that have been given.  However, they will have to weigh those against the track record of the proposed purchaser in honouring or not honouring previous commitments.</p></speech>

These concerns are based on the experience of their union colleagues in other titles involved in previous mergers and relate to cross-advertising rates, sharing of copy and images.

If INM does not sell newspapers it will not have a newspaper.  The point is that circulation is not the only metric and may not even be the most important metric; it is one of many.  That point is paramount and relates to editorial control.  One person runs the business and someone else runs the editorial team.</p> <p>  I have a question on the existing titles and the casualisation of labour.  Journalists, photographers and digital staff may be multi-rostered.  To what extent has that affected the existing INM titles resulting in job-sharing, people being on casual contracts, cutbacks and perhaps even redundancies?  To what extent can we use that to predict what might happen in the new entity if the merger goes ahead?  That is a concern.</p></speech>

I am very glad he brought it back to the quality of jobs.  This cannot be a last-man-standing argument.  One must enjoy working in a newspaper; it is a vocation as can be seen particularly with the journalists who write for a newspaper.  Professor Kenny said it is difficult for young people to come into this industry.  We hired 12 graduates, fully paid, on a two-year programme and they are still with INM at the moment.  That was a huge investment in a very distressed business.  That is because we understand the need for a pipeline of young people who want to work in newspapers, who want to write copy, who want to take photographs and so forth.</p> <p>  I agree with Professor Kenny on the challenges the industry faces.  We are trying to address them and create quality jobs.  We improved the maternity benefits for people in INM from three weeks to 24 weeks last year to better allow people with a young family to be able to continue their career.  This is alongside all the other things we do in terms of reorganising the business.  Some of them can seem harsh, but they are decisions that somebody has to take and I will take those decisions.  However, we cannot sacrifice quality, which, as I understand from my retail experience, is paramount.  We have to provide something that people want to buy or transact with; and we have that in INM.  Of course, when we make changes to how we produce a newspaper and make changes to the volumes of content, we have to make some kind of value decision based on what the person gets and so forth.  We, in INM, have been very balanced on that.</p></speech>

The Senator is correct that informing people of those key elements of local democracy is a crucial part of the make-up and future of local journalism.  Having said that, with the reduced number of journalists available to editors - I am sure every editor will empathise with this - there are always tough choices to be made in the allocation of staff and deciding the events to cover.  Courts and local government represent a key element of any respectable local newspaper.<br/><br/>I will give a sense of the challenges that face me in a practical sense in my local area.  The <i>Westmeath Independent</i>is based in Athlone.  As members will know, Athlone is a split town between Westmeath and Roscommon.  Offaly is six miles away with Longford about eight miles away.  We also circulate in Ballinasloe in County Galway.  That is a fairly diverse territory for coverage of local authorities.  The fragmentation of the local government system can be added into the mix.  Nowadays we have county councils, municipal districts, strategic policy committees etc.  I do not need to tell members about those; they are well aware of those demands on their colleagues on the local authorities.  That, obviously, increases the demands on local newspapers.<br/><br/>Our readers consume increasing amounts of content on mobile phones and laptops and they want that content provided instantaneously or at least as quickly as possible.  That is another challenge to add into the mix.  One of the most successful digital offerings in which my newspaper was involved was the coverage of a controversy over an installation in an art gallery in Athlone.  We covered a meeting through Twitter and Facebook and we had a huge audience.  We need to do more of that sort of thing.  That is why the digital strength that INM can give to us is important to me, as an editor.</p></speech>

It was a pity that the Taoiseach recently seemed to throw out the idea of a commission to look at the future of the media in Ireland.</p><p>When listening to the debate and discussion here one is asked to consider an incredibly complex thing.  It is not only about saving jobs.  It is also about diversity of media, cross-media ownership, the future of the media, advertising and social media.  All of these things are in the pot and we are just touching them slightly as it suits whatever argument we might all be making.  It is probably time, as Dr. Flynn mentioned, for an inquiry.  I remember the last inquiry because I covered it for <i>The Irish Times</i>.  It was in 1995, around the time the <i>Irish Press</i>collapsed.  It was a different world.  Given the issues that we are discussing here today there should be something far more all-encompassing and far more subtle that will look at how we, as a society, are going to carry on having a healthy democracy with a vibrant media that can fulfil the function  it is meant to fulfil.</p></speech>

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise witnesses that the opening submissions and statements they have provided us with will be published on the committee website following this meeting.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I thank the witnesses for the written submissions we received.  We will ask one person from each organisation to make an opening statement of between two to three minutes.  </p></speech>

The Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools, ACCS, is the management body representing 96 post-primary schools in Ireland.  Of those post-primary schools, 14 are comprehensive schools and 82 are community schools.  There is a slight difference between both.  Comprehensive schools are designated as either Protestant or Catholic comprehensive schools.  All of our schools are joint patronage.  The majority of community schools have a religious trustee and an education and training board, ETB, as a trustee.  The latest two community schools to open have an ETB and Educate Together as trustees.  The model is a community-led management structure which involves representation from within the staff, the community itself and the trustees who form the schools.</p> <p>  By their nature, all community schools are multidenominational.  We encourage all schools to have open and transparent admissions policies.  The problem that is arising, which is described in this admissions Bill, would affect some of our comprehensive schools but would really only apply where there is over-subscription within the schools, which represents a small proportion of the schools nationally.  Some comprehensive schools will have religion as a criterion for priority on initial enrolment but none of the community schools will have it as a criterion of enrolment.  The schools aim to meet the needs of the entire community.  One will find, as was shown in the ESRI research from 2013, that the main criterion for people being involved in our schools is the locality in which they lived.  That was the first criterion of choice of parents when they were asked.  The main reason parents were selecting particular schools was the quality of the school over any other factor.  It was the key factor.  Religion was quite low in the pecking order for most of the schools as a reason for selecting the particular type of school.  The ESRI report from 2013 would indicate that this seems to be across the board and that it was a very strong aspect for some people in selection of school but was not predominant across all schools.  </p> <p>  There is a rural-urban divide here.  Very often in rural primary and post-primary schools, over-subscription is not the same issue as is occurring in some of the larger urban areas.  In those areas, our schools accept all students of their community.  The ACCS very much supports the objectives of the Bill in respect of bringing transparency and clarity to the area of admissions and is strongly supportive of the Bill.  Our aim is to try to meet the needs of all students in the community.  There is a statement within the deed of trust in all community schools that two hours of religious education is provided for.</p><p>There is also a statement that parents or a student over the age of 18 may withdraw.  For community schools, we would be quite supportive of the idea that in any future admissions policy, there would be an explicit statement as to what the provision would be for all students in that particular category.  We do feel that it may have potential resource implications, obviously, and alternatives would have to be considered.  I do not think recreation or study is necessarily the preferred option.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-07a.294" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Mulconry" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017020700002#D00300"><p>My name is Seamus Mulconry and I am the general secretary of the Catholic Primary Schools Management Association.  I am joined today by my colleague, Ms Miriam McCabe, one of our education advisers and a principal with 24 years teaching experience, 15 of those as the principal of a school in Oldcastle, County Meath.  We are the support organisation for over 2,800 schools and almost 23,000 members of boards of management.  We provide advice to schools on a wide range of issues, ranging from admissions to HR, finance, parental complaints, bullying and the myriad of other issues faced by schools.  We also provide training to boards of management and last year held 33 training sessions.  We represent boards in discussions with the Department of Education and Skills and other stakeholders.</p> <p>  There are three fundamental points I would like to make about the legislation before us.  We have been invited here to comment on the Equal Status (Admissions to Schools) Bill 2016.  The first fundamental point I want to make on this issue is that no Catholic school wishes to exclude any child from the benefits of a Catholic education.  In almost 95% of our schools, we take everyone who applies.  Our schools are welcoming and diverse, dedicated to the full development of the child and not to indoctrination.  The school that my child attends is a pretty good example.  It basically reflects the geographical area in which it is situated.  It takes everyone and all comers.</p> <p>  The second point is that the difficulties schools, parents and pupils face are really about resources and not religion.  There is a growing issue of oversubscription found mainly in the Dublin area and the commuter belt, such as Meath and Kildare, but that sometimes flares up in other locations.  We have been looking at this issue for a while.  Last year, we identified about 21 schools in the greater Dublin area in which there were problems with oversubscription.  This year we have identified 42.  In 17 of those schools, there was an issue with baptism.  That equates to about 1.2% of rejected applications.  I will give the committee the figures.  There were approximately 26,968 applications to Catholic primary schools that completed a survey for us.  Of these, 19,218 were successful.  Of the remainder, only 1.2% were unsuccessful due to an issue with a baptismal cert.  The key point I am making is that this issue is really about a lack of school places in some geographical locations.  The Bill before us is an admissions Bill.  It will not add one school place.  It will not solve the problem.  The fundamental issue I would point out is resources.  We need to investigate what is really going on in terms of oversubscription.  We need to identify where extra school places are needed and put them in as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>  The Bill itself is a little bit unclear.  It does not define the catchment area, which is core to what the Bill is about, nor does it define how a school can prove that it has taken in sufficient numbers of its own denomination to prove that it has satisfied local need.  These are two big areas.  We have a real concern that if the Bill goes through, it will not solve the problems we are facing but could create a field day for lawyers who would have a merry time trying to figure out loopholes and could pit schools against each other.  If schools are allowed to define their catchment areas, there is nothing to say that catchment areas could not overlap.  For this reason, we believe the Bill is premature and we urge the committee to investigate what is going on with oversubscription in the greater Dublin area.</p></speech>

We represent the Church of Ireland Board of Education, the primary school management advisory service for 197 primary schools under ten Church of Ireland patrons, as well as Presbyterian, Methodist and Quaker Society of Friends schools.  There are a further 25 post-primary schools under Church of Ireland and wider Protestant management and patronage.  I am joined by Ms Linda Rainsberry, chair of the board of governors of Kilkenny College. Â Kilkenny College is a voluntary secondary school in the free scheme which serves the Church of Ireland and Protestant population in nine counties in the south east.  Ms Rainsberry will be happy to speak to the committee about how a restrictive regulation on catchment areas would affect a Protestant boarding school serving practically all of Leinster outside Dublin.  </p> <p>  The committee will be aware that there are three separate matters to do with school admissions in train - the Bill brought forward by Deputy Joan Burton and the Labour Party, the Education (Admissions to School) Bill 2016 and the consultation process on school admissions with the Department for Education and Skills.  We note that section 61(2)(b) of the Education (Admissions to School) Bill 2016 contains a specific reference to section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act 2000. This Bill seems to link the religious denominational criteria with the school catchment area but without reference to the Education (Admissions to School) Bill 2016 and neither is being considered in the context of the ongoing consultation process with the Department for Education and Skills that has as one of the options amendment of section 7 (3)(c) of the Equal Status Act 2000.  In her comments to the D&aacute;il in introducing this Bill I notice that Deputy Joan Burton made reference to the importance of the prioritisation of and the derogation in section 7(3)(c) of the Equal Status Act 2000 for the Church of Ireland community.  I thank her for that reference.  Of course, none of the proposed changes, as Mr. Mulconry said, would add one school place in the education system or address the reality that the issue of oversubscription arises as a result of the shortage of school places.  The other reality is that by law all children must go to school.  I suggest to the committee that the National Educational Welfare Board and Tusla are best placed to advise it on the numbers of children not in school on 30Â September in any given year which would give it a picture on oversubscription.Â </p> <p>  I again thank the Chairman and members for inviting us.  As I mentioned, my colleague, Ms Rainsberry, is available to provide further more detailed information on how catchment area restrictions would affect one of our 25 second level schools which also happens to be a boarding school.</p></speech>

According to the 2011 census, there were almost 50,000 Muslims living in Ireland, including over 8,000 children in primary schools and 3,500 in secondary schools.  The vast majority of these children attend local schools, but in recent years parents have found it increasingly difficult to obtain school places for their children, particularly in the secondary sector.</p> <p>  The current estimate of the Muslim population in Ireland is approximately 65,000, which represents an increase of almost 30% since 2011.  This is an indicator that the numbers of Muslim children entering the education system are growing very rapidly.  Parents have encountered a number of problems at the point of admission to schools.  They include the requirement to have a baptismal certificate.  Anecdotal evidence indicates that many non-practising Catholic parents, people of no faith, as well as Muslim parents, face the same obstacle.  While other parents can, if they so wish, obtain a baptismal certificate, this is not an option for Muslims.  From the outset it is an obstacle for the Muslim community.  </p> <p>  The current admission policy may also ignore local catchment areas in preference of admitting children of a particular faith.  Under the current system, schools have refused Muslim children from feeder schools, siblings who have established links with the school and children in local catchment areas, citing school admission policies that prioritise the children of one faith over another.  The situation is that the majority of schools in Ireland have a Catholic ethos, leaving Muslim children at the mercy of admission policies that seriously curtail parental and student choice.  Many Muslim parents, especially from newer communities, are unfamiliar with the Irish education system which causes additional barriers in understanding varied and unclear admission policies.</p><p> The implications of the policy are the imposition of seriously limited choice for parents and students and inequality of access to education, which may lead to long-term implications with regard to the exclusion of Muslims in Ireland from social, economic and civic engagement.  A number of psychological reports indicate a link between educational achievement and a child's sense of belonging.  A feeling of being excluded or unwanted is not conducive to integration or a child's well-being.  Those schools with a more open admission policy, which we welcome, are left to cater for large groups of Muslim students, instead of integration being encouraged throughout the school system.</p><p> The Minister's recent proposals contain some elements which the Muslim Primary Education Board would support.  The removal of the baptismal requirement would allow a more equitable basis of admission and the establishment of catchment areas allowing Muslim students to attend their local schools.  When children from the same locality attend school together it creates a bond, strengthens local communities and encourages religious diversity and cultural tolerance.  It would also prohibit the practice of maintaining an ethos by preferring children from outside a catchment area.  The maintenance of a school's ethos should not be based on 100% of the student population being of one faith.  Rather, it needs to reflect the diversity in Irish society.  An admission policy should safeguard and respect the child's rights to religious practice.</p><p> We would like to clearly state that parents and students should have a choice with regard to religious and non-religious education.  To ignore the religious ethos of any school as a blanket policy is not a strategy we would support.  We firmly believe the way forward in education should be to seek a balance between ethos and diversity.  A school community should reflect wider society in its pupil cohort and its staff.</p></speech>

I invite Mr. Curtis of the Joint Management Body, JMB, to address the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-07a.310" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Curtis" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017020700002#F00500"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation.  Committee members will be glad to know I will not go through what we submitted in full detail.  I will give an abridged version and take questions afterwards.  I am conscious everybody has a copy of our submission.  I am joined by my colleague, the president of the Joint Management Body, Fr. Paul Connell.</p> <p>  The JMB was founded in 1972 to represent the interests of all voluntary secondary schools in the Republic of Ireland.  It is the main decision-making and negotiating body for the management authorities of almost 380 voluntary secondary schools.  The JMB comprises two founding organisations, namely, the Association of Management of Catholic Secondary Schools, AMCSS, and the Irish School Heads' Association, ISA, which represents Protestant schools in the State.</p> <p>  With a combined enrolment of more than 185,000 students, admission policies and practices in voluntary secondary schools can only be described as inclusive, compliant and, essentially, unproblematic.  It is the position of the JMB that the results of the Department's audit of enrolment policies in 2008, indicating no evidence of any system-wide enrolment practices that give rise to concern, should inform the present consideration, and the high levels of integrity with which our schools have been exercising their responsibilities should be acknowledged.  Only 20% of our schools are oversubscribed.  The JMB believes the existing system works well, with relatively few section 29 appeals against refusal to enrol each year, of which only a small proportion are successful.</p> <p>  In the context of oversubscription challenges, no legislation can change the fact that in some areas throughout the country there is a shortage of school places.  We acknowledge this.  We maintain that schools, like families, are not solely operational entities.  They thrive on relationships, values, continuity, local community cohesion and loyalties built up over time.  Allowance must be made for this at local operational level.  We accept that oversubscription is a difficult issue.  There cannot, and never will, be general agreement on the fairest criteria in these circumstances.  Appropriate weight must be given to the principle of subsidiarity, which suggests matters ought to be handled by the most local competent authority, in this case the school board of management.</p> <p>  With regard specifically to the proposed amendment, the JMB very much welcomes the State's requirement for every school to have a transparent and legally compliant enrolment policy, although it should be noted that catchment might be problematic in our sector.  The proposed amendment does not appear to directly challenge the constitutional protections afforded to either the denominational character of a school or the right of the pupil not to attend religious instruction.  It does, however, introduce the notion of the separability of religious instruction from the secular.  The JMB sees this distinction as completely untenable in terms of the lived out ethos of the school.  Faith schools intentionally set out to permeate the day to day life of their schools with a set of values, relationships, visible reminders, policies and curricular frameworks which cannot be divided into religious versus secular paradigms.</p> <p>  We are very grateful to have the opportunity to engage in this debate.  Like my colleagues Dr. Fennelly and Mr. Mulconry, we very much look forward to engagement with the Minister on the admission to schools Bill because much teasing out needs to be done before we proceed with it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-07a.311" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017020700002#F00600"><p>I thank all of the witnesses for their statements.  We will have an opportunity for clarification.  Many of the witnesses addressed the need for more resources as this issue arises in 20% of schools.  It is true to say the point was well made that not a single extra school place will be created by virtue of the Bill or any amendment to it, and this must be borne in mind.  We also have the issue of resources required for opt out options from religion classes and the challenges this poses for schools.</p> <p>  The Gaelscoileanna have a particular issue, which is very understandable.  It is a different type of challenge to those in religious and non-religious schools.  Collectively we will have to look at the issue and pose the question to ourselves as to whether it is right that any child in any modern European society is denied access to any particular school because of religion.  Certainly in the society we have in Ireland I do not think this should be the case.  It concerns me that 1.2% of children who applied have not been given places because of their religion.  This is a relatively high figure.  We need to look at the disadvantages and advantages of holding religious classes outside of school hours, and the resourcing of this is important.  A total of 90% of our primary schools are run by Catholic patronage with 6% under Church of Ireland patronage.</p><p>We have a much wider and more diverse population at this point in time.  Resources come into play with regard to the opt-out options.  I say that as a former teacher who taught religion for many years and really enjoyed teaching it.  I was very conscious of situations where children were left at the back of the class.  In a way, those children were isolated.  I will hand over to members of the committee.  I presume Deputy Burton would like to respond first.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-07a.313" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017020700002#G00200"><p>I thank everybody for coming in and sharing their experiences and views on this matter with the committee.  I apologise for arriving somewhat late but I was speaking in the D&aacute;il earlier.  My approach to this is governed by my experience on the ground so I will not concentrate on constitutional issues <i>per se</i>except to say that we went to a lot of trouble to get legal advice, as we have done over a long period of years, in respect of the difficult question of how we have a primary and secondary school system that is welcoming to every child but which follows the constitutional requirements regarding parents' choices in respect of children and parents and children having religious affiliations, which we respect, and also takes note of the development of communities and an integrated, if very diverse, society.  I represent Dublin West, which is the area around Blanchardstown, Castleknock and Mulhuddart.  According to the last census, it is probably the most diverse part of Ireland.  Over 30% of the population were not born in Ireland or have parents who were not born in Ireland.  When we talk about areas where there may be competition for school places, that competition may also mean that parents from different countries around the world are applying on behalf of their children because they have come to live in Ireland.  Like many outer suburbs of our big cities, Dublin 15 ranges from being quite diverse to being very diverse.  This extends into the commuter belts around the big cities.  I am sure the Chairman will be familiar with that.</p><p>There are three issues at play here.  One is the constitutional requirement regarding freedom of religion and freedom of expression of religion and the Constitution's recognition that parents are the educators of their child.  Our Bill seeks to accommodate and recognise that fully.  The second issue is how one avoids discrimination against children where people of a particular religion apply in sufficient numbers yet in the general area, there is a more diverse population.  The second question is how you accommodate and recognise diversity.  In a situation where there is no pressure on school places, I would be the first to say that by and large, it is not a huge issue for people.  It may well be that, ultimately, parents find practices in schools that they do not particularly like or they are at odds with some of their views but by and large, I would be the first to acknowledge that this is significantly tied up with the issue of pressure on school places and the pressure of population growth in certain areas.  The third issue that arises is geography.  If people are in a recognised geographical area, which could be a school enrolment district or, as was traditionally identified in Ireland, a parish or townland area, how do you give all of the children living in that area access to their local national school even though that school may have a particular denominational affiliation and patronage?  </p><p>I have been dealing with this issue with all of the different communities in Dublin West for at least 15 years.  I pay tribute to almost all of the patron bodies.  I would not have dealt with everybody here but I would have dealt with many patron bodies, as would other public representatives in the area.  By and large, patrons in Ireland, boards of management and teachers have sought to ensure that every child is welcome; that as far as possible, there is an accommodation of diversity; and that where there is rationing of places because of enormous increases in population, which is where the difficulties arise, it is done in a fair way that is not discriminatory.  I appreciate that for religious denominations like the Church of Ireland, the issue is the balance between ethos, diversity, welcome and openness, particularly for small schools.  We said this in our submission.  I thank Dr. Fennelly for acknowledging that.  We are very aware of it because much of what we expressed in the Bill is the expression of experience in dealing with the front line of these issues for modern Ireland.  </p><p>I have been very influenced by the approaches of different members of the clergy from different denominations I have encountered.  In that context, I will digress briefly.  Before Christmas, an outstanding Catholic priest, Fr. Martin Murnaghan, died.  Over a long period of time, Fr. Murnaghan was the parish priest in St. Mochta's parish in Porterstown.  This is an immensely diverse area with three different schools that, ultimately, established a practice whereby they would have different kinds of quotas notwithstanding the fact that two of the schools were Catholic schools while the other - Scoil Choilm community national school - was a late formation school that was under the patronage of the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin for a number of years and then became one of the first ETB-based community national schools.  The other schools were St. Patrick's national school and St. Mochta's national school.  One of the schools was in Diswellstown while the other covered the broader area.  Fr. Murnaghan and his successor, Fr. John Daly, came up with something like a 30% quota allocation based on all the normal considerations of application, the dates, identifying the school of choice, filling in the application form, attending at the school and the parents applying.  That model has been applied in a number of different areas but if I am correct, it has been adopted by a school board and perhaps the patron by agreement.  I am not sure if it applies everywhere or whether there is any guarantee that this model can apply because even within that model, there is quite a heightened consciousness among numbers of parents that the baptismal requirement is also required.  I do not know whether any scientific study has been carried out but it is certainly an issue of concern to parents.  Increasingly, as pressure on places has increased in recent years, this issue has come more to the fore.  Other members of the committee might have more experience of how this has been applied in other parts of the country.</p><p>In fact, if the Department of Education and Skills has more information on what the composition of the student population in different schools has been, that might be quite helpful because there are parts of the country which are not so diverse and there are other parts which are very diverse.  If, for example, one takes 1992 to 1994, the Bosnian community first came to Ireland in significant numbers arising from the consequences of the war.  That resulted in several hundred families settling in Dublin West.  I would think that almost all of those children experienced their education in schools of different religious denominations.  That community could speak for itself, but I think every effort was made to be inclusive.  Nonetheless, our Bill reflects the fact that we have now moved on in time and there are points where there are difficulties, notwithstanding very good practices which are there which I would like to acknowledge and the very caring approach by so many of the patrons, boards of management and teachers.  Our Bill seeks to provide a balance between the constitutional rights regarding religion and the recognition of non-discrimination in respect of children.  We have set out an explanatory memorandum to the Bill which sets out many of the legal arguments in some detail.<br/><br/>Way back in 1996, when Ireland was really not what one might call a very diverse society - I think the Vikings were among the most recent people to have arrived to come and live in Ireland - the Constitution Review Group said:</p><blockquote>...suppose that there is one small national school (and therefore in receipt of public funds) which is run by a Catholic religious order and where the school population heretofore consisted exclusively of Catholic pupils. Members of the Islamic community move into the area and have no realistic alternative but to send their children to the local national school. The parents of these children not only insist on withdrawing their children from formal religious instruction but also object to the Roman Catholic ethos which permeates instruction in other subjects in the school-----</blockquote><p>Now this is 1996 so we are talking about a rather different situation in a lot of schools then.  The quote continues:</p><blockquote>-----and is also reflected in, for example, religious pictures and school holidays for religious feast days.  Must a school which is in receipt of public moneys accede to these objections, or may it give preference to the wishes of the majority of parents who wish the school to retain its Catholic ethos?</blockquote><p>When one thinks that was 1996 it was a very far-sighted judge who wrote that.  It does still reflect some of the delicate issues and our legislation seeks to address those issues while maintaining the capacity for religious preference.  The law has moved on in practice and practice has moved on.  This is illustrated by the development of a whole sector of multi-denominational schools and by the fact that An Foras Patr&uacute;nachta now recognises Gaelscoileanna which may have a Catholic ethos, those which may have a multi-denominational ethos and, I think, those which may have a non-denominational ethos.  We have moved on a great deal in our practice but there is still an issue to address and I welcome the opportunity to address it.  If people would like to ask me any further questions I am happy to respond.  <br/><br/>Considering that we now have a significant population of teenagers and children coming into the teenage years who have settled in Ireland, who have been born in Ireland or whose parents have settled in Ireland, it is absolutely vital for us as a society that they get the best education possible and that they have an extremely positive educational experience that respects them, as well as them respecting the people among whom they are now living.  In that way we may avoid some of the mistakes that other societies have made and can strive to be an inclusive and welcoming society.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses this afternoon.  I enjoyed their presentations and statements and found them very informative.  It is a useful excercise and I am sure they themselves enjoyed the statements and contributions from their colleagues around the table.</p> <p>  In the part of the world that I come from this particular issue is in many ways a foreign land.  We do not have this problem.  It is actually the complete opposite.  As one drives around the boreens of County Monaghan or County Donegal, where I come from, one constantly sees billboards for schools that are having open days.  They are encouraging parents and children to come along to those open nights so that the school can display its wares.  It is a new and welcome development that has come to light in recent years.  Although I do not doubt its sincerity, it is important that we get a sense of perspective on this particular debate.  We should recognise that we have a problem but also that, thankfully, the problem is very much confined to certain areas.  Those areas have been highlighted here this afternoon. </p> <p>  The issue is fundamentally about resources.  It is about lack of school places which, as I said, is the complete opposite to the experience we have in rural Ireland.  I would say in most parts of rural Ireland the experience would be similar to that which I have outlined.  I think it was Dr. Fennelly who used the words order and calm in his contribution.  They are very apt in this particular debate.  It is important that we, as a committee, listen to all sides.  We should keep a sense of perspective in relation to the actual problem and its size but should not ignore the fact that in some instances there is a problem.  It is important that we address that.  I would like to think that a consensus would be arrived at and eventually we will reach a model that will cater for the small numbers not being accommodated at the moment.  </p> <p>  Fundamentally, and I will repeat this, this is a resources issue.  We need to increase resources to the areas that have the problem.  Until we do that we are only tinkering with the symptoms of the problem not actually dealing with the problem itself.  The witnesses can all be very proud of the educational system generally, in addition to the education that is delivered to our young people and indeed our adults of today.  I know in County Monaghan, for example, we have experienced a big influx of foreign nationals from eastern Europe over the past 15 years or so.  They now make up approximately 12% to 13% of the population of Monaghan and in Monaghan town that figure increases to 30%.  I am glad to report that they have all been accommodated within the school network that currently exists.  It goes to show that if the resources are there people can be accommodated.</p></speech>

Some, including Dr. Fennelly in his submission, have raised the fact that the Minister is having his own consultations and we are having our discussions separately.  People have raised this with me privately too.  The answer to that is that the Minister has no control over this committee.  We are the legislative body and we are legislating.  The Minister can have whatever consultation he wants.  I hope it is useful.  I certainly would be interested in reading the submissions but legislation will be passed here.  That is why we have continued with our deliberations.  The Minister has no legislative function in this committee.  Whatever he proposes is simply a proposal.  That is why it is important we hear the witnesses, but I certainly will want to read the submissions.  There is no question about that.</p> <p>  I know that some, including Mr. Mulconry, have raised questions about catchment areas.  Can I dwell on that issue for a moment and see what are the pros and cons of catchment areas and whether anybody has strong views on them?</p><p>Is that possible?</p></speech>

If we could find agreement, what do they believe should be the top three criteria for admissions to schools that are oversubscribed?  I would be interested to hear the variance in opinions.  Is it linear distance, siblings, place on waiting lists, religion, etc.?  I have a question for the Catholic Primary School Management Association, CPSMA, on the survey referenced in the submission.  Of the 72 schools that did not complete the survey, were those schools concentrated in one area or spread across the greater Dublin area?  Of the 1.2% of applications - approximately 80 - that were refused over issues relating to a baptism certificate, were those applications concentrated in a specific area?  This is an issue that is regularly raised with me by parents in the constituency of Dublin-Rathdown.  How is the ESRI's 20% figure for oversubscription explained?  It is a huge difference.  Do we know what difference in the methods used in gathering the data might have given such results?</p></speech>

I am very lucky to be able to sit in on the committee meeting today.</p> <p>  I have a couple of points of observation that I think might be useful as well as a couple of questions.  Mr. Irwin mentioned that, in his opinion, religion was a lower concern compared to, say, location and quality for parents when making their decisions.  However, we know from a particular poll that was carried out that most respondents in rural areas would prefer non-denominational options rather than religious ones if they were available.  I might humbly suggest that in some senses it may not be a criterion that people are applying to their choice because the option is not available.  That is not to say that it necessarily reflects a lack of concern or desire to have a non-religious or multidenominational option.</p> <p>  I will return to the issue of admissions but it is worth noting that Mr. Mulconry noted in his presentation that no Catholic school wishes to exclude a child from a Catholic education.  The key concern is that we have many situations throughout Ireland where the only option for an education is at a Catholic institution.  There is that question.  We need to move to a position where no school wishes to exclude a child from an education and there may be a Catholic or other religious ethos.  That is an example of why we need to move forward to ensure that, with resources, we are delivering on the commitment to 400 other multidenominational or non-denominational schools.  I point out that there is an onus in the provision of education that every child should have the option to be able to access education while also exercising his or her right to not practise a religion or to practise one.  The question of withdrawals was made in a number of different ways.  The question of whether it needed to be specified in the Bill was raised.  I would argue that it is important that it be specified and that it be clarified in the Bill because it is a key point.  There is also the question of resources.  There is already an implicit question of resources.  If we are to recognise a child's right to not receive religious instruction, as was rightly said it is not simply that children can be sent home half an hour earlier.  There is a requirement that an option would be available.  The Chairman spoke eloquently about how it is not an adequate solution to have children sitting at the back of a classroom and opting out while in the same room.  That is not adequate provision.  I would appreciate the witnesses' thoughts on what is adequate provision or what is an appropriate way to address the child's right to not receive religious instruction within a school.  Practical proposals were put forward in the Bill but perhaps there are others.  I personally would love to see philosophy as an option in schools.  I am sure there are many alternatives.  What are the possible proposals? </p> <p>  To my mind, that there were 100 refusals in the greater Dublin area does not necessarily include those who may, for example, have felt they had to produce a baptism certificate.  People may have had concerns but may not have raised it as an issue.  However, that there were 100 refusals is quite significant.  I know that this is only a sampling and that it was different from the ESRI's sampling but it still merits consideration.</p> <p>  I have one other point.  Ms Al-Tawash spoke eloquently about the importance of inclusion, the sense of building a community and the role a school has in both reflecting the diversity of its community and in providing a meeting point to generate positive diversity.  I appreciate that role but I also appreciate some of the concerns raised by Mr. Fennelly, for example, on catchment area.  I would appreciate Mr. Fennelly's thoughts on how to  balance those issues.  It is probably Ms Rainsberry who will address it.  When she does, will she tell us how we should balance that role of schools in terms of building local cohesion and exchange?</p> <p>  I appreciate Mr. &Oacute; hEaghra's presentation, which was very important.  I appreciate that An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta is working to ensure that there is a range of options available.  Every child and family should have the choice of a religious, non-denominational or multidenominational option.  They should also have the right to choose to be educated in their native language.  That is an important right and both of those rights should not be forced into a position of compromise.  I agree in terms of the question about whether Irish is a household language.  I would have some concern, however, where one parent is an Irish speaker.  As Mr. &Oacute; hEaghra eloquently stated, the language is one of the deepest and most important ways to engage with the culture.  We can look to where Irish is the language of a household - that is one situation - but most families in Ireland will be able to speak some words of Irish or have someone with some capacity in Irish.  I would not like to see our Irish language schools under pressure in terms of resources and numbers.  If we consider the number of households where Irish is spoken and also those households where one parent can speak Irish, I imagine there will always be more than enough to fill each school that becomes available.  I worry about those who are coming in from new communities.  We had a children's rights referendum and we want to ensure that every child has the right, regardless of their parent's capacity, to learn and to grow through Irish.  It is different where Irish is spoken in the household because that is a separate right.  Linking it too much to the parent passing a test, for example, might be prohibitive.  I would really appreciate the witnesses' thoughts on those issues and thank them again for their presentations. </p></speech>

I welcome her statement that it is not the intention of the Legislature to destroy the denominational character of schools or to end the participation of minority faiths in the education system.  In that context, it is imperative that if the catchment area criterion is to be adopted, this must be a matter to be defined by each school in its statutory admissions policy as referenced by Deputy Burton in her speech.</p> <p>  I chair the board of Kilkenny College, which is a Church of Ireland voluntary secondary school.  It is a co-educational boarding and day school with 846 students.  Approximately half, 430, are boarding pupils and 416 are day pupils.  The number of pupils has increased since we joined the free scheme in 2013 and we now have approximately 100 more pupils than we had before we joined the free scheme; that has been a success for the school.  Approximately three quarters of the current pupil body are from the Protestant faith background.</p> <p>  Kilkenny College and Protestant schools in general have a proud tradition of welcoming others from outside their own faith traditions.  Kilkenny College along with many other secondary schools is in an unusual position in that there are so few Protestant secondary schools in the 26 Counties.  Kilkenny College is the only Protestant secondary school in County Kilkenny and it also serves families from the neighbouring counties of Carlow, Laois, Offaly, Kildare, Tipperary and Wexford.  There is no alternative Protestant secondary school in any of those counties.  There are 14 counties in Ireland without a Protestant secondary school.  By definition, the Protestant secondary schools that exist must draw people from a very wide catchment area.</p> <p>  Kilkenny College is often referred to as the diocesan college for the diocese of Cashel, Ferns and Ossary because it is the only Church of Ireland secondary school within that diocese.  Newtown School in Waterford in the diocese is a Society of Friends school.  Our catchment area stretches beyond our diocese because we regularly take children from County Tipperary which is outside the diocese and towns such as Athy, Mountmellick, Roscrea, Birr or Tullamore, all of which are in different dioceses.</p> <p>  On a practical level, Kilkenny College is oversubscribed.  The college admits 144 pupils in each first year.  For the next year in which admissions are yet to be determined, 2018-19, we have 338 applications for first year, meaning almost two applicants for every place in the school.  Therefore oversubscription is a very real problem for the college.</p> <p>  At both primary and more especially secondary level, Protestant parents who wish to have their children educated in their own faith must send their children to schools some distance away.  Sometimes that distance is so great that the children require to board.  Primary and secondary Protestant schools are a valuable focal point for an often-scattered minority group.  It is there that children from Protestant backgrounds get to meet other children from Protestant backgrounds because they may be the only Protestant family living in their own neighbourhood.  While they can obviously meet and form relationships through church, it is in the school that those connections and friendships, which are so essential for the survival of the faith, are formed and have a chance to grow affording the Protestant culture a real chance of surviving when it is divided among such a dispersed community.</p> <p>  As has been said here, the Constitution recognises the family as the primary educator of the child and makes particular mention of the rights of parents in the matter of religions and moral formation.  In the light of the constitutional rights of parents, it is necessary that where the oversubscribed Protestant schools continue to be able to prioritise those of their own faith tradition notwithstanding that those pupils are travelling from very great distances away and which would not normally be considered a local area for a school.</p></speech>

I am just trying to get her views on the difficulties before we make our decisions.  If we were to make a law specifying that a school could only prioritise Protestant children or co-religionists from within a catchment area and that it could not bring in Protestant children from outside that area, but if the catchment area were to be defined as that large area Ms Rainsberry described, would that cause a problem for her school?</p></speech>

Then it is really just a matter of transparency and not a matter of restriction.  If it is simply a matter for transparency for parents to know where pupils come from, how big an area the school serves and what are their chances of getting in, that is not a problem.  However, if the catchment area is imposed on a school, it is most likely, particularly in the case of Protestant schools, that the catchment area is too small and some Protestant children will end up without a school to go to.</p></speech>

What is the school's policy in choosing who is admitted in first year?</p> <p>  I know Deputy Burton also has a question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-07a.333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017020700002#K00900"><p>Further to Deputy Byrne's question, Ms Rainsberry said, as everybody knows, that almost every Protestant primary and secondary school includes children of other faiths and that a huge amount of effort goes into doing that.  For instance, Dublin 15 is a hotbed for people coming from different countries throughout the world.  The local Church of Ireland primary school is a very popular, as are most Church of Ireland schools.  While I do not know the exact numbers, it has a level of diversity, but it has always been oversubscribed.  During the time when Mr. Ruair&iacute; Quinn was Minister for Education and Skills, a second Church of Ireland school was established in Dunboyne for the wider Dunboyne catchment area.</p> <p>  Nobody has ever suggested that catchment areas would be based on dioceses if that was an inadequate geographical area given the spread of the schools.  However, I have a complementary question.  Would Ms Rainsberry accept it is good to have a degree of diversity in the school if that can be accommodated?  It is good for the Protestant children and it is obviously good for local community relations.  We need a balance between the school having the right to have a sufficient number of children to reflect its ethos while not at the same time excluding other children who may live relatively close to the school and would therefore find the school an attractive option in the local context.  The Constitution reflects the right of religious freedom and expression; there is also a reflection of a right of a child not to be discriminated against.  We are trying to balance a number of different things that are set out as objectives and ideals in the Constitution.</p></speech>

The school, like every other school, has a published admissions policy.  I cannot pretend to know the exact order of the seven categories.  However, the first category comprises Church of Ireland children from within the united diocese and children from outside the united diocese.  Priority is then given to siblings and for people with a proven connection to the school, obviously including teachers who teach in the school.  At this stage applications are at such a level that the top categories are filling the capacity and those who would not have any connection with the school would probably be in difficulty in getting places because of the oversubscription.  It is a very acute problem.</p><p>As I said, because the Church of Ireland schools are disparate and widely spaced, a Protestant child living in Mountmellick might end up without a place if preference was given to somebody living beside the school to take that place.</p></speech>

When we said that "catchment" might be problematic, it is that the definition of "catchment" might be problematic for us.  I might use the example of my own school because this is a part-time role for me.  My main job is principal of St. Finian's College in Mullingar, which is a diocesan school.  Traditionally, we had many boarders from across the entire diocese of Meath and when we stopped taking boarders ten years ago, the patron asked us to try to continue to serve as many parishes as possible around the Mullingar area because Mullingar has quite a few second level schools.</p> <p>  Our admissions policy is quite simple.  We take siblings first and after that the eldest by date of birth across the board.  Interestingly, that leads to a very diverse school population, both in terms of religious affiliation and of nationality of origin.  It is something that is seamless from our point of view.  We do not dwell on it but last year, for example, when we were celebrating 1916-2016, on flag day we allowed the children from the other countries to talk about their flag in their original country.  We discovered, to our surprise, that we had 29 different nationalities represented.  There are many different traditions and approaches across our sector, depending on what part of the country one is in, and so we would argue there should not be a rigid definition of "catchment".</p></speech>

In other words, if Kilkenny College was filling its places on the full gamut of Protestant people, we would not want a scenario to arise where a Protestant family would not get a place but somebody else would because it would be open to challenge.  That would go to the section 29 appeal process and create all sorts of problems.</p> <p>  On the quota aspect, I am slightly uneasy as to how that might work in practice.  I know it is a good idea that people are going forward in the west Dublin area and, as Deputy Burton said, it seems to be working but I am slightly uneasy as to how it might work in practice across the board for Protestant minority schools.</p></speech>

The important point to remember, which Deputy Burton made, is that it is all about engagement at local level to see what might best fit in that context.  The issue of catchment will vary from school to school but, essentially, all schools have communities and they are engaging as best they can with primary schools and primary groups on what might be best for that school in that area.  There is a large level of engagement taking place.  In the context of catchment, as Deputy Byrne mentioned, it is to allow that autonomy and to ensure that at local level there is that element of subsidiarity whereby it is the board of management that, by and large, knows what might be best for a school.  The difficulty we have sometimes around legislation is that it might be too prescriptive and will take away that element of fluidity, common sense or knowledge of the local area that might be needed in the Irish context.</p></speech>

In my town, Newbridge, there is a common enrolment policy where the seven schools get together and agree that each school will take a certain number of, say, non-national children and children with special needs.  Only one of the schools has an ASD unit so it will have a higher number but I agree that what the witnesses can do, together with co-operation among a number of different schools locally, can subvent many of the issues that can arise.</p></speech>

On that point, I appreciate the Chairman's comment and I am aware of her comments, and those of Deputy Byrne, made before Christmas when the committee met on the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill process.  I have been coming before committees of the Houses since 2009, as has my predecessor, D&oacute;nal &Oacute; Conaill, and we have encountered this issue with translation.  I do not understand the reason the issue is not addressed.

First, unless adequate school places are available, I do not think it matters what criteria we set down.  I would acknowledge that post-primary is different from primary, but much of this debate stems from the fact that there is a shortage of school places in certain areas.  Whether we define it by catchment or whatever other criteria, unless there are adequate school places the basic problem will not go away.</p> <p>  While new schools are needed to cope with the shortage of places, I am also conscious of what Senator Gallagher said.  At both primary and post-primary level we must also be conscious that, in a effort to provide for diversity around rural Ireland, the problem is quite the reverse.  In such areas, schools are struggling to maintain student numbers.  By virtue of their settings, however, they are automatically diverse as we stand.  Therefore, the issue is not as applicable when we move outside the troubled areas.</p> <p>  The second issue concerns educational provision for a changing Ireland, regardless of school size or what part of the country we are in.  The main criterion for entry in many of the 96 community schools is residence in one's local community and attendance in the local feeder schools.  I do not think there is a community school in the country that lays down any other criterion, other than that a person is based and living in, as well as coming from, the community.</p> <p>  There will be an issue in future whereby we do have an obligation to provide - as the Secretary-General of the Department said recently - for students of all faiths and none.  That is a separate issue that will have to be dealt with.  Senator Gallagher mentioned the words "calm" and "considered".  We need to plan for that and ask how we can accommodate parents who are quite happy for their children to attend religion classes, and those who want provision.  There is a resource implication for that.  We must separate the two issues of access to schools and provision.  They are areas for two separate discussions.  </p></speech>

That is precisely why we surveyed schools in the Dublin area, in order to provide hard data and give us a picture of what is going on.  Most Catholic primary schools will take anybody who turns up.  In point of fact, that means that our schools are very diverse.  If one goes to Ballaghaderreen or Portlaoise one will find schools which have significant Muslim populations.  Therefore there is no barrier to entry other than a lack of places.  It is not our desire to have wholly Catholic schools.  In point of fact, in the Dublin area I know of no Catholic primary school that is wholly Catholic.  There are significant populations from other faiths and significant numbers of people who are of no faith.  The issue is a lack of school places.  Policy should be driven by data, not by anecdote.  If communities are having specific problems - and I am aware and cognisant of the challenges faced by the Muslim community - then we need to understand what is happening.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked an interesting question on whether there were specific areas where there was a problem with the baptismal certificate.  It tends to be concentrated, so it is not evenly distributed.  There tend to be 15 or 16 here and there.  When we did the initial research the first returns came from schools where there was absolutely none because they were taking everybody, so it is concentrated in certain pockets.  I think that really needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  If one looks at the data, then there are certain areas.  Our point is that over-subscription is increasing.  About 18 months ago, a survey of diocesan secretaries was undertaken asking them if there were problems.  At that stage we identified about 21 schools.  We have now identified in total about 42 areas that are under pressure.  Of those, there were 17 where the baptismal certificate comes in.  The worst case is a particular location where there were 402 applications for 208 places.  There were roughly 16 refusals based on baptism, but - and this is important - there were between six and eight people who were not baptised but were brought in because of the sibling rule.  Therefore, this idea that there is some kind of blanket desire to keep people out is absolutely incorrect.  </p> <p>  Deputy Burton asked if we could get an overall picture of what is going on in schools.  We asked the Department of Education and Skills for that information.  They said to us that it was not compulsory for schools to do it and they seemed to be unsure of some of the data they had.  Therefore they were not willing to publish it.  We would love that information to be made public because, if so, one would find - and I am absolutely convinced of this - that Catholic schools are reflecting the populations of their areas.</p> <p>  I am not sure whether this is around perception or fact, but in some areas there is an issue that Catholic students from outside the catchment area - and most schools in Dublin are operating some variation of a catchment area - are getting preference in Catholic schools and therefore excluding others.  The issue for us is that there are three parishes in Dublin which do not have Catholic primary schools and therefore parishes around them have to take that overflow.  That may be contributing to a perception that there is an issue on that.</p> <p>  I would love to see more hard data driving policy, so that we can identify where there is a problem, deal with it now as quickly as we can, and then ensure that we predict where problems will arise in future.  Our schools are reflective of the communities in which they live.  </p> <p>  I would also like to raise an issue that has not yet been raised, but which should be.  I was speaking to my colleague in the Edmund Rice Trust which operates 33 primary schools.  Almost all of them are DEIS schools with a focus on special needs and minority communities.  Not one of them is over-subscribed, so there is something going on here that has less to do with religion and more to do with other factors.</p> <p>  Catholic schools are often picked out as the ones that are somehow to blame for all of this.   I would remind people that we have the majority of DEIS schools and we cater to some of the most marginalised communities.  My colleagues in the Edmund Rice Trust would be great exemplars; they run fantastic schools in the inner city and other urban locations.</p> <p>  What do we see happening where there is pressure in rural areas?  The Department sometimes refers to white flight.  In point of fact, what they are talking about is middle-class flight from town schools which may have an immigrant population, to smaller schools on the outskirts.  That creates problems for some of our schools on the outskirts.  Therefore there is much more going on in admissions than religion, and a sole focus on religion is avoiding the bigger picture.  </p> <p>  I will ask my colleague, Ms McCabe, to describe briefly how she deals with the issue of opt-outs in her own school.</p></speech>

I am a teaching principal.  This issue has come as news to me because in the rural community I come from, everybody is welcome.  We are one of those schools that says, "We're open; please come and see us".  We welcome everybody.</p> <p>  As a teacher, I find the idea that a child is left sitting at the back of the classroom a very sad image and not one of which I have experience.  Rather than focus on an opt-out, we would actually have an opt-in.  It is all about the level of engagement the parents want.  Our school has children who are not of the Catholic faith and have never had problems.  It is all about what parents want and that is what we provide.  Those children sing in choirs and bring up gifts if they wish.  They are very much part of the related artistic activities.  These children are very much included and are never found sitting at the back of the classroom.  I emphasise that point.  From talking to colleagues, I know it is not the case in other schools close to mine.</p></speech>

As Ms McCabe has described, a number of Catholic schools have a wide degree of diversity.  It is interesting that we are hearing that the baptism barrier does not seem to be a necessary element in preserving the ethos of the school.  I am hearing that in many cases it has not proved to be necessary because schools have maintained their Catholic ethos without employing it.  From what I am hearing, it seems to be linked more to a question of pressure on resources.  Should we have the baptism barrier at all if in many cases it is not applied, but only applied at times where there is a pressure on resources?</p> <p>  I agree with Mr. Mulconry that a number of issues relating to inclusion need to be addressed.  That is a very well made point.  A good aspect of Deputy Burton's legislation is the proposal for inclusion to be a consideration and a criterion, not linked to religion.  It was widely worded and may address some of the other issues the witnesses have highlighted.</p></speech>

While there have been some wonderful examples of inclusivity in schools across the country, the problem arises in schools that are oversubscribed, mainly secondary schools because there is such a huge difference in the number of primary and secondary schools.  Children of faith from new communities or minorities are facing issues when they try to access secondary schools.  We are looking for some kind of balance in legislation and for legislation to act as a framework and guidance so that there is a balance even when there is a problem of oversubscription.</p> <p>  When there are enough places, everyone is welcome.  However, when there are not enough places, there should be some guidelines that those children should also have the right to education so that they can be treated in a similar way.  We are looking for a solution in partnership with all the boards and not looking for special treatment, just for equal access for the children to education.  The problem is with oversubscription, which in time, if it is looked after with adequate resources, will be sorted out.  In the meantime, there is a problem on the ground where children and their parents are faced with no choice or very limited choice.  I am aware of the urban-rural divide in this regard.  We are looking for some form of guidance and partnership with the other boards and from the Government itself.</p></speech>

We realise there are issues with resources and oversubscription.  The same difficulties do not arise with primary schools.  Muslim parents put their children into primary schools.  Most of those schools are feeder schools into secondary schools.  Like every other parent, they have the expectation that their child will go with his or her classmates to a secondary school.  Suddenly they face the reality that their child is left out.  A number of parents have come to me pointing out that the entire class has gone to a particular school but that their child cannot go.</p> <p>  I understand all the difficulties and I commend all the organisations represented here on their inclusivity.  I know of many schools where children are really welcome.  However, parents are coming to us saying: "I can't find a secondary school for my child.  I have applied for six or seven different schools.  I have paid an application fee for a lot of those schools."  In the end their choice is minute.  The result is that all of our young people end up in a block in the school that is not as oversubscribed or has a more open policy, which is not good for them.  It is not particularly good for the school and it is not good for integration into mainstream society.</p> <p>  We have talked about immigrant populations and minority groups.  In the two Muslim schools we have, 95% of those children were born in Ireland.  They are not immigrants or from minorities; they are Irish children with the same rights as every other Irish child.  It is important for us to remember that point.</p> <p>  Regarding sitting at the back of the class, there are schools in Dublin where the Muslim community has provided in Catholic schools opportunities for Muslim children to have religious education.  They provide their own teachers who are vetted and go into schools to teach parallel classes.  The will is there to work with other groups.</p></speech>

I am very aware of the discrimination against children with special educational needs.  I have come across schools that have taken in children, but the siblings with special educational needs are told to go to the school down the road.  It is outrageous.  It is not helped - I have also raised this issue - by the fact that the MLL inspectors will ask the school at the end of the week of the inspection why it has such a large proportion of children with special educational needs, but they never ask the school, which does not have children with special needs, why it does not have children with special educational needs or why it has such a small proportion of them.  I am very aware of that issue.</p> <p>  I acknowledge and commend the work consistently done by all groups represented here in nurturing our children.</p></speech>

In areas with oversubscribed schools, there tends to be a number of schools in the area that are oversubscribed.  In a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, Kitty Holland wrote about her problems in getting her child into a school.  She pointed out that she could not get into the Catholic school because of baptism, but in point of fact the list was so long that baptism would not have made a difference anyway.  Her child could not get into the Protestant school.  However, the interdenominational school and the Gaelscoil were taking people from outside the catchment area.</p><p>These things happen.  If, as a Catholic parent, I was trying to get my child into a school there, I could find myself being pushed down into a school with another patron rather than into a Catholic school where I would have the ethos I wanted for my child.  It is a concern around Catholic parents being able to access Catholic schools in cases of oversubscription because they could actually be disadvantaged where they could not get their children into other schools.</p></speech>

I tend to think we should drive these things with data.  That is why I would love to see some proper research into what is happening in Dublin.  It is clear to me from the story Kitty Holland wrote that the problem in the area was oversubscription, not religion.  If we had hard data, it would inform good policy-making.  </p> <p>  The Senator mentioned children with special needs.  I do not normally go for anecdotes, but one was given to me recently which was deeply shocking.  A teacher had a Traveller child in her school, a lovely young fellow.  He said, "Miss, I like this school.  I do not get expelled from it that often."  She asked him what he meant.  He said that at his last school, he was expelled every couple of days.  The school was moving the child on and the family eventually got the message and moved.  That stuff happens too.  It is not around admissions, but there are soft barriers which are not defensible.</p></speech>

I have no difficulty with it, but in the submission we made we were pointing out that the debate had somehow concentrated very much on religion when that was not the only factor.  Very often, in fact, it is not the more important factor.  In school admission we see inclusivity as the key issue.  The soft barriers to which the Senator referred are something we sincerely hope the committee will be open to debating in the context of the wider admissions Bill and seek people's views.  Under the new allocation model for pupils with special educational needs at post-primary level, each school will have a baseline of 20%.  No school can put up a defence that it cannot accept a child on the basis that it is not able to meet a special educational need when that need is being provided for through the allocation model.  We would like to see that issue opened for debate and discussed fully.  Deputy Cathderine Martin mentioned soft barriers.  Anecdotally, we hear it also, but it is about the nature of inclusive education.</p> <p>  In terms of communities looking for non-denominational schools by choice if they were available, one is looking at the evolution of the education system.  We know from where it evolved and can see in the later schools that have opened such as community schools that they are non-denominational.  There will be a catch-up period.  I note that the schools currently available are diverse and inclusive and very much aim to meet the needs of all communities.  However, I take the point made.</p></speech>

There should not be a situation in any school where kids are not allowed in because of special needs.  We see our schools as hugely inclusive.  Every school has to have an admission policy and there must be transparency.  If there are issues around inclusion in that respect, they should be looked at.  I also make the point in the context of some of the difficulties encountered in gaining places in second level schools in Dublin, or nationally for that matter, that we represent the majority of Catholic schools in the country.  In the context of oversubscription, in practice the Catholic faith is not used as a criterion in determining who gets places in a school.  We are very glad to say that has not been the practice in our schools.  Again, we come back to the issue of oversubscription.  There are places in the country where, for a variety of reasons, there is a shortage of places and a number of kids are not getting them.  That is the issue that has to be addressed.</p></speech>

It is retained through the fact that we have the right to maintain them as faith schools, not just Catholic schools.  What is important is the reality on the ground where the practice of our schools is hugely inclusive and reflects what is going on at community level.  It is that practice that should be looked at.  It is what is in place that should be recognised.  That is why, in the context of legislation coming into this sphere, we are perhaps a little worried about what it might entail.  We have a very diverse schooling system in this country.  It is great on one level.  There is great diversity in the second level system which works relatively well.  In truth, we have few enough problems on the ground in this area.  The few problems we have with oversubscription have to do more with resources than anything else.  It is in that context that we make our point.</p></speech>

What we are talking about is being able to prioritise within a catchment area.  That is what we are already doing in most schools in Dublin.  I cannot say it is in 100% of schools, but it is in most.  The reason is very much the point I made about the Kitty Holland article.  One could have a Catholic pupil or parent being disadvantaged because he or she does not have Irish to get into an Irish school or a pupil or parent is not Protestant and cannot get into the Protestant school.  Pupils and parents want to get into their own schools and do not want to be pushed into a multidenominational or other patronage model.  In essence, that is what our issue is.</p></speech>

It has been great to hear the different opinions and about the diversity, welcome as it is in schools, and also the inclusivity.  It is really a question and an issue of mutual respect.  I take the opportunity to acknowledge the terrific work the delegates do in their own fields to educate young people.  I note the many decades and centuries of religious education in the country and the generations that received an excellent education because of the ethos of both Catholic and Church of Ireland schools which we have traditionally had.  They afforded all of us and those who went before us a great education.  However, we are now in a new era.  We have a very different Ireland and a pluralist society.</p><p>We want to make sure that we have the best quality education for our children who are in school now, and those in the future.  There is no doubt that the question of resources is absolutely huge.  That is a key message we will convey to the Minister.  I thank the witnesses and the members for their attendance today.</p></speech>

I will deal with NewERA first.  To many, the methodology behind NewERA and the failure to meet the EUROSTAT test undermined the whole concept behind and reason for the establishment of the water charging system.  It would appear that passing the test is not now possible.  I am conscious of the recommendations of the expert commissions and some questions emanating from that in respect of borrowings.  What is the current borrowing cost of Irish Water in comparison to ten-year Government bonds?  I ask this because, at present, I believe borrowing is done on a yearly basis.  Is that correct?</p> <p>  If the State is to become the sole customer of domestic water tariffs, is it feasible to borrow on the markets whether it be by Irish Water or its parent company, Ervia, thereafter?  Has Irish Water undertaken an analysis of this shift, as proposed by the expert commission report?  It was published some time ago and I am sure there has been some consideration of the recommendations contained in it.  It would be interesting to hear at this juncture whether there is any comment from NewERA in respect of this issue.  </p> <p>  Some would say that the cessation of water metering was on the cards anyway because we were led to believe that 300,000 properties could not be metered.  Has the shift of any remaining metering to district metering affected borrowing capacity if that remains a commitment or the wish of Irish Water even with the State being its only customer in respect of domestic charges?</p></speech>

It is primarily about the most cost-effective way currently for Irish Water to fund its commercial facilities in the context of the decision by EUROSTAT and in light of the suspension of domestic charges.  The report looked specifically at the cost of current commercial facilities for Irish Water, which are on a one-year basis, and compared it with what the State is funding on a one-year basis.  Based on an interest rate of 1.4% for Irish Water and -0.4% for the State, we would calculate that this amounts to an interest rate saving of about &euro;14 million for the State so that is the primary context for the report.</p><p> On longer term funding rates for the State, Irish Water is not funding long term.  Under any circumstances, in the usual order of merit State funds are cheapest.  Semi-State and commercial semi-State bodies fund with a premium, while Irish Water is in a different phase of its development.  If we compare the five-year cost of debt for Irish Water hypothetically because it is not currently funded with the cost of five-year debt for the State, it is cheaper for the State.  From its perspective, given current circumstances, for the foreseeable future the most cost-effective way of funding Irish Water is through the State.</p></speech>

The average rate for Irish Water for its commercial debt facilities is 1.4%.  Even over a period of ten years, it would be more expensive because longer term money would be provided, but the State is funding it at a rate of about 1.2%.  There has been a slight rise in rates.</p></speech>

That does not preclude, at any point, Irish Water from returning to commercial markets.  Being what they are, commercial lenders will lend to someone if they think they will get an appropriate return at an appropriate level of risk.  I do not think deciding to fund Irish Water from State resources would make any material difference or lock Irish Water out of commercial lending forever.</p></speech>

One will remember that, at a certain stage, the off-balance-sheet argument became a really key one for Irish Water.  The objective in being off balance sheet was to allow borrowing that would not appear on our books under the fiscal rules and so on.  The former Minister Deputy Alan Kelly said when Irish Water had failed the EUROSTAT test that it had had no impact whatsoever, but it obviously does.</p> <p>  I am following up on the main point, at which Deputy Barry Cowen was getting.  As it stands, according to NewERA, the additional cost on a yearly basis of Irish Water borrowing with what is effectively a failed off-balance sheet mechanism is &euro;13 million to &euro;15 million.  The main benefit that was meant to accrue from that model was that the borrowing would not appear on our books under the fiscal rules.</p></speech>

However, because it is now within the Government structure, what Irish Water does will affect the national accounts.  From a pragmatic perspective, one is looking for the most cost-effective way and use of the sovereign is the most cost-effective way, but it does not have the advantage of a commercial semi-State body, the actions of which would not have an impact.</p></speech>

Irish Water is highly ambitious about capital expenditure and meeting the need in this regard.  In this model I do not believe there is any reason it could not carry out its objectives in that regard.</p></speech>

The delegates outlined three possible options in their paper, one being to retain the existing plan which is to have Irish Water borrowing privately at higher rates, with the State being able to borrow directly; the second being to retain the existing private financing arrangement but to borrow directly via the State as new financing needs arise, and the third being to transition all private finance into Government borrowings.  Ms Fitzpatrick opts strongly for the third optio.  Will she explain her reasons?</p></speech>

On the second option which is to retain existing commercial facilities, the fundamental point is that it is still cheaper for the Government.  We would have landed heavily on the third option.  Irish Water may have some small qualitative issues around it in terms of flexibility or certainty, or the visibility of the expenditure.  A private facility - a revolving credit facility - can be drawn down or repaid at very short notice.  As Government funding is not quite like that, in terms of facilitating that flexibility, one could leave a very small amount which is really for working capital, but that is a fine point.</p></speech>

If there is no continuation of metering it will have a fundamental impact on the cost base of Irish Water as it goes about identifying leakages and carrying out conservation, and this will affect ongoing sustainability.  It is not correct to dismiss the impact of metering on costs.  Can the delegation give its views on that?  If we do not identify leakages and distribution patterns there will be a long-term impact.</p> <p>  The initial strategy was to attract external funding by virtue of the cost base being off balance sheet and that allowed the State, and Irish Water by extension, to invest substantially in capital infrastructure.  The level of State subsidy was the key point and it narrowly failed the EUROSTAT test.  What are the long-term implications of the investment plan?  It does not matter to Ervia whether the funding comes from an external source or the State as long as one has a sustainable funding base but it does matter as far as State funding and State services are concerned.  I want to highlight that point, for the benefit of the committee rather than the delegation, because the impact on State services will matter to us in our deliberations.  The funding will either come from external sources or the taxpayer.</p> <p>  Irish Water has a capital loan from the Minister for Finance.  What happens to that loan when it expires?  Will it be turned into equity and how is it treated on the books of NewERA?   </p></speech>

Metering has a lot of practical advantages that translate into cost savings in the future under the utility model.  The utility can determine what the rate of leakage is and be very precise about usage.  I did not make any comment on the importance or otherwise of metering but Ervia has already outlined many of its advantages.</p></speech>

Irish Water's capital investment programme as outlined in the business plan year-on-year includes revenue funding but the majority is borrowed from private sources or the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  If Government was to move to option three for cost reasons, as has been outlined, I presume that the balance between the smaller portion of revenue funding and the greater portion of borrowed money remains roughly the same.  The source of borrowing changes and therefore the costs reduce.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

There are two issues connected to that.</p> <p>  When the Department of Finance representatives came before the committee some weeks ago, Deputy Murphy asked them a question on EUROSTAT.  One of the reasons it gave a negative reading to the first application for the market corporation test was that there was a mismatch in the relationship between the revenue generated by the cost of domestic charges and the borrowing requirements in the plan for the capital investment programme.  The consequence of that is that in order to get to an off-balance sheet position by 2018 or 2019 a higher rate or projection of a future higher rate of domestic water charges would be required.  Is that the witnesses' understanding or interpretation of that bit of the market corporation test failure?</p> <p>  The capital projections for Irish Water sit around &euro;500 million until 2019, but from 2019 to 2021 they increase significantly to between &euro;770 million to around &euro;900 million each year.  If Irish Water, irrespective of what happens with water charges, remains off-balance sheet post-2019, is it the view of the witnesses that it could meet those capital projections within the existing borrowing envelope of the State in order to comply with the European Commission's fiscal treaty rules?</p> <p>  I have one further question for the Department.</p></speech>

When it examines such matters, it has certain quantitative tests and is also entitled to take a qualitative view.  Its opinion is absolute in these matters.  Therefore, I cannot comment on its thinking process.  It would apply a couple of very basic tests.  It would look for the revenue to be generated to be at least 50% of the operating costs.  It would look for economically significant prices to be charged and determine what the level of Government control would be.</p></speech>

Depending on the estimate of average household use, is the Department examining what such a stream could raise versus what it would cost to administer it in terms of building enforcement?</p></speech>

To answer two issues, the &euro;5.5 billion in capital investment in Irish Water is reflected in the capital plan and is, therefore, reflected in the budgetary perspective at the moment.  Obviously, budgetary arithmetic is done on an annual basis and certainty of funding - a phrase to which we always come back - is one of the issues that concerns funding models.  I would have pointed to that when first before the committee.  In terms of examining scenarios and revenue streams that may come from an excess charge, this will depend on where it is set and the objective to be achieved.  For instance, the plastic bag levy is an environmental charge that is designed to change behaviour.  It is not intended to be a sustainable revenue source over the long term.  This will be something that causes people to adapt their behaviour in order to conserve water and which will also have an impact on production costs over the long term.  I am cautioning against simply looking at what are the administration costs and core revenue because the objective may sustain a different perspective.</p></speech>

We heard at earlier meetings that Irish Water's long-term investment planning strategy has been set out and that the investment required to address all known deficits is estimated to be circa &euro;13 billion.  Is the overall &euro;13 billion figure achievable in the absence of a direct charging regime?  It would appear from answers given to Deputy Barry Cowen that the capital investment programme can be met with the State being the main customer.  Therefore, is this figure of &euro;13 billion achievable with the State as the main customer?  Is the timeframe for the implementation of the capital plan feasible without a direct charging regime?  Those are my first two questions.  I have two more, but perhaps those two might be answered first.</p></speech>

The easiest way to look at it is that there is a business plan which has been approved by the regulator.  Therefore, there is a plan.  What is happening is that the revenue that was going to come from domestic customers is now coming from the State.  The plan in so far as the Commission for Energy Regulation has looked at it is a feasible plan, but one line is being substituted, with the State now taking the place of the domestic customer.  Whatever portion of that statement of the plan, if one likes, that was coming from the domestic customer is being substituted and the Government is stepping in in lieu.  Everything else in terms of financial expectations and planning etc. stays the same.  There is one fixed-----</p></speech>

This refers to the period from 2017 to 2021.  Under this model, customer revenue from charges would help to fund the capital programme.  It is obviously feasible for the State to step in under the expert model arrangement or in another scenario.  The question is the certainty one would have in this regard and what would be put in around that mechanism.  The expert commission had one view in which the State would be the customer.  The less revenue one has from charges, the more one has the issue of water at the table, alongside housing, transport and other areas and sectoral interests that are seeking to secure capital.  This is simply part of the normal Government arithmetic.</p></speech>

Regarding its implementation, metering has given rise to issues such as identifying leakage.  The benefits of metering are more long term than on a year by year basis.  If money is being saved by identifying leaks and reducing consumption, the rate at which capacity and plants must be built is deferred into the future.  One is, therefore, comparing a short-term issue with a long-term one.</p></speech>

The amount is equal to the allowed revenue set by the regulator.  What it sets as the allowed revenue covers operational expenditure and the cost of funds referred to previously to fund the capital programme.  A combination of a surplus in revenue over operations, an equity provision which in the coming years will average &euro;270 million and an amount of debt raised make up the capital spend.</p></speech>

In a situation where the State is the sole customer of Irish Water, obviously it will bill the State every year.  Is that not funding of a different type from the one about which Ms Graham has spoken in terms of certainty of funding?  The State can decide whether it wants to invest in roads.  It is not the case that Transport Infrastructure Ireland bills the State every year for a service provided.  It is a different type of funding requirement.  Is that not the case?  It would fall due as a liability rather than be something over which the State would have control in deciding whether to give X or Y amount.  The amount billed is a liability rather than being determined by a budgetary decision.</p></speech>

It is different from a previous funding model that would have seen operations and capital expenditure funded in different ways as in other areas of infrastructure.  It is dependent on the bill being presented to the State and a mechanism being in place to enable the State to honour it.  There is certainty.  There are mechanisms in other countries where the state, for example, gives an outline of the funding likely to be available in a multi-annual period and the regulator and the utility work in that vein.  We set out in one of our earlier papers how that might work.  The Deputy is correct.  There is greater certainty from the utility's perspective if it can simply present the bill to the State as a sole customer and have it paid.</p></speech>

At the end of that letter, the Commissioner states:</p><blockquote>[...] in order for the charge on excessive or wasteful use of water to attain its purpose, the consumption of water for normal use should be set at a reasonable level, and the charge for excessive or wasteful use should be dissuasive.

The water bill is projected to be &euro;13 billion over ten years.  In the context of the recommendation in the expert group's report that there be a charge for excessive usage, has the Department considered the possibility that it might have to give money back to people who use less than the water allowance?  Has consideration been given to the possibility of a monetary reward for water conservation?  Perhaps people might get a cheque if they have barrels to collect rainwater or if they invest in their homes.  Have the witnesses considered the impact of that?</p> <p>  I want to get the figures clear in my head.

My questions are directed to the Department officials.  The Irish Water assumed compliance rate to the end of 2017 was 73%, with expected cash receipts of &euro;259 million.  Following the suspension of water charges in the first quarter of 2017, the Department of Finance adjusted the expected cash receipts amount by 25% to &euro;194 million.  On what basis was it assumed the compliance rate would be 73%?  The reduction in cash receipts will have a knock-on effect in terms of future public finances.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced a new public pay deal of &euro;170 million which is to come from within existing resources.  Has there been any allocation of resources by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to that pay deal and, if not, is there any scope for that going forward?</p></speech>

In regard to the suspension of water charges, over the term of the business plan assumptions were made around levels of compliance which, as members will be aware, were rising all the time.  As stated by Ms Fitzpatrick, in addition to the subvention, the Department would have given a working capital loan to Irish Water in recognition of the lag between billing and receipt of income.  In terms of 2017, the working capital loan was &euro;39 million and it was converted to subvention to address the gap between expected revenue-----</p></speech>

The plan for Irish Water is based on an accruals basis and we look at what its cash requirements are on a year-by-year basis.

We all have our views on what constitutes excessive usage.  I appreciate the Commission for Energy Regulation will be tasked with setting the figure.  The witnesses specifically referred in their submission to the importance of a dissuasive argument for those who are prone to wasting water, or even to determine whether people are wasting water.  What are the views of the witnesses on the level at which this should be set?</p> <p>  We have a very obvious question of fairness, particularly to those who provide their own water supply, such as group water schemes throughout the country.  They provide a significant saving to the Exchequer.  In the long term, it is most likely cheaper for them to provide the water supply to their communities than for the State to do so in certain instances.  Otherwise, I would argue, group water schemes would not exist.  How do we square this circle?  How do we deal with the basic inequality we will have if the current arrangement is adopted through the expert report, with regard to people paying for excessive usage versus those in private group schemes who will pay a charge regardless?  I understand there is State subvention, and this has been restored as of the suspension date to 2015 levels.  I know the witnesses are calling for additional subsidies, and it is in the report which is helpful no doubt to group water schemes.  What are the views of the witnesses on this?</p> <p>  Do the witnesses believe it is possible for private group schemes to provide the service the State provides in housing estates throughout the country cheaper than the State provides it?  Do they have a view on how this would be achieved?  I am sure they can appreciate we have spoken to the commission, Irish Water, NewERA and departmental officials on numerous occasions in recent years, where the total cost of the provision of the water and the wastewater networks throughout the State has been highlighted.  All the while, hundreds of thousands of people already pay for water and their local community water services.  With very few exceptions, certainly in the advice with which we have been provided, I have seen examples of excellence in the service provided by group water schemes, no more than by State providers.</p><p>Do the witnesses have a view on the ongoing sustainability of the group schemes they represent?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-07a.581" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm Brady" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017020700002#S00200"><p>I will deal first with the second issue on fairness and equity.  I presume the Deputy is talking about Irish Water and other service providers versus the group water scheme sector.  As mentioned in our submission, since the late 1990s when domestic water charges were abandoned on the public water supplies, the group water scheme sector has been getting a subvention towards the cost of supply and treatment of domestic water services.  That has been in place since then.  Group water schemes come together as a group, assess their own individual overall costs, assess what they can get through the subsidy and then agree among themselves as a group with the leadership of the committee of management or board of directors as to what they are prepared to contribute directly towards the costs of their group water supply scheme.</p> <p>  That subsidy has been reviewed a number of times since then.  We have a partnership arrangement with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, as it was, and now the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  We review that on behalf of the schemes with that Department.  In all instances we have had a good relationship with the Department and found that it takes our views on costs into account.  That review has always been an upward review, apart from the time when domestic water charges were reintroduced when we had a reduction in that subsidy.</p> <p>  Irrespective of what comes out of this process, whether it be a charge based on excessive usage, a charge that is based on a charge that is there currently but suspended, or no charge at all, we would expect to sit down with the Department.  We have received assurances from the Department, and I am sure all the people here would give us the same assurances, as to what this committee would recommend.</p> <p>  We have been given assurances that we will get a review of that subsidy and that situation.  We have flagged, and we always would flag, additional charges that have arisen since the previous review in 2008.  We refer to some of those charges here and we would expect those additional costs to be taken into account in any review.  The equity arises in the operation and maintenance cost.  We would expect that equity would continue to apply through that process.</p> <p>  Group water schemes have been getting capital grants towards the capital costs of new group water schemes and upgrading old group water schemes.  The old group water schemes I am talking about in were installed in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.  Those group water schemes were effectively in a mess in the late 1990s and were the subject of a European Court of Justice case.  There had always been grants for the group water scheme sector, but at that stage the grants were significantly increased.  A serious amount of work was done under that rural water programme, as it was, again in partnership with the Department and local authorities through the national rural water services committee.  That work has been done.</p> <p>  Without fear of contradiction, I can say that at this stage the group water scheme sector, through that grant aid process, is probably in a better position from an infrastructural point of view than Irish Water.  All the reports we have seen to date indicate that Irish Water is in need of serious investment in order to bring its infrastructure up to date.  We are ahead of the posse there and have achieved that through that grant aid.  We would expect that grant aid to continue through the process if that level of support is there for Irish Water and its capital costs.</p> <p>  Group water schemes contribute towards the initial capital costs and the capital costs of any improvements and replacement infrastructure.  It is a programme that is very focused on getting value for money and only replacing infrastructure where it is needed.  Around all that, through that rural water programme, the whole area of metering came into play big time.</p><p> Group water scheme committees of management would have been iffy about metering in the beginning.  Through the process of metering, and I mean individual meters for tens of thousands of members across hundreds of group water schemes right around the country, it immediately became very evident that most or at least a very high proportion of the excessive usage or leakage, whatever we want to call it, was on the consumer side of the meter, particularly when the contribution mechanism based on volume of usage came in.  Through that, the usage and demand came down.  The amount of infrastructure required also came down, such as reservoir storage.  There were instances where projects for planned reservoirs could be abandoned because of the reduction in usage.  That was one of the savings.  There was a saving for operational maintenance costs since the more water put through a system, the more maintenance required.  That has come about through all that.  Group schemes would say, without contradiction, that universal metering as a management tool and as a water conservation tool on their group water schemes, combined with a reasonable charge on usage over and above a free allowance, has been the single driving force behind the overall transformation of the sector.</p><p> I will address excessive usage and what it constitutes.  Our research on the group water scheme sector, and we can only deal with the thousands of members on group water schemes that we talk about, shows that the average usage of a household would range from about 120 cu. m to 150 cu. m per annum.  That would be based on metered usage in the context of a metered water charge over a particular free allowance.</p></speech>

I think it is a very good question.  We still have issues to resolve.  We have a lot of very small rural water supplies out there.  We are working with the Department and it is very much a partnership approach.  It is actually 20 years ago this month since the co-operative, collaborative approach to subsidy arrangements was made for group water schemes.  One of the major focuses of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes in the time ahead is to ensure sustainability and we have begun a process of rationalisation within the sector.  We are not content with being as good as Irish Water.  We want to be better than it.  There is evidence out there that a lot of schemes have attained that and we are going to continue on that road.</p></speech>

It was most impressive and useful.  The main recommendation of the Expert Commission on Domestic Public Water Services and the duty of this committee thereafter is to find a funding mechanism to deal with the implementation of that.  In recommending that the State become the main customer for provision of domestic use, it also, to inform Deputy Farrell, recommends and asks that we seek greater parity and equality for those who fund that from their own resources in addition to State help and assistance.  That point has to be made.  It is our duty and what we want to do.  We want to get some information from the witnesses that allows us to be in a position to make a recommendation that can close that gap.  It has not been closed in recent years, I would add.</p> <p>  I have some specific questions to help to do that.  Has the National Federation of Group Water Schemes calculated the estimated cost per household of a group water scheme bill?  In other words, what is the average bill throughout the country?  Has it calculated that and can it be made available to the committee?  How much would complete subsidisation of group water schemes cost per annum, to equalise completely with the public provision?  What is the current average subsidy per group scheme from the State?  How does that equate to the customer, the end user?</p><p>In other words, what is the average subsidisation in respect of each user?  We will end up with subsidisation if we proceed along the road in respect of public supply and we did not compare that with existing subsidisation of the rural sector so that we can seek to address parity, if necessary.  The agreement we reached with Fine Gael put a pathway in place to deal with this issue and allow the Government to continue to function so as to deal with many other pressing issues, as we saw last night, for example.  Can the witnesses confirm that grant aid was reinstated when we suspended charges?  Did it increase because a commitment was given that it would increase?  As authors of the agreement, we need to know to ensure that what we were seeking at that time, namely, to ensure greater parity and equality, has been achieved.  This committee has a greater responsibility to ensure greater parity and equality in the event of it making a recommendation to the D&aacute;il for its acceptance.</p></speech>

There are schemes that get water from Irish Water and those that produce, treat and supply their own water.  In respect of the schemes that got their water from Irish Water, prior to the introduction of charges, the subsidy was &euro;70 per household.  This reduced to &euro;40 per household from 1 January 2015 when the charges for domestic water supply were introduced.</p></speech>

Subsequent to the charges being suspended, it was brought back up to the same level.  It was the same for the privately sourced group water schemes with the basic subsidy of &euro;140 being reduced to &euro;95 and subsequently restored to &euro;140.  The subsidies were restored in full from 1 January 2016.</p> <p>  In respect of the maximum limits on capital grant aid, the current capital grant is &euro;7,650.  It was increased by &euro;1,000 for new group water schemes possibly two years ago but in the past 12 months, it was increased by &euro;1,000 for existing group water schemes.  That is a cap.  One does not get &euro;7,650 unless the cost of one's project is over the full cost of &euro;9,000 per household.</p></speech>

That is where the figure of &euro;7,650 comes from.  That is an increase in capital grant aid.  I do not have the calculations relating to subsidy costs per annum.  In respect of the subsidy, including the costs of administration on the local authority side of the subsidy and the rural water programme and some other minor elements of that, the overall subsidy for the group water scheme sector is about &euro;21 million to &euro;22 million.</p></speech>

That is probably the priority for all of us in this particular discussion.  One of the things I was interested in asking about, and again a written response is fine, is the gap between the subvention and the actual cost.  If the subvention is &euro;70 per household, what is the total cost of the scheme and what is the difference?</p></speech>

Currently he or she has to pay the local authority and Irish Water and those costs are now increasing.  In South Dublin County Council, people have to pay i&euro;3,000, &euro;4,000 and, sometimes, &euro;5,000 now.  I would be interested to hear more from Mr. Brady in his detail written response about what kinds of works those capital grants go towards.  What do they cover?  What do they not cover?  This will allow us to try to make a comparison between the capital cost for a household in a group water scheme in rural Ireland versus those in an urban area.</p> <p>  Mr. Brady's submission also referred to the reduction in consumption, which in some cases was between 60% and 80%.  I would be interested to know if that was a result of the detection of leaks, whether inside the private property or otherwise, or a change in behaviour and a reduction in usage.  Has Mr. Brady any data on that?</p> <p>  Some of us in urban areas in Dublin still have group water schemes.  My experience is that some very much like being in group water schemes and do not want that to change.  They want equity and parity in terms of whatever outcome there is for others.  However, I also deal with people in group water schemes who would prefer to be in the public water system.  The difficulty, of course, is that historically the local authority was not able to fund the work, so in a sense they are outside the public water scheme but not by choice.  How reflective are those two experiences of Mr. Brady's affiliates?  Is there a desire among some to retain their current position but, obviously, to improve its funding?  Do others want to be part of a public water scheme or does it depend on the circumstances and the funding that would allow it?</p></speech>

There are quite a number of group water schemes that have made the decision or are waiting to make a decision to apply to be taken in charge by Irish Water, as it is now, under the terms of the Water Services Act.  We have worked with Irish Water and the Department, in a partnership way, to develop protocols and procedures in this regard.  Those protocols and procedures are as good as finalised at this stage and work has started on taking over those schemes.  Obviously, those involved in the schemes would like to move this forward more quickly.  We will work with the Department and Irish Water to do that but, of course, funding comes into all of this.</p> <p>  On the reduction in demand, it was a combination of leakage and change in practices, but it was all down to the fact that, whether they fixed the leak or changed their practices, with the volumetric charging in place they were going to have a cost.  Even I, in my situation at home, came across a leak that I would not have come across only for my having a meter in place.  It could potentially have cost thousands over years.  As I knew it would happen and was aware of the implications for the environment and every other thing, I made sure to fix the leak.</p><p>That is what we are experiencing all the time.  The other questions have been asked.</p></speech>

It was not quite half in some cases and more in others.  The level was pretty high in some schemes, and there was very high usage.  As members will see from the submission from the federation, there is a lot more pipework in a group water scheme per household than there is for households under Irish Water.  Therefore, the measure was essential.  Obviously, the bulk meter did a significant job in identifying sections of main posing a problem.  The tendency in the local group scheme was to believe the system was leaking like a sieve, leading to the view that the pipework should be replaced.  Replacing the pipework would not have actually solved the problem because most of the loss was not in the pipe at all but on the consumer side of the connection.  We could not have identified that without the individual meters.  That explains what we very much tend to favour.  At a number of seminars we had recently, we asked group scheme administrators which of all the technological advances of recent years has been most significant.  Without exception, they replied it was the introduction of individual metering.</p></speech>

I read <i>Rural Water News</i>.  There is a very important editorial in it that is written in bold by the delegates.  I agree with it very much.  It states that to ignore the group water scheme subsidy arrangement introduced originally when public domestic water charges were abolished in the late 1990s leads to a one-sided debate and an unnecessary and unhelpful urban&ndash;rural division on the water issue.  The good news, it states, is that advance payments at the restored subsidy rate were paid out to schemes in mid-December by way of a supplementary payment.  For me, that is very important because there has been an attempt to create an urban&ndash;rural divide, which is not at all helpful.  Those of us who campaigned against water charges did so for everybody.  Is it fair to say the fortunes of those on group water schemes, in terms of the amount they end up paying out of their own pocket, have fluctuated in line with those of people in the public water scheme, albeit not to a point of complete fairness because I do not believe such a point exists?  When water charges were abolished, the subsidy was introduced.  When water charges were reintroduced, the subsidy was cut, and when water charges were suspended, the subsidy was increased again.  Have the interests of those on group water schemes not fluctuated together with those in the public scheme?</p></speech>

Following the report of the expert panel, there was a tendency to present those on group water schemes as victims.  We do not see ourselves as victims.  We have worked under various Ministers from various parties, and the Department has consistently been a huge boon to the scheme.  That was not being reflected in the commentary immediately after the report of the expert panel.  All sides of the House recognise that the schemes are doing a job.</p> <p>  The subsidy associated with the group water scheme is, of course, predicated on the existence of free water, as they call it, on the public side.  We do not take issue with that.  We do not take issue with the recommendation that it be financed through the public Exchequer.  Clearly, many schemes could not function without subsidisation at present.  It is important to us but we have to come back to what Mr. Brady mentioned in respect of our relationship with the Department.  We have total confidence because, over the years, a partnership arrangement developed in which the concerns of the group water scheme sector have been reflected.  We see what is happening on the public sector being reflected.   In the review of subsidisation in 2013, a set of principles was agreed.  We would certainly be up to submitting them.  Among them is the principle that equity will always be maintained for the group water schemes sector.  Therefore, we are very confident that the Houses will reflect that.</p></speech>

To follow up on that, I have a point related to some questions already asked.  If we arrive at a position in which those under Irish Water do not have any charges, we must have an arrangement whereby, at least in terms of current expenditure as opposed to capital expenditure, those in group water schemes do not end up paying charges from their own pockets.  Some of Deputy Barry Cowen's questions were on figuring out how much that would cost.  The question on the average bill for an individual is very important.</p><p>I have heard that the average charge, with the subsidy, would be around &euro;100, &euro;120 or &euro;140.  Is that in the right ballpark?  If subsidies were doubled, at a cost of &euro;25 million, we would probably be able to eliminate current charges.  What is the experience of the witnesses in regard to this question?</p></speech>

On the question of eliminating charges, because of the success of the model until now, I cannot see group water charges going back to a situation where they do not have a direct contribution from members, agreed on the basis of usage.  The Deputy is right that a doubling of the subsidy would mean an extra &euro;20 million or &euro;21 million for the group water scheme sector.</p> <p>  Mr. McDonald set out the principles, which are fair treatment between drinking water consumers and the public group water sectors; recognition of particular cost structures and networks; subsidies continuing to be tied to conditions which support customer charters, compliance and optimal management; ensuring the combination of capital grants and operational subvention to provide schemes with the capacity to sustain drinking water quality improvements; arrangements which are as straightforward as possible and which recognise the scale of the sector; and promoting water conservation and source protection.  We are confident that those principles will apply in any review of the subsidy.  Our organisation was founded back in 1997 on parity and equity and we have fought for those since then.  We have worked with the Department and with successive Governments and Ministers, we have been very successful and we expect to continue with that success.  We are delighted that the expert commission recognises that and we are delighted with the response we are getting from this committee and the fact that its members are also concerned about equity and parity.</p></speech>

It is very important for the committee, in its deliberations, to have some understanding of a typical bill for a person on a group water scheme.  If we are to be treated fairly and equitably, which is what we all want and which is a recommendation of the expert commission, we need an understanding around those figures.  There will be realism about our recommendations as to how this may be subsidised by the State.  I acknowledge the work done by group water schemes on supply maintenance and the treatment of their own water supplies and this needs to be continuously maintained and subsidised.  We will have to come up with recommendations to the D&aacute;il on how we can treat group schemes fairly in relation to others on public water supply.  It is a very important point and I ask the witnesses to come back to us, either with averages or typical bills.</p></speech>

One is within the sector itself with group water schemes amalgamating to generate economies of scale and the Senator referred to the other example, which is consolidation with Irish Water.

I think that is the key issue, and hopefully that will be progressed.  There is a long lead-in period to it, getting all the ducks in a row.  That is likely to begin, we hope, sooner rather than later, because many of the schemes are orphan schemes which are in a diabolical state with no committee of management.  Sometimes they are connected to one another.  There is a lot of work to do there, but the federation has been working closely with Irish Water and with other stakeholders, including the Department, to progress that as soon as possible.</p></speech>

It is a pity that the Right to Water campaign was not here today.  It was invited by this committee but it failed to send delegates.

The other issue in regard to that, and where charges in group water schemes can rise, is that in order to comply with drinking water regulations it is no longer sufficient to operate group water schemes in a voluntary capacity.  There is need for professional, paid management and caretakers to meet these regulations, and we are working with the group water schemes again.  We have a lot of management structures in place.  That is just one of the areas where there might be an increase in costs associated with that.</p></speech>

Is it true to say that prior to the introduction of the rural water programme the management of group water schemes was quite haphazard and varied significantly from scheme to scheme?  Some schemes had paid staff to actively manage the consumption of the scheme.  Quite a lot of schemes had none.  The figures in regard to consumption and things like that are quite skewed because the first active look at the consumption figures on schemes was in conjunction with the major capital investment under the rural water programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-07a.643" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm Brady" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017020700002#Y01000"><p>It would have been based on actual consumption on those particular schemes, but I take the point.  Effectively, group water schemes were put in the ground on day one.  They were left to their own devices for the most part, and they were being funded entirely by the members of the group water schemes.  The people operating those schemes did a serious job in the context of the resources and time they had available to them.  It was for the most part a voluntary effort by very good volunteers.  Volunteers can manage group water schemes very effectively.  The point I am making is that the public health issues in the regulations do not allow the schemes to continue in that capacity into the future but there will always be a place for volunteers in group water schemes.</p></speech>

The group water scheme sector has done a huge amount of work in improving the quality and standard of water on their supplies.  With regard the information that we have asked for in regard to the average cost of schemes, it is important for the work of the committee to actually link that to the individual schemes and the type of treatment that is on the scheme.  Many schemes would have simple disinfection whereas other schemes would have quite detailed dissolved air floatation, DAF, machinery which would mean different costs.  It would be useful for the committee if the average costs were actually tied into the type of treatment used in the schemes.</p></speech>

The American Chamber of Commerce Ireland is an Irish non-partisan, membership organisation.  Our membership consists of the Irish operations of US multinational companies and Irish companies with operations in the United States of America, USA.  We are a completely independent stand alone organisation resourced by our membership in Ireland.  Our role is to be the voice of our total membership and not that of any individual member company.  Our advocacy work focusses on issues relevant to the wide spectrum of our membership and not on individual companies.  We do not advocate for individual companies nor do we make public comment on them.  Our vision is that Ireland will remain the global location of choice for US business investment.</p> <p>  In his letter of invitation the Chairman asked us to engage with the committee on the EU state aid investigation into alleged tax preferential rulings and the wider issue of corporation tax in a global context.  The invitation is timely.  We are concerned that these issues can be used to paint a highly inaccurate picture of the nature of US business investment in Ireland.  In the current climate, with challenges including Brexit, and a changing world order for global trade, it is vitally important that every opportunity is taken to put on the record the real nature of this investment and how it has been to the benefit of Ireland and the United States.</p> <p>  On the role played by corporation tax policy, I need not make any specific comment on open legal proceedings regarding the EU Commission ruling on the Revenue Commissioners' interactions with Apple and the allegation of preferential state aid.  I would like, however, to make the following points.  The chamber fully supports the Government's decision to appeal the EU Commission's ruling.  The chamber believes that Ireland's membership of the European Union has been central to our country's social and economic development and critically important in retaining existing, and attracting future, US inward investment.  The EU and the US are the world's largest trading partners.  We believe that every effort should be made to ensure the EU remains a location where US business can continue to invest with certainty.  That is why we believe Ireland or any other EU member state simply cannot afford to have its tax policy and administration second guessed in a retrospective fashion.  Businesses cannot make investment decisions in such an environment.</p> <p>  Ireland is fortunate in having a robust and independent revenue authority that is recognised as operating to the highest international standards.  It implements a rules-based tax code legislated for in a transparent manner by the Oireachtas.  Any attempt to undermine the independence of our revenue authority and second guess how it does its work must be challenged.  Any attempt to undermine the necessary process for taxpayers, including those in business, to seek clarification from the revenue authority of the application of the law to their circumstances must be challenged as a retrograde step that undermines the global move by all leading revenue authorities to a cooperative compliance model.</p><p>The suggestion from an EU Commission spokesperson that "if you want legal certainty, then you need a Commission decision" does not help the case for investing in the European Union.  Why do we believe this issue is so fundamentally important to Ireland?  There are 150,000 compelling reasons, because that is the number of highly talented people who are working for US companies across Ireland, from Wexford to Ringaskiddy to Shannon to Letterkenny.  Their jobs support a further 100,000 indirect jobs countrywide.  Anybody who has visited these company locations cannot but be impressed by the passion and innovation of this talented workforce and the pride it takes in what it does.  That pride is truly justified, because they are producing products and services at the cutting edge of global technologies that are saving lives and enhancing how people work and live around the world.  Commentary about the nature of US business investment in Ireland and its substance is not credible if it does not reflect the contribution and performance of these people.</p><p> Four of every five medical stents used around the world are created in Ireland.  One out of every two hospital ventilators used globally to sustain life are created in Ireland and one out of every three sets of contact lenses used globally are created here.  As we are serving a global market we have created a global talent pool that has enriched our country, our respect for every individual and our respect for diversity and inclusion.  It is remarkable that a country that for so many decades saw its people forced to emigrate as economic refugees is now a place where people from all over the world wish to come to live and build their careers.  It is worth noting that nearly all the Irish operations of US companies here are led by Irish men and women, many of whom go on to global roles with their companies.  They are building a culture that is informed by, among other things, a commitment to their communities.  The Irish operations of US companies support the donation by their people of over 600,000 volunteer hours to over 7,000 community projects throughout Ireland each year.</p><p> It is also important to put on the record that the economic relationship between Ireland and the United States is very much a two-way relationship.  Investing in Ireland has been good for US business and for the US economy.  Over 200 Irish companies have created jobs at over 2,600 locations in all 50 US states and they generate US sales of $90 billion annually.  The US leaders of the companies that have Irish operations consistently state how their Irish operations have been critical to their global success.  These companies are called multinationals because they serve multinational markets and they must have operations in those major markets, not least the European Union.</p><p> While it is not the only reason for our success, Ireland's competitive corporation tax policy is a very important one.  It was established six decades ago, before the establishment of the forerunner to the European Union, and it has been implemented consistently since its introduction.  On its introduction Ireland was a poor isolated country on the periphery of Europe.  Visionaries such as the late T. K. Whitaker realised that if we had any hope of sustaining a living standard for future generations we would have to attract inward investment and we would have to export.  To do this we cast aside failed policies of isolationism and introduced pro-enterprise policies such as low corporate tax rates.  The reason this policy has worked is that it is implemented with transparency and certainty.</p><p> There is a widespread consensus that the basis for taxing the international operations of multinational companies has not kept pace with the evolution of the global economy, the emergence of new industries and business transformation.  In some cases, global tax protocols were almost 100 years out of date and there has been an understandable public frustration surrounding the operation of the international tax code.  The need to bring matters up to date gave rise to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, initiative.  Ireland has been a central participant in this initiative.  In her evidence to the committee last week, Commissioner Vestager said: "... one aspect I very much admire, is the fact that Ireland is very much leading when it comes to the implementation of the OECD work to make a more global tax community".  Not only is Ireland's taxation regime competitive, by any global standard it is also highly transparent and consistent.  Ireland has taxation agreements with 72 other countries and has over 20 information exchange agreements.  These information exchange agreements provide for the cross-border sharing of information, ensuring greater levels of international tax compliance.</p><p> In conclusion, Ireland has transformed its economy due to key pillars, including the certainty, transparency and universal applicability to all companies of its tax code.  That certainty has helped Ireland compete and that track record has created an investment relationship with the United States that is remarkably resilient.  For example, in the five very tough years for our country from 2008 to 2012, US business investment here exceeded that of the previous 60 years.  This is down to our hard-earned reputation for certainty and to the innovation and talent of our people.  In the current very competitive and challenging global environment for inward investment, it is vital that we protect and defend this hard-earned reputation.</p></speech>

That amendment placed on a statutory basis what was the long-standing convention in this area, a convention dating back to the establishment of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  The political system may not interfere with the administration of the Irish tax system.  In the decision published by the European Commission at the end of August last year, the Commission has taken upon itself powers of interference in the decisions of the Revenue Commissioners.  It has assumed powers which Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann formally denied to itself in 2011.</p> <p>  There are 13 billion reasons for wanting to accept the EU Commission decision, but we believe it would be a false economy to do so.  Chartered Accountants Ireland is on public record as stating that the EU Commission ruling in the Apple case infringes on Irish sovereignty.  Our belief is that the application of the state aid rules to overturn an administrative decision on a direct tax matter goes beyond EU competence.</p> <p>  The boundaries within which the Commission must operate when addressing tax issues for all the EU member states, not just Ireland, are complex but nevertheless are clearly set out in the EU treaties.  Decisions that relate to taxation require unanimous consent.  This principle was reaffirmed by the EU&rsquo;s legal service as recently as November last year, when it found that a proposed directive concerning the reporting of tax liabilities by multinationals would require unanimous approval as a fiscal measure, rather than requiring qualified majority approval as a reporting measure.  Any adjudication by the Commission on any aspect of the direct tax affairs of an EU member state for whatever reason must therefore be regarded with some suspicion.  Indeed, much suspicion was voiced by members of this committee when they met with Commissioner Vestager last week.</p> <p>  Ireland has traditionally been respectful of the EU state aid rules in accordance with its obligations under the EU treaties.  Tax incentives introduced in various Finance Bills have frequently been sent to Brussels for advance vetting before taking effect, a practice mentioned by the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners last week.  This is to ensure that they do not distort the Single Market by selectively conferring advantages which go beyond the limits tolerated under state aid rules.  On balance, we believe Irish tax legislation has been improved by this type of vetting.  Indeed, the 12.5% corporation tax rate itself was created as a result of state aid scrutiny.</p> <p>  However, the Commission&rsquo;s Apple ruling does not concern the design of Irish tax legislation.  Instead, it concerns administrative opinions and confirmations made by the officers of the Revenue Commissioners with regard to the apportionment of the profits of non-resident multinational companies.  I do not propose to offer a critique of the Commission ruling here.  The committee has already heard many of the arguments in the course of its deliberations and, as recently as yesterday morning, the Commission published a summary of the Irish legal position against its decisions.  Our concern is the impact of the making of the decision, irrespective of its consequences, on the independence of the Revenue Commissioners and, therefore, on the reliance that a taxpayer may place on their dealings with the tax office, both in the past and into the future.  No arm of the State can function efficiently if it leaves itself open to being second-guessed by an external authority.  It does not seem reasonable that such a vast amount of money should properly accrue to the Irish Exchequer from a single case.  A company would need to have made an average profit from its Irish activities of &euro;10 billion per year over the ten-year period in question for such a vast amount of tax to be owing to the Collector General.</p> <p>  Putting forward concerns over sovereignty draws down suggestions that Chartered Accountants Ireland sides with the Government decision to lodge an appeal, or is arguing for the commercial concerns of Apple Incorporated, or that we support without question, and this is not the case, the behaviour of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in all matters.</p><p>However, Irish taxpayers, individuals, domestic companies and multinationals alike, deserve some degree of certainty in dealing with their tax compliance obligations.  Otherwise we are all just making up the rules as we go along.  I look forward to participating in this afternoon&rsquo;s discussion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-07a.659" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Clarken" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017020700002#C00200"><p>Thank you for the opportunity to speak to the committee today.  It is an important and welcome opportunity for Oxfam to engage with decision makers in a genuine and solutions-oriented discussion on how to increase tax justice to improve the lives of people in Ireland and abroad.  Oxfam works in 90 of the poorest countries in the world and we seek to develop long-term solutions to global poverty and inequality.  This is impossible to achieve as long as the current scale of global corporate tax avoidance continues to drain essential financial resources from developing countries.</p> <p>  I will not speak at length about the Apple state aid case but, instead, about how to apply the lessons from the case and ensure we develop a global tax system that ends the corporate tax avoidance that is particularly detrimental to developing countries.  The UN has estimated that every year developing countries lose approximately $100 billion as a result of corporate tax avoidance schemes.  This is enough to pay for the education of all the 121 million children who currently are not in school and for health interventions that could save the lives of 4 million children.  It is outrageous, unjustifiable and morally defunct.</p> <p>  In the run-up to the 2016 general election, Oxfam Ireland commissioned independent nationwide attitudinal research on inequality and corporate tax avoidance.  The research found that 82% of Irish adults polled agreed that the next Taoiseach should specifically address tax dodging, equal pay and access to quality public services.  The survey also showed growing concern about large-scale tax dodging, with 86% of people believing that big companies and wealthy individuals are using tax loopholes to avoid paying their fair share of taxes.  It is clear that the people have mandated the Government to act.</p> <p>  Oxfam recognises that Ireland has been involved in the OECD BEPS process and various ongoing processes at EU level to address corporate tax avoidance.  International fora are the most appropriate avenues to deal with a number of issues related to corporate tax avoidance.  We also recognise the important role the 12.5% corporate tax rate has played in our economic development over many years.  Oxfam Ireland is not asking for changes to this rate.  We acknowledge the strong and important role the multinational corporation sector plays in Ireland.  However, we have serious concerns as to whether the existing processes Ireland is engaged in go far enough to really address the problem of global tax avoidance.  Having worked on these issues for many years, we believe the following five areas need to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>  A global tax body must be developed.  The rewriting of global tax rules should be tackled by a body like the UN.  The OECD and EU are not constituted or qualified to represent the international community and a forum which does not include developing countries on an equal footing will, inevitably, not take their interests sufficiently into account.  Since 2012, the G77 has been calling on the UN to set up an international tax body to agree a truly global set of rules for taxation.  We call upon Ireland to stand with developing countries on the issue and support the formation of a global tax body.</p> <p>  There must be increased transparency.  Ireland has agreed to exchange country-by-country reports and tax rulings with its European partners, yet this falls well short of full transparency.  None of this limited information will be available for public scrutiny by legislators, policy makers, civil society watchdogs or the media.  It also will not be available to those most affected by tax avoidance, namely, developing countries and their citizens.  We already have public country-by-country reporting for the financial sector in Europe, and this is an important tool which allows policy makers to identify potential tax avoidance strategies.  There is no public interest in not extending this approach to all other business sectors.  If the recent crash has taught us anything, it is that we need quality information to deliberate on and select policy options that result in outcomes that protect the public interest.</p> <p>  We must tackle profit shifting.  It is obvious that one of the primary ways companies continue to avoid taxes in Ireland is by profiting shifting.  We can see evidence of this in a variety of ways, such as our inflated GDP figures or the very high levels of excess profits over and above what might normally be expected based on real economic activities, which we estimate is in the tens of billions of euro.  Despite this, Ireland's specific legislation on transfer pricing is exceptionally weak and does not give Revenue officials authority to investigate instances in which profit shifting may be used as a tax avoidance strategy.  This needs to change.</p> <p>  Ireland needs to legislate for strong controlled foreign company, CFC, rules, as agreed to under the EU anti-tax avoidance directive.  This should be done as soon as possible, preferably in the next budget.  The main aim of CFC rules is to discourage profit shifting to tax havens outside the EU, which should benefit both developed and developing countries.</p> <p>  Another area that must be addressed is double taxation treaties.  A 2011 report prepared by the UN, World Bank, IMF and OECD recommended that all treaties with developing countries should include an anti-abuse clause.  Despite this, none of Ireland&rsquo;s treaties with developing countries contain any anti-abuse provisions, even those treaties with Ethiopia, Pakistan and Botswana, which were concluded after 2011, following the recommendations.  We call on the Government to ensure all double taxation agreements concluded by Ireland contain such anti-abuse provisions.</p> <p>  The final area we must address is spillover analysis.  Ireland is to be commended on commissioning a spillover analysis of the possible effects of the Irish taxation system on the developing world.  However, at the time the analysis was carried out, there was no access to country-by-country reporting by multinationals, so it was extremely difficult to assess where the flows originated.  Given that country-by-country reporting has been mandated for Irish companies from 2016, we call on the Government to conduct a follow-up spillover analysis using the new data available, which may help to improve understanding of flows between Ireland and developing countries via third countries, and help target measures to end corporate tax avoidance.</p> <p>  Corporate tax avoidance is not a victimless crime.  Because of the Apple ruling, we know all profits from iPhones and other Apple products sold in Europe, the Middle East or Africa are recorded in Ireland and little or no tax was paid on some of them.  This is worth considering in the context of developing countries in Africa.  Africa is a bigger mobile phone market than the USA and will shortly surpass Europe.  Apple is cashing in on this growing market.  Sales of the iPhone grew by 133% in 2015 in the Middle East and Africa.  But African countries' tax revenues have not been benefitting from this boom.  Even if just a small amount of the billions of profits that are generated were taxable in developing countries, the additional resources would make a huge difference to the people with whom Oxfam works and who are fighting every day to lift themselves out of poverty.</p> <p>  I will conclude by telling a story that shows the human impact of tax policy.  It reminds us that when we talk about what seem like dry, technical accounting practices or reforms - with apologies to the accountants in the room - lives are at stake.  Monique Koumate was expecting twins in the west African country Cameroon.  When she went into labour and started experiencing complications, her partner took her to hospital.  However, because they could not pay the small hospital fees, she was left outside the maternity hospital for hours in desperate need of urgent care.  The doors were closed to her.  Although Monique's family did their best for her, one twin was stillborn and the other died moments after birth.  Monique Koumate died on the steps of the maternity unit.  Three lives were lost just feet away from the medical attention they so desperately needed and which would have saved their lives.  Cameroon has a severe shortage of doctors with just one for every 5,000 people.  The government introduced a fee-based system for health care in a bid to bridge a funding gap and make services more widely available.  Precisely because of those fees, care was not available to Monique.  Illicit flows out of Cameroon are the equivalent of 63% of the country's health budget and the equivalent of the country's entire FDI and aid each year.  It is not just the Government of Cameroon which is left short of funds to cover the cost of universal health care.  For the west African countries at the centre of the Ebola crisis, health budgets were dwarfed by the figures lost to corporate tax avoidance and dodging.</p> <p>  We have a chance to build a more human economy in which the interests of the majority are put first, a world where there is decent work for all, where women and men are equal, where tax havens are something people read about in history books, and where everybody pays his or her fair share to support a society that benefits everyone.  During the past 15 years, we have reduced extreme poverty across the world by 50%.  The intention is, with the sustainable development goals, to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.  It is possible and feasible, but will not happen unless we adequately tackle the global problem of tax avoidance.</p></speech>

I have been working and researching the area of corporate taxation and the taxation of multinational enterprises, MNEs, for many years.  MNE tax strategies are complex but often obscure.  The tax strategies of Apple were first revealed in detail by a US Senate sub-committee in 2013.  These complex arrangements were known to very few.  One reason for this is that all Apple subsidiaries in Ireland are incorporated as unlimited companies and file very little financial information.<br/><br/>There are three main aspects to my presentation: Apple structure and tax strategy, aspects of the Commission decision, and some implications of the Apple appeal.  Ireland is very important to Apple in terms of profitability and tax structure.  Form 10K for 2015 states, &quot;Substantially all of the Company's undistributed international earnings ... were generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland.&quot;  The Apple group has seven subsidiaries incorporated in Ireland and three are not resident for tax purposes.<br/><br/><i></i>There are a number of reasons for the success of Apple, in particular the development of organisational competencies, market power and intellectual property.  Apple profitability reflects all three aspects.  Organisational competencies include factoryless production, or contract manufacturing, from which ASI benefits enormously in respect of Apple production in China.<br/><br/>Apple Ireland is HQ for European operations, including India, Middle East and Africa. The US Senate report found that one subsidiary in Ireland, Apple Sales International, had no employees, no fixed assets and income of $22 billion in 2011, on which it paid tax at the rate of 0.045%.  The effective tax rate for ASI fell to 10% of that number by 2014, to 0.005%.  The ability to remain incorporated in Ireland but not resident for tax purposes in any country was ended in the Finance Act 2013.  As a result, Apple Ireland has been reported in 2016 to be the largest taxpayer in Ireland.<br/><br/><i></i>The appendix to my presentation shows various measures of effective tax rates, ETRs, for Apple for the period 2006 to 2015.  The table shows that while the Apple group pays corporation tax, although not at the statutory rate, little corporation tax is paid outside the US due to large foreign tax savings, largely arising from Irish operations.  The foreign tax charge on overseas earnings amounts by one measure to 5.2%, by another to 3.4%.  As a result of Apple's overseas tax rate being so low, a tax credit for overseas tax is also low, so that on repatriation of those profits, Apple would be subject to a much higher tax rate.<br/><br/>The Department of Finance summary of the basis of Ireland's appeal does not refer to the fact that ASI and AOI are registered companies in Ireland, but rather refers to the Irish branches of ASI and AOI.  There are several important legal requirements for an Irish incorporated company, as distinct from a branch.  The country of incorporation has assumed greater significance because of European Court of Justice rulings.  For example in the case of Eurofoods, incorporated in Ireland, there was a dispute as to whether the firm should be liquidated in Ireland or Italy, where the parent company Parmalat was located.  The European Court of Justice ruled that the registered office, the place of incorporation, was the centre of main interests.  This firm also had no employees and no fixed assets.  ASI and AOI were regarded by Revenue as not tax resident in Ireland because ASI and AOE had a trading activity in Ireland through their respective branches but were managed and controlled outside Ireland.  Furthermore, both companies were not resident in any other jurisdiction.<br/><br/><i></i>Apple has argued that ASI could be split into two branches, even though it had no fixed assets and no employees, and this argument was accepted by Revenue.  The Commission states that the two tax rulings issued by Ireland concerned the internal allocation of these profits within Apple.  One branch in Ireland earned very little profit and paid tax on those profits.  The other part, the headquarters branch, earned most profits and paid no tax.  The Commission issued a press statement to the following effect:</p><blockquote>Specifically, Revenue endorsed a split of the profits for tax purposes in Ireland: Under the agreed method, most profits were internally allocated away from Ireland to a &quot;head office&quot; within Apple Sales International.  This &quot;head office&quot; was not based in any country and did not have any employees or own premises.  Its activities consisted solely of occasional board meetings.</blockquote> <p>The Commission comments on this organisational structure as follows &quot;since ASI's and AOE's Irish branches do not have a separate legal personality from the companies to which they belong, neither those branches nor any other part of those companies, in particular their respective head offices, could be said to separately own the assets or owe the liabilities of those companies&quot;.<br/><br/><i></i>Why were ASI and AOI regarded as non-resident companies?  Apple and Ireland claim that critical business activities conducted by or for ASI and AOE were conducted outside of Ireland, for example through Apple Inc. employees or the board of directors of ASI and AOE.  In contrast, the Commission could find no evidence that AOI or ASI were managed and controlled outside Ireland.<br/><br/>Why is ASI so profitable if it has no fixed assets or employees?  The Commission decision states that ASI and AOE had the beneficial ownership in their territory of the intangible property developed as a result of the research and development conducted under the cost sharing agreement with Apple.<br/><br/>One of the criticisms of the Commission decision is that Ireland would become a tax collector for the rest of the world.  The Commission press release of 30 August 2016 states, &quot;The amount of unpaid taxes to be recovered by the Irish authorities would be reduced if other countries were to require Apple to pay more taxes on the profits recorded by Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe for this period&quot;.  The Commission decision refers to two cases where this has happened, namely, Italy where according to press reports the amount was approximately &euro;318 million, and one other unnamed country.  The transfer is indirect.  It is not a direct transfer from the Irish State.  Such reallocation of profit from Ireland to other countries, mostly EU countries, has become common.  There have been around 100 such adjustments since 2005, involving a reduction in profits declared in Ireland, a consequent repayment of Irish corporate tax of around &euro;900 million and an associated increase in reported profits and corporate tax payments in other countries.  There are likely to be far more cases involving Irish subsidiaries in future years because of increased data provision to jurisdictions in other countries, in particular country by country reporting.  Such adjustments could be seen as a form of introduction of consolidated corporate tax base, CCTB, but on a bilateral basis.<br/><br/>Revenue, in commenting on the decision to appeal the Apple decision, stated, &quot;MNEs should pay tax on profits and it is not the function of Revenue to defend the use of international tax law by multinationals&quot;.  By appealing this case the Irish Government appears to be doing just that.  The Irish Government case is identical to the Apple case.  The Irish Government has spent considerable sums in defending the Apple case and there will be further expenditures in the future.  In the absence of these expenditures, Apple expenditures are likely to be much higher.  The words &quot;Apple&quot; and &quot;Ireland&quot; are continuously conjoined in the Commission decision, giving the impression both cases are identical.<br/><br/>In the context of Brexit, where we are likely to seek important concessions from our EU partners, and special economic measures perhaps in an emergency for certain sectors, it is unfortunate that in two major areas, the introduction of CCTB and CCCTB and the Apple case, Ireland is in dispute with the Commission.  There is a high risk that, by appealing this case, a number of EU Governments and, perhaps more important, public opinion in EU countries will interpret this appeal as support for Apple's tax strategy.  Apple has deep pockets and this appeal could last several years, a constant reminder to public opinion that Ireland apparently supports Apple's tax strategies.<br/><br/>The Commission case is very strong.  Apple and the Irish Government are likely to lose this case, but irrespective of the decision, appealing this case is a mistake and is not in the public interest.</p></speech>

He suggested the UN, saying that the OECD and EU are not the appropriate bodies to resolve the issue of legal corporate tax avoidance.  What of the substance of the OECD's base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, initiative?  Irrespective of the fact that, although it is not global, the OECD is trying to get developing countries to sign up to it, does Mr. Clarken agree with the direction of the proposed reforms to deal with the erosion of the profitable base and the artificial shifting of profits?  Is what the OECD is trying to do right and is it the wrong body to do it?</p></speech>

That this has been done and agreed by a body is helpful, but the OECD is not a representative body.  Rather, it is a club for the wealthiest nations in the world.  Developing countries were not there at the beginning and have not been involved in designing the initiative.  That is very problematic.  I do not know any country that would sign up to a set of agreements that were designed without its input.  That is fundamental to our problem with this.  There is global momentum in the G77, led by Ecuador and supported by China, for the UN or a globally representative body to tackle these issues.  The fundamental flaw cannot be addressed by the current initiative.</p></speech>

I understand Mr. Clarken's point, in that those countries are being asked to join something in which they did not have a role in designing.

Those within the OECD process are not going to design a system that is in any way impactful on or detrimental to any of its members, as we have seen in the OECD's definitions of tax havens and so on.  The membership issue is a major part of the problem.</p> <p>  In order to engage with the OECD, developing countries would be forced to pay significant fees that they could not afford and they would not be given the technical support required for an even and fair bilateral arrangement with another country.  They are not in a position to engage with those processes at the same level as every other country in the OECD.  That is an immediate problem with how the initiative will be rolled out.</p></speech>

Mr. Keegan is the expert on tax law.  When I examine how profits move from one jurisdiction to another, it always seems to involve transfer pricing and royalty payments for intellectual property, with the profits ending up in countries where there is practically no tax to be paid.  According to Mr. Clarken, Ireland has only had transfer pricing-specific legislation since 2010 and there is still no law in Ireland to authorise Revenue officials to investigate incidents in which profit shifting may be used as a tax avoidance strategy.  He stated that this was remiss of the Government, given its support of the arm's length principle, and that Ireland's transfer pricing regime should be made two-way, giving Revenue officials the power to investigate where they believe transfer prices to be overstated in Ireland's favour rather than only where they may be understated.  This goes to the heart of the issue of profits being moved from one jurisdiction to another and how Ireland can be a link in that chain.  Will Mr. Keegan address this point?  Are our laws on transfer pricing and what we have signed up to weak or strong enough?</p></speech>

The Irish transfer pricing legislation is in full conformity with the OECD standards.  It is hot-wired against them, so it compares well <i>pari passu</i>with everything else.  However, Deputy McGrath is right.  The mismatch that arises is fundamentally the result of disputes about the so-called arm's length principle and the real market value of items being charged across borders.  In so far as the focus of any revenue authority is concerned, such authorities will only examine the impact on their own tax takes.  They will not necessarily alert other revenue authorities.  At least, that was not the case until recent initiatives on exchanging information across borders became more prevalent.<br/><br/>There has been a strengthening of provisions against potential profit shifting since 2011, particularly in Ireland.  Participation in BEPS is contributing towards Ireland's capacity to manage that.  One of the great pities of the Apple case is that the European Commission's investigation seems to have damaged the BEPS process.  There is increasing push-back from the US in particular against participation in, for example, country-by-country reporting and harmonising tax treaty arrangements because of a sense that the BEPS project is unfairly targeting some of its multinationals.  Many complex issues are involved, but the movement is undoubtedly in the right direction.  Ironically, the Apple decision does not help that.</p></speech>

It seems that profits have been shifted to end up in the Caymans, Bermuda or other places where no tax is paid.</p></speech>

The best way to answer this is by saying that the process is not nearly where it should be at the moment.  However, it is still a work in progress and open consultations are ongoing at OECD level as to how branch profits should be attributed.  To summarise, we are in a better position - not just in Ireland, but generally around the world - than we were four or five years ago, but it remains a work in progress and there is still capacity for profit shifting to take place.  That is why the BEPS initiative continues to try to roll forward.</p></speech>

I thank him for that.  He is a strong advocate for tax justice.  Emerging from this case is the scenario whereby all of Apple's profits outside of the Americas - approximately 60% of its global profits - should have been subject to tax in Ireland as opposed to all of the other countries where Apple had operations and its products were being told.  Where is the tax justice for those countries in that?</p></speech>

I mentioned the Italian case and the Commission mentioned another, but there are likely to be further cases in which profits will be reallocated.</p><p>It is difficult to decide on how profit should be allocated within a firm such as Apple.  The profits do not arise just from intellectual property, IP.  The Cork branches had entered into a contract with Apple so that they have the licence to use that IP.  It also results from organisational competence where the Chinese sales of Apple computers are effectively routed partly through Apple Sales International, ASI, in Cork for a few weeks, a few months and then sold on.  The profits accrue in Cork.</p><p> It relates to other aspects, that is, market power.  What market power means is that Apple can charge superior prices for its products.  I think the profits resulting from the price of the product should accrue in the countries where the sales take place.  This is the reason I am in favour of a common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB.  I do not think that arm's length transfer pricing can work where most trade is intra-firm.  There must be other issues involved.  It is a difficult in respect of intra-firm transfer pricing.</p></speech>

Much of the profits concerned remain untaxed pending possible repatriation to the United States and pending claims by other countries which can claim there was economic activity in their jurisdiction that contributed to the generation of those profits.  Commissioner Vestager opened up that in the Commission press release last August.  It is not as simplistic as Deputy Boyd Barrett seeks to make out.</p> <p>  Dr. Stewart states he is an advocate of CCCTB.

There are reports purporting to estimate the effects on Irish corporate tax receipts.  It is very difficult to know exactly how it will work out.  The Commission has done studies indicating there will be a small fall in corporate tax receipts in Ireland and an increase in other countries.  I think because of the adjustments that I referred to earlier, CCTB, that is, a common corporate tax base, will enter by default.  Increasingly, countries will have the information on which they themselves determine that profits of companies operating in their jurisdiction do not reflect value added and they will seek those profits to be repatriated or to be transferred from where the profits are currently declared.  I think the solution is the introduction of a harmonised CCCTB.  In the long run it would be good for Ireland, good for business in Ireland and good for multinational enterprises, MNEs, in Ireland.  US companies are the main beneficiaries of a free market and that is the reason some US companies have initiated state aid claims cases.  For example, Microsoft and other companies are the major beneficiaries of a free market and free trade in goods, services and labour.</p></speech>

The reason I have asked Mr. Keegan about that matter is I have huge respect for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, as I mentioned when its representatives were before us, but I think it got it seriously wrong in this instance.  We are, however, also looking through the lens of the past.  Let us look at the years when the judgment or tax ruling was made.  There was no legislation stating the Office of the Revenue Commissioners was independent.  In fact, the Moriarty tribunal recommended that, as legislators, we introduce it.  The reason was it had found that the Taoiseach of the day, during the exact same period when the first Apple ruling was issued, had directly interfered with the most senior official within the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to confer a benefit of millions of euro on an individual by the name of Mr. Dunne.  There is, therefore, an acceptance that there was political interference at the highest level with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners during that period.  Mr. Redmond spoke about the independence of the Revenue Commissioners, but is it not a statement of fact that the Moriarty tribunal found that there had been interference during that period?  There were many other allegations of political interference in the case of Ansbacher.  For example, the former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern's brother-in-law, as Revenue appeals commissioner, reduced the former Taoiseach Mr. Haughey's tax liability which was in the millions to zero.  Is it not believable that there could have been political interference given what we know about what happened at that time?  We know what the culture of politics was back in the 1980s and how the Fianna F&aacute;il Party worked in making side deals and having regard to all of the things that have been noted since.</p></speech>

I do not know about it to that level of detail or about political interference in other cases, but I will make this observation.  It does seem that, if nothing else, the Commission has been extremely thorough in its documentation.  I am not familiar, however, with what it would have made of the suggestion of political interference.  Beyond this observation, I cannot really offer anything useful in answering the Deputy's specific question.</p></speech>

However, I do take issue with delegates continuing to refer to the independence of the Revenue Commissioners and the need to defend it without noting that the Moriarty tribunal found that there was political interference.  Because of the level of that political interference the House was required to introduce legislation to make it a crime.</p> <p>  I ask the panel of delegates to comment on the fact that one of the largest accountancy firms in the State, KPMG, is advertising on its website as an "Irish headquartered company".  It talks about the attraction of using Ireland as a global corporate headquarters.  It cites a number of reasons, including that Ireland is a gateway to Europe; that it is a member of the eurozone; that it has an English-speaking, young, dynamic and well educated workforce; that it has a single financial services regulatory authority, a common law legal system and an attractive tax regime encompassing the rates of 0%, 12.5% and 25%, depending on the vehicle used.  Why do we have one of the largest accountancy firms in the country telling global giants to locate here and stating there are vehicles by which they could reduce their tax liabilities to zero?  Do the delegates think that is the type of member state tax regime we should have in place in this jurisdiction?  I ask Mr. Clarken to comment first.</p></speech>

The benefits include that Ireland has an English-speaking, well educated workforce, as well as access to the European market.  It is worth remembering that although we had a consistent tax rate for many years, things did not really take off until the mid-1990s following the peace process, when there was the investment of funds from the European Union in infrastructure.  There was also the impact of investment in education over a long period.  We understand there are global accountancy giants which are advocating and presenting Ireland in this very way.  This goes to the heart of what we want in terms of the need for transparency.  We cannot see a justifiable reason not to have absolute transparency and public country-by-country reporting in order that people in the media and others can scrutinise what is happening.  Unless civil society can do the same in having public registers of beneficial ownership and the publication of tax rulings, we will not have learned sufficiently from what has happened here and there is a real fear that it will continue in the future.  We have not heard a single, rational, strong reason we are resisting providing for that level of transparency.  We cannot rely on LuxLeaks, the Panama papers and all of the solid pieces of investigative work by journalists to provide us with information which should be publicly available.</p></speech>

It is as simple as that.  One of the points we can sometimes overlook - it is a commercial reality, although I know that it is not a comfortable one for a lot of businesses - is that, in my experience - I have been involved in the tax sector for 30 years - most businesses regard tax as another cost.  It is a cost to be managed in the same way as manufacturing, lighting or heating costs are managed.  As a nation, we have recognised this since the late 1950s.  First there was export sales relief, which was followed by the 10% manufacturing rate, corporation tax from 1980 onwards and, subsequently, the 12.5% rate of corporation tax.  When one is trying to attract business to a small peripheral country, one uses whatever tools and levers one possibly can.  It may not be acceptable in many quarters and I understand why.  People are looking at their own tax bill and saying: "We have to pay so much.  Why aren't other companies paying as much?"  The reality is that businesses are more likely to migrate to where they can manage tax as a cost.  Whether that is right or wrong is the subject of a separate discussion, but I am answering the Deputy's question straight.  </p> <p>  To give another point of view, Dr. Stewart mentioned a justifiable reason for not having country-by-country reporting.  The United States has indicated that it will not do business with any other country which provides for public country-by-country reporting.  Why is it doing this?  It is because it has a concern about confidentiality for its own corporates.  I am not saying all of these things are right or wrong, but I am trying to give a straight answer to the Deputy's question as to why a company such as KPMG might be advertising in this way.</p> <p>  I have one last point to make about some of the structures used.  Just because tax is not paid in Ireland does not necessarily mean that it is not ultimately paid somewhere else.  That is a point worth making in the context of multinational tax planning.</p></speech>

The CEO was concerned about the reputational damage that might ensue if Ireland was involved in practices of this nature.  I ask Mr. Clarken, who has spoken about the impact of reputational damage on other member states, and Mr. Redmond to respond to that.</p></speech>

Its voice is heard way above its scale and its size.  The events of the last year or two have had a hugely detrimental impact on Ireland's reputation.  It is important for corporations to remember that the tax euros they pay are needed not just for social services like health and the education of the kind of workforce they require, but also for public investment in infrastructure like water and quality broadband.  If they do not pay their taxes, they will not have the capacity to do what they need to do here.  It is very short-sighted for corporations to be unwilling to pay their fair share.  If the US is not willing to engage with companies that have public country-by-country reporting, we need to challenge it about that because the Inland Revenue Service in the US is also losing out.  We mentioned in a report we produced for Davos less than a month ago that the eight wealthiest people in the world own the same amount of wealth as 3.6 billion people.  The IMF, the World Economic Forum and numerous other agencies that would ordinarily have nothing to do with our arguments have identified this as a global crisis that will have significant implications for economic growth across the world if it is not addressed.  This problem must be addressed for the benefit of economies and multinational companies.  If developing countries are not given an opportunity to move beyond their current stage of development, they will not be able to create markets for the kinds of products and services these companies want to sell.  This needs to be considered by such companies from a self-interest point of view.  If this is managed properly, it will result in a win for companies.  Things cannot continue as they are at present.</p></speech>

The Deputy referred to a phone call between two leaders of a medical technology company.  The recipient of the call is the leader of a team that is part of a group of people in this country who create four out every five medical stents, thereby saving lives throughout the world.  These 150,000 bright people, who are passionate about innovation, would not do what they do to save and enhance lives if they were working in the wild west.  We should be proud of them and proud of the contribution they are making to Ireland's reputation on the world stage.</p></speech>

Nobody has suggested that any such aspersions should be cast.  It is a complete red herring.  I would like to pick up on a line of questioning from earlier in this meeting.  Apple is a member of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland.  Does Mr. Redmond have any reason to believe the representatives of Apple were telling lies to the Senate congressional committee?  Would it not be a serious matter if members of the chamber of commerce swore under oath and lied to a Senate congressional committee?  Would Mr. Redmond's assumption be that his members told the truth at the Senate Congressional hearing when they said they believed there was a special tax arrangement with Ireland and when Tim Cook said there was a special tax incentive scheme?  Does Mr. Redmond have any reason to believe they were stating anything other than the truth?</p></speech>

I think any reasonable person looking at it would say the company has been caught with its pants down.  It said something it believed to be true at the time, but it decided to backtrack on that at a later point when it discovered that it was going to cost it dearly.  I think that is what any reasonable person looking at this would conclude.  We will move on.  I think the point has been made.</p> <p>  Professor Stewart said that in 2011, Apple Sales International, with "no employees, no fixed assets and income of $22 billion" paid &euro;10 million in tax.  This equates to a tax rate of 0.045%, or less than half of 1%.  The company cannot have many overheads if it has no employees and no office.  I want to clarify that it has no legal tax residence anywhere in the world.  Regardless of the merits of the current case - I am not asking about them - do Mr. Redmond and Mr. Keegan consider that the facts I have outlined are acceptable?  Is it acceptable that a company could make $22 billion in revenue while having no overheads and paying less than 1% in tax?  Leaving aside the issue of Ireland, do Mr. Keegan and Mr. Redmond believe that to be morally acceptable?</p></speech>

The first goal of a taxpayer, be it a corporation or an individual, is to comply with the law of the land.  There is almost no moral guidance extant on any of this stuff.  Professor Tony Honor&eacute; works in one of the Oxford colleges.  He has talked about the moral contract that a company or an individual has with society.  Once a company or an individual decides to locate, to whatever extent, in a society they must buy into the rules.

The consensus at the moment, with which I agree, is that it is not.  That is why we have a thing called the base erosion and profit sharing, BEPS, project.  The idea behind the BEPS project is to eliminate the kind of mismatches that make the global system inequitable in the first place.  My organisation and I support that stance.  We are the single organisation that has made the most technical input into the BEPS process over the past three years.  We are constantly in correspondence with the OECD on the project, making suggestions and offering views on its consultations papers.  We really want to make this happen.</p> <p>  I reiterate the point that I made to Deputy Michael McGrath.  One of our concerns about the current Apple case is that it is impeding the BEPS process.

From that point of view, nothing would suit me better than a common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB.  It would be fantastic, in theory, to have a common system where everybody knew exactly where they stood in terms of taxation.  The system has two fatal flaws.  First, because it would be centralised to Brussels it would not give Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann the kind of flexibility it might need to change the situation to meet a different economic circumstance.  Second, because the tax arbitrage is all about mismatches and because CCCTB is effectively an EU-based system, it does not address a huge part of the problem.  I mean the mismatch between the likes of countries on the far side of the Atlantic and countries in the Far East.  One has a local solution to a global problem.  The upshot of that might be that those who are involved in the local solution might ultimately do this.  Philosophically, I have no particular difficulty with the scheme.  My concerns about it are practical.  </p></speech>

Would Mr. Clarken from Oxfam agree it is fair to say that the major contributing factor to the staggering level of inequality he has identified in his recent report about eight people owning the same wealth as half the world's population is corporations that do not want to pay tax?  I know there are lots of contributory factors.  Would Mr. Clarken say that is the major contributing factor?  What does he think we will be faced with if we do not address the problem in a serious manner in terms of redistributing the wealth that has become heavily concentrated at the top?  </p> <p>  I shall ask Dr. Stewart a question as I am out of time.  Perhaps both witnesses can answer together.  I have read the TASC seminar report put together by Dr. Stewart and Mr. Cillian Doyle on the section 110 issue to which Dr. Stewart alluded earlier.  The report is brilliant and quite shocking.  Dr. Stewart has said that 2,500 financial vehicle corporations, FVCs, could be benefitting from the provisions of section 110, which essentially is a scheme whereby no tax is paid on assets worth hundreds of billions of euro.  If I have understood correctly what Dr. Stewart said - I ask him to confirm and elaborate slightly -  there is little or no regulation on this area and there is not even joined-up thinking between the Central Bank and Revenue in terms of getting information on these firms.  Dr. Stewart cited a range of stockbrokers, financial organisations, etc. that tout Ireland as a country without financial regulation and in which virtually no tax is paid on assets worth hundreds of billions of euro.  I ask him to comment further on that point.    </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-02-07a.781" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Clarken" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017020700002#J03600"><p>I can answer the Deputy's question on impact.  Without doubt, tax avoidance of this scale has a massive impact and we know it amounts to &euro;100 billion in developing countries.  It amounts to trillions of euro when one considers individual wealth as well as corporation wealth that has not been taxed in the places that it should have been taxed.</p> <p>  Let us remember, as I have tried to illustrate, the difference between a health service that works and one that works less well is people dying in huge numbers.  Similarly, it means children not being educated from the ages of five years upwards or children dying.  That is how serious this problem is.  I have outlined the human face and impact of tax avoidance.  It has a massive impact on the lives of ordinary people across the world.  Tax avoidance must resonate as a justice issue.  We need global corporations to be successful, innovative and produce great products and services in order that society at large will benefit.</p><p>Corporations once thought of themselves as organisations that were to contribute to society as opposed to just quarterly reporting on profit improvements.  As was quoted, surely the moral contract with a society is the society where one is based.  That is where it starts.  When we see corporations in developing countries often not paying tax yet benefiting from the resources of that country, whether they be natural or human resources, and the benefits governments in those countries provide to them to make the money they want to make, there is a complete mismatch.</p><p> Our major concern is that the inequality growth we are seeing, and it is important that people understand it is getting worse year on year, is a huge impediment to development.  We are fearful that it is an impediment to our ambition to eradicate extreme poverty, which might sound like a big dream but if we continue at the pace we have been going in the past 20 years we could do that.  There is a real concern, and not just on the part of organisations like Oxfam but also the IMF, the World Economic Forum and other such organisations, that unless this is tackled head-on we will be looking at reversing some of the progress we have made rather than getting to the finish line.  It has to be a priority for all of us.</p></speech>

Regarding section 110, section 110 refers to this particular section in the 1997 Finance Act which underwrites an earlier provision.  The basic idea was to encourage securitisation in the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC.  Rather confusingly, there are two types of companies that may be section 110 companies.  There are financial vehicle corporations, FVCs, that the Central Bank has been looking at for years and in which the European Central Bank, ECB, has been very interested, and then special purpose vehicles, SPVs, that may benefit also under this provision.  There are thousands of special purpose vehicles in Ireland, only a small number of which are section 110 vehicles.</p> <p>  An interesting aspect is that according to Revenue data, there are approximately 2,200 of these that are alive; they are trading.  However, according to Central Bank data there appears to be only about 1,650 so one of the issues Cillian Doyle and myself have been doing research on is to try to explain that gap.  One of the possible reasons we have for explaining that gap is regulatory problems in locating an FVC and an SPV because it seems to us that the only way the Revenue finds out that a company is a section 110 company is when it is sending in its annual report and accounts.  The Central Bank is supposed to collect this data within one week of anything trading but many companies do not seem to report to the Central Bank.  Interestingly, many of the companies that have bought distressed property are in the Central Bank registry as a FVC but they are not strictly an FVC.  There are many other companies that are simply omitted.  That area certainly deserves much more research.  I hope that is helpful to the Deputy.</p></speech>

My question is to Mr. Keegan.  I believe it was Leona Helmsley who said that only the little people pay taxes.  Is this a case of the little companies pay tax and the larger companies can get away without paying tax because they can employ tax lawyers that are good enough to help them do that?</p></speech>

The Deputy heard testimony from the Revenue Commissioners to the extent that approximately 40% of corporation is paid by fewer than a dozen companies.  That principle also extends to our income tax system where, effectively, 75% of all income tax is paid by about 25% of wage earners.</p> <p>  If a company of a sufficient size can operate in a multinational environment, going back to the point I made earlier that companies regard tax as a cost and will do what they can legitimately to manage that cost, it can put strategies in place that many of us cannot.  American companies can put strategies in place that many European companies cannot because of a particular mismatch in the way tax is computed in both territories, but that is the world in which we find ourselves.  I do not believe it necessarily falls based on this case.</p></speech>

It may not be paying tax in Ireland but it is accountable in a country we know we can deal with, and that is important.<br/><br/>In terms of property, the only observation I would make is that there is a long-standing position in Irish tax law that any asset which derives value from land or property in the State is <i>prima facie</i>taxable in the State.

One of the factors that goes into the allocation of profit is, of course, the size of assets in a country.  I note that with the wind-down of the double Irish many companies have been transferring intellectual property to Ireland and it is not obvious to me that we would lose a significant amount of tax revenue.</p> <p>  In any case, we will lose tax revenue because of these collaborative adjustments that I referred to earlier.  The way ahead to a rational tax system is in terms of CCCTB.  It is a tax change that will cement the benefits of the free market.  It is ultimately to the benefit of all companies operating in Ireland that one can sell goods freely throughout the EU.</p> <p>  By the way, it would be a complete disaster if Ireland even thought about leaving the EU, never mind that one might have discussed it.  This is not the matter to be discussing at present in light of Brexit, Trump, etc.</p></speech>

Many get much more air time than he does.</p> <p>  On the repatriation of profits to the US from those stateless companies, I recall Mr. Tim Cook clearly stating in an interview that there is a fund of billions of dollars for when Apple repatriates its profits.  Should it be the country where the product is invented, created and formed that would take the bulk of the profits?</p></speech>

For example, the country where the intellectual property, IP, was created, that is, America, has transferred the rights to those assets to Cork and the value is located in Cork.  One might dispute the price that Cork subsidiaries paid for that but that is a different issue.  The rights are located in Cork and that is where the intellectual property is held and where the profits are located.</p> <p>  Those who know far more about tax than I would say it is plausible to repatriate profits to the US under current legislation without triggering a tax charge of anywhere near 35%.  The problem is it is difficult to get in very large sums.  If one were trying to get in a couple of billion dollars, one would be hit but by nothing like 35%.  That is why Apple has engaged in various alternative tax strategies.</p></speech>

CCTB and CCCTB is a rational way of organising the intra-country allocation of profits.  The OECD, unfortunately, has gone down the route of setting prices at arm's length.  Most trade that takes place in Ireland is within the firm and most of the trade takes place within the firm in monopolistic or oligopolistic-type structures, such as Google and Apple.  Determining the arm's length price is very difficult and subject to massive litigation.  It is out of date and a formulary approach, such as the CCTB, is a much more rational way of organising that.</p> <p>  By the way, the tax rate in Ireland would remain the same.  We could still have different tax rates.</p></speech>

For example, if Ireland was not a member of the OECD and suddenly this body decided to design a new system that we were not part of, would we around here think it acceptable to join that after the rules had been created?  More than 100 country Governments have been excluded from the agenda setting.  I mentioned that at the start.  I should have also said the OECD's processes are opaque.  It has already determined that it will not be critical of countries within the club, for example, it has narrowly defined what a tax haven is.  Understandably, the OECD is committed to advancing the benefit to its members, as opposed to the world which is what we think needs to happen, and it has limited its agenda specifically to BEPS whereas a UN body could have a much broader remit.</p> <p>  Also, there is a lack of transparency and possibility to engage with and challenge the OECD on these processes, compared with what a UN-mandated body would be obliged to do, for civil society, for media and for opposition to the various proposals that are being put forward.  It is important that the membership involved in this matters.  The OECD is based in Paris and developing countries have limited enough access to it.  In the UN institutions, the poorest countries are given financial support to participate where they do not necessarily have the technical or financial expertise or capacity to be involved.  By definition, it will be an unbalanced outcome.  We have to acknowledge it is better than where we were but it is not the right vehicle.</p></speech>

Some other countries within the OECD still have not moved.

Did any first-mover benefit accrue to ourselves?</p></speech>

It introduces a lot of complexities into the tax system.  It makes what is already complex even more complex.  There is also emphasis on exchange of information.  Something has to be done with that information and there is a problem that revenue authorities in different countries may suffer from information overload.  How can they deal with all the information on rulings and coming under country-by-country reporting so that they can use it in a particular way?  There are greater chances of reform coming from the European Union rather than the OECD.  In particular, under changes in US Administration, the US may become more hostile to the OECD process and may also engage in rather protective practices in tax, trade and other policies.</p></speech>

Mr. Tim Cook stated in the statement in August of last year that Apple had taken a Revenue opinion on how the taxes would be applied and acted in accordance with that opinion.</p><p>The Revenue Commissioners have also said that is the case, that they gave an opinion of how the law should be applied to the company.  Commissioner Vestager, when she appeared before the committee last week, said there could be &euro;13 billion due to the Irish Exchequer.  Is it possible that Ireland could have the benefit of the windfall of those moneys, given that the information was given by the Revenue Commissioners on behalf of the State and that the reputational damage to Apple could be so much larger than &euro;13 billion?  Is it possible that a case could be taken by the company on the basis that the Revenue Commissioners gave an opinion it believed to be correct with regard to the law, yet retrospectively the Commission moves with a state aid case that impacts on the company?</p></speech>

It is important that a good revenue authority in an open democracy encourages taxpayers to come to it and seek clarification on how the law applies to them if they are uncertain.  That is best practice.  That is why I said at the outset that I would hate to see any undermining of that in this context.</p></speech>

I cannot understand the description of the OECD process as being opaque.  I cannot think of any process I have encountered in which there was more consultation and which was more accessible to the institutions and the people involved.  In terms of information overload as a consequence of BEPS, a common reporting standard has been developed.  In fact, the Oireachtas passed legislation in the Finance Act which allows the Revenue Commissioners not to accept voluntary disclosures any more with regard to offshore assets because the quality of the information they are getting is so good.  I have to disagree completely with the observations on the BEPS process.</p> <p>  As regards how the law should be applied, I will make one observation to Deputy D'Arcy.  The Revenue Commissioners were not saying this is how section 25 works.  They were saying that they had a calculation to carry out of the actual commercial amount which falls subject to Irish tax.  That is the issue.  They have to give those types of decisions in all types of circumstances, be they to multinationals or to a self-employed person who perhaps uses his car for private use and business.  They constantly do this type of work and if we impede their capacity to clarify matters for taxpayers in any way, we are doing ourselves a disservice.</p></speech>

Mr. Redmond spoke about our reputation for certainty, which is an important word.  However, does he think companies have located in this country because they were certain that they would have to pay little or no tax?</p></speech>

Our internationally competitive tax rate certainly is an important factor.  To respond to the earlier question, the key reason companies locate and grow here is the talent they find here.  That is the essential reason.  Other countries can compete with us in respect of competitive tax regimes, but few can compete with us with regard to the extraordinary talent we have created.</p></speech>

Mr. Redmond is saying the taxation element of our competitiveness is almost insignificant in attracting foreign direct investment.  People are quite happy with the 12.5%.</p></speech>

It is a very important factor, but, as I said, the first is people.  The issue that would concern us is the certainty.  Imagine if the situation was reversed and an Irish company had invested in one of the states of the US and got an opinion or guidance at state level, but 25 years later it was overturned at federal level.  Imagine how the Irish would feel about that, so it is the certainty piece.</p></speech>

How would that make matters appear?  One hears somebody say to the US Senate that they had a special agreement, but then one hears a few months later that there was no special deal in place.  Imagine how confusing that is for ordinary Irish people and, indeed, for people who are thinking of investing here.  All taxation and rulings must be retrospective by their nature.  When one looks at penalties, levies and so forth they are always done retrospectively.  Why should multinationals be any different?</p></speech>

I accept that we have a well educated workforce but, looking at the tables for education throughout the world, believing the reason multinationals are attracted to Ireland is that somehow we are more educated than the people of other countries does not hold true.  I will move on to other specific matters.  There are many Irish companies operating in the US.  Do they get the same deals as US companies get here?</p></speech>

That is probably at the heart of part of the legal proceedings.  To be helpful to the committee and to reply to the question, my understanding is that there is as much tax competition between different states within the United States to attract inward investment as Ireland faces from other EU members states, or indeed other countries, to attract inward investment here.  There are different state tax regimes depending on where a company chooses to locate.</p></speech>

A poll of international readers of <i>The Economist</i>found that the majority agreed that rules were flouted regarding Apple&rsquo;s tax arrangement.  This continues to be terrible publicity for Ireland.  There are no two ways about it.  It is that publicity and the perception of Ireland as a tax haven that is damaging.  Does Mr. Redmond believe our reputation could be somewhat salvaged or restored by Ireland coming clean and not appealing the Commission&rsquo;s ruling?  Would it not be better if Ireland admitted that  it had done things wrong in the past, that it did not have tax fairness or transparency, and that it lacked what I would call a progressive tax system?  If we said we will do it right in the future, would that not create absolute certainty for companies?</p></speech>

That is not just me saying it.  It has been put on the record of this committee by Pierre Moscovici, European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs, Jos&eacute; &Aacute;ngel Gurr&iacute;a, the Secretary General of the OECD, and Pascal Saint-Amans, the leader of the OECD&rsquo;s BEPS project.  Tax havens do not have over 70 tax treaties and 20 information exchange agreements.  Tax havens are not fourth in the world to sign a bilateral agreement with the United States of America on its Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.  Tax havens do not have 250,000 people working and creating brilliant products and services which are saving and enhancing lives around the world.  That is why I keep saying to the committee that we need to put the facts out about the substance and depth of the US-Ireland relationship.</p></speech>

That goes without saying.  I know figures fluctuate from here and there on direct and indirect investment and so forth.  It is difficult to substantiate them but it is well-recognised we have a positive relationship with the US.  We want to protect that in terms of investment both ways, both from Ireland and back.  We are just trying to get to the crux of fairness and tax justice.</p> <p>  Mr. Clarken&rsquo;s recent report labelled Ireland a tax haven, which provoked much anger.  What is the most internationally-recognised measure of what is and what is not a tax haven?  Based on the OECD&rsquo;s assessment, how many tax havens are there in the world?</p></speech>

I will not engage in semantics but any destination which facilitates, inadvertently or otherwise, grand-scale tax avoision or profit shifting can be considered detrimental to other countries.  That is where we would be positioning this.  Looking at a number of indicators, we described how Ireland plays out within that system.  More importantly, going back to the core argument, there is a real global problem and Ireland is somehow part of it.  It is up to us to do everything we can as part of a multilateral arrangement to improve that system for the benefit of Irish citizens and people all over the world.  It is possible and doable.</p> <p>  I would contend an earlier assertion about BEPS.  Transparency is not at the heart of BEPS.  We are not talking about public country-by-country reporting, public beneficiaries of ownership or publication of tax rulings.  Had it not been for the US Senate inquiry, we would not be aware of the Apple situation?  Without having the level of transparency needed, we may see situations like this again, with or without BEPs.  This has to go to the heart of what needs to be done and transparency needs to be central.</p></speech>

If the EU had found out about this some years ago, it would have been illegal then.  The reason it remained illegal is because no one knew about it.  The best way to do something illegal is not tell anybody.  No one knows about it and, therefore, it remains legal because due process cannot take place.  That is one of the problems with this particular state-aid case.</p></speech>

What surprises me in one way, however, is that the Apple case is similar to the double-Irish arrangement.  In the latter, the actual headquarters location in Bermuda, or wherever, was minimal.  It was just a brass-plate operation.  There were some legal differences involved between the two.  It was not a branch involved but a separate company.  Again, it was deemed to be located in two countries and bilocated, hence the double Irish.  It is because Ireland passed legislation making the double Irish illegal for countries where one does not have a double-taxation treaty that the Commission did not investigate this particular case.</p> <p>  In the overall context, it is legally difficult to work out where a company is located.  It sounds like a simple question but is very difficult and tricky, particularly for digital and Internet-based companies.  That is one element with which the OECD has attempted to grapple.  It has had some success but it is a huge area.</p></speech>

I have a few questions on the CCCTB proposal.  In 2016 we had huge celebrations of our sovereignty.  Does Dr. Stewart believe there is a danger that the CCCTB could water down or compromise our sovereignty and our ability to set our own tax rules?</p></speech>

We exchange a huge amount of information with the Commission and other EU countries.  I think that is right and a good thing to do.  There are enormous benefits from being in the EU and we have voluntarily given up considerable aspects of our sovereignty.  It is a bit of a chimera to suggest that we have sovereignty over our tax.  Our tax rate is heavily influenced by what other countries do.  In the context of Brexit, for example, if the UK goes down the route of light-touch regulation and low corporate tax, that will have huge adverse implications for us.  What do we mean by sovereignty?  How can we really be sovereign in setting our own tax rates?  Co-operation and collaboration is a better economic strategy for us.</p></speech>

When we hear the term "deals" being used in the media, very loosely in some cases, with regard to the Apple case, does that compromise Revenue's authority to issue advance opinions?  Obviously investors and taxpayers need to rely on advance opinions, in terms of their interpretation of the law and in terms of certainty.</p></speech>

We have seen in recent times a number of changes to Revenue's procedures around advance opinions, most notably in the last few weeks where Revenue has time-bound future opinions and any opinions post-2012 to a period of five years.  A sunset clause has been put in place.  That, of itself, is not necessarily a bad thing.  One of the other points that generally applies is that we do not rely terribly heavily on advance opinions in Ireland in comparison with other European countries because our tax system is fundamentally different.  It is based on common law principles rather than civil law principles.  Looking at the judgment, there is a mismatch there in the tradition of tax and perhaps a misunderstanding.</p> <p>  To respond directly to the Deputy's question, it is bound to have had an effect.</p></speech>

One of the contentions right the way along, in terms of the arguments against the Commission and in terms of the practicalities, is that this is state aid going beyond its normal boundaries.  We are quite used to state aid rules influencing the construction of Irish law and to getting Irish law pre-cleared under those rules.  This is state aid impinging on an administrative decision by an arm of the State and that is unprecedented.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Keegan to comment on the fact that Ireland is undertaking a corporate tax review, as announced in the budget.  I also invite him to comment on the loopholes that have been closed off, including the so-called double Irish relating to stateless companies that are incorporated within the Companies Registration Office, CRO, the section 110 companies and so forth.  What are his views on how the Government has responded in this budget to ensure that our tax system is transparent and that loopholes that were being used in an inappropriate manner are closed off?</p></speech>

We talk about our conflict, for want of a better word, with the European Commission at the moment but a range of directives have been brought into play, in terms of information exchange and co-operation in the recovery of taxes across borders, which Ireland has signed up to with some alacrity.  The consequence of that has been that the system has become progressively more and more insulated from attack and the consequence of that has been that the corporation tax yield has gone up by 50% in the last two years.  We are going in the right direction.</p><p>As I expressed earlier to Deputy Michael McGrath, I am a bit concerned about the consequences of this case for the best process overall.  Even prior to the inauguration of President Trump, the US authorities already seemed to be beginning to push back on some of the developments and this is clearly not helping.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; iontach bheith ar DAB, ar an aip agus ar l&iacute;ne, ach m&aacute; t&aacute;imid d&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoi seo agus m&aacute; t&aacute;imid ag iarraidh a bheith ar chomhchaighde&aacute;n le st&aacute;isi&uacute;n eile at&aacute; ar FM, caithfimid bheith ar na hard&aacute;in ch&eacute;anna leo.  Maidir len&aacute;r l&aacute;ithreoir&iacute;, t&aacute;imid ag iarraidh go mbeidh lean&uacute;nachas ann agus t&aacute;imid ag iarraidh go n-aithneoidh an pobal na gl&oacute;rtha at&aacute; le cloiste&aacute;il.  T&aacute; na l&aacute;ithreoir&iacute; ar fad ag obair go deonach linn faoi l&aacute;thair.

T&aacute; s&eacute; an-th&aacute;bhachtach d&uacute;inn go mbeidh an lean&uacute;nachas sin ann.<br/><br/>Chomh maith leis sin, t&aacute;imid ag d&eacute;anamh ceardlanna raidi&oacute; i me&aacute;nscoileanna agus i mbunscoileanna faoi l&aacute;thair.  Sin rud at&aacute;imid ag diri&uacute; air i mbliana i gceart.  T&aacute; an-t&oacute;ir ar na ceardlanna sin agus t&aacute; liosta feithimh mh&oacute;r fhada agam.  Tuigim nach mbeidh m&eacute; in ann freastal ar na scoileanna ar fad a thagann i dteagmh&aacute;il linn toisc nach bhfuil ach m&eacute; f&eacute;in ann go l&aacute;n-aimseartha.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin an-d&iacute;om&aacute;ch mar nuair a th&eacute;im isteach go dt&iacute; na scoileanna, t&aacute; deis iontach agam dul i bhfeidhm ar dhaoine &oacute;ga agus rud &eacute;igin spraoi&uacute;il a dh&eacute;anamh leis an nGaeilge le daoine &oacute;ga agus deis a thabhairt d&oacute;ibh nach mbeadh acu.  Maidir leis an bhfoireann, bheadh s&eacute; i gceist againn bainisteoir, riarth&oacute;ir agus oifigeach marga&iacute;ochta a fhost&uacute; mar aon le l&aacute;ithreoir&iacute; l&aacute;n-aimseartha a mbeadh ag freastal ar scoileanna, ar chol&aacute;ist&iacute; tri&uacute; leibh&eacute;al, ar chlubanna &oacute;ga agus ar imeachta&iacute; sa phobal.  T&aacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach d&uacute;inn chomh maith cur leis an bhfoireann dheonach agus go mbeadh dalta&iacute; me&aacute;nscoile agus mic l&eacute;inn tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al ag f&aacute;il taith&iacute; raid&iacute;o linn leis an nGaeilge.<br/><br/>S&iacute;lim go bhfuilimid tagtha go pointe nuair nach f&eacute;idir linn m&oacute;r&aacute;n sa bhreis a dh&eacute;anamh.  T&aacute; ocht mbliana caite ag Raid&iacute;o R&iacute;-R&aacute; ag cur cruth ar an st&aacute;isi&uacute;n agus t&aacute; s&eacute; in am d&uacute;inn, agus is g&aacute; d&uacute;inn anois an ch&eacute;ad ch&eacute;im eile a th&oacute;g&aacute;il.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go mbeidh &eacute;ileamh air &oacute; bheith ag labhairt le dalta&iacute;, m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; agus mic l&eacute;inn.  Rinneadh suirbh&eacute; siar i 2005 leis an Roinn Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta, Coimisi&uacute;n Craolach&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann agus Foras na Gaeilge agus l&eacute;irigh 75% den phobal taca&iacute;ocht do st&aacute;isi&uacute;n raidi&oacute; tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge don aos &oacute;g.</p><p>As sin, d&rsquo;eagraigh Conradh na Gaeilge cruinni&uacute; beag ag Oireachtas na Samhna le seirbh&iacute;s raidi&oacute; don aos &oacute;g a phl&eacute; agus, as sin, buna&iacute;odh Raidi&oacute; R&iacute;-R&aacute;.  Mar a deirim, is g&aacute; anois an ch&eacute;ad ch&eacute;im eile a th&oacute;g&aacute;il.</p><p> Dar nd&oacute;igh, an phr&iacute;omhfhadhb at&aacute; ann n&aacute; go bhfuil an-chostas ag baint leis an st&aacute;isi&uacute;n a chur ar FM go l&aacute;n-aimseartha ach bheadh an toradh agus na bunt&aacute;ist&iacute; a thiocfadh as iontach agus an-luachmhar don Ghaeilge agus don t&iacute;r.  Measann muid go mbeadh costas de &euro;1.6 milli&uacute;n ann agus, cinnte, is m&oacute;r an m&eacute;id &eacute; sin.  T&aacute;imid ag moladh, &aacute;fach, go dtiocfadh an t-airgead sin &oacute;n gcead&uacute;nas teilif&iacute;se reatha agus n&iacute; bheadh aon chostas sa bhreis ar an St&aacute;t.  Sa mh&oacute;r-chomhth&eacute;acs den chead&uacute;nas teilif&iacute;se, n&iacute; bheadh i gceist leis an st&aacute;isi&uacute;n a fhorbairt ach 0.69% den chead&uacute;nas teilif&iacute;se.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin bunaithe ar fhigi&uacute;ir&iacute; &oacute; 2014.  Is fi&uacute; a r&aacute; chomh maith go mbeadh &euro;1.1 milli&uacute;n as an &euro;1.6 milli&uacute;n at&aacute; measta againn don fhorbairt ag dul ar tharchur amh&aacute;in agus bheadh s&eacute; sin le h&iacute;oc againn le RTE.</p><p> Luadh linn, agus muid ag pl&eacute; &eacute; seo thar na blianta, nach mbeadh minic&iacute;ocht amh&aacute;in ar f&aacute;il ach n&iacute; d&oacute;igh linn go bhfuil s&eacute; seo r&oacute;-th&aacute;bhachtach.  Is f&eacute;idir minic&iacute;ochta&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la a bheith againn in &aacute;iteanna &eacute;ags&uacute;la timpeall na t&iacute;re.  Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute;, chaitheamar tr&eacute;imhs&iacute; ag craoladh ar FM agus bh&iacute; minic&iacute;ochta&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la in &aacute;iteanna difri&uacute;la.

D&uacute;radh linn dul ar aghaidh go dt&iacute; an tAire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Se&aacute;n Kyne.  T&aacute; Roinn na Gaeltachta cheana f&eacute;in ag tac&uacute; linn.  Mar sin, i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re, caithfimid dul anois go dt&iacute; an tAire sinsearach.  Mar a dheirimid, is cinneadh Rialtais a bheadh i gceist, ach cinneadh a mbeidh cabhair &oacute; Thithe an Oireachtais ag teast&aacute;il uaidh freisin.  D&aacute; mbeadh gach duine ag tarraingt le ch&eacute;ile, ar n&oacute;s a rinneadh le TG4, d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfa&iacute; seo a chur ar bun ar chostas an-&iacute;seal, ach go bhfeicfeadh an tAire reatha an f&iacute;s sin.

T&aacute;imid ag labhairt le cuid de na hoifigigh sin le c&uacute;pla bliain agus t&aacute; siad tar &eacute;is an fhorbairt at&aacute; ag teacht ar an st&aacute;isi&uacute;n a fheice&aacute;il de r&eacute;ir a ch&eacute;ile.  T&aacute; siad ag breathn&uacute; ar bheala&iacute; go bhf&eacute;adfadh muid dul chun cinn a dh&eacute;anamh.  S&iacute;lim gur chinneadh n&iacute;os airde n&aacute; sin at&aacute; ann, mar go mbeidh cinneadh polaiti&uacute;la ag teast&aacute;il m&aacute; t&aacute; s&eacute; le dul ar aghaidh go dt&iacute; an ch&eacute;ad ch&eacute;im eile.</p><p> Maidir leis an gcomhchoiste cumars&aacute;ide, s&iacute;lim go raibh Niamh N&iacute; Chr&oacute;in&iacute;n p&aacute;irteach i gcomharli&uacute;ch&aacute;n a thosaigh siad le d&eacute;ana&iacute; faoi thodhcha&iacute; cumars&aacute;ide na t&iacute;re.  n&iacute;or mhaith linn a bheith ag fanacht ar thoradh nuair at&aacute; rud &eacute;igin r&eacute;idh againn cheana f&eacute;in.  Mar a dheireann Niamh N&iacute; Chr&oacute;in&iacute;n, tos&oacute;idh ruda&iacute; ag titim as a ch&eacute;ile ar&iacute;s sa samhradh mar go mbeidh daoine ag imeacht agus eile.

Mar sin, bheadh muid cinnte in ann airgead a bhaili&uacute; sa tsl&iacute; sin.  Maidir leis an st&aacute;isi&uacute;n a bheith cine&aacute;l i bhfolach, t&aacute; s&eacute; toisc nach bhfuil s&eacute; ar FM.  Nuair a &eacute;isteann daoine leis an raidi&oacute;, is d&oacute;cha go n-&eacute;isteann siad leis an raidi&oacute; ar FM roimh aon rud eile.
