We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as permanent witness to the committee.  He is joined by Mary Henry, deputy director of audit.  The Chairman, Deputy Sean Fleming, sends his apologies that he cannot attend today.</p><p>We will take the business of the committee at the meeting next Thursday.<br/><br/>Today, we will continue looking at the 2015 appropriation accounts both for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and dealing specifically with the internal audit of financial procedures in the Garda College.  The committee met to deal with this matter on 4 May, 31 May and 13 June.  Today, the committee will engage with the Garda Commissioner, Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, who is the Accounting Officer.  The second session of the committee today will take place at 7 p.m. with the Policing Authority and the Department of Justice and Equality.  The focus of today's meeting will be what has happened since 2015, the interim audit report and its implementation.  As was the case at the previous meeting, I ask that members and witnesses co-operate in this regard.  Representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na present include the sole witness for this session, Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan.  She is supported by the deputy commissioner in charge of governance and strategy, Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in;  Mr. John Twomey, deputy commissioner; Mr. Joseph Nugent, chief administration officer; Superintendent Marie Broderick, private secretary to the Commissioner; Inspector Darren McCarthy of the office of the Commissioner; and Mr. Andrew McAlinden, director of communications.  All are very welcome.  We are again joined by Ms Anne Barry of the Department of Justice and Equality.<br/><br/>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.<br/><br/>I advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if she is directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, she is entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  The witness is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, she should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <br/><br/>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits or objectives of such policies.  They are also reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>We are joined by the people I have mentioned.  The Commissioner will be the sole witness in this session.  She is supported by those around her.  However, no questions will be directed at anyone other than the Commissioner.  If she needs to confer with any of those with her today, she may do so in regard to answering questions but no evidence will be given by anyone other than the Commissioner.  I ask the Commissioner to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

This is in addition to the actions that I advised the committee have been taken following the receipt by the Garda executive of the draft interim audit report in September 2016.  As members are aware, these issues have their origin in the funding model set up for the Garda College several decades ago.  These are very complex and complicated financial and legal arrangements that in some cases require us to take expert advice to resolve them and ensure they cannot happen again.  Notwithstanding this, we are determined to resolve them as quickly as possible as they clearly do not meet modern corporate governance or financial standards.  All of the recommendations of the interim audit report will be implemented and we are happy to provide periodic updates on our progress to the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Policing Authority and the independent Garda audit committee.  On that note, I wish to advise the committee that on Friday of last week the head of the Garda internal audit section provided me with a verbal briefing on concerns he had in regard to particular financial matters relating to activities in the Garda College.  Following this meeting, I requested that a written report from the internal audit service be provided on Monday.  I reviewed the report yesterday and, based on the information available, the matter has now been referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, for investigation.  I am also conscious that the Garda internal audit section is continuing its audit of the Garda College and any further issues that may arise as that audit progresses will be addressed and appropriate action taken by the Garda executive.</p> <p>  As the Chairman has said, those accompanying me are available to assist the committee in any way possible.</p></speech>

The delay in the commencement of this meeting related to a number of documents that the committee received late last night and needed time to go through.  One of those documents from the Commissioner refers to the fact that on Friday last the internal auditor, Mr. Kelly, gave the witness a verbal report on the area of EU-funded training programmes and projects and the witness yesterday received his written report on the matter and referred it to GSOC.   Is that correct?</p></speech>

How does the Commissioner distinguish between using section 41(b) of the Act to refer this issue, of which she learned on Friday, within one working day, and taking a huge amount of time to refer the original report that was allegedly brought to her attention in July 2015?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-20a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017062000002#E01000"><p>The Vice Chairman has made a number of points in that question.  I will take them in sequence.  There is a very significant difference between the report that was received yesterday and the report that was received in July.  The difference is that I yesterday received a report from the head of our Garda internal audit section to say that he had reasonable suspicions about activity regarding a particular account-----</p></speech>

I asked him could he complete his report over the weekend and deliver it to me by Monday.  I received his completed report yesterday.  On receipt of that report, Mr. Kelly informed me that, as a result of the audit he was and is conducting in regard to a particular account he identified in connection with which he suspected suspicious activity had taken place, he referred the matter under section 59 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  It was very clear.  In such a significant case, the Policing Authority as well as the Department of Justice and Equality would always be informed.  Mr. Kelly spoke with the Comptroller and Auditor General in this regard and Deputy Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in informed the chair of the audit committee.  All relevant parties were informed yesterday.  Mr. Kelly also informed the European Anti-Fraud Office, which is known as OLAF.</p></speech>

However, she distinguished that from the scale of issues brought to her attention in July 2015 that she felt should not be brought to the attention of the Secretary General under section 41(b).</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-20a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017062000002#E01600"><p>As I said, there are several points I would like to clarify because many were raised in the Vice Chairman's question.  Perhaps I may deal with them in sequence.  The first point related to why I referred on the matters that I received a report on yesterday.  Mr. Kelly, the head of internal audit, who, as members know, has a statutory function, told me that he considers there is sufficient suspicion that fraud may have been committed in respect of a particular account.  On that basis, I decided to refer the matter to the Department and the Policing Authority.  As I said, my colleagues Mr. Kelly and deputy commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in informed the chair of the audit committee, the Comptroller and Auditor General and OLAF.   Those are the appropriate steps to take.</p> <p>  In July 2015, I became aware that a number of issues had been identified in regard to broader activities of the Garda College.</p><p>This is a very specific issue and there is reasonable cause to suspect that fraud has been committed on an account.  That is why the matter was referred to GSOC yesterday to examine the report and to make further inquiries to see if a criminal offence has been committed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-20a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017062000002#F00200"><p>In summary, the distinction is that yesterday Ms O'Sullivan felt that because there were specific allegations of theft and fraud, it was worthwhile notifying the Department under section 41.  However, in July 2015, a date which is disputed and which we will clarify later, Ms O'Sullivan did not feel that the broad issues relating to a multiplicity of concerns on the issue of the Garda College were of such magnitude as to warrant referral to the Department of Justice and Equality under the same legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-20a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017062000002#F00300"><p>Perhaps I can give my view of what happened in July 2015.  I was made aware that certain issues had been raised about the Garda College.  There were a multitude of various issues.  It was very clear from the information that was in my possession at the time and from briefings that I got from colleagues that more information was required.  However, I was very anxious that there would be full transparency on the matters that we were looking at.  A working group was established, with the Department of Justice and Equality involved and with full sight and full visibility from the Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-20a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017062000002#F00400"><p>Ms O'Sullivan was inquiring months later.</p></speech>

I was very unclear as to what had been done from 2008 to 2015, and it was very necessary, on the advice of the then chief administrative officer, the deputy commissioner in charge of governance and strategy, that we needed to compile more information and have a fuller and clearer picture on what precisely had been done from 2008 to 2015.</p></speech>

In the evidence on 4 May, Ms O'Sullivan said she did not feel there was any evidence of misappropriation of funds or fraud.  Does she still believe that?</p></speech>

Matters may be addressed.  In my opening address on 4 May, I said the same thing, and as the audit continues and if issues are addressed, they of course will be dealt with appropriately, as we did yesterday.</p></speech>

It was only in this room that Mr. Barrett, the subject of that letter, became aware of its full contents after many attempts to source this letter, personally and through his solicitor.  Ms O'Sullivan acted swiftly on the comments of the head of internal audit, Mr. Niall Kelly, as to his suspicions of fraudulent activity.  He is more junior than the director of finance.  When the director of finance wrote to Ms O'Sullivan and suggested that a criminal investigation be carried out into Mr. Barrett for a suspected breech of the Official Secrets Act, how is it that Ms O'Sullivan did not take similar action at that point, if that was her instinct as a lifelong detective?</p></speech>

Yesterday, I received a statutory report from a person with statutory responsibility who I had appointed to conduct an internal audit on these matters.  The head of our internal audit unit told me about this.  I perceived, as a detective, that the minute I received, along with some other recipients, was the view of a particular individual.  On the face of it, it appeared to me that it was an interpersonal difference of opinion between two individuals, and one of the individuals had become aware of something.</p></speech>

I made contact with the deputy commissioner of governance and strategy, who was acting Commissioner at the time.  I asked him to raise the matter at the next executive, which was on the Tuesday.  From memory, this document was received on a Saturday.  I asked him to raise it at the next executive.  To me, this was an interpersonal dispute between two individuals in a particular line of management.  At that time, the line manager was the chief administrative officer.  I asked the acting Commissioner to have Mr. Dunne meet with both of the individuals and try to address and resolve this and identify if there were any further actions required.</p></speech>

Mr. Dunne also gave advice to Mr. Barrett, which I think was quite appropriate.  Mr. Barrett was relatively new to the organisation and may not have fully understood the consequences of sending documents off-site, so to speak.  Mr. Dunne also gave Mr. Barrett some advice in respect of managing his documents and his files in a more secure manner.</p></speech>

I will have to confer with my colleague, Mr. Nugent, about what day of the week that was.  On Tuesday, 26 October that correspondence was acknowledged by my staff and Mr. Barrett was informed that it had gone to the chief administrative officer, his line manager, to be dealt with.  That office had previously dealt with the matter.  On 26 October, the letter was also sent to the chief administrative officer to address it.  So that is one piece of correspondence.</p> <p>  The next piece of correspondence was on 28 October - three days later, which would have been Friday of a bank holiday weekend, when the second piece of correspondence was received from Mr. Barrett.</p></speech>

It is not as important as the Commissioner says.  If there was a series of acknowledgements or the matter was looked into or it was a case of Bob passed it to Joe and Mary passed it to John, the net result is that he did not get the letter in its full context until he was in this room with us two weeks ago.  I am just asking directly why he did not get a copy of the letter.  I am not interested in a chronological list of superficial responses that were given.  Rather, I am interested in the substantive issue of why he did not get a copy of the letter and who decided not to give it to him.</p></speech>

That was the Friday of the bank holiday weekend.  I might provide some context.  This was a weekend when we were dealing with unprecedented threatened industrial action by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On that Friday, the third piece of correspondence was received from Mr. Barrett.  Correspondence was received on the previous Tuesday and the Friday and then on the following Tuesday after the bank holiday weekend.  On 2 November, the chief administrative officer had been inquiring from a legal perspective how the documents could be released to Mr. Barrett given there was third-party information involved.</p></speech>

It was very clear, as I have said already, between 28 and 30 July, that there were considerable files relating to this matter.  The focus was on making sure that sufficient information was gathered to be in a position to fully know precisely what had happened since 2008 when these matters had been brought to attention.  That was the purpose of the work that was being conducted by the then working group.</p></speech>

I want to be very clear that at all times we acted in absolute good faith and with propriety.  The minute these matters were brought to our attention our focus was on doing two things.  One was regularising the matters at the Garda College, to make sure the regularity was there and also, in terms of propriety, to make sure that the appropriate actions were taken, that we got full sight of what had been done and that we made sure that processes were in place to correct things that were wrong, to fix them and put new mechanisms in place to ensure they could never happen again.  Our focus was also to make sure that we got a complete picture of the historical context, of who had done what and what had actually been actioned.  What was very clear was that over the years this was a very complex matter.  The record will show that what this executive did from the time we became aware of it in 2015 all the way through to the present day is unravel what is a very, very complex structure, try to regularise it, get appropriate advices, appropriate support and put regulatory and propriety practices in place that ensure this can never happen again.</p></speech>

I want to be very clear.  I have made it very clear, even since I took up the role of interim Commissioner, that internal audit is a key part of the internal structures that we have in place to give me assurances as Commissioner.  What we are doing is very important.  There is no doubt, because we have heard and seen it, that the structures we have in place need to be reviewed and robustly addressed.  What we are doing on 27 June is taking the opportunity provided by a new audit committee to ask it to provide me as Commissioner and my team, as an executive, with advices as to how best that can be put in place, to repair some of the relationships and to make sure that there are proper and appropriate interactions between all of the various elements of the internal control mechanisms.</p></speech>

I certainly was not.

I honestly cannot remember how long the meeting went on.  There is no issue regarding how long the meeting went on.  I believe the focus is on what actually transpired at that meeting, and the outcome of that meeting.  In terms of what transpired at that meeting, I was aware that Mr. Ruane, the head of legal affairs, had sent a report to Deputy Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in.  The person who had contributed to the authoring of that report, Mr. Barrett, was present at the meeting in the college that day - the day-long meeting.  Deputy Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in invited Mr. Barrett over to the reception room so that he could hear what we were going to discuss regarding the content of Mr. Ruane's report.  Those discussions went on and arising from those discussions, the following morning, Deputy Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in sent me a report regularising what we had discussed at those meetings.  Thereafter, immediate actions were taken, which has led to the implementation of the recommendations in the internal audit report, which we are now discussing.  I am not in dispute around the length of the meeting.  It was at the end of a very long day.  The meeting was informal in nature.  If it was a formal meeting-----</p></speech>

In his evidence to the committee, which I alluded to earlier as did the Vice Chairman, the Comptroller and Auditor General said that to "immediately inform the relevant authorities", including his office, was the absolute correct course of action in the circumstances.

There is the money controlled by an account in Cabra but in terms of how it got there, I raised a question here a couple of weeks ago about money coming from Templemore to a Dublin account that was controlled by a senior member of the force.  I presume that is what we are talking about here.  When I asked Mr. Kelly, he said that he was not happy to discuss it at that meeting a couple of weeks ago because it was the subject of an audit.  Again, I asked Deputy Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in last week about inquiries other than the internal audit, and we have progressed to that in less than a week.  The money would have had to come from Templemore.</p><p>There is a number of different accounts there.  As such, somebody in Templemore was transferring money to an account.  Was that straightforward in the normal course of events?  Would money that was allocated for the purpose of the European funding not have been exclusive to Templemore?  Why would that have gone to the Cabra account?</p></speech>

Obviously, they are facts that will have to be established in the investigation.  To be fair to the committee, I want to be very clear.  What the internal auditor has told us at the moment - if I can just quote from his audit report - is that he considers that there is sufficient suspicion that fraud may have been committed.

They are his exact wordings and that is why I think it is really important.  We are talking about a potential suspicious activity on an account that may potentially lead investigators to establish that something has happened.  We have to be very careful in terms of the context that we are putting on this.  This is at the very early stages.  It has not even - I do not even want to say that the ombudsman commission - it was only considering the matter.  To be fair, the ombudsman commission got the matter yesterday.  Of course, we remain there to assist the ombudsman commission in whatever way possible, including with the expertise available throughout the organisation.</p></speech>

While I am very pleased that something is being inquired into by the appropriate body, I have to point out that the timing appears incredibly convenient given that the Commissioner is in front of us today and it puts out of bounds discussions on some of the matters that we were trying to explore.</p></speech>

It refers back to the letter of 24 October where we read out the section relating to Mr. Barrett collecting all confidential material and posting it to himself.  It suggests the Official Secrets Act.  The Commissioner termed that an "interpersonal dispute".  We have interrogated this over and back with different people over the last couple of weeks.  It certainly looks very different to an interpersonal dispute to me.  Mr. Barrett and a number of witnesses before us have agreed that much of this material would not have ended up in the public domain had he not forced that to happen.  He was very diligent in how he pursued things.  He then ends up being subject to this letter coming from Mr. Culhane and a suggestion that the Official Secrets Act should be applied.  That for me is not an interpersonal dispute.  Does the Commissioner regret saying that or does she still hold that it is an interpersonal dispute?  She formed her opinion of that at the time but it is very important that this ended up in the public domain.  We have the potential of a fraud here that has gone to GSOC.  Even that would not have happened had this not come into public light or is unlikely to have happened.  Does the Commissioner still believe it was an interpersonal dispute?</p></speech>

We may be talking about two separate things so I will clarify my position.  This letter was received on 24 October 2015.  It was quite evident from reading the content of the letter that there was, when I called it &quot;an interpersonal dispute&quot;, a difference of opinion in the way that Mr. Barrett was handling things and Mr. Culhane's perception of that and <i>vice versa</i>.  It involved a number of other parties.  To my mind, what it highlighted was the interpersonal differences between two individuals operating in the same line of management and, most importantly, who had key roles to play in actually fixing the issues at hand.  To come to Mr. Barrett, quite rightly he did what was proper and appropriate in bringing the matters to the attention of his then line manager, Mr. Dunne.  That was back when he did do that.  Then, Mr. Dunne was dealing with these matters and this letter comes into play.  It was evident to me at that stage that here were two key people who actually had key roles to play in fixing these issues, which we had committed to doing.  My focus was on making sure that those issues were dealt with and that any differences between these two individuals were resolved.</p></speech>

When we asked the Comptroller and Auditor General whether that was his understanding of how it should have happened or if it was the correct timing, he said it should have been referred immediately or very soon after it came to light.  When one looks at the McGee report of 2008, it was given to Mr. Culhane who then had full knowledge.  The genesis of the most recent report comes from that 2008 report.  Mr. Culhane was aware of that.  The internal auditor was not given the appropriate information.  In fact, the Comptroller and Auditor General has done a very helpful report for us on where the rights and responsibilities are, including those of the Accounting Officer.  It is document No. DE0075GCT, page 9 of 12.  At paragraph 60, it states that the internal audit function must operate freely and objectively.  It says that this requires the full support of management, a sufficient organisational status for the function, and execution by the internal audit unit of work in a manner which is and is perceived to be objective and professional.  The material was deliberately withheld and the internal auditor told us that until Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in took his position, he had been frustrated in getting material.  Given that there is a potential fraud - and it is nothing more than a potential at this stage - withholding information is also potentially a disciplinary matter.  Does the Commissioner agree?</p></speech>

It is not appropriate to withhold information from the internal audit function.  As I said earlier, the internal audit function is an integral part of the control mechanisms and structures we have in place within the organisation.</p></speech>

What it means is that, if we are at year zero, what we have to do and what we are focused on doing as the executive at the moment, as I mentioned earlier, is ensuring that we ensure the mechanisms and structures we have in place are working to maximum effect.  That is why we are getting the advices of the audit committee.  How can we put these structures in place and, if I am frank, repair the relationships that are in existence, because that it what we have to do?</p></speech>

However, there are checks and balances all the way, such as internal audit, the head of finance, an audit committee and a section 41 possibility.  All of these fail-safe mechanisms and systems should militate against any interpersonal disputes.  They did not work, however.  It was only when someone outside the organisation disrupted the system that this started to unfold, including the internal auditor realising he had a right to far more information than he was being afforded.  I find it difficult to accept that the Commissioner sees this as an internal interpersonal dispute in that context.  The checks and balances will not work if these are seen as that.  The ongoing management then becomes a concern in the context of the potential repetition of all of this.</p></speech>

We absolutely recognise the need to have the internal governance structures in place.  Back in 2015, Mr. Barrett did the right thing bringing this into place.  He was there but there was also a new management team there.  That should not be lost sight of.  We were absolutely committed to making sure a light was shone on these matters.  In our modernisation and renewal programme, one of the first things we committed to doing was strengthening governance arrangements within the organisation, including those internal structures - the mechanisms and checks and balances - and ensuring we were complying with best corporate governance standards for the public sector.</p></speech>

He stated this matter was not going to go away and that he would pursue the matter.  He said the Commissioner, which is Ms O'Sullivan, should do a section 41 disclosure, that the Comptroller and Auditor General's office should be informed and so on.

It is a letter dated 13 October 2016 sent from Mr. Culhane to Mr. Niall Kelly - Mr. Culhane would have been furnished with a copy of a draft internal audit report - and he writes "In your report you have failed to mention the action that has been taken by College management to address various issues to such an extent that your report is misleading."

It is more than that.  Following the McGee report in 2008 a former Commissioner recommended that the finance directorate should take a more hands-on approach.  There were five specific recommendations none of which were implemented, by the way, which raises more questions for the finance directorate.  Here we have a draft report in 2015, nine years on from when these issues first surfaced.  The head of the finance directorate wrote to the head of internal audit, accused him of calling into question his character, stated the report was unprofessional, misleading and mischievous and went on to threaten him with legal action.</p><p>In his opening statement to us, Mr. Kelly said:</p><blockquote>I find these two letters totally unacceptable because Mr. Culhane questions my motives and my professional integrity and competence.  I can only view these letters as an attempt to undermine the report or to try to get me to change my audit opinion, findings and recommendations.</blockquote> <p>Would the Commissioner regard it as very serious that the head of the finance directorate could attempt to undermine or change the opinion of internal audit and its findings and recommendations?</p></speech>

This is on page 3 of the letter.  The secretariat has it.  It states Mr. Culhane "said that he was shocked by what had just been said by [Ken Ruane]"-----</p></speech>

It was a meeting that started at 11.15 a.m. and finished at 1.15 p.m..  I refer the Commissioner to page 3, which states "MC [which is Michael Culhane] said that he was shocked by what had just been said by [Ken Ruane] in that there was nothing complex or difficult about this issue and why would the issue have to be elevated to the Attorney Generals Office without all the relevant documentation".</p> <p>  The last paragraph states "He again expressed shock that [Ken Ruane] is considering that there are complex corporate law issues here".  Again there seems to be a pattern here.  Mr. Culhane is unhappy with even the Office of the Attorney General being informed.</p></speech>

When I put those questions to Mr. Dunne when he was before the committee, he said that it involved and included the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Committee of Public Accounts and others.  Here we have a situation where the Commissioner was informed about this in July 2015, she was obviously concerned enough to establish the steering group, the steering group met and one of its discussions was around whether external players should have been informed, and they were not informed.  Would the Commissioner see this as satisfactory?</p></speech>

This is why the Commissioner was brought in to the committee last.  We had the different heads of Departments before the committee and when they were asked about why they did not give information to the Comptroller and Auditor General's office, they said that it was to do with their superiors.  We had middle and senior management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before the committee and I put the question to them as well.  They said that the role of the Accounting Officer is very clear.  The Accounting Officer has a responsibility to inform the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I asked Mr. McCarthy specifically about who has responsibility for informing his office.  Maybe Mr. McCarthy could clarify this again for me.  Who has the ultimate responsibility for informing his office of irregularities when they become known within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?</p></speech>

She was briefed on the issues, she had a meeting with Mr. Barrett, and, I take it, others also, but she was most certainly aware of the issues involved and that these issues were historical, going back over a long number of years.

Ms O'Sullivan became Accounting Officer when she became Commissioner.  I presume that when she was acting Commissioner she took on that role as well.  The report from Mr. Barrett went in and there was a meeting on 27 July.  The latter is disputed as being the first meeting.  Assistant Commissioner &Oacute; Cu&aacute;lain's report was on 28 July, and the Comptroller and Auditor General's office was still not informed about the issues that had arisen.  In the context of the letter on 31 July, the latter did not happen either.</p></speech>

The head of human resources was saying that accounts were potentially compromised and yet the Commissioner gave a letter of assurance to the Comptroller and Auditor General's office that said that everything was okay.</p></speech>

He also told us that, given the information provided to her in July, he would have expected the Commissioner, who was then Accounting Officer and aware of the issues, to notify him in this letter.  Ms O'Sullivan did not do so and that is a huge contradiction for us, as a committee.  She is now informing us that if she was aware then of what she knows now, she would have put the information in the letter.</p></speech>

I am not aware of the letter from Mr. Barrett that is being spoken about here.  What I am aware of is the briefing that I got from the deputy commissioner and the meeting that we had on the evening of 27 July.  I was asked by Deputy Cullinane what I did.  The outcome was to set up this group to gather information and inform me of what the issues were.</p></speech>

On the basis of that report, which was discussed internally among the management team, the Commissioner received a letter from Mr. Ruane in respect of which she is claiming privilege.  That is the report that we are referring to from Mr. Barrett.  Everything else fell out of that.  As a consequence, is the witness saying that she was not privy to the high-level points in Mr. Barrett's report that gave rise to Mr. Ruane writing to her?</p></speech>

She is in a position of enormous responsibility and I am sure she can appreciate the difficulties that members of the public have with the breadth of issues that have arisen.</p><p>If people cannot have faith in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be above reproach, what faith do they have?  The Commissioner is here to try to answer some of those questions for the committee.  In terms of Ms O'Sullivan's opening statement, Deputy Cullinane mentioned her actions in July 2015.  I note that she took over as Commissioner in March 2014, as she just said, on an interim basis until November 2014, when she was appointed on a permanent basis.  I am interested in the time between November 2014 and July 2015 because in her earlier evidence she mentioned mechanisms and structures and putting those in place.  The McGee report was completed in 2008.  Ms O'Sullivan must therefore have been aware for a significant period of time of some of the issues within the wider Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

Part of our focus was three-pronged: to ensure we restored public confidence and confidence of the institutions of the State in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and to restore the morale and confidence of our members.  That was a mammoth task to then undertake.  As we worked through that, the first thing I wanted to do was to ensure we could create a culture where people could speak up as this was a really controversial issue.</p></speech>

However, that does not abdicate our responsibility.  We have put in place internal structures such as appointing two protected disclosures managers and ensuring we have structures in place to investigate all matters.  I am on record as having said since April 2014 that dissent is not disloyalty.  That is relevant in relation to encouraging people to speak up, to have the confidence to come forward and to know that the issues they raise may not always be completely right but will be listened to, taken seriously and investigated, as was the case in this-----</p></speech>

For the first time ever, we identified opportunities to increase the civilian representation on the senior management team.  Mr. Barrett's appointment provides the first evidence of that.  A decision was taken in 2007 that the HR position should be held by a civilian.  That was never acted upon, but when I took up as Commissioner, I ensured that was done and that a civilian, Mr. Barrett, was appointed to the position, which had been held previously by an assistant commissioner.  Since then, new civilian members have been appointed to the team.  There has been a huge cultural shift in terms of speaking up and the integration of garda&iacute; and civilian employees.  What has manifested here at the committee, in the public domain and in commentary is not helpful and is not conducive to that because we are trying to develop a cohesive, effective team-----</p></speech>

In the case I dealt with yesterday, that was the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  Whatever action needs to be taken, be it structural or process, will be taken.</p> <p>  I mentioned earlier that one of the things we have identified, out of everything that has happened since 2015, is the need to give ourselves, this committee and the public assurances that this can never happen again.  That is why we are using the opportunity of the first meeting, that is, the induction of the new audit committee on the 27th to look for advice on how we can make sure that all of our internal structural mechanisms, our internal financial control framework, our audit committee, our internal audit and our risk management process, which the deputy commissioner was responsible for revising recently, are best working together.  In the interim, we restructured all of those to bring them together in a more meaningful way to give me, as Accounting Officer, assurances, to give this committee assurances, to give the Comptroller and Auditor General assurances and to give our audit committee assurances that this cannot happen again.</p></speech>

There is, however, an expectation and established practice that significant matters be communicated to the auditors at the earliest opportunity.  Earlier, Ms O'Sullivan said there were very clear and significant issues, in her view, and that is why she set up a working group.  In hindsight, does she think the T&aacute;naiste and the Department of Justice and Equality should have been made aware of that at the time?</p></speech>

The Chair asked us to find it and get our officials to point to it.  Somebody has found it for us.

I have read it, as have all of the Deputies present.  The report was published in 2008.  Unfortunately, Mr. McGee has his name on it.  It was commissioned by the financial director above him.  It went to Mr. Fachtna Murphy, who was the then Commissioner, and returned with a recommendation from him that it be implemented.  A comment is made somewhere to the effect that it would be a breach of trust if the report was not implemented.  On top of that, there was a recommendation that an internal audit be conducted.  That did not happen.  If the Commissioner still does not have an idea from the Garda's inquiries to date as to why that did not happen, that is okay, but she should make that clear to me.  She can confer with her colleagues.</p></speech>

It is disappointing that she has not done so because he mentioned quite a number of things that were brought to the attention of those who attended the meeting.  He mentioned AC Nolan's report in 2010 and the McGee report, and highlighted many things in the note, and that the meeting went on for well over two hours.  He mentioned, in particular in relation to McGee, the missing records.  He stated that he was told to be careful in making allegations like that, and mentioned that aspect twice.</p> <p>  Let me explain what I am doing.  I do not expect the Commissioner to know every bit of the note but I did expect that she would have read it.  Mr. Barrett stated that it was a very serious meeting where he raised all of these issues.  Alarm bells should have rung.  The 2008 and 2010 reports were not acted on and he brought this matter to her attention.</p></speech>

It is not dealt with in my opinion.  I have asked the Commissioner if she thought it was dealt with and she talked about difficulties.

Mr. Howard wrote to the Commissioner on 25 October.  Let me put this in perspective and I will conclude on this issue.  The letter was addressed to the Commissioner and concerned the audit of the Garda.  Does the Commissioner wish to see it on the screen or does she have a copy?</p></speech>

I am sorry as I am wasting time.  The letter is here if the Commissioner wants to look at it.  Mr. Howard raised serious concerns about the background.  He stated: &quot;Again during 2015, the matter was raised internally within management.  On this occasion, the existence of a potential problem in the Garda College was at least mentioned to the Audit Committee&quot; and he gave the background.  He wrote:</p><blockquote>The internal audit has not, to date, uncovered evidence of actual fraud.  But, while welcome in itself, this provides limited grounds for reassurance.  Over a lengthy period, some of the most important arrangements for financial management at the College were incompatible with public financial procedures.  Some basic controls were simply absent.</blockquote> <p>He went on to outline them.  That was in October 2016, after all the working groups and steering groups had been set up.  He went on to note in emails that there was a lack of candour, which he would be raising personally with the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in.  He said he intended to reiterate the points in the letter to the Commissioner.  He emphasised the apparent lack of candour in disclosing the matter.  He wrote to the Commissioner personally.  Does the Commissioner have the correspondence for 2017?</p></speech>

Mr. Howard said is standing full-square behind Niall Kelly, so it must be after the audit.  There is no date on the letter but it is addressed to the Commissioner, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan.

Mr. Howard wrote a detailed letter again.  He said: "I regret that I am obliged to write to you again" and he went on to express his concerns.  I am finished, Vice Chairman.  There is a letter and there are emails dating to late 2016 and early 2017 and after the audit.  The head of the audit committee expressed serious concerns about lack of candour.  As Commissioner, does Ms O'Sullivan stand over that?</p></speech>

Those submissions, as I understand it, were copied or the audit committee made aware of them.  Mr. Howard quite rightly raised the issue in relation to October and subsequently we had a number of meetings with Mr. Howard to explain the process that had to be undertaken, the legal advices that were there.  We assured him that I and the executive took this matter extremely seriously and that we were fully supporting Mr. Kelly in completing his audit process, respecting the fact that the due process and the submissions had to be made by the individuals that were making them.</p></speech>

Does Ms O'Sullivan have confidence in every single member of senior management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their current positions?  The majority of them have been witnesses here.

I will make it simple for her.  Does she have full confidence in them in their roles?  That is the first question.  Second, does she have full confidence that every member of her senior management team has the capacity to do their job?  Third, does she have confidence they can all work together collectively to the best of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's ability and in the best interest of the Irish public?</p></speech>

Yes, I am confident we are working together to create a cohesive, effective team.  It is greatly assisted by the capacity issue, which means we have had new people brought onto the team in recent times.  There are new skill sets and a different perspective.  It is a very positive thing.  I have confidence going forward that we will and can create a cohesive, effective team.  I think that will be very much supported by the skill sets that we are working to bring onto the team.</p></speech>

Members of the public, who are watching proceedings, need to know, as a result of what they have seen here, that Ms O'Sullivan has full confidence in every way in each and every one of the management team in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I need to know this, as the person who is chairing this meeting.  I have gone through thousands of pages of documents and have seen contradictions all over the place.  I have seen issues with interpersonal relationships - we all have, in fairness - and evidence that is contradictory.  It is imperative that Ms O'Sullivan honestly answers the question whether she has full confidence in each and every one of them given what has transpired before the Committee of Public Accounts on this issue.</p></speech>

It was not until January of this year that we actually had a fully functioning executive.  That is nobody's fault here.  The reality is what we have had to do since 2014 is build up a team and build up an effective team.  In any organisation going through the type of deep structural change, cultural change and reform we are going through, there will always be tensions within teams.  Our job is to make sure we pull together that team into a cohesive, effective team and I am confident we are doing that.  I am confident that the members of the team supported by the appropriate skill sets will be in a position to continue to provide that effective leadership.</p></speech>

In other words, we now know the Commissioner was informed by legal letter, a letter we cannot see, which I will return to, on 24 July and that a meeting took place on 27 July.  There is a dispute on when the committee was set up.  A further meeting or document was put in place on 28 July, which we were told today.  Would the Comptroller and Auditor General have expected that prior to the completion of such an investigation, he would have been informed once the Commissioner was made aware of these issues?</p></speech>

The principle here is that a person exercising an independent function such as an external or internal audit should be given information that allows them to exercise their independence.  If one does not know about something, one cannot take it into account when one exercises one's function.  If the question is being put at a senior level in an organisation about whether they should tell the Comptroller and Auditor General about something, that is the time to tell.  They might only be telling partial information but it gives the external auditor - in that case, me, as Comptroller and Auditor General - the power to assess the information that is available to identify any action we might recommend.</p></speech>

My mindset at that time and when I was presented with the statement of internal financial controls was that I certainly was not in possession of complete information.  The advice I had been given from both the chief administrative officer and the deputy commissioner was that we needed to gather more information to have a complete picture.  I fully accept what the Comptroller and Auditor General is saying and I have absolutely no issue with it.</p></speech>

I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General if it is an appropriate defence for any Accounting Officer to say they would not inform him of potential issues no matter how limited or basic the information is, which the Comptroller and Auditor General has just answered.  Is it a defence to say they are gathering materials and all materials are not available to them so they have not informed the Comptroller and Auditor General yet?</p></speech>

As Chairman of the committee here today I will officially ask her to reconsider that.  It is her own decision but I am just asking her officially.  It would be helpful to everyone and it would be in the interest of transparency.  We will certainly be having a conversation with the Department of Justice and Equality about it later in the meeting.</p><p> In July 2015, the Commissioner said that she had a basic understanding of what was going on.  I do not want to put words in her mouth so I ask her to let me know if she disagrees.  I am not going to ask her about the letter from Ken Ruane but I will ask her about that whole process and about the meeting on 27 July that went on for somewhere between five minutes and more than two hours.  Was the McGee report not appended to documentation provided for that meeting?</p></speech>

The second issue is that we need to know if and at what length the McGee and Barrett reports were discussed at that meeting.  The Commissioner's decision as based on the basic or more extended knowledge she has is a critical issue for our committee in terms of making deliberations and reporting on this.  The decision not to do a section 41, not to inform the internal auditor until March 2016, and not to inform the Comptroller and Auditor General, despite his evidence here today, is based on the documentation and discussion at that meeting, which is a highly disputed meeting.</p></speech>

Let us run through this meeting.  It took place on 27 July, the letter was from 24 July.  We have evidence given to us here from Mr. Ruane that he has a note from 30 June where he was informed by Mr. Barrett that Mr. Dunne had informed the Commissioner of the issues around Templemore on 30 June.  We have a meeting that took place on 2 July.  It is now under dispute as to whether that was the committee that was set up to deal with Templemore.  The Commissioner is saying, and she should contradict me if I am being unfair, that this is the first iteration.  That then moved on because the Commissioner claims in her evidence on 4 May that she acted promptly and immediately once she was made aware of the issues on 27 July.  We have a dispute as to whether that was the committee that was set up to deal with Templemore or whether that was set up at the meeting of 27 July.  Mr. Culhane and Mr. Barrett were in agreement that it was on 2 July that this was set out.  We also have evidence of a letter sent by Mr. Barrett to Mr. Dunne on 8 July which he received on 9 July which also states that the Commissioner was informed of this.</p> <p>  Does the Commissioner not see that these multiple contradictions over when she was informed of the issues around Templemore cause both the public and this committee serious concerns?</p></speech>

Let me finish.  There is a second issue.  Through this process, will the Commissioner as the Accounting Officer, even though I believe she should be aware of it, ask her management team if he was given access to all accounts immediately?  This is not about instructions but whether he actually was given access to all of the accounts.</p> <p>  As a last thing, the Commissioner said earlier on that Mr. Barrett-----</p></speech>

Our understanding is that the Cabra account closed in 2010.  Therefore, I do not know - I am speculating - but the account may have been uncovered in Mr. Kelly's audit process as opposed to someone giving access to an audit that started in 2015.  However, we will have to clarify that because I want to be fair and truthful to the committee.</p></speech>

When asked about when Mr. Barrett looked for correspondence relating to the letter in which Mr. Culhane had cited the Official Secrets Act, the Commissioner gave evidence, in fairness to her, that absolutely no investigation was ever even considered in relation to the issue.  She also spoke about that weekend when Mr. Barrett looked for the letter.  She said it was a very busy weekend and that a lot of stuff was going on and there was a potential industrial strike.  Where was she that weekend?</p></speech>

At the outset, let us look at the exploration of the questioning that has been happening over a series of these meetings relating to Templemore and its importance to public discourse.  In the complexities of some of the questions that are being thrown at the Commissioner, that and why this probing is happening is sometimes lost.  Specifically, I think it is best encapsulated by the document, "A Critical Inflection Point" which she referenced earlier and was written on 29 September 2015.</p><p>Mr. Barrett, when writing to the CAO, expressed his concern about the scale and amount of co-mingled moneys at Templemore - some &euro;12 million over ten years and a total of &euro;2.3 million in investment accounts at its peak - and the confirmation that no refund was made at year-end from the surpluses generated.  This is a point to which Mr. Kelly referred in his presentation to the committee when he said Deputy Commissioner Rice stated in a note in 2009 "I strongly believe that any surplus money does not belong to the State but rather is owned by the members of AGS".  He pointed out that this had occurred since the position of Accounting Officer had been bestowed on the holder of the office of Commissioner in 2005.  This is the crucial point in years when An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needed a substantial Supplementary Estimate from the Exchequer.  We are not just interested in exploring bad processes here because this had a direct impact on the taxpayer.  This was effectively a bailout.  Substantial surpluses were being generated yet, as pointed out in "A Critical Inflection Point", this was at a time when Supplementary Estimates were needed as well.  The Commissioner mentioned her 36 years on the force.  While she was not Commissioner at the time in question, can Ms O'Sullivan explain how these belief systems came into being such that people were of the view that surpluses generated did not belong to the State but rather to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a time when Supplementary Estimates from the taxpayer were required?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-20a.1055" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017062000002#BB00200"><p>To clarify in respect of Mr. Barrett's &quot;A Critical Inflection Point&quot;, the first I saw of that document was when it was here at the first committee meeting I believe.  As a point of record, it is very disadvantageous to be asked to read documents in a committee room in the course of a meeting.  It would have been preferable to have had the opportunity to see the documents beforehand and it would be much better from a learning point of view if they were all shared with the witnesses beforehand.  It is very difficult for me to get into the mindsets of people but I can say that the historical context is that this was a funding model established some time around the time of the Walsh report in the 1980s.  It was a very complex structure at the time with the <i>per capita</i>grants being given.  It then developed and became even more complex in nature and the practices that developed around that prior to the time of the Commissioner's becoming Accounting Officer became very complex and unwieldy.  That is evidenced by the fact that they were so complex when we began the work in 2015 that trying to unravel them and distinguish what was what was very tedious.</p></speech>

I know that some accounts operated independently of each other but the Commissioner can understand people's concern and anger if surpluses were being generated - for example, &euro;2.3 million at the peak - at a time when Supplementary Estimates were required from the Exchequer.</p></speech>

Our focus has been on making sure that this cannot happen again.  By way of assurances, these surpluses cannot build up in the model that is currently implemented.</p></speech>

Does she have real confidence that everything will be unearthed and that, as was said earlier, there will be a blowing wide open of all the policies involved?  On what is that confidence based?</p></speech>

The confidence is based on the 19 recommendations of Mr. Kelly's interim audit report which had been given to Mr. Nugent to implement in full.  Mr. Nugent chairs a high-level steering group.  He has informed me that today he is in a position to inform the committee that we believe those recommendations will all be implemented by the end of this year.</p> <p>  Second, we have put in new administrative structures in the college, including one of the recommendations in Mr. Kelly's report, a principal officer with experience in this area who we are also supporting.</p> <p>  Third, to satisfy ourselves and to give me, as Accounting Officer, this committee and us, as the executive, assurances, our new audit committee is meeting for the first time next week, on 27 June, which is opportune.  We will ask the audit committee for its advices on reviewing our internal control mechanisms and on how the internal financial control mechanisms - the audit committee, the internal audit and our new risk management processes - interact to ensure that we are in compliance with best corporate governance standards for public sector bodies.  We will keep that under continuous review and take any advices from this committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General when he completes his report and from our own audit committee.</p></speech>

She spoke to Deputy MacSharry of that difference of opinion and interpersonal differences.  To describe the relationship between Mr. Culhane and Mr. Kelly and Mr. Barrett as a difference of opinion would be to gloss over what is happening there.  The best word to describe the atmosphere on the day they attended a meeting of this committee is "toxic".  It was unbelievable to see the hostility manifest itself between those gentlemen who were supposedly on the same side.  I do not think it was a difference of opinion.  I am asking about the Commissioner's confidence to the effect that she can get to the heart of the matter and achieve the reform she seeks in light of the sheer toxic hostility between these people.  Can the Commissioner understand that from our position, seeing that toxic atmosphere, we wonder what in God's name they are like when they are away from here where they were on public show?  If they could not hide their contempt for one another on that day, what are they like when they are elsewhere?  The relevance of this for everyone watching and trying to get to the truth of the matter is whether we can have confidence that these gentlemen can work together.</p></speech>

They go to the heart of what we are trying to achieve in the way of cultural reform.  My explanation of the interpersonal difficulties is the genesis of what has happened.  There are very deeply held differences of view and opinion between individual members.  Our job is to make sure we put those into place.  One of our serious concerns - and my concern, as Accounting Officer and as Commissioner - is to make sure that we review the process in place to ensure these matters cannot happen again, and that those very critical structures and the individuals leading them are able to interact and work together effectively to make sure I can get the assurances I need.  That is why we are asking the audit committee to give us advices on how to review the structures.  Separately, we are doing some work.  As I said, only in the past two weeks we have made the latest additions to our senior leadership team.  That is a very positive move.  When we get the new civilian members of the team, the dynamic of the team will change.  It is my job, as Commissioner, and our job collectively, as an executive, to make sure we support the team, create a cohesive, effective team and make sure the skill sets are there to support all the individuals.</p></speech>

There is the issue of the uncovering of practices.  On the last occasion I asked Mr. Kelly whether these practices were wilful misappropriation or incompetence.  Mr. Kelly said it was coming down on the scale of incompetence rather than wilful misappropriation.  However, I probed him further on the practices that were uncovered and on the concerted effort to thwart the truths that were coming to light, a point that was scratched on a while ago.  I think that is as serious as it gets in terms of the issues at play.</p> <p>  In terms of people's interpretation of whether this was wilful misappropriation of funds or just sheer incompetence, if there was a concerted effort to thwart Mr. Kelly in his work on the matter, that brings a whole new dimension.  I put that question to Mr. Kelly and he said: "I think there is sufficient evidence before this committee to say that the Office of the Director of Finance, or in the past the Office of the Deputy Commissioner of Strategy and Change Management did not forward information to me."   The college itself did not forward information to internal audit.  That is a pretty damning situation.</p></speech>

I do not know whether Deputy Cassells was here earlier, but he may be aware that Mr. Howard, the outgoing chair of the audit committee had corresponded with me in relation to certain matters and those matters are in a different process which we are dealing with at present through the chief administrative officer.  Separately, we have to be very mindful of the fact that we are working to make sure that we deal with all of these issues and that we put the necessary structures in place that address all of these issues and ensure that they can never happen again.</p></speech>

Again, I refer to Mr. Barrett's reply to the same question, who spoke about having a very substantial difference of opinion with the finance director.  These are his words: </p><blockquote>I think there is a very significant difference between outputs and outcomes.  There may be memos, there may be meetings, as Mr. Culhane outlined, but it changed nothing.  The show went on.  On my arrival in Templemore I could not believe what it was that sat in plain view despite all the memos and all the history that Mr. Culhane has referred to, it continued in plain view contrary to the blue book.</blockquote> <p>He concludes: &quot;I did not create this, I stumbled upon it, I did not get the &quot;let us resolve it attitude&quot; as the first response.  Those who I would have imagined were statutorily responsible for dealing with matters like this did not race to my aid, no more than that do I need to say.&quot;</p></speech>

What we can demonstrate very clearly is that from 27 July 2015, to date, there were immediate actions taken.  If I may give the timeline on that, on 27 July these matters were raised.  On 30 July they were actioned.  The first meeting of the steering group took place on 6 August and thereafter a series of actions were implemented, which resulted in the 19 recommendations of Mr. Kelly's internal audit report that will be implemented by the end of this year.  What is really important to emphasise about that is that this is some thing that has been going on and an architecture and an infrastructure that is very complex and complicated has developed over nearly 40 years.  What we have managed to do in that short space of time is to unravel that, to deal with it, where necessary, to deconstruct all that had been done and to put in place mechanisms to ensure that it can never happen again.</p></speech>

First, let us consider what the Commissioner is facing to achieve that aim.  Mr. Kelly in his summation made two key points that summed up everything that he was concerned about - governance and culture.  If one is swimming against the tide of the culture - he pointed to the fact that he was convinced there was and still may be a culture in parts of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of not admitting to problems - problems persist in trying to keep them in-house and away from transparent public scrutiny.  Will the Commissioner outline how she proposes to untangle that culture that permeates the force and not just in the edifice of Templemore?  Where does the root and branch reform of the culture begin and end?</p></speech>

Part of the emphasis in 2014, and I made this point to Deputy Madigan earlier, was to ensure we start a significant cultural and structural reform.  May I mention Mr. Kelly, because to be fair to Mr. Kelly, at his last appearance before the committee, when asked by the Chairman, Deputy Fleming, to clarify whether it was then or now, my understanding is that Mr. Kelly is on record as saying it was then.  He openly admits the change in the culture, that he is getting co-operation and he mentioned in particular, the deputy commissioner, myself and others.</p></speech>

From 2014, as well as creating an environment where people can speak up freely, such as Mr. Barrett bringing these matters to our attention, we also decided that we would identify where we had problems.  I was asked earlier about the breath test, which is a good example.  If we had problems, we were going to shine a light on them and turn over the stones and ensure that we not only identified the issues but that we brought them to the surface and dealt with them and put them right.  On top of that, we made a commitment to openness and transparency that would make it clear that they were in plain view and to involve all of the necessary parties.</p></speech>

There are many positives in the culture of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In many ways it is different, but when it comes to financial management procedures, public finances and transparency and accountability and in particular democratic accountability, let us be under no illusion, we are absolutely committed to engaging in democratic accountability to its full extent.  That includes the architectural oversight that has been put in place.  We remain committed to that as an executive.  We remain committed to that not just as an organisation, there is an important distinction to be made here, we pride ourselves on our profession.  This is not about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as an organisation, this is about a profession of policing.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the professional policing service to protect the Irish citizens and the Irish public.  In doing that we must engage to satisfy public confidence in the democratic accountability of the force.</p></speech>

Mr. Nugent keeps me informed of the progress that has been made in that regard.  He has line responsibility but also strategic responsibility for it.  I am satisfied.

I have a letter that was referred to earlier, which refers to Mr. Barrett and was written by Mr. Culhane.  It was sent to the Commissioner and deputy commissioners and is dated 24 October 2015.  It is pretty excoriating in respect of Mr. Barrett.  I think Ms O'Sullivan would recognise that the language is pretty choice and dramatic.  The interesting thing is that the title of the letter sent is "Re Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act section 41 - Garda College".  I find it very interesting that Mr. Culhane is having a right go at Mr. Barrett, up to and including suggesting that he may have broken the Official Secrets Act and all sorts, and defending his honour.</p> <p>  He was quite aggressive in respect of Mr. Barrett and stated Mr. Barrett thought he was responsible for the devil and all and that it is all his fault.  Is it not interesting that this is how he highlights the matter?  He does not explicitly say anywhere that a disclosure should not be made.  If one read the letter, one would have to imagine it was designed not just to take a pop at Mr. Barrett, but also to dissuade any notion of making that disclosure. </p> <p>  He states: "I refer to the ongoing issues concerning the Garda college which recently culminated in a minute from the head of legal affairs [that is our friend, Mr. Ruane] based upon partial and inaccurate representations made by Mr. John Barrett advising the Commissioner to make a section 41 disclosure to the Minister."  Although he never says in the text that a disclosure should not be made, if it landed on my desk I would read it as an attempt to persuade me not to make that disclosure.  Is that how Ms O'Sullivan read the document?</p></speech>

That date was the first meeting of the group.  My understanding is the Department was involved in this.  My point was that there are many ways of ensuring that the Department was kept fully informed and that was one way of making sure the Department was fully informed.  A section 41 disclosure does not always need to take the form of a letter.  Under no circumstances-----</p></speech>

I am not interested in her pastimes.</p> <p>  I want to move on to another piece of correspondence.  This is again from Mr. Culhane, but was sent to Mr. Kelly.  It is dated 13 October 2016.  He wrote this a couple of weeks before he wrote to the Commissioner.  In this letter, he takes Mr. Kelly to task.  He accuses him of being unprofessional, misleading and mischievous.  He accuses him of making defamatory comments.  Ms O'Sullivan is familiar with this piece of correspondence.  Again, the language is fairly dramatic.  Those are his words.</p> <p>  Mr. Howard, chair of the audit committee, wrote to Ms O'Sullivan not in respect of this letter, but, rather, this turn of events because he is obviously very concerned that this is a direct interference with the internal audit function.  He is alarmed by this.  In his correspondence, he said he felt moved to raise the issue with Ms O'Sullivan and that, in his view, the head of internal audit acted in good faith, and therefore he treats any accusation to the contrary as a very serious issue of principle. </p> <p>  He went on to say that the situation can only be resolved if the assertions made by Mr. Culhane are either unconditionally withdrawn or unambiguously overruled by a superior authority.  I understand that the remarks were neither withdrawn nor were they overruled by a superior authority.  Am I right in that assessment?</p></speech>

On the contrary, we seem to have heard of a decision, taken at whatever level, not to inform the Comptroller and Auditor General to keep these matters beyond the purview of the Committee of Public Accounts.  We dealt with correspondence earlier today, which I will not retread, in terms of a letter the Commissioner sent to Mr. McCarthy which might be interpreted as being misleading to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  She was given legal advice then by Mr. Ruane to activate section 41, which was the right advice for what it is worth, but she did not take it.  She had some methodology of collaborating, informing or discussing but she did not act decisively in that case.  Then we have, astonishingly, a scenario in which the head of finance, Mr. Culhane, attempts to lean on and goes so far as to threaten legal action against the head of internal audit.  This matter is then raised with the Commissioner by the chair of the Garda audit committee.  Far from being decisive, the Commissioner failed to act.</p></speech>

I got wind that there may be a document in relation to charitable status.  I asked for it and this was produced.  Is that okay?  </p><p>I will read into the record the cover note, dated 13 June 2017, that was sent by John Barrett to the chief administrative officer.  Notwithstanding the fact that the CAO has said that he did not see it until yesterday, 19 June, his office date stamped it 14 June so somebody read it in his office to the extent that he or she stamped it.  If he is away or otherwise engaged, I am sure somebody is delegated with the responsibility in his office that if something is important, it should be passed up the line.  The Commissioner can clarify the matter. </p><p>The cover note states:</p><blockquote>I refer to a hand delivered document in an Oireachtas envelope which arrived at the gate this morning.<br /><br />I have no idea of its provenance.  <br /><br />It was collected by Mr. Paul Flood from my office and this is a copy of the contents which you may wish to note.<br /><br />I would respectfully suggest that you draw the attention of all the various correspondents to the document and provide them with copies as a matter of courtesy.<br /><br />Further it seems to me that the Public Accounts Committee may have an interest in the content and I would again respectfully suggest that this be brought to the attention of the PAC immediately. </blockquote> <p>Let the record show that it was not brought to our attention; we brought it to our own attention.</p><p>Moving on, there is one specific small email that follows on from correspondence between PwC and Mr. Culhane, in 2010, in terms of matters of taxation and all of the issues before us here today.  He, in turn, was obviously corresponding or in contact with Eugene Banks of the Garda division in the Department of Justice and Equality.  I am extremely troubled by one of the emails dated 5 July 2010 that was sent at 17.26.  It seems to be a response to Eugene Banks, in the Garda division, who inquired whether there had been any developments on the matters raised below, in particular, the relationship between the college and the companies and the legal entity of the college itself.  Mr. Culhane responded:</p><blockquote>Eugene <br /><br />There have been no further developments.  To muddy things up, I included charitable status for the College in the letter to the Revenue dated 28<sup>th</sup>May but as you can see it was not included in their response.</blockquote> <p>We do not have the response.  I wish to refer to the phrase &quot;to muddy things up&quot; in the context of all the evidence we have received so far - the conflicting evidence from certain parties.  For a finance director to use the phrase &quot;to muddy things up&quot; in the context of any correspondence with the Revenue Commissioners and inform Eugene Banks from the Department of Justice and Equality seems to suggest an awful lot, Commissioner.  I take her word that she has seen this document for the first time in recent minutes.  What is her response to such language?</p></speech>

My reading of it is that there was an attempt on the basis of a suggestion of a law that exists in England by PwC that the Garda may have some grounds to build a case.  I see heads shaking in the background over there.  I do not know whether that is relevant to what I am saying or something else.  That is the letter.  I will quote it because I am concerned about the shaking heads and I will mention the relevant part about charitable status.</p> <p>  George Reddin of PwC wrote to Michael Culhane in response to the latter's letter to PwC on 23 March, a copy of which we do not have.  The email states: "As we discussed, there may be a possibility of arguing that all of the investment income [which is the cash income from shops, restaurants and so on] is effectively being applied for charitable purposes.  There is judicial authority in the UK that the expression 'charitable purposes' includes the furtherance/provision of education in schools/universities etc."</p> <p>  Then we have, following this correspondence, the phrase being used: "I included charitable status for the College in the letter to the Revenue."  I do not know, and without prejudice to the answer to my next question, as Accounting Officer, what waters were being tried to be muddied? </p></speech>

First of all, the nodding in the background was in relation to the fact that, and this is not the fault of the secretariat or indeed any of the committee members, obviously this document was available to the committee or it was aware of it or it was available to the committee prior to the break.  Perhaps if we had it prior to the break we would have been able to make some inquiries during the break.</p></speech>

There is a consistency in answering since these hearings began along the lines of "I was not in the post, it was not my responsibility and there are line managers".  We are having huge difficulty getting to who knows what and who did what.</p> <p>  We are all time limited and I will return shortly to the phrase of "muddying of the waters".  I asked the Commissioner earlier about the signatory to the account in Cabra.  She said in later testimony to some of the other questions that, when she inquired of her colleagues, she found that this account had been closed in 2010.  Was the account ever in the personal name, with the personal address, of a retired member of the Garda after he or she retired?</p></speech>

At the break in today's proceedings, Deputy Commissioner D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in took the opportunity to speak to Mr. Kelly in order to answer the Vice Chairman's question whether Mr. Kelly believed any accounts were held from him.  I do not want to put words into other people's mouths as I would be in the area of hearsay, so if the committee wishes, Deputy Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in can answer this question.  Mr. Kelly has informed us that he does not believe accounts were kept from him.  On the specific account in Cabra, as I said this morning, the fact is that this matter is now under examination and consideration by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and it would be quite inappropriate for me to comment on signatories or otherwise of that account.</p></speech>

Would it not have been much better if the committee had had the opportunity to consider these matters before our meeting today?  There were 16 months in terms of real action, and notwithstanding the intervention of Mr. Barrett and Mr. Ruane, we manage to have this matter in GSOC.  It is certainly appropriate that GSOC would look at it but can I ask-----</p></speech>

It would appear to me to be muddying the waters for Revenue.  I would suggest, and ask, that the senior management would consider referring all these matters to GSOC.  It is a State organisation and yet it seems many department heads operated as islands.  Retirements and so on seemed to have been hugely disruptive to the extent that no one knows anything about anything.</p></speech>

Immediately on receiving Mr. Kelly's report yesterday, and with regard to the seriousness of the matter, the deputy commissioner referred the issue to the GSOC, which is appropriate practice.  Under no circumstances was this done to keep it out of the view of this committee, and indeed it was quite the opposite.  I would hope that it would provide assurance to the committee that we would take appropriate action as soon as it comes to our attention.</p> <p>  On the actions taken in the 16 month intervening period, there was, and there is evidence to show there was, action taken at all times and the appropriate mechanisms and structures put in place to ensure Mr. Kelly's recommendations will be fully implemented by the end of this year, as we heard earlier from Mr. Nugent, or through me from Mr. Nugent.</p></speech>

It was not given to us, even though it was suggested that it should be, until we sought it, and it was provided to us this morning by the gentleman sitting on the Commissioner's right, Mr. Joseph Nugent.  It would appear from my humble, non-legalistic view as a citizen that someone was seeking to muddy the waters for Revenue in the context of charitable status and other matters relevant to the Garda College in Templemore and taxation.  This is shocking in the extreme.  Is this organisation too unwieldy for one person to run?</p></speech>

The consistent theme from all witnesses in these hearings since they began has been, "I do not know about that, I was not in the post, I was responsible for something else, and they are responsible for that."  When the Commissioner is asked something, even though the buck stops with her, she says it is the CAO's responsibility and he is retired.

We have put, and continue to put, the structures, the necessary checks and balances and the safeguards in place to make sure there are effective communications, structures and processes.  That is work we continue to do with the support of the Policing Authority and the Department of Justice and Equality.  I mentioned earlier about getting new skill sets in, and as of two weeks ago, we are now the closest we have ever been to a full management team, and we are not completed yet.  That is an important consideration.  There is no doubt that over recent years, with the downturn in the economy and with various Government decisions, there was a reduction especially in the senior management cadre in the organisation.  At one stage we were left with five people at the top of the organisation.  With the support of the Government, the Department and the Policing Authority, we have rebuilt that.  The organisation can be run by one person, but the necessary structures and architecture need to be put in place to support that.</p></speech>

I have listened to most of the discussion and I want to focus first on those people who report to the Commissioner and the chain of command that is in operation in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I know the Vice Chairman has asked whether the Commissioner has confidence in those who report to her.  I want to focus on capacity and how one would expect personnel to carry out their functions and how capable individuals are in their roles within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is very important for this committee to see if they are operating as prescribed.  I find it difficult to get my head around one area in particular.  I appreciate that the Commissioner is the Accounting Officer and that at the end of the day these personnel report to her through the chain of command.</p> <p>  In the meeting of the committee on 31 May 2017, a document was circulated which was correspondence of Mr. Michael Culhane.  The reference on the top is PAC 32R339.  There is a detailed memo with attachments dated 4 March 2011 where a review has been carried out into the Garda College in Templemore by the financial director of the time, Mr. Culhane, and it was also sent to the head of internal audit, Mr. Niall Kelly, whose name is on the top of the memo.  I am concerned that back in 2011, a number of issues were raised in that correspondence, including the need to reduce urgently the number of bank accounts by 13.  To any reasonable person without any major financial knowledge, if one talks of reducing the number of bank accounts by such a significant quantity, it would suggest there is a big operation at play.  Other issues raised in the correspondence were the urgent need for new accounting procedures, all accounts to be audited, and if the financial director at that time, Mr. Culhane, had checked that the accounts were audited.  For example, the bar account had not been audited at that stage.  Will the Commissioner comment on this?  We have the financial director giving assurances on paper to the internal auditor that things happened and they were compliant in some respects, whereas at the time he signed that memo, there was not compliance.</p><p>Is that good enough for those who occupy positions of serious responsibility?</p></speech>

I would expect someone who was auditing the accounts and monitoring that checks and balances in the Garda were operating to have some scepticism and check that what he or she was being told was correct.  Does the Commissioner not concur that someone carrying out an audit function should be expected to check the work that is handed to him or her by those in the Garda, including the financial director?</p></speech>

That is why we are taking the advice of the incoming audit committee or, indeed, this committee.  We are focused on learning lessons from what has gone before, ensuring that we put safeguards, checks and balances and structures in place, as well as supporting people in order that the proper professional skill sets are in place to support those functions.</p></speech>

The 2011 memo referred to a number of significant points, including the facts that certain entities, such as the bar and restaurant, were using different PAYE, PRSI and VAT numbers, the restaurant made a loss in 2009 of in excess of &euro;400,000, the OPW had entered into an arrangement with the Garda regarding land that subsequently was rented and the bar had its own audited accounts.  Clearly, this information was in the hands of the Garda's financial director, who is accountable to this committee, in 2011 and it was in the hands of the internal auditor who has conducted an audit of the Garda.  For the life of me, I cannot see what has changed since.  Why are people not being held to account in their roles?  I know from operating in the private sector that, if I signed a letter giving an untruthful assurance that an entity had been audited, its accounts were up to date and financial procedures and protocols would be followed, it would be a serious situation.  I would like to see that the Commissioner is concerned about this.</p></speech>

That is why we are taking these steps.  As Accounting Officer, I want to have assurances.  We as the executive, the committee and the public need assurances to the effect that we have the correct processes and skill sets in place to be more probative and challenging in respect of these matters, there is more cohesion and we are in compliance with best corporate governance standards in the public sector.  That is what we are working towards.  When Mr. Kelly's audit is finally completed, there may be other issues that we need to address, including some of those that the Deputy has referenced.</p></speech>

Everyone is in the dock, including the Accounting Officer and all other ranks who have dealt with Templemore.  What has changed in the chain of command within the Garda that allowed this to happen?  If something happened now, how could we be sure that it would be acted upon differently?  I am concerned because many people who are potentially in senior positions did not act on cases in 2011.</p></speech>

We immediately actioned what was brought to our attention.  In that period, we were able to deal with the 19 recommendations in Mr. Kelly's audit report.  As the committee heard through me from the CAO, we will be in a position to have all of the 19 recommendations implemented by the end of this year.  That is the unravelling of the complicated infrastructure and financial accounting architecture that were put in place over an almost 40-year period.  That does not happen easily.  It is a daunting task.  I must commend the work of Mr. Nugent and his steering group, which has managed to do that, and Mr. Kelly and his audit team, which was able to undertake the audit in the intervening period.  This demonstrates the commitment of this executive and management team to ensuring that, not only in terms of the college matters, but all matters, we turn over the stones, identify the issues, bring them to the surface and deal with them in an open and transparent manner.  That has been our intention at the committee at all times.  The evidence trail in the intervening period will show that that is what we have done.</p></speech>

We have been advised of the reporting requirements and that GSOC will now examine a number of transactions.  The Commissioner might enlighten me as to the current guidelines for the Garda receiving State funding.  How does it prove something to the State?  Like all other State agencies, is the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na currently required to get a tax clearance certificate for moneys that it receives from the State?</p></speech>

As Mr. Nugent has just outlined to me and as he outlined at a previous committee hearing, there are tensions around whether, for example, the restaurant is an independent entity or part of the college infrastructure.

Consider what normal people and businesses must go through to get tax clearance certificates to receive any funding from the State, be it an older person trying to get a mobility grant in respect of his or her house, a business seeking to receive State funding or a State body.  It is concerning that the Garda is overseeing an entity - the form of which is not known - that cannot furnish a tax clearance certificate from Revenue.</p> <p>  The Commissioner referred to GSOC investigating potential fraud issues.  Surely someone must be held to account for letting a situation evolve in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in which a tax number did not have a tax clearance certificate even though, in theory, it was in possession of State funding in some form or other having, for example, grown within one of the entities or having come directly from the State.  Given that Ms O'Sullivan is the Commissioner and Accounting Officer for the Garda, does she foresee there being action in terms of prosecutions?  If a private sector entity could not obtain a tax clearance certificate, the consequences for it would be stark.</p></speech>

I will take them in order.  First, it is a major concern.  A part of our objective of pulling that account into the general tax number is to ensure that we regularise the situation.</p><p>That is the purpose of our ongoing discussions with the Revenue Commissioners and, of course, we will update the committee on that as soon as that process is finalised. </p><p> Second, the referral to GSOC relates to a specific audit report received yesterday regarding a specific matter and on the findings of the head of internal audit.  Separately, as I informed the committee before, we have an assistant commissioner with responsibility for special crime operations who is examining the totality of Mr. Kelly's interim report.  He will also continue to examine Mr. Kelly's next iteration of that report.  If any matters at all, from any perspective, come to attention, he will make recommendations on how they need to be dealt with and, if necessary, if there are matters that come to his notice that require referral to GSOC or any other agency, that will happen.  </p></speech>

The Commissioner categorised what happened between Mr. Barrett and Mr. Culhane as an interpersonal and issue and referred the matter to Mr. Dunne, the CAO.  Given that Mr. Barrett was head of human resources, I would expect he would understand if something was an interpersonal issue.  It would be part of the discipline and part of the reason he was recruited into his role would have been that he had considerable experience.</p> <p>  I would like to return to the governance architecture.  This is not about a team.  The internal audit, audit committee and head of finance are not a team.  Tensions are expected in this architecture which is, or should be, designed with tensions, albeit not to the extent that people beat each other up or anything.  It is not an interpersonal matter and should not be categorised as such, given Mr. Barrett's background and given that this friction is intended.  One can introduce all the recommendations one likes but if this matter is viewed as people having a working relationship with one other that does not work well, I have serious concerns about whether this architecture will provide the protection to which the Garda Commissioner repeatedly refers.  She keeps referring to checks and balances.  What is it about these checks and balances that are different and will not be able to overcome a difficulty that is described as interpersonal?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-20a.1298" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017062000002#NN00600"><p>Maybe I explained this earlier and if I did not, let me explain it again now.  The Deputy is perfectly right; there is the architecture and there are the key individuals and the key roles within that architecture, such as, for example, the head of internal audit unit, the director of finance, the chair of the audit committee and the deputy commissioner who is in charge of our risk governance board.  That is the architecture that I see and that is where we are revising and reviewing that architecture to ensure the regularity and propriety of it to make sure it is working effectively in the way that we want it.</p> <p>  Separately, there is the team and the individuals we refer to are all part of the senior leadership team.  As well as being involved in the architecture, they are absolutely key players in delivering on not just our reform programme, but also the goals and objectives that we have to deal with every single day.  I am very concerned that there are these tensions between these key individuals.  As I said earlier, it is our job to work to make sure that we work through these difficulties, that we make the most effective use of the team and that the architecture and the skill set are there to support that team in delivering on their individual and collective missions.  </p></speech>

Mr. Kelly, in his opening statement, which I am sure the Garda Commissioner had read when she appeared before the committee a couple of weeks ago, drew our attention to the reasons he was not able to do his job.  He referred, for example, to the attitude to the public money that was provided for recruits and, for example, to Deputy Commissioner Rice's attitude to what that money was for.  In fact, I asked Ms Anne Marie McMahon, whose rank I cannot recall, and Mr. Pat McCabe about this and they were both of the opinion that this money was for more than the upkeep of the members in relation to the restaurant.  That must have come from somewhere.  Mr. Kelly's opening statement was littered with comments, including, for example, that he now knew he was misinformed and that Mr. Culhane had questioned his motives.  Deputy Cullinane raised this matter earlier.  Mr. Kelly's statement features many comments setting out how he was frustrated in doing his job.  This was not just an interpersonal problem.  A range of different players are involved in this and it is very important that it is not seen as an interpersonal problem.</p> <p>  A number of different audit committees have operated since the function of Accounting Officer transferred from the Department to the Commissioner.  There was one in place from 2006 to 2009 and another in place between 2009 and 2013.  A further audit committee operated subsequent to that and there is probably a new one in place now.  Was any member of the audit committee that operated between 2006 and 2009 a signatory to the bank account that is under investigation?</p></speech>

That is my understanding but again I want to be careful as I do not want to pre-empt the examination or investigation that is being considered by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission at the moment.  As I said this morning, we remain in a position to assist in whatever way we can.  I do not want to pre-empt what the nature or extent of its investigation will be.</p></speech>

She accepted that there was a problem.  She would not have established a steering committee if she did not accept that there was a problem.  A couple of minutes ago, she used the word "irregular".  I did not use the term.  The Commissioner also used it earlier today.

It seems to me from this letter that Mr. Ruane got it.  He knew that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be informed immediately and that was the advice he said he gave the meeting.  It has been acknowledged by the Comptroller and Auditor General that it would have been better had he been informed.  We now have an actual discussion and we have gone beyond whether, in the Commissioner's judgment, it should have been done or what she knew back then.  There was an actual discussion at this meeting about whether the Comptroller and Auditor General should be informed and we have an opinion from the legal section that he should be informed immediately, but this was not done.</p></speech>

He respectfully suggested that she corrects the D&aacute;il record in that regard and on the actual duration of the meeting on the evening of 27 July.

We had a lengthy discussion on the use of the word "irregular", a word she used when first responding to my questions on whether she had acted appropriately.  She said she had done and took the right corrective action, saying she wanted to "regularise" accounting practices.  This morning she used the same word but she signed a letter to the Comptroller and Auditor General on 31 July, which is certainly after she became aware.  She said, "I have disclosed to you [the Comptroller and Auditor General] all instances of loss, fraud or irregularity" that were known to her.  She goes on that, "where such instances [including irregularities] are known to me I have reported them to you".  It strikes me that she did not do this.  It is quite obvious that the Commissioner did not report these to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Can the Vice Chairman tell me if this letter, which was given to the Comptroller and Auditor General, is inaccurate?  If it is inaccurate to say, "where such instances are known to me I have reported them to you" because they did not happen, it calls into question whether the letter sent by the Garda Commissioner to the Comptroller and Auditor General is accurate.</p></speech>

I have listened to what she said and have sat through all the meetings on these hearings.  All I want to do is establish the facts and the truth.  The Commissioner weaves one narrative when asked questions on what she did because she wants to point out that on 27 July when she said she first became aware of this, she did everything she possibly could because she understood the seriousness of the issues, having been briefed on them.  Her response to this, however, is entirely different, and she says that she was only aware of the generalities, not all the information.  She has enough information.  She cannot assume the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Mr. McCarthy said that, if he was informed, he could pass judgment.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I found that there was an extensive file available in my office, which indicated that there were files in other parts of the organisations.  It was clear that there were outside bodies and other sections within the organisation that may have information.  I was trying to get as complete a picture as possible.

I am not referring in the first instance to how all of these practices became established, convoluted and so on.
