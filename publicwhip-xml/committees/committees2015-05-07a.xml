Agreed.  </p> <p>  We will move to correspondence received since the previous meeting.  No. 3A.1 is correspondence, dated 1 May 2015, from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It follows up on the committee's meeting with officials of the Department on 5 March.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  </p> <p>  No. 3A.2 is correspondence, dated 6 May 2015, from the Health Service Executive to correct the record of the meeting of 23 April.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  </p> <p>  No. 3B.1 is correspondence, dated 28 April 2015, from the Health Service Executive which provides a response on the issue of State-sponsored methadone treatment.  The correspondence is to be noted, published and forwarded to Mr. Jim O'Connell.  </p> <p>  No. 3B.2 is correspondence, dated 14 April 2015, from Mr. Noel Waters, Secretary General, Department of Justice and Equality, regarding the Thornton Hall project. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-07a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015050700002#B00300"><p>I note a number of discrepancies between this document which provides a full account of the Thornton Hall project and the document the committee received on 6 February.  For example, the document, dated 14 April 2015, states in respect of capacity that the proposed development at Thornton Hall would have provided a maximum of 723 places, in addition to the female prison.  However, the original document, dated 6 February 2015, stated the new prison development would provide accommodation for 1,400 prisoners, with operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200.  There is a major discrepancy between the figures presented for the numbers of prisoners who would have been accommodated at Thornton Hall.</p> <p>  The original document stated that following the decision not to proceed with the Thornton Hall project, the Department decided to focus resources on providing in-cell sanitation in Mountjoy Prison and noted that the project was nearing completion.  The main reason cited by the Department for purchasing a site for a new prison at Thornton Hall was the lack of in-cell sanitation in Mountjoy Prison and the estimated cost of installing same of &euro;400 million.  Now that the Department has addressed the primary reason for spending &euro;30 million on the purchase of Thornton Hall, it has not indicated what was the cost of providing in-cell sanitation in Mountjoy Prison.  Clarification is required in this regard.</p> <p>  The document, dated 14 April 2015, only gave a brief description of the expenditure of &euro;30 million on the Thornton Hall project and some additional minor expenditure in a couple of other areas, including acreage purchased for ancillary purposes.  The document received on 6 February, however, indicated that total expenditure on the prison development project was &euro;50.14 million.  There is, therefore, a discrepancy of &euro;20 million in expenditure.  It is one of a number of serious discrepancies. </p> <p>  It should also be recalled that Mountjoy Prison was to be sold and that Shanganagh Castle, the only juvenile open prison in the State, was sold.  There is now no juvenile prison to make up the shortfall in expenditure.  The contents of the two documents suggest either that they were produced by two different people or that the author approached the issue from two perspectives.  I suggest we seek clarification on their contents.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-07a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015050700002#B00400"><p>Perhaps we should set out the differences the Deputy has outlined by sending a copy of the transcript to the Department to seek clarification on the matters raised.  We should also state that if they are not clarified in a satisfactory manner, we will invite the Secretary General and the relevant officials to appear before the committee.  I suggest this as a first step.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-07a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015050700002#B00500"><p>That would be excellent.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-07a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015050700002#B00600"><p>No. 3C is documents for today&rsquo;s meeting and comprises Nos. 3C.1 and 3C.2.  They are to be noted and published.</p> <p>  No. 4 is reports, statements and accounts received since the meeting of 30 April.  All four documents have a clear audit opinion and are to be noted and published.</p> <p>  The work programme is on screen.  The next meeting will be with officials of the Office of the Minister for Finance to discuss the outturn for 2013, the issue of Government debt and the financial accounts for 2013.</p> <p>  This morning in the D&aacute;il the Minister for Finance indicated that there would be some form of investigation into SiteServ and referred to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Committee of Public Accounts.  My understanding is the deal in question was very much commercial in nature.</p><p>At the last meeting, we, as a committee, decided we would ask for the papers relative to the decision-making process leading up to this.  If we could have those for that meeting, then we can rightly deal with whatever queries that might arise in respect of the lead-up to this sale and the involvement of the Department officials.  We could also seek clarification from them as to what their concerns were at the time about Siteserv and the other commercial deals that were done.  Apparently, they were speaking about not only Siteserv but the other businesses that were sold.</p><p> We did ask for those papers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-07a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Clerk to the Committee" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015050700002#C00200"><p>I did speak to the Secretary General of the Department.  He is aware of the committee's request and said he will have the appropriate people here next week to deal with the main issues on Siteserv.  There is a bigger investigation ongoing at the moment so I presume they may be limited in what they can reveal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-07a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015050700002#C00300"><p>To make it clear as I understood it from the members last week, what we want is the information relative to the different businesses that were sold in respect of what the officials thought and what were their concerns that we read about every day in the newspapers and the media.  It is our responsibility as the Committee of Public Accounts to have that information and to analyse it.  That is where the members were coming from and it is the information we want.  Beyond that, in terms of the sale from the bank to the business, that may be for another day.  Is that correct from our last meeting Deputy McDonald?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-07a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015050700002#C00600"><p>Yes, that is correct.  In fact, at the finance committee yesterday, a motion was brought forward asking for different individuals to come before that committee.</p> <p>  On legal advice that motion was withdrawn on the basis that the commercial interactions, be it around Siteserv and the commercial wisdom of decisions made, are not for that committee or for our committee to scrutinise or second-guess.  The point was made very strongly that the policy oversight, as well as the political oversight and interaction between the system and the IBRC, Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, is very much a legitimate space.  It is not something KPMG will delve into.  Its will be very much a technical and, in my view, a wholly inadequate mechanism for investigating all of these matters.  I support what the Chairman is doing and I would hope that we would have the relevant documentation in advance of next week's meeting so we can prepare ourselves for the exchange.</p> <p>  The second question is this but I do not know if it can be answered today.  We need to get some clarity from the Minister because he has made several references to committees of the House and he has referenced our committee in particular.  We need to know not only  hat we will be in receipt of whatever report KPMG produces but to what end.  What level of scrutiny at the end of the day will we be able to apply to such a report, giving our remit, standing orders, Abbeylara, etc?</p> <p>  It strikes me there is a strong element of playing for time on the part of the Government.  We are being referenced as part of a very drawn-out sequence.  That is my own view.  Apparently, we are going to get this report.  We are not sure what form it will take or the level of data and information we will be given, however.  The experience has been that all of these interactions are cloaked in a vale of commercial sensitivity.  We have no guarantee that this will not be the case when we finally see the report from KPMG.  We receive it but what next?  What level of scrutiny will we be able to apply to it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-07a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015050700002#C00700"><p>We will come back to that.  I call Deputy Costello.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-07a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015050700002#C00800"><p>We indicated at our last meeting that we were dealing with the matter arising from remarks made by the Taoiseach that he would hope to refer it to this committee and that it would involve the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Then some other issues arose.  The general opinion around the table was that the committee would play as big a role as it could in the matter.  I would welcome the Committee of Public Accounts paying that role because we are, after all, the committee that deals with taxpayers&rsquo; money and the use and abuse of that money.</p> <p>  The system that has been set up is to report by the end of August.  I do not know if the Minister for Finance mentioned this committee.  He did mention the relevant committees of the House. The Taoiseach mentioned this committee.  We do need clarification that this is the committee that will deal with the report when it does come out.  It is to be completed by the end of August.  Presumably, the intention would be that it would be dealt with by the committees of the House in early September.  In the meantime, regarding whatever documentation might be required, I would be agreeable that it would come before the committee and we could be prepared for it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-07a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1081" speakername="John Perry" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015050700002#C00900"><p>I agree with Deputy Costello that it is important to get clarification on the Government&rsquo;s intention as to what role the committee will have once the report is published after September.  This would be the appropriate committee for dealing with the report.  I also agree with the Chairman on getting the documents before the officials attend the committee next week.  Will the clerk get clarification as to what increased powers the Committee of Public Accounts would require to investigate this report once it is published in September?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-07a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1011" speakername="Robert Dowds" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015050700002#C01000"><p>To what extent will the remit of this committee have to be altered for us to consider something like the Siteserv issue?  If that will be the case, then there is an argument for the remit to be examined for other matters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-07a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015050700002#C01100"><p>To be clear about the committee and where we are going, next week the Department of Finance officials will attend the committee.  We have indicated to the Department that we will ask questions about its involvement and whatever concerns it might have had, not only with Siteserv but the other companies and transactions that have been brought into the public domain by way of general comment.  Any paperwork relevant to those transactions from the Department&rsquo;s side is what we are entitled to discuss.  We shall send a clear message to the Department of Finance that this is within our remit, this is what we want to discuss and there is more than just Siteserv.  In a general way we want to deal with that.</p> <p>  It is only fair then, on the other side of this, that we would make clear that it is misleading of either the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance or any other Minister to say the Committee of Public Accounts will deal with this.  The committee&rsquo;s remit will not allow it to go into the IBRC or call witnesses.  If the Committee of Public Accounts is to conduct any analysis of this, then an order of the D&aacute;il needs to be made.  The KPMG report, if it is to be referred to us, will have to be given to us with the appropriate powers to analyse it and to call witnesses.</p> <p>  Whatever statement has been made on this, from a public interest, it should be specified and clarified that whatever committee deals with this, it will require a certain set of powers to be able to do it properly.  It is wrong to leave it hanging in the air with the public expectation that the Committee of Public Accounts will be able to discuss it when it is clearly not the case.</p> <p>  In response to what is happening, we should reflect that fact to the Taoiseach and the Ministers concerned to ensure we are all clear about it.</p><p>I think that is the right thing to do.  Is that okay?  Yes.</p><p> We are dealing with the work programme.  We will have the Department of Social Protection after that and then the Department of Education and Skills.  We have that special report from Cork VEC.  Will that come up on that day?</p></speech>

We had a meeting yesterday - a briefing session - which went on for two and a half hours.  I thank the members who were present and who listened to what was said.  It was a shocking story of events and abuse of power by the State in relation to a number of individuals and companies.  The need for investigation is quite clear.  In the light of what we heard yesterday, I will ask the clerk to do a full report of what was presented to us.  He should attach the appropriate paperwork collected by the individuals and businesses concerned because it relates to a huge waste of public money and an abuse of governance and power.  We can then circulate that to members with a view to having a hearing specific to the expenditure of public moneys in relation to those matters.  We are due to meet with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on 18 June.  We could perhaps use that as a timeline and bring forward the report prior to that.  The committee can agree the report and then we will be armed with the information should we wish to raise it at the meeting.</p></speech>

Will it be possible to bring them in to answer questions at that time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-07a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015050700002#D00700"><p>We will request that they be here.  It is important too that the Chief State Solicitor's office would be represented as well at the meeting, because then all the players responsible for the expenditure and governance issues will be present.  The members can decide for themselves then what questions to ask from the report the clerk will provide for us.  We will have a dossier of information.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-07a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015050700002#D00800"><p>Subject to the report being compiled and circulated to members, we may be seeking fairly specific figures at the meeting relating to specific expenditure on specific actions.  Once the clerk has compiled the report, could we then hone it down to specific instances because in fairness to the officials, if we are asking for very specific figures we must give them notice of that?</p></speech>

All that can be worked out prior to 18 June.</p></speech>

I never met the individuals concerned before.  I do not know them or the sky over them but we have an obligation to try to do something about it in the event of any of the stories being repeated on any family farm anywhere in the country.

Aside from the work we can do on this committee, I would recommend to members that they might consider fully what we heard yesterday and perhaps use the floor of the House to raise this issue in the context of a debate, which I believe is absolutely necessary given the evidence we heard and the documents that are available.</p></speech>

When the clerk is drawing up a report on the presentation that was made yesterday, will there be an opportunity for us to go beyond the Department and the unit concerned because references were made yesterday to costs being incurred by the State across a range of Departments, the Courts Service and the Garda?</p></speech>

Once it is a cost to the State, and it is within a Department and it is relevant to what we heard yesterday, based on the dossier of information the clerk will provide to us, we can then decide that we should also invite others to attend our meeting on 18 June.  We will meet prior to that and members can contact the clerk and make their suggestions.  From what we heard yesterday, it is clear that there needs to be a very open debate about the issues that were raised.  Some issues might be better raised in the House rather than in this committee.  Members should consider a significant and appropriate way to raise those matters.</p></speech>

The appropriation account for Vote 30 - Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, had total gross expenditure of just under &euro;394 million in 2013.  Figure 1, which could now be brought onto the screen, indicates how that expenditure was divided between the various Vote programmes.  The largest programme was in relation to broadcasting, under which a total of &euro;242 million, or 61%, was spent.  The bulk of the expenditure under that programme was in the form of grants paid to RTE - just under &euro;182 million, and to Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge - &euro;33.7 million.  &euro;14.4 million was paid into the Broadcasting Fund.  &euro;11.2 million was paid to An Post in respect of the costs of collecting broadcasting licence fees.  The fees collected by An Post are remitted to the Department, and account for the bulk of the appropriations in aid of the Vote.  In 2013, a total of just over &euro;216 million in broadcast licence fee income was received by the Vote.  The net expenditure on the Vote was around &euro;27 million less than was provided for the Vote for 2013.  The Department got the agreement of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to carry over &euro;8.5 million in unspent capital funding to 2014.  The balance of the surplus was due for surrender.</p> <p>  The report before the committee this morning relates to an examination of the arrangements for the provision of a national emergency call answering service, which comes within the responsibilities of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  By way of background to the examination, I should explain that, in the course of carrying out the audit of the financial statements of ComReg for 2011-12, we noted that the regulator had incurred legal costs of over &euro;310,000 when it settled a legal case taken against it by a telecoms provider.  The company had challenged ComReg on the manner in which it had made a decision to increase the emergency call handling fee by 50%.  It also complained about the absence of an appeal process in respect of fee changes.  Our initial review established that the Department had put in place a complex framework to underpin the emergency call system, and I decided to review the arrangements in parallel with the audit of the 2013 appropriation account for Vote 30.  </p> <p>  Historically, emergency call answering was done by Eircom operators.  Since July 2010, the service has been provided by BT Communications Ireland, which won the contract following a tender competition run by the Department between 2007 and 2009.  The contract is for a period of five years, with an option to extend for up to two more years.  I understand that the initial five-year term is due for completion in July of this year.  The emergency call service is fully funded by the telecom service providers.  The companies are charged a handling fee for each call made through their networks.  There is no direct charge for the person making an emergency call.  In practice, the costs are passed on by the companies to their customers through the normal user charges.</p> <p>  The emergency call fee charged to the telecoms companies by BT is regulated by ComReg and is based on the expected cost of providing the service and the anticipated volume of emergency calls.  Annual revisions of the call handling fee by ComReg take account of any under- or over-recovery of costs by the service provider in prior periods.  We found that the volume of emergency calls received over the period 2010 to 2014 has been relatively constant at around 2.8 million calls a year.  This is around 42% lower than projected when the service was put out to tender.  The much lower than anticipated call volume, together with some other cost changes, led to a 50% increase in the call handling fee, from the initial rate set of &euro;2.23 per call, to a rate of &euro;3.35 per call.  There were subsequent reductions and increases in the rate, which, in the period 2014/2015, stood at &euro;3.08 per call.  Legislation provides for ComReg to determine the costs BT may recover through fee charges.  The scope of what costs are reasonable is set out in the concession contract.  This specifies that the costs include a guaranteed rate of return of 6.63% on the capital sum invested by BT, which applies for the duration of the contract.</p> <p>  Our examination found that the guaranteed return is calculated on the gross book value of its capital investment - just over &euro;11 million - giving a flat-rate guaranteed return of around &euro;750,000 each year.  This is factored in as a reasonable cost in the fee-setting model.  As BT is also allowed to include a depreciation charge in its costs, its effective rate of return on its capital investment is significantly higher than the 6.63% set out in the agreement.  The rate of 6.63% in the contract was arrived at from a base rate set by the Department, plus a margin proposed by BT in their tender.  The National Development Finance Agency advises State authorities on the optimum financing of public investment projects.  I recommended that the Department should consider consulting with the NDFA on any future projects of a similar size and involving similar complex structures, in order to ensure that the most appropriate terms are agreed, including advice on whether it is appropriate to specify a base rate of return.</p> <p>  The governance arrangements for the call answering service are set out in figure 2, which can now be shown on the screen.  The concession agreement between BT and the Department envisaged the establishment of a project board, with representatives of the emergency services, and a liaison committee to facilitate communication on all matters between the Department and BT.  In fact, the liaison committee was never established.  Instead, meetings are held at least quarterly between a Department representative and BT's representative.  The planned project board, referred to as the Emergency Services Group, has been established but it has no formal terms of reference and formal minutes of the group's monthly meetings are not recorded.  I recommended to the Department that it should draw up formal terms of reference for the group and maintain formal records of its meeting, and it has agreed to do so.  </p> <p>  BT reports monthly on its performance against service delivery standards specified in the concession agreement.</p><p>The reports are reviewed by ComReg and the Department and any instances where performance fails to meet the specified standard are raised and addressed with BT.  Overall, performance standards are being met.  Although provided for in the concession agreement, no annual reviews of BT&rsquo;s performance have taken place.  However, as part of its 2014 annual review of the call-handling fee, ComReg planned to engage an independent consultant to formally review and test the methodology by which BT compiles and calculates its performance reports.  The Department has also agreed to a recommendation to publish an annual report on the performance of the emergency call answering service.</p></speech>

Following a tender process, BT Ireland was appointed as operator of the ECAS and the concession agreement with BT commenced operation in July 2010.  Emergency calls are free of charge to the caller on all telecommunications networks.  The ECAS system is funded through the call-handling fee payable by the presenting telephone operators. </p> <p>  To ensure the highest level of availability and adequate contingency arrangements, fully replicated data centres are located in Navan and Dublin and three operator centres have been deployed in Navan, Dublin and Ballyshannon.  The ECAS is performing to a consistently high standard and exceeding all the performance levels set out in the concession agreement.  Under the concession agreement, BT is required to ensure 99.999% availability of the service each year.  In other words, the service cannot be unavailable for more than a total of five minutes per annum.  It has handled a total of over 10 million calls since it launched in July 2010.  Of that total, it has filtered out over 6.2 million, thus ensuring the emergency services can deal with genuine emergency calls.  The average speed of answer for a caller to ECAS is 0.6 seconds which is one of the fastest in Europe.  Ireland is one of the first countries in Europe to provide an emergency SMS service.</p> <p>  In so far as the 2013 appropriation account is concerned, total gross spend under the Vote in 2013 was just over &euro;393 million, some &euro;33 million below the budget allocation of &euro;426 million.  The underspend is primarily due to slower than expected expenditure on the post codes project, on energy research programmes and on broadcasting expenditure due to lower than forecast TV licence receipts. </p> <p>  I will briefly set out some of the key projects supported from the Vote in 2013.  There was expenditure in 2013 of almost &euro;23 million on communications, multimedia developments and the information society.  This expenditure was primarily on the national broadband scheme and the second level schools broadband programme.  Some 234 second level schools in counties Dublin, Kildare and Meath were provided with a 100 Mbps broadband connection in 2013, thus bringing high speed connectivity to 516 schools under the first two phases of the national roll-out programme.  The programme was completed in 2014. </p> <p>  Some &euro;75 million was spent in the energy sector in 2013, with &euro;57 million of this expended by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland on the delivery of energy efficiency upgrades.  The schemes funded include residential grants, grants to low income energy consumers through the warmer homes scheme and group community projects.  During the year, over 26,000 homes benefited from an energy efficiency upgrade, supporting around 3,000 jobs and highlighting again the importance of the State&rsquo;s involvement in this area. </p> <p>  Expenditure in 2013 in the broadcasting area amounted to &euro;242 million.  Of this, &euro;181.5 million was paid in grant aid to RTE in respect of the revenue from the sale of television licences.  A total of &euro;24.4 million of Exchequer funding and licence fee funding of &euro;9.2 million was provided to TG4 to deliver on programme commitments.  A total of &euro;14.4 million in grants from the broadcasting fund was provided to the audio and audiovisual media sector, supporting about 300 projects.  During the year, the procurement process was completed for the national post code system.</p> <p>  Almost &euro;32 million was paid to meet the administration and operational costs of Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Loughs Agency.  This funding enabled IFI to undertake almost 140,000 patrol hours and nearly 6,000 habitat inspections.  A total of &euro;5.4 million was spent on various geoscience projects, including mapping over 3,000 sq. km of the national seabed under INFOMAR, the national seabed survey project. </p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s administrative budget has been significantly reduced from &euro;40 million in 2007 to just over &euro;21.5 million in 2013.  Notwithstanding this, the Department has continued to oversee and implement a wide range of new and existing programmes, undertake regulatory functions and provide policy advice across its wide brief. </p> <p>  I have separately provided the committee with the Vote outturn figures for 2014.  These indicate gross expenditure of &euro;424.7 million in 2014 compared to &euro;393.6 million in the 2013 outturn.  A breakdown of the 2014 outturn by subhead has also been provided.  I look forward to assisting the committee with any questions it may have on the issues under consideration today.</p></speech>

It is difficult to know where to start because the Department is so diverse and deals with such a variety of areas.  I will begin with an aspect of its work which I regard as very important.  I refer to the question of the roll-out of broadband services.  I am fortunate in that I am an urban Deputy in Dublin so I am not as familiar with what some of my rural colleagues refer to as bog band.  I understand that the high speed broadband will be rolled out to everybody by 2020.  What is the current situation?  It is obviously a matter of great urgency for people outside the major centres who need to be able to compete and have good access to something which is essential nowadays.</p></speech>

It is a project which for a whole range of reasons is very dear to my heart.  I know it is among the top priorities for the Minister.</p> <p>  The national broadband plan needs to be considered in its broadest sense.  This involves both what the commercial sector is doing and what the State plans to do.  Part of our effort over the past couple of years has been on enabling the commercial sector to be involved to a greater extent in the provision of broadband infrastructure.  For example, I refer to the work carried out last year in bringing forward legislation to allow ESB engage in the provision of broadband infrastructure.  Next week, ESB and Vodafone will launch their joint venture which will set out the first 50 towns where they plan to invest and which will benefit under the joint venture programme.</p> <p>  One also needs to consider what the other big players in the sector are doing.  There has been a substantial increase in what Eircom had originally targeted to do when the national broadband plan was rolled out in 2012.  The footprint of the Eircom plan which it indicated covering under its NGA programme was approximately 1.2 million households.  This has increased to approximately 1.6 million, if not more.  There has been very significant progress in the private sector in terms of the commercial interventions.</p> <p>  Looking at what the Government needs to do, the Minister published a national high speed coverage map last November which set out where the commercial sector was going to intervene by 2016 and what the State needed to do under it its own intervention strategy.  The coverage map is divided in two.  A blue area reflects where the commercial sector will intervene and an amber area reflects where the State needs to intervene.  Effectively, there is a 70:30 split between the commercial and State interventions.  Approximately 700,000 properties need to be covered in the State intervention.  It covers 96% of the land area of the State.  The commercial companies will invest where it is commercially viable to do so.  Therefore, the main focus is on the towns and the larger villages.  The map was published at the end of November 2014.  Public consultation on the map was initiated at that stage and closed on 12 February 2015.  We received 29 submissions and these are being assessed.</p></speech>

There is intensive work under way in the Department on a range of issues, including the detailed nature of the intervention strategy, the cost-benefit analysis for the programme and how the programme is to be funded.  This work is expected to be completed over the next month or so.  The intention then is to present a comprehensive draft strategy to Government for approval, to include consideration of a whole range of important issues such as the appropriate ownership model for the infrastructure, whether a single contractor or multiple contractors will be engaged to build this infrastructure, the intervention cost - which is a critical component of the overall project - how the funding will be secured, to what extent it will impact on the Exchequer, the duration of the contract and so on.</p></speech>

We would hope that the programme proposed by the commercial companies would be ambitious and that we could achieve the greatest level of coverage within the shortest possible timeframe.  If the Deputy is asking what percentage of people I expect to be covered within the first 12 months, I cannot give a straight answer on that.  There are 700,000 properties to be delivered with broadband infrastructure over a three to five year period.  This means that, on average, 150,000 properties will need to receive broadband coverage each year.</p></speech>

Cost will be a considerable factor.  In the heel of the hunt, the most economically advantageous tender will be selected.  We will obviously take into account the capacity of the company to deliver a significant proportion of the intervention area within a relatively short time.  If the Deputy is asking if cost will be the only consideration, the answer is "No".  Cost, quality of service, ability to meet the basic thresholds set out in the NGA, which will be a minimum threshold of 30 Mbps per second, and the extent to which fibre will be a component of the network build will be taken into account.  We see fibre as being a future proof technology which will have to form a considerable part of the overall network build.  There will be range of issues, other than cost, taken into account.  Obviously, cost will form part of the consideration.</p></speech>

In 2012, some 202 schools across 14 western and midland counties were connected, including Cavan, Clare, Donegal, Galway, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Louth, Mayo, Monaghan, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo and Westmeath.  In 2013, as mentioned, a further 236 schools in counties Dublin, Meath and Kildare were connected.  The remaining 269 post-primary schools in Carlow, Kerry, Kilkenny, Limerick, Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow were provided with 100 Mbps connectivity by the end of 2014.  In total, when account is taken of the schools and education centres, we are one short of 800 schools that have been covered by the programme.  We met all of the capital costs.  We paid the current cost for the year in which the connection was made and for the subsequent 12 months.  The feedback we have received is that the programme is very effective.</p></speech>

A number of months ago I watched a programme - I think it was "Ear to the Ground" - which highlighted the case of a small company in the food sector and the difficulties it was experiencing, because it was outside an NGA area, in doing the most basic things in terms of broadband connectivity.  One of the driving forces behind the introduction of the national broadband plan was why it was acceptable that people who live in urban areas have access to high speed broadband.  In my case, I can have Sky, UPC or Eircom broadband.  Some of the other larger towns that will be provided with broadband under the UPC-Vodafone joint venture will also have that choice.  However, in areas outside of the county towns it is only possible to get 1 Mbps to 1.5 Mbps of broadband, which is simply not fit for purpose.</p> <p>  In terms of the work under way in regard to the preparation of the intervention strategy, PricewaterhouseCoopers is currently examining the cost-benefit analysis.

Does the Department have any say in the running of RTE or TG4?  For example, in respect of salary levels it is a point of contention that certain senior people in RTE are on very high salaries.  Is that done entirely within RTE itself?</p></speech>

We do not have any direct line of sight or decision-making power in respect of what RTE would pay some of the better-paid presenters in the organisation.  I do know, however, that the pay of some of the higher-paid presenters has been reduced over the last years in line with a very substantial general reduction in the RTE pay bill.  It is interesting to note that, in fact, some of the higher paid presenters are on channels other than RTE.  There is an issue for RTE of being able to compete and to attract people who are popular in terms of coverage and listenership and who also bring sponsorship to the radio station.  That is a consideration for RTE.</p></speech>

If I could move to one or two other areas, I will then leave it to Deputy Perry, who is going to cover some other points.</p> <p>  On the area of energy research, to what extent does the Department feel this should be prioritised?  Can Mr. Griffin outline the long-term approach to this area of growing importance, particularly in terms of non-polluting and renewable energy?</p></speech>

One of the areas we flagged up in my opening statement was the extent to which there was an underspend during the course of 2013.  We have to accept that some of the energy research programmes, particularly the offshore energy research for which we flagged the underspend in 2013, are at a very early stage.  We completed an offshore renewable energy development plan in 2014 and that sets out very ambitious targets for research in the sector.  In terms of the State's territory, its offshore, water area is about ten times the size of its landmass footprint.  Technology such as wave and tidal energy are still at the research, development and demonstration stage globally.  Realistically, in terms of the commercial application of those technologies we are probably looking several years down the road.</p></speech>

I am aware that not all renewable energy would come from the offshore direction but some of it would.  I see it as an area in which Ireland could forge out into the future ahead of various other countries.  I suspect we have quite a lot to learn from Scotland.  I understand the islands of Orkney are entirely supplied by renewable energy.  We are probably in a better position to do that work than many other countries.</p></speech>

A lot of the funding we are providing at the moment is with a view to building that research capacity, primarily on the west coast.</p><p>A centre off the coast at Belmullet is being funded.  Another centre off the Galway-Clare coast is being funded.  We are also working to fund an energy resource cluster, the Irish Maritime and Energy Resource Cluster, IMERC, in Ringaskiddy.  As a Department, we have committed to funding of &euro;26.3 million over the 2013 to 2016 period, which is a substantial level of investment.</p></speech>

There is a collaboration between Government agencies in terms of the SEAI and the Marine Institute, universities which have technical and research capacity and expertise to bring to bear, and the private sector whose principal motivation is to advance the technologies to a commercial stage.  That work is ongoing.  For example, the IMERC is a partnership between University College Cork, UCC, Cork Institute of Technology and the Irish Naval Service.  Therefore, a range of very competent partners are being funded through an EU programme for research in third level institutions and they are also being funded by way of a grant of &euro;3 million from my Department over the 2012 to 2015 period.  Aside from the ocean energy research side, there is also a very successful energy research programme in University College Dublin, UCD.  The research end is well funded.  While we can never have enough funding for research, we are committing funding of &euro;26.3 million over the 2013 to 2016 period.  We are in discussions with other Departments seeking to secure an additional &euro;30 million in funding for research in the ocean energy area.</p></speech>

In Belmullet we are developing a site to have a full-scale prototype of wave or tidal energy technology.  Off Galway, the facility is a quarter of the size.  The IMERC facility in Cork is a test tank facility to allow us do more of the experimental research.</p></speech>

In terms of solar, we will be going out for public consultation shortly on future energy technologies, including where solar might fit into the system because it is a technology that seems to be gaining primacy in many other jurisdictions and is something we must examine closely.  There is a good deal of detailed research being undertaken in UCC on future renewables and the integration of renewables into the grid, and EirGrid, the transmission system operator, will be looking at that issue as well.</p></speech>

On the operation of the emergency call answering service, in terms of the Comptroller and Auditor General's detailed report, what would Mr. Griffin do differently now that the five-year contract will be due for renewal and there will be a two-year extension?</p></speech>

He made three recommendations.  The first was the terms of reference for the emergency services group.  We have put in place formal consolidated terms of reference which have been presented to the emergency services group and which will be finalised at the next meeting of the group in the coming weeks.  The group is now chaired at principal officer level in the Department and formal minutes of the meetings are being recorded.  That is progress in terms of some of the governance deficiencies the Comptroller and Auditor General identified.</p> <p>  In terms of the annual review, perhaps we lost sight of that as an issue because our main focus was on identifying whether the system was performing to the key performance indicators, KPIs, outlined in the concession agreement.  We got monthly reports from BT.  They were assessed and they determined that the KPIs were being met.  Notwithstanding that, we have put in place an arrangement for an annual report to be prepared.  It is drafted and will be finalised and signed off during the course of this month.</p> <p>  On the National Development Finance Agency issue, notwithstanding the fact that this was a complicated enough procurement process, the view taken at the time was that the cost of the contract was likely to be less than &euro;20 million.  The NDFA was not consulted because the procurement process concluded at around &euro;11 million.  However, as a matter of process, we will ensure that when we go back out to the market for the next concession agreement, the NDFA will be consulted.  We give a commitment to that.</p></speech>

When we consider also its profit margin of &euro;750,000, which was in excess of the 4.2% rate agreed plus the additional percentage allowed, plus the fact that it can write off its initial investment, is it not the case that the risk was minimal and value for money was very poor?</p></speech>

It must be borne in mind that BT had to come in and invest significant capital moneys, which I mentioned in the opening statement, in two data centres in Navan and Dublin and three call centres in Navan, Dublin and Ballyshannon.

Let us return to the invitation to tender.  One will see that it included a base rate of 4.2% based on euribor rates at the time.  Our concern was that if the invitation to tender had not included a base rate, there would have been no competition.  In our view there was a real risk that if one did not provide for some guaranteed rate of return for the tenderers, the existing operator which had assets in place could bid a low management fee and undercut all other bidders and one might not have had a competition.  We needed a competition to ensure we would have the most effective outcome in terms of having an emergency call answering system that would deal with what were life saving issues.  Fundamentally what happened was that bidders bid for a management fee which was required to operate the service.  The bottom line is that the winning bidder, BT, submitted a tender which was significantly lower than the other bids received.  Its bid was an order of magnitude lower than the other bids received.</p></speech>

In effect, is the investment funded by the State?  When one takes account of the depreciation allowance, plus the allowance of 4.2%, in addition to the margin of 2.43%, it is a massive return based on the initial contract.

The invitation to tender required the submission of a sensitivity analysis.  If the tenderers did not submit it, that is a matter for them.  Let us look at the costs allowed under the contract and bear in mind that they are independently assessed by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  They are broken down between pay and non-pay costs.  The non-pay costs include the premises, backhaul infrastructure, network maintenance, annual depreciation, the guaranteed rate of return and transfers to the sinking fund.  The total figure the Deputy sees in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report also includes the guaranteed rate of return.  The figures quoted by the Deputy which are to be found on page 108 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, are &euro;3.86 million up to 11 February 2011 - that figure is not for a full year - &euro;9.42 million, &euro;9.3 million and &euro;7.76 million.

If one looks at the figures I have quoted, the actual cost of providing the service reduced in the last period.

In spite of the need for redundancies, it still has to provide three geographically spread call centres and two data centres to act as backups for each other.  Therefore, the need for that core infrastructure will not decline all that much, irrespective of the reduction in the level of calls.  The upshot for us, as a Department, is that in terms of procurement we will be looking for a new concession agreement at some stage in the not too distance future.  We have to reflect on the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the suggestions set out in the report and will absolutely do this.  One of the things on which we will reflect is whether there is a better and less complex way of structuring an invitation to tender to make sure that whoever bids will bid for a service that will deliver what needs to be delivered, given the critical nature of these services.  Perhaps, we need to be a little less obscure in how we structure the invitation to tender around the guaranteed rate of return, the base rate, and so on and simply ask tenderers, "What is it you require by way of a management fee to run this service for the next number of years?"</p></speech>

I do not have it available to me, but the costs are determined by ComReg.  There is a very detailed analysis by ComReg which, effectively, regulates the costs.

Did the outcome impact on the setting of future rates?  ComReg is independent and this was a service adjudicated on by it, but the contract and terms are set by the Department.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I would not say there was a degree of dissatisfaction on the part of ComReg about the contract.  ComReg has a role in relation to the contract which involves oversight of the costs incurred and making a determination on which costs are eligible or ineligible.  I will come back to an earlier point made by the Deputy about the NDFA and its role in PPPs.  One of the things the Comptroller and Auditor General clearly sets out in his report is the preference to have the NDFA involved in the process.  We accept this, albeit that the cost was below the threshold set.  It is a complex undertaking.  Certainly in terms of the new contract, we will consult the NDFA and take whatever advice is given.</p> <p>  In terms of the court case to which the Deputy referred, I understand the proceedings were withdrawn as a result of an out of court settlement.  I gather the terms of the settlement are so confidential that I do not even know what they are.  Therefore, I cannot be particularly helpful to the Deputy.</p></speech>

It was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i>on 17 April that CDM Smith, the lead company employed to carry out a study of fracking in Ireland, was pro-fracking and involved in the use of the controversial gas extraction method in the United States and Poland.  This issue has been raised locally.</p><p>Given that a pro-fracking consultant carried out the report, did the Department consider the question of that consultant's impartiality in advance of awarding the contract?  It is quite extraordinary.</p></speech>

It has already done a huge amount of work for the State on river basin management planning and so on and it has a broad spectrum of expertise.  CDM is one of perhaps five or six organisations that will be involved in doing work in this particular area.  There are mechanisms within the contract to ensure that, in the discharge of the work, where there are conflicts of interest they will be identified.  I am not in the least bit uncomfortable about the fact that CDM is leading the team.  We expect the team to bring to bear the range of expertise available to it in the areas required for the contract and to do so in the most professional of manners.  We answered a parliamentary question on this matter in the past couple of weeks and the Minister dealt with it comprehensively.</p></speech>

The decision and the recommendations that come forward in the report will not be a matter for CDM alone.  The Deputy should bear in mind that the team undertaking the work is overseen by a steering group of very competent people.

That would have been the basis for the estimate of call volumes in the tender process.  In my opening statement I referred to the fact that ECAS had handled 10 million calls in the four or five year period since it came into operation in 2010, with 6.2 million effectively non-calls, silent calls or hoax calls.</p></speech>

These involve people ringing but the calls not being followed up.  "Silent calls" are, for example, having one's mobile telephone in a back pocket and hitting the emergency dial by accident.  The technology has changed in the past 12 months or so, in that one needs to do a bit more to issue an emergency call.</p><p> I do not have the statistics on the number of hoax calls but the trend in the volume of calls in recent years is interesting.  In 2009, the precursor to ECAS was operated by eircom and received 3.57 million calls.  In 2010, that figure was 3.23 million while in 2011, it was 2.8 million.  In 2012, it was approximately the same but decreased to 2.6 million in 2013.  There was a significant reduction in 2014 to 2.1 million.  The projection for 2015 is approximately 1.8 million.  There has been a substantial reduction in the number of calls.  Much of this is down to investment in the State's telecomms infrastructure, particularly eircom's copper network.  Thanks to upgrading the network, the so-called noisy calls have decreased substantially in the past year or two.</p><p> In fairness to ECAS, it had to operate on the basis of the information provided to it.  A service was pitched based on an expected level of calls but the number of calls reduced, which had an impact on the call handling fee and the service's overall level of costs, which have declined in the past 12 months in particular, as I told Deputy Perry.</p></speech>

It is a matter for the Garda to determine whether follow-up is required.</p></speech>

From having spoken to ECAS last week, I understand that the list of the top 20 hoax callers changes monthly.  I suspect that the Garda is doing follow-up of a sort, albeit probably short of pursuing people through a legal channel except in the most exceptional of circumstances.</p></speech>

One of the matters we were conscious of in the original tender process was how to devise a competitive process that did not give an unfair advantage to the incumbent.  This is perhaps the reason the convoluted base rate and the guaranteed rate of return process was introduced.  We will have to go through a similar process of determining the best way of ensuring that the incumbent does not unduly benefit from the invitation-to-tender process.  We will consider this issue as part of structuring the procurement process so as to determine in what way the existing service provider cannot benefit by virtue of being the existing service provider.</p></speech>

While a range of governance structures were put in place, there was an element of "suck it and see" to determine what worked best for managing the system.  The fundamental concern for ECAS and for us was to ensure that adequate processes were in place to oversee the key performance indicators, KPIs.  We received monthly reports from BT on compliance with the KPIs.  Where there were issues with the operation of the service, we could demand data at short notice on a daily basis to see what was happening.  While BT might not have strictly complied with the governance arrangements set out in the invitation to tender, we were satisfied, by and large, that the structures were at least working.  The Deputy is right that missing basic elements like taking minutes is not acceptable.  As to a commitment to produce an annual report, while the monthly arrangements worked, it would have been preferable to have had an annual report produced.  The liaison committee and the emergency services group are being chaired at the appropriate level in the Department and minutes are being produced.  Detailed terms of reference for the emergency services group will be signed off at the meeting in May and we will produce the first annual report in May.</p></speech>

One of the big issues I believe they need to look at is the whole banking sector, the standard bank account and that sort of service.  As part of this we will be looking to see if additional Government services can be provided through the post office network, which are not currently provided.  We need to look at the whole issue of procurement and that in directing additional Government services towards a post office network, we are compliant with public procurement guidelines.</p> <p>  It is interesting for our own Department.  We are pushing the digital economy and the digital agenda - the facts are that consumers spend about &euro;6 billion online every year,  &euro;700,000 online, 24 hours a day.  Customer expectations are that they would be in a position to engage electronically with banks, Government services, post offices or whoever is providing services to them.  The business development group needs to look closely at the digital agenda to see what way the post office network can engage further on that front.  The programme for Government is crystal clear in regard to the future of the network.  It wants the network to remain strong and robust.  There has been a significant investment in IT infrastructure in recent years.  Notwithstanding the concern among postmasters and the IPU and local communities - it is interesting that the level of closures is very low in recent years.</p></speech>

They give this impression of a public consultation which does not exist.  They say to local communities to submit information as to why their local post office is so important, but at the end of the day it is very hard to know how they make a decision between two different post offices.  I give Galway as an example where they still have not been able to prove to me why post office A is different from post office B.  Would Mr. Griffin not have an issue, when a postmaster passes away or retires, that the licence is taken back immediately?  Someone may be happy to take over the licence and need 12 months to prove it as a viable business but that does not seem to be the way An Post is working with this situation.  It seems to operate by getting its hands on the licence, taking it back and making applicants for the licence jump through hoops for six months before telling them if they like the idea or not.  Would the Department not have an issue with that sort of consultation?</p></speech>

The Deputy's experience may be different but when it comes to making a decision, An Post takes into account the level of business at the post office, customer access to service elsewhere, capacity of neighbouring offices and network coverage.  There are a range of factors, not only the level of business at the office.  We have discussed this with An Post and I do not get the sense that when someone indicates their intention to retire, An Post immediately goes in and pulls down the shutters - far from it.  I believe it is very conscious of the needs and concerns of local communities.  It is also conscious of politicians at local level and the difficulty this poses for them.  I do not have a sense from An Post that the process is as brutal as the Deputy describes.</p></speech>

We have mentioned a whole range of areas here where Mr. Griffin used the term KPI - key performance indicators.  I do not understand why An Post cannot be more strategic for the future of the post office network - people are going to use them or they are not.  Is it up to the public to put back these individual post offices?  Over the past four years I have heard the same sort of answer when it comes to post offices, "We love post offices, but".  However, when digital-age. aspects are considered greater confusion arises.  There is a great deal of sentimentality about, but it must be asked what is the practical situation on the ground.</p></speech>

The IPU and An Post is addressing them so there is a real opportunity for people to meet and be creative about the retail opportunities that may present and that could maintain the strength of the network.  Post offices will have to move away from the traditional types of services.</p></speech>

It will also require investment.  There has been a significant investment in computerisation but if the post offices move more into the banking arena that will cost money and require investment.  We have discussed terms of the financial services working group with the Department of Finance on the roles of An Post and the post office network in delivering a basic bank account.  The other thing An Post and the network is grappling with is the Department of Social Protection contract and the move from cash to electronic payments.  Again, it is a reflection of the fact that some customers would prefer an electronic payment.  When one looks at the costs of an over-the-counter cash payment versus an electronic payment, there is a ratio of about 10:1.  It is over &euro;1 for a cash payment but about 10 cent for an electronic payment.  To support that approach would, therefore, have a big impact on the social welfare budget.  That is part of the consideration of the post office development group.  An Post has the DSP contract for two years and it will be bidding again for a continuation of that.  It provides a great service but I hope the group is looking at the whole spectrum of issues facing the post office network and is being creative about the options available around additional business, and public sector business that may be transacted, as well as looking at the whole digital economy.  Mr. Bobby Kerr is a successful retailer and he will bring a lot to bear in that process also.</p></speech>

It is a bit negative or poorly timed that, as the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is considering the future of post offices, the Department of Social Protection is writing to the clients of post offices encouraging them to open a bank account.  Is that not robbing the post office of its clients, or an attempt to raid the post office of its clients, at a time when there are two different working committees deciding how best to promote the post office?  Is it the case that one arm of the State is raiding the post office while another two arms of the State are attempting to protect, as best they can, the post offices for the future?</p></speech>

In fairness to the Department of Social Protection, it has a very substantial payments operation that it has to administer, and it is a very costly operation.  We have commitments under e-government strategies to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, we engage with clients and customers of the State in electronic fashion, where that is feasible.</p> <p>  In talking to Deputy Connaughton, I mentioned that there is a very substantial price differential &mdash; I am not being an apologist for the Department of Social Protection on this &mdash; between an over-the-counter payment and an EFT payment.  The recent exercise by the Department of Social Protection was a small trial.  In fact, letters were issued to approximately 2,800 clients and the objective of the exercise was to determine the best means of communicating with people about payment options.  There was no obligation or requirement on them to switch from an over-the-counter payment to an EFT payment.  One should compare the 2,800 clients with the 800,000 clients who receive Department of Social Protection cash payments through the An Post network.  It was a small trial and the timing was probably not ideal.  The last thing we want to do is send mixed messages to the people involved in the Post Office Network Business Development Group, postmasters and post mistresses around the country that we are not serious about this process.  We are serious about it.</p></speech>

The "schizophrenia across government", as Mr. Griffin described it, is causing havoc in terms of business for post offices.  Mr. Griffin can imagine the position of a postmaster in an office where customers come in waving the letter asking whether they now have to open a bank account, against the backdrop of a history of closures in the post office network, despite there having been few closures in recent years.  This causes a lot of difficulty.  One must ask whether one should invest in one's business or not, whether one is going to be closed or whether the Government will close one's business.  By the latter, I refer to an An Post business decision.</p> <p>  The other issue I see is that as the Department and all of us serve the digital agenda, there are those who will not march to the same drumbeat.  There are those who are comfortable collecting cash because they are familiar with doing so, and there are those who are simply marginalised because, as I believe was said during the week, 25% of the population have no broadband.  There are elderly people who simply do not want broadband.  In fact, some people do not want to live in the fast lane.  As governors of society, we have to accept that and accommodate it.  I suggest that the Department of Social Protection and some activities and actions within An Post Network are frightening the daylights out of businesspeople who are already under pressure.  I suggest there is an onus on the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and An Post to ensure any negative actions, such as the issuing of the letter in question, are put to one side until such time as the two groups report.</p></speech>

In fairness to the Department of Social Protection, it will pay over &euro;50 million to An Post under a contract for the cash payment services to welfare customers this year.  As I mentioned, the contract may be extended.  In fact, it can be extended up to the end of December 2019.  My colleagues in the Department of Social Protection are better able to speak on this issue than I will ever be.  I am sure that, at some stage, this committee will be speaking to them about it.  One would imagine, however, that if the Department of Social Protection did not explore options to ensure the funding available to it to discharge its functions is being used to the best effect, it would be equally open to criticism.  It has a very clear payment strategy, published a number of years back, that set out a schedule for the moving, where possible, from cash payments to EFT payments.  I do not believe that schedule is in any way being complied with.  In fact, those concerned are quite behind in terms of the process.  However, we are engaging with the Department of Social Protection and a whole range of other Departments and State agencies in regard to what other services could realistically be provided through the post office network.  As I said, the trial was a small trial, involving 2,800 letters out of a client base of 800,000 who receive cash payments through An Post.</p></speech>

Without doubt, it sounds small but one must understand that it is seen as a threat by the individual post offices whose clients have received the letter, against the history of the closures of post offices.  Even today, as we discuss this, we do not know how much An Post has invested in broadband to ensure each post office is at the cutting edge of broadband technology.  I agree the Department of Social Protection would be the first to be criticised for not reducing its cost in terms of payment but everyone in this House has to apply a certain degree of common sense also.  Not everyone has a computer or smartphone so a balance has to be struck.  I hope that it is being struck in the context of the work of the various committees.</p></speech>

As to its reporting line in to the EPA, Inland Fisheries Ireland is part of an overall architecture in place to implement the water framework directive and to ensure river basin management plans for the seven river basins in the State are being implemented and are being complied with.  I believe there were 6,000 habitat inspections last year and approximately 140,000 man hours of patrols.

It monitors fish at specified sites and reports the results to the EPA.  I do not want to presume, but by identifying the process in that way it would appear that the issuing of enforcement or prosecutions - on foot of any issues identified by the IFI or any other statutory agencies involved in the water framework directive - would appear to a fall to the EPA, perhaps through the office of environmental enforcement.  I will check that out for you.</p></speech>

There are obvious cases where raw sewage is entering the rivers of this country and nobody seems to care that much about it.  I am told by fishermen from many parts of the country that this is the case and is worsening.

If the local authorities, or anybody else, was found to be at fault and no action was taken, then surely it would fall back to Inland Fisheries to ask why no action was taken.  Can you tell this committee, in regard to Inland Fisheries Ireland, how many of these actions were taken, how many are pending, how many were successful and how many are ongoing - in the sense that the local authorities do not care and do not respond?</p></speech>

There is a considerable degree of on-the-ground patrol work undertaken by the IFI, funded by the Department and by the IFI through its own resources.  I had the opportunity to visit IFI staff over the last 12 months.  It is an organisation that has moved considerably in adapting to technology in its work with the use of CCTV cameras and other surveillance technologies.  That augments significantly the patrol work and on-the-ground coverage by IFI staff.</p></speech>

In 2013 we had 190,000 patrol man-hours, in 2014 we had 180,000.  The reality is that the funding available to the organisation to carry out patrols is a factor in its capacity to do that.

The rationale for the project was to provide a nationwide broadband network.

However, I made inquiries about the issuing of a licence in the south-east, and tabled a parliamentary question on it.  I have had correspondence with the Department.  It is extremely difficult to get to the end of the issues that can be confronted by an applicant for such a licence.  It was an onshore licence, but it went on from 2006, with a revised application in 2007 and renewed interest in 2013.  The EPA had a role in it after that.  If Mr. Griffin checks on the parliamentary questions and the correspondence, he will see the company involved.  Is there a long turnaround period for these licences?  Is that the norm?</p></speech>

We are very supportive of ensuring an active oil and gas exploration operation in the State.  We regularly meet with those who are interested in engaging in prospecting, those who want to take out a licensing option, and those who want to move from a licensing option to a full exploration licence and ultimately a lease.</p> <p>  In dealing with my own colleagues in the Department, the relationship with industry is very good.  That would be my sense of it.  They are open to sitting down with individuals who have difficulties and teasing through what their difficulties are.  There is a process to go through, including initial prospecting, taking out licensing options, moving on from that to full petroleum prospecting authorisation, and then a lease undertaking.  That can take time.  At each phase during the process, there are certain obligations that the prospectee needs to live up to in terms of financial commitments and undertaking a programme of work.  </p> <p>  We have to comply with regulatory requirements, obviously, but, having said that, I would characterise our approach as being very much open for business.  We would be hopeful that the 2015 licensing round that will conclude this year will be encouraging in terms of the level of interest and activity that we expect to see.  Operators are now in the system that have not previously been involved within the Irish offshore area, including the likes of Cairn, Kosmos and Woodside.  Although the price of a barrel of crude oil has declined quite dramatically over the last 12 months, we are hopeful that when the round concludes in September there will be a significant degree of interest.  If there are genuine concerns among individual operators in terms of engagement with the Department, we would like to hear about them and we would like to engage with them.</p></speech>

It is stated that there were six contracts at a value of &euro;683,672.  Two contracts were extended due to a lack of suitable people to tender for them.</p></speech>

It is regrettable that deceased people are still on the register of electors.  Families get very annoyed by it and they send back letters.  The list is totally inaccurate.

While we are waiting for the 100 MB, why is it the case that a number of exchanges have not been connected?</p> <p>  You raised with Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, Chairman, that we have the biggest tourism attraction in the world.  There are thousands of kilometres of fantastic riverbank walks and rivers and lakes for fishing, especially when one takes drift netting and salmon netting into account.  I am disappointed with the promotion of rivers.  I bring that to the attention of Mr. Griffin as the Accounting Officer with responsibility for the area.  Nobody is promoting the tourism potential of rivers and lakes.</p></speech>

I know that IFI commissioned a very comprehensive report in recent years on the value of the inland fisheries resource in terms of generating additional tourism within the State.  The figures are quite staggering.  We are talking several hundred million euro.  I think it is &euro;280 million that the recreational fishing industry generates for the State in terms of tourism potential.</p></speech>

It is an issue for Inland Fisheries Ireland.  I take Mr. Griffin's point that there is also a good story to tell in that regard.  We will organise a separate session on it.</p></speech>

We are possibly getting into policy areas though in some respects.  A national identity card would address some of the points Deputy Perry has made but obviously it is a policy issue as to whether there is an identity card.  We are also looking at the development of the PPS system.  I would expect to have a report on that in a number of months.</p></speech>

We have spoken to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the CSO, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade - it is critical for passports, the Department of Health, the NTMA, the Private Residential Tenancies Board, the Revenue, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and we are also working ESB Networks.  We are looking at what databases need to be updated and we have already invested significant money in doing that and looking at the applications that they are engaged in, both current and prospective, that would benefit from the postcode system.  The great thing about this system now is that we are on the cusp of going live and if one looks at the challenges that are faced in this State in terms of non-unique identifiers, we have 35% of the addresses in the State that are non-unique.  From an OECD perspective we are unique in that regard.</p><p>Coming back to the earlier discussion we had on ECAS, this will make a massive difference to people's ability to access emergency services.</p></speech>

That is critical.  It also affects the basic issue, as we discussed, such as the degree to which there is online shopping in the State and the cost that can be saved through having a more effective logistics and delivery process for some of the big companies around the State.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.  As we have a quorum, the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis is now in public session.  Can I ask members and those in public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off?</p><p>We begin today's session 1 public hearing discussion with Mr. Michael Torpey, former group finance director at Ulster Bank Group, and Mr. Robert Gallagher, former chief executive, corporate markets division at Ulster Bank.  In doing so, I would like to welcome everyone to the 24th public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis, and today we continue our hearings with senior bank executives who had roles during and after the crisis.  <br/><br/>This morning we will hear from witnesses from Ulster Bank, Mr. Michael Torpey, former group finance director, Ulster Bank Group and Mr. Robert Gallagher, former chief executive, corporate markets division of Ulster Bank.  Mr. Michael Torpey was group finance director, Ulster Bank Group, from 2004 to 2007, having previously been financial director at First Active.  Since leaving Ulster Bank, Mr. Torpey has been a group treasurer at Irish Life and Permanent, head of banking at NTMA and, since 2013, has been chief executive, corporate and treasury division at Bank of Ireland.<br/><br/>Mr. Robert Gallagher was chief executive, corporate markets division, Ulster Bank, from 2015 to 2011.  Between 1991 and 2005, Mr. Gallagher had numerous positions in AIB and before that he worked with Citigroup in Australia.  Since 2014, Mr. Gallagher has been director credit at KKR, a US investment firm.  <br/><br/>Mr. Torpey and Mr. Gallagher, you are both welcome before the committee this morning and before I commence proceedings, I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  The utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the gallery, those documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.<br/><br/>So, in that regard the witnesses have been directed to attend the meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee and will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  So before we begin the proceedings, so if I can ask the clerk to administer the oath to both Mr. Torpey and Mr. Gallagher, please.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to assist the inquiry and I will be pleased to address any questions the committee may wish to ask pertaining to your remit.  My background is that I have spent my career to date working in financial services in Ireland with a particular focus on capital markets and treasury activities.  Immediately prior to my role as finance director at Ulster Bank Group, I spent three years as director with responsibility for finance and treasury at First Active plc, the former First National Building Society, which had converted to plc and floated on the Stock Exchange in 1998.  I was appointed finance director of the Ulster Bank Group in January 2004, following the acquisition of First Active plc by the Ulster Bank Group on behalf of Royal Bank of Scotland.  I remained in this position until December 2007.  And this move to Ulster Bank represented a move from the position of finance director of a publicly quoted company to a reporting line internally in the RBS group, to the group finance director in what was a very much larger multinational  organisation.</p> <p>  My specific responsibilities in my capacity as finance director of Ulster Bank included the integration of the First Active and Ulster Bank Group financial accounting systems onto the RBS Group accounting platform; decision support to all of the business areas of the Ulster Bank Group in matters of finance; review of group accounting policies and practices; and assessing and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.  I was chairman of the Ulster Bank Group tax policy and controls committee, the group assets and liabilities committee, the group reconciliations committee and the finance supervisory committee.  </p> <p>  My brief included responsibility for statutory and regulatory reporting as well as financial controls and reconciliations for so long as the financial accounting systems resided in Ulster Bank Group.  A major element of my role while in the Ulster Bank Group was delivery of a hugely complex  integration of the financial accounting systems of both First Active and Ulster Bank onto the RBS group financial accounting systems.</p><p>With differing regulatory, legal, taxation and even currency regimes, this was an extraordinarily complex project, which had to be delivered while maintaining continuity of accounting reporting and, indeed, controls in Ulster Bank Group throughout the period.</p><p> Following completion of the migration project, production of statutory and regulatory accounts, along with the principal accounting services for the Ulster Bank Group, moved to the RBS Group accounting function in Scotland.  As a wholly owned subsidiary of RBS, the role of finance director, as indicated, was much more specialised than might have been encountered in a stand-alone company or, indeed, than I had experienced at First Active plc.  It was, effectively, a divisional management position within the RBS finance function with additional responsibility, including in relation to statutory accounts and regulatory reporting.  Following completion of the integration project and the move of the principal accounting services to Scotland, the role was further narrowed, becoming a role heavily focused on the hugely important business support and financial controls, as well as reporting to, and very close engagement with, RBS Group finance.  In practical terms, the role can be represented as a specialised accounting role at that stage.</p><p> I reported to the CEO of Ulster Bank Group and, in parallel, to the RBS Group finance director.  And this latter relationship reflected that, in large part, my responsibilities were carried out under RBS Group strategy, policies, and often under direct influence and control.  I had little involvement in operational matters in the business which did not directly involve delivery by the finance function.  The Ulster Bank finance function had no involvement, for example, in credit policy and strategy and was not represented on the group risk credit policy and strategy committee, which was responsible for maintaining asset quality, determining policy, and ensuring adequate controls within the parameters of the RBS policy framework.</p><p> Central to this operating structure is the functional nature of the RBS Group organisational structure.  RBS Group operates as an integrated group requiring that control, policy and process and so forth are driven and controlled from the centre.  A particularly significant instance of this was that, from the outset, RBS Group treasury assumed responsibility for, among other things, treasury and balance sheet management functions and undertook to meet the capital and funding needs of Ulster Bank Group directly.  I had proposed the retention of baseline treasury capability in Ulster Bank Group from the outset but this was not in keeping with RBS policy and was not accepted.  From Ulster Bank's perspective, then, capital funding requirements and balance sheet metrics were viewed in the context of the overall RBS Group situation rather than from a stand-alone perspective.  Ulster Bank was a small part of the RBS Group and in Ulster Bank we had limited influence on, or control responsibility for, the RBS Group balance sheet management.  This approach by RBS Group certainly had cost and scale benefits and had the effect for the group of enabling divisions to focus on business delivery while the RBS Group centre delivered the structural supports, such as the funding capital and balance sheet management.  These structural requirements would, of course be ... form an integral part of management in a stand-alone entity.  </p><p> I mention these matters, Chairman, to clarify my role and reporting relationships, as they operated within the RBS policy framework, and to provide the committee with some insight into my role within a wholly owned subsidiary.  That said, I clearly recognise and accept that, as a member of the boards of Ulster Bank Group and as a member of the RBS finance board - that being a committee of the finance directors of RBS divisions and senior finance personnel from RBS Group centre, which was chaired by the RBS Group finance director - I have responsibility for my part in developments within Ulster Bank Group between 2004 and 2007 and any impacts that these developments had on the banking sector generally.  I very much regret that, like so many others, I did not foresee, during my time in Ulster Bank Group, the extent of the difficulties arising within the RBS Group, the extent or duration of the turbulence in wholesale funding markets, the collapse of the property market in Ireland and, indeed, the resulting difficulties for Ulster Bank Group and the impacts on people and the population as a whole.  I dearly wish that we could have known that even ... then even a small part of what we now know so that we might have been able to pursue a different course.  I'm happy, Chairman, to address any questions the committee wish to ask within the context of the inquiry.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to appear before this inquiry and I shall be as helpful as I can in assisting you in your work.  My opening remarks this morning are supplementary to the written statement, which I submitted to the inquiry on 9 April.</p> <p>  My professional background is in international banking.  Prior to joining Ulster Bank I was head of corporate banking international for AIB, with responsibility for businesses in London, Frankfurt and Paris.  I joined as chief executive, corporate markets, at Ulster Bank Group in late 2005 and worked at the bank until I resigned in September 2011.</p><p>I joined the bank well into its growth phase, and in the six years I spent working there, I oversaw a two year period of growth followed by four years of intensive portfolio management and remediation of the corporate markets divisions of the bank.</p><p> The reputation and strength of RBS Group was a key factor in influencing my decision to join Ulster Bank.  RBS was then a very successful bank.  It was held in high regard globally, and I believe the significant presence they had in Europe, the US and Asia could be leveraged to the benefit of Irish companies seeking to expand in those markets.  Looking back, I was excited about the opportunity to develop and grow a corporate business here to compete with AIB and Bank of Ireland.</p><p> As chief executive of the corporate markets, my responsibilities included corporate banking, business and commercial banking, property finance, capital markets in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland.  Corporate markets had approximately 1,700 people working in Dublin, Belfast and 32 business centres around the island.</p><p> On my arrival into the business, Ulster Bank already had a well developed and long-standing property division.  The commercial property loan book was then approximately 60% of the corporate loan book.  On joining, a key objective of mine was to diversify the portfolio.  I sought to do this by bringing the RBS global capacity and products to the corporate and business customers in Ireland.  In order to facilitate this objective, I oversaw a significant expansion of the business centre network, the enhancement of the corporate systems capability and initiate a substantial training and investment in our people, particularly on financial and cash flow analysis. </p><p> The bank's strategy was to become a third force in the Irish universal banking market, to challenge the dominance of the big two.  As a wholly-owned subsidiary bank, treasury, capital funding and balance sheet management was provided to us by RBS.  Our focus in corporate markets was on growth and diversification of income streams.</p><p> The bank's strategy and business agenda were underpinned by a control and reporting framework, which was aligned with the wider RBS group.  We were plugged directly into the RBS credit approval framework.  The risk, credit, finance operations, internal audit, HR and treasury functions all reported into RBS on a matrix basis.  The concept of first and second line of defence was deeply imbedded in the RBS approach to the control environment.  The risk management division of Ulster Bank, which was independent of the corporate markets, was structured, resourced and managed in a manner consistent with other RBS divisional risk management functions.  We were obliged to operate within the parameters of a comprehensive and detailed policy rules and guidelines, which prescribed how risks were to be managed.  These policies covered lending limits and approval structures, LTV limits, stress testing and evaluation processes.</p><p> In my view, the governance structures and policies at Ulster Bank were adequate.  Did everything work according to plan?  No, I can't say everything did.  However, in the vast majority of situations, the rigour and consistency of the bank's approach worked well.  The critical mistake was to base our ambitious growth strategy on economic assumptions which we firmly believed to be well founded, but which proved in time to be seriously flawed.  When I joined the bank in 2005, the internal economic analysis and pretty much all of the external economic analysis forecasted continued GDP growth into the medium term.  Ireland had experienced a property boom which had lasted then over ten years, driven in main by the fundamental factors such as low interest rate regime, increasing population, strong growth in employment and rising household incomes.  Corporate activity was particularly strong from the late 1990s onwards through a combination of buoyant indigenous enterprise and foreign direct investment.</p><p> Come 2007 when the signals of the slow down became apparent, most economic analysis, including our own, predicted the notorious soft landing.  The consequence of the reliance on flawed assumptions allied to the failure to critically analysis and challenge the pace and extent of the property construction lending has been clear to everyone.  As a former director of Ulster Bank, I deeply regret this.  I spent the period from 2008 onwards remediating the business.  During this period and as a member of the executive of Ulster Bank, we sought and received RBS approval for an action plan to protect the Ulster Bank franchise in Ireland.  In corporate markets, this plan included the allocation of over 300 people to a new division to manage the deteriorating portfolio; the reduction of the intergroup lending limit, which had grown substantially following the introduction of the bank guarantee scheme in the Republic of Ireland, of which Ulster Bank was not part; and the reduction of the cost base of the organisation and the re-shape and re-size of the business to reflect the new economic reality.</p><p>Through this very difficult period we continue to have the support and faith of the new RBS management team which has brought in to manage business.  Thank you for listening to my opening remarks and I am happy to address the questions from the members of the inquiry.</p></speech>

A few questions for you following on from your statements.  First of all actually I want to ask you both, Mr. McCarthy when he was here yesterday indicated to the committee that he had had some contact with Ulster Bank in preparing his opening statement.  I'd just like to ask you maybe both to clarify the extent of any help from Ulster Bank in terms of preparing your presentation to the committee both this morning and the previous written statement.</p></speech>

I left Ulster Bank at the end of 2007 so when I received the direction to attend the committee, I sought from Ulster Bank some briefing so as to assist me in my recall and accurate evidence to the committee and I received briefing documents in relation to the areas of inquiry which the committee has signalled to me.</p></speech>

On the night of the 29th, we know now that there was extensive conversations involving officials at the Department of Finance on 29 September 2008, Minister for Finance, Taoiseach and representatives of AIB and Bank of Ireland.  Were either or both of you aware at the time that these conversations were happening and did Ulster Bank, in or about that time, make any representations as to the nature of those discussions?  And I also furthermore ask you both your opinion as to the nature of the guarantee which emerged?  Do you have any particular views as to the items that were covered by the guarantee and the full extent of it and what is your current opinion on the blanket guarantee that emerged subsequently?</p></speech>

I think in terms of events on the night of the guarantee Deputy, I've no knowledge whatever.  I left Ulster Bank at the end of 2007 and in fact I was not working in the financial services industry and for very much of 2008 not even in the country.  So that I have no knowledge, frankly, as to the events leading up to, surrounding or immediately following the night of the guarantee so regrettably, I can't offer any assistance on that front.  Equally I am entirely uninformed as to the detail of the circumstances that gave rise to the guarantee and as such, any opinion that I would have would be at risk of being worse than unhelpful but misleading simply because of the lack of information I have.  Thank you Chairman.</p></speech>

I did, along with Mr. McCarthy, meet the Minister for Finance on the 30th in the morning, where he was attending a business launch which we were having in George's Quay in Dublin and at that meeting, we indicated our concern about the impact of the guarantee to Ulster Bank and the outflow of deposits.  And post that date and for broadly speaking a month afterwards, we saw a material outflow of deposits.</p></speech>

Can I ask then, Mr. Gallagher I suppose is the most relevant person to ask, in relation to the guarantee itself, Mr. McCarthy yesterday in evidence spoke about the predatory behaviour of certain institutions in or around the time of the guarantee and I want to quote him directly.</p><p>He said, "...pretty quickly after the guarantee was announced there was predatory behaviour on the part of certain institutions.  People in certain institutions contacting customers to the effect that, you know, "Bring your money in here, there is a State guarantee, it is much safer.""  That's a direct quote.  Can you inform the committee which institutions were engaged in that particular activity or do you have any further information to add to what Mr. McCarthy said in that regard yesterday?</p></speech>

So, as a fact, we had a material outflow of moneys, which went to other institutions and that fact is reflected in the increase in the inter-group limit in Ulster Bank.  The moneys provided by RBS, I think in the month of October, went up by approximately &euro;4 billion.  So we had an outflow of approximately that amount of money that went to other institutions who were guaranteed.  There is no question in my mind that other institutions, or front-line staff of other institutions, were proactive with our customer base in their desire to build their deposit base.  And, anecdotal evidence would suggest that, in doing so, they reinforced their ... their communication around the strength of the guarantee and our lack of a guarantee.</p></speech>

He also said on the same point yesterday ,about consolidation in the banking sector ... and I want to quote him directly again, he said  "There was some conversation subsequent to the guarantee about institutions merging and doing, you know, transactions.  I think there's been some evidence to the committee about that and there were some conversations held with us as to whether we, as a group, would be interested in participating in consolidation of the Irish banking sector."  Just want to know, Mr. Gallagher, can you provide any additional information as to the nature of those conversations and, really, who was asking Ulster Bank to participate in consolidation of the banking sector and what consideration was given by Ulster Bank to those conversations?</p></speech>

I can assume happened at chief executive and chairman level.  So, other than what has been covered in the public media about coming together ... or whether third forces ... I don't have actually a perspective or knowledge of that.</p></speech>

But, yesterday Mr. Boucher, under questioning from Deputy Higgins, said that a letter which he wrote in support of that particular project - a planning letter - in Ballsbridge was one of the most stupid things he had ever done and that's a direct quote.  And yet it was Ulster Bank who had famously mostly funded the particular project in question.  I'd just like to ask you how you would characterise the decision of Ulster Bank at the time to fund that particular project.  It was during your time, I think.</p></speech>

The decision in relation to the ... any particular credit, and I am not going to talk about anyone in particular, was a matter which occurred as between the competent functions in the Ulster Bank Group.  So when a credit application came to the appropriate part of the business, that credit application was considered and developed in whatever way they do it, and went to the appropriate credit decisioning authority to make a decision.  And where credits were of a certain size that fell within discretion within Ulster Bank; where they were of a larger size they went to credit committees at RBS Group.  I think I mentioned in my opening statement the integrated nature of the group and such that there was a very high level of control by RBS Group in such matters.</p><p> As the finance director in Ulster Bank, I had no part to play in these matters.  I would have no knowledge of the customers, of the particular credit applications or the credit decisions and, you know, to the extent that it's a follow-on from your earlier question, I would have no reason to believe that any such decisions in relation to any customers of the bank were taken on anything other than commercial ... a commercial basis.</p></speech>

I think in the public ... in the public domain, that sale and purchase of that asset, I think, occurred in June, July '05.  I wasn't in the organisation but I echo Mr. Torpey's comments with regard to specific customer information, I couldn't comment, even if I had been.</p></speech>

And I want to put you particularly a quote from Mr. Brian Goggin, former chief executive of Bank of Ireland, who gave testimony to the inquiry last week on the product, and he said, and I quote:<blockquote><br /><br />The pioneers of 100% mortgages was Ulster Bank through First Active.  And we actually ... when the concept of providing 100% mortgages was first raised at a group risk policy committee, my recollection is it was declined and by the time we came to providing 100% mortgages, we were very much a reluctant follower.</blockquote>I want to ask you both, do you believe that Ulster Bank effectively then drove other banks in the Republic of Ireland into the 100% mortgage market and ultimately into making decisions which, up to that point, they wouldn't have made?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-07a.526" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Torpey" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050700002#H00500"><p>I think, Deputy, the question of 100% mortgages is something that was grounded in the circumstances of the time.  I have, no doubt, in fact I'm entirely satisfied, that 100% mortgages were available on a, let's call it case-by-case basis from a number of institutions prior to the more public availability of a product labelled in those terms.  I think, again I would be ... I'm entirely satisfied that we were in an extremely competitive market situation at the time and indeed First Active, being the subsidiary within Ulster Bank which was the first within Ulster Bank to introduce the 100% mortgages, was in fact losing market share materially in the context of the competition in the marketplace.  They were the conditions that gave rise to the introduction of a product with limited availability and fairly tight controls.  Having said all of that, you know, as the way the market has evolved over time, events that subsequently happened, I think with the benefit of hindsight, it would've better if that product had not been introduced.</p></speech>

As a board member of the bank, it was a constrained-in-size and well monitored product.  That's all I really have to say, yes.</p></speech>

Can I ask, Mr. Torpey, how ... like, what is your own feeling?  We've heard evidence from a number of witnesses that Ulster Bank were the instigators of marketing the 100% mortgage product for the first time, and perhaps it was available to certain categories of individuals in other institutions.  But others from other institutions have come in here and firmly pointed the finger at Ulster Bank as being the instigators of this particular product.  And yesterday, Mr. McCarthy gave evidence to the committee that 100% mortgages formed about 1% of their mortgage loan book, I think, in Ulster Bank, prior to the direct marketing of this product, and then it went up to about 4%, I think, was the figure that he used yesterday.  Do you have any feelings about being characterised as the instigators of this product and, you know, what is your own, I suppose, opinion now, if you could elaborate on that a bit more, as to the effect that the 100% mortgage and the direct marketing of that as a product into the Irish market, ultimately had on mortgage lending across the board in all the banks?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-07a.530" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Torpey" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050700002#J00100"><p>I think, Deputy, the 100% mortgages is one of a number of elements of an extraordinarily competitive market that existed in the period to which you're referring.  There was extensive marketing of incentives of one sort or another to encourage or support people in the purchase of houses and the financing of them through mortgage borrowing.  I think the intensity of the competition across the piece did contribute to the over-heating of the market through that period.  To the specific question of the 100% mortgage, it was one element in that wide range of competitive factors that were put into play.  I think the ... with the benefit of hindsight, it had a more pronounced effect in optical terms in terms of the perceptions that it will have created in the marketplace than it had in terms of an actual impact.  As you rightly say, the proportion of Ulster Bank's portfolio that ended up in 100% mortgages built up over a number of years was still in low single digits.  So it didn't, in terms of the quantity of financing it put into the market, move the dial in any dramatic fashion, but I would accept, Deputy, that it may have had a greater announcement effect as I have said, and, with that perspective, I would acknowledge that it was not a good move to make with the benefit of that hindsight.</p></speech>

Mr Gallagher, you expressed the view that ... you were a member of the board at the time, and you expressed some regret about the 100% mortgage ... was there any discussion at board level or any opposition, any alternative views offered when the prospect of offering 100% mortgages was first discussed and a decision was made.

I want to move to core document, gentlemen, UBI - B2, at page 16.  It's a memorandum to the board for a meeting in August of 2007, authored by Mr. Torpey.  It's particularly a reference to sectoral limits, and there's a quote in it that I ... under the heading "Background", and was referenced yesterday in discussions with Mr McCarthy: "In recent weeks, the Irish Financial Regulator (IFR) has increased Ulster Bank [Ireland's] property sectoral limit from 250% to 500% of its regulatory capital base and may, following a diversification review scheduled for July 2007, be prepared to increase the limit further."</p> <p>  I would like to ask you, I suppose, firstly, Mr Torpey, in your opinion, did the fact that Ulster Bank Ireland could easily transfer the risk on its property portfolio in excess of 250% of its limit to its parent, enable the bank to lend more aggressively into the property sector in Ireland than would otherwise have been the case?  And actually, I have a group of further subsequent questions, but if you could answer that one first, maybe?</p></speech>

The reality is that had the risk transfers not been possible, the capital would have simply been moved to the ... the other subsidiaries, such ... because the capital was available in the ... in the Ulster Bank Group to meet the appetite.  So, the short answer to your question, Deputy, is the risk transfer ... the sectoral limits requirements did not act as a constraint on the level of property lending by Ulster Bank Group because the capital was available in the group.</p></speech>

Specifically on the matter of sectoral limits, yesterday Mr. McCarthy, in his earlier evidence, said ... stated, and I quote, that: "There was a sense that the sectoral limit was honoured more in the breach than in the observance".  Subsequently when I asked him specifically about the matter, he said that Ulster Bank had never breached the 250% limit as it previously existed, and we've had evidence from Mr. Gleeson, in particular, former chairman of AIB, where he referred ... referenced the sectoral limits, and he said directly: "We would have been very well off not to have exceeded the sectoral limit.  It's a great shame that we didn't".  And he's viewed the sectoral limit as a guideline more than an actual firm limit.  So I want to ask you, in relation to Mr. McCarthy's evidence yesterday, firstly, he said it was observed more in the breach than in the observance, and, secondly, he said that Ulster Bank had never breached it,.  Did Ulster Bank breach the sectoral limit, did it come anywhere near breaching the sectoral limit?  If it didn't, why was there ... why was the limit increased to 500%, and why was that sought by Ulster Bank?  And, furthermore, what was your own attitude, and the attitude of the bank to the limits in question?  Did you see them, as Mr. Gleeson saw them, as guidelines, or did you see them, as Mr. McCarthy referenced them yesterday, as firm restrictions on lending into particular sectors?</p></speech>

We did not breach the limits at any stage.  When we were approaching the limit within a subsidiary within the Ulster Bank Group, specifically the subsidiaries UBIL, Ulster Bank Ireland Limited or First Active, we engaged in risk transfers with the full knowledge of the regulator so as to locate the risk where there was sufficient capital to accommodate that lending, and as such we observed, entirely, the rules in a full and open way with full and open transparency to the regulator.  So I'm entirely satisfied with the compliance of Ulster Bank to that, and indeed to regulatory rules, generally.  To your question in relation to others, we would have wondered, given the pace of growth in lending in some quarters, how it was others managed to comply with the rules, and, indeed, recent evidence as you pointed out suggests that some people who didn't necessarily comply with those rules, as we understood them.</p></speech>

Was there any concerns or difficulties with regard to the skill sets of staff members, particularly in regard to when market conditions would deteriorate and loan impairments started to increase?  And did you consider that Ulster Bank had sufficiently-trained staff with the appropriate skill sets to deal with the arrear collections and the managing of problem loans?  It's like moving, in sporting parlance from offence to defence, did you actually have the skill sets at that time?</p></speech>

So, Chairman, the first thing is I'd say is in 2006, we made a very material investment in enhancing the capability of our people and launched what was called an academy, which was a very comprehensive programme, which pretty much all staff had the option to go on or opportunity to go on, which was anchored in increasing their skills around cash flow analysis, their skills around understanding of balance sheets, cash flows, P and Ls, to reinforce across the business the need to focus on repayment capacity being sourced from cash flow and to continuously encourage our people to realise that security is a second way out not a first way out.  That was a very material programme for which we spent a material amount of money.</p> <p>  To the question that then moves how adequately resourced or talented were people to manage the deterioration in the period late '07 onwards, it has to be recognised, I think, that banking generally and banking in Ireland went through a very, very prolonged period of no or very little bad debts and in a period where that occurs, the skill sets and knowledge around managing tough situations diminishes.  So, there was a lot of specific training and there was a lot of need to enhance skills and people learned on the job and they learned by training and they learned, by some degree, by the occasional bringing-in of people from RBS who had worked in deteriorating case situations.</p></speech>

Mr. Torpey, if I could address my first question to yourself, please, and I'd like to refer to core document, Vol. 2, page 5, and it relates to the inspection by the regulator of Ulster Bank in February of 2006 and in the subsequent report that you received from the regulator under the heading &quot;Reporting of Credit Risk&quot;, the following is said:<blockquote><br /><br />The inspectors are concerned that there [are not ... there] does not appear to be any evidence of credit risk reporting to [the bank of ...] the board of [Ulster Bank Ireland] on a periodic basis.  Credit Risk reporting would include, inter alia, an overview of the quality of the loan book, the level of provisions and a summary of the level of exceptions which have been approved.</blockquote>And in relation to those exceptions, Mr. Torpey, the regulator says:<blockquote>The inspectors noted a high level of exceptions to policy on the [residential mortgage lending] portfolio - 27% of approvals in 2005 were exceptions.  In addition, while a list of Debt Service Ratio ... and Loan To Value ... exceptions was provided to the inspectors, there was no evidence that these exceptions to policy (together with a rationale for permitting them) are being reported to the board.</blockquote></p><p>Mr. Torpey, was there a free-for-all in the lending in Ulster Bank at this stage, perhaps arising - I suggest you confirm or deny - from pressure to extend the business of the bank in relation to the type of targets that had been set for the bank, in terms of growth, profits etc.?</p></speech>

It would be a matter of, I suppose, concern that the nature of the engagement by the Financial Regulator with the institution was one where the regulator will, as in this case, have conducted an inspection, will have chosen not to engage with queries as to detail on the ground in the inspection and will have written their observations.  An effect of that, Deputy, is that the regulator will not necessarily have been fully appraised of the position, will not have got the simple answers to questions, until such time as he wrote and got the response.</p> <p>  To the specific content of your inquiry, was there reporting of lending, was there reporting of exceptions and was there challenge to exceptions by the board of Ulster Bank Ireland Limited, yes, there was and there was on a continuing basis through my period working with Ulster Bank.  So I am entirely satisfied that we were operating in a highly controlled environment, that there was appropriate challenge, there were policies in place, in particular in relation to the residential lending, which is the point of your reference here; that where there were exceptions and, policies being as they are, there was a tolerance for a level of exceptions just as there is now under the regulatory guidelines, or regulatory rules on mortgage lending, that there was a challenge to those exceptions, that exceptions were addressed by management to establish that the lending was of a character and quality that fell within the risk appetite of the group.  So, I am fully satisfied that the controls were in place.</p></speech>

How does that square?  How did ... in your view, did the regulator get it completely wrong and, if you believe that, how so?</p></speech>

The regulator, on his inspection, will, I'm absolutely satisfied in good faith, have made certain observations and will not have found, during that relatively short period of inspection, the evidence of these matters.  Personally, I would've preferred if there had been a closer engagement by the regulator with senior management, when many of these queries could have been answered immediately, because it is a matter of fact that there was a reporting of these matters and of exceptions to the board on a continuing basis.</p></speech>

There was no confirmation of the amount of rental income ... used in the calculation of DSR in a number of cases</blockquote>And there's other related matters ... the use of the term &quot;nixers&quot; in a branch assessment and the use of income arising from nixers in assessing a mortgage application.</p><p>Now, Mr. Torpey, this observation here by the regulator ties in with evidence that was given to the inquiry by the chairman and chief executive of NAMA, who found that there was insufficient documentation, insufficient checking of creditworthiness of individuals and projects etc., which created huge problems for many of the banks later.  But you say there was no problem in Ulster Bank? </p></speech>

There is no doubt that files, which are bulky and complex affairs, and indeed back ten years ago tended to be even far more manually compiled than they are nowadays, it will have been challenging for the inspection, in the space of a few days in the building, to trace through all of the documentation on a file.  You know, I note from your quote that they found that the files had insufficient documentation or there was no evidence.  So I think ... I know that the bank will have addressed these queries very specifically and resolved these queries in an extensive fashion.  To your comparison with NAMA, frankly it's impossible to comment upon that.  NAMA did not have any engagement with Ulster Bank, so NAMA's experience has ... bears no relation to the position in Ulster Bank and NAMA furthermore was in commercial property.</p></speech>

I believe that the standards applied were of the best international standards.  It's not to say that there weren't lapses or errors or weaknesses, as in any process driven by human effort, but as to whether there was a systemic laxity in the controls and processes operated by Ulster Bank, I have no reason to believe that there was any such laxity.</p></speech>

Mr. McCarthy told us yesterday, in essence, that Ulster Bank came in here as a much vaunted third force, which had been spoken about.  Very ambitious targets of growth for profit, lending, etc.  Would you agree or disagree that that would have put a lot of pressure on your lenders within the bank to grow the business much quicker than was perhaps prudent or not?</p></speech>

Your question really is: if we did have, as I understand it, a well-controlled process, how did we ... how did we come to lose money?  And I think the core of it lies in the fact that the RBS Group was a group which, as you rightly suggest, was targeted on growing its business in Ireland.  In particular having invested very heavily in both the purchase of the banks in Ireland and the systems costs that were applied, they sought to grow to be a competitor with, an equal with, or indeed to match the incumbent full-service banks, being AIB and Bank of Ireland.  The strategy, therefore, was one of growth.  The growth was predicated on an environment where there was a near-universal view that the growth prospects for the Irish market continued to be strong and that Ireland was on a good path, shall we say.  Any ambitions to grow the business were subject to the constraints of the risk appetite of the group, subject to the controls, procedures and policies of the RBS Group, as transmitted to Ulster Bank.  So while we had an objective to grow the business, a clear desire and ambition to grow the business, the RBS Group was not tolerant of relaxing standards and controls in pursuit of that growth.</p></speech>

I would distinguish, Deputy, between the position of a small challenger seeking to grow market share within a market and overall growth in a market place.  Ulster Bank was coming from a position of being very much smaller than the dominant banks in the Irish marketplace.  It is entirely acceptable from a business perspective, in my view, that a small challenger can seek to grow significantly more rapidly than the general marketplace and significantly more rapidly than a competitor's, in the interest of bringing competition to the marketplace and growing its position relative to the incumbents.</p></speech>

But to the pure core question, the remuneration which I received was determined by the RBS Group.</p><p>It was determined independent of me ... and like all executives within the RBS Group, it was determined across a matrix of objectives about topics like people leadership, topics like running the business, topics like customer engagement, topics like performance.  So it was a ...a balanced scorecard assessment.  But ultimately it was discretionary ... discretionary in the bonus element by the RBS Group ... of which I was a recipient.  To your question about the ... the levels, I think your observation is fair.  I think the levels look excessive.</p></speech>

Is that fair to say?</p></speech>

For example, your largest bonus was &euro;580,000 in 2008, the very year that many banks, including RBS, tanked.  Would there not have been a clawback from the bonus in relation to that very detrimental happening for the bank?</p></speech>

So I have seen how that has impacted the way the evolution of those types of rewards occur.  Were they sufficient in ... across the industry generally?  Were they sufficient in the years up to 2008?  I think they ... I would echo what the general sentiment is and say, "No they weren't."</p></speech>

I would think ... you know ... pay levels in the banking business at the time, were undoubtedly very high.  I believe that the incentives were driven on a balanced scorecard basis reflecting the variety of objectives which constituted the make-up of the overall banking situation.  And I think in terms of the lessons learned ... I think the approach to remuneration in banking internationally, particularly the EBA approach to guidelines for remuneration in banking, have taken on board lessons learned, not just in Ireland, indeed, internationally from the weaknesses of remuneration structures that may have existed, or did indeed, exist in the past.</p></speech>

This sets goals and customer strategies ... or purports to set them for the period 2007 to 2012.  And it is envisaged that operating profit will go from &euro;600 million to &euro;1.3 billion ... new mortgage lending from &euro;5 billion to &euro;15 billion ... corporate market Republic of Ireland share from 15% to 30%.  What was management thinking here, Mr. Gallagher?  These would, by many, be considered to be extraordinarily ambitious targets.  What was your rationale and how did you think you were going to achieve them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-07a.603" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Gallagher" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050700002#O01500"><p>So, Deputy ...a couple of comments, if I may.  The first is ''Journey to One'' was predominantly a staff engagement programme.  So we utilised a process emanating from the States called ... a teaching programme where people engaged about leadership and how they shared and worked together.  And a part of it was this page and the outputs from this page, but a lot of the programme was around staff engagement ... around post ... some very, very tough integration matters we had ... how would we encourage and motivate and lift people's spirits?  That was the context.  I will answer your specific question but that was the context to it.</p> <p>The other thing I will say, Deputy ... in ... on this topic is there is no question that Ulster Bank, until the ownership of RBS, had a real desire to compete with AIB and Bank of Ireland in a much more substantial way.  And it was one of the reasons I joined the organisation.  And if you think about what Ulster Bank is on the Republic of Ireland ... in ... for instance, in Donegal, Ulster Bank's market share might be 20%, whereas in Cork and Kerry it might be 2%.  So the belief that Ulster Bank could increase its market share, particularly in the southern part of the country, was real and meaningful and was evidenced by the investment which Ulster Bank was making around the country.</p> <p>So, if you look at the business centres and branches which were opened by Ulster Bank in that period in places like Carrigaline, in Killarney, in Tralee, in Limerick ... there was a material expansion of the physical premises on the island of Ireland by Ulster Bank.  If you compound that with the material investment in technology ... just to provide services to retail customers and business customers ... and you add to that the material expansion of the ATM network of Ulster Bank ... some of which was reflected in these pages.  There was a very substantial increase in the capability of Ulster Bank to provide services to customers around the island which never existed before in its 175 years on the island and in the Republic of Ireland.</p></speech>

Ulster Bank maintained a panel of perhaps around 100 approved mortgage valuers and obviously in terms of assessing risk it is in banking I believe vitally important that an independent valuation be requested and property may be taken as security.  How was the business distributed among these valuers?  And were there any groups within that, that got disproportionate share of the business or were specially favoured or how did it work?</p></speech>

So, on the top of page 74, if you have it in front of you, "Control Issue No. 2 ... Mortgages are processed to completion without sufficient consideration being given to whether all terms and conditions, and documentation requirements, have been satisfied."  Classification is "Significant".  And if we go down to the third paragraph then underneath that, "The current process does not require (or result in) full copies of a Mortgage Offer Letter ... being held on file, either in paper form or electronically.  For switcher mortgages (remortgages) the current process does not require the centre to have sight of the signed [offer letter] at all."  Can you comment on that?

It's not strictly in my remit but I'll answer as best I can from my general knowledge of the situation.  Following the establishment of that mortgage centre, weaknesses emerged ... there was an internal audit requested ... I believe by the chief executive, although I'm open to correction on that, and it did turn up very significant issues which led to an immediate escalation of the concerns and it did lead to an immediate bringing in of resource from RBS Group who, as I've stressed earlier, take these things very seriously, to remediate the issues as quickly as possible, because ... I would, you know, that ... an audit report like ... such as this does not make good reading.  I don't offer it as an excuse, that it had just been newly set up.  I think the only good thing that can be said about an audit report like this was that it was undertaken quickly after the establishment of the Dublin Mortgage Centre to establish the weaknesses and ... so that they could be escalated, addressed and put to rights.</p></speech>

I think, Deputy, that's somewhat different to ... any implication that they would be offered ... that there would've been mortgages going out on preferential terms.  I think, as I read it here, Deputy, and again I'm talking from a general knowledge rather than a detailed knowledge of the Dublin Mortgage Centre, it seems to me that we're looking here at  ... at ... at a serious deficiency in process where the various items that had to be delivered prior to draw down weren't necessarily ... or at least there wasn't evidence that they had been delivered prior to draw down.  That is a weakness, not an acceptable weakness, and management will have taken that very seriously and I have sufficient recollection to know that, as I have said, that ... that a senior resource from the RBS Group was brought in to quickly and thoroughly remediate these weaknesses.</p></speech>

I've to move on now just to another question while I still have time.  And the book is UBI - B2, page 21.  So you have some tables in front of you.  By mid-2006, the level of new mortgage lending in Ulster Bank outside of policy reached 40%, and policy changed later that year and the level dropped to 20%.  So can you just clarify for me, lending outside of policy, is that what you would refer to as exceptional lending?</p></speech>

The approach to policy in residential mortgages was ... and, as would be good practice today, indeed, that you had policies which then had a tolerance around them because prescriptive policies of their nature lead to a need for a certain level of exception.  And, to be entirely frank, Deputy, once you're moving beyond low-teens, mid-teens exceptions, you have to raise a question as to the appropriateness of policy.  The exceptions to policy were the subject of challenge by the board of UBIL throughout.  And to the specific item of debt service ratio policy exceptions within ... within UBIL ... and you will note on the page to which you've referred me, the difference between the First Active and the UBIL experience; that arose largely because the exceptions were very highly concentrated on people with higher incomes such that the appropriate debt service requirement will not have been captured by policy and, indeed, the revision to policy will have captured that.  So if we find that ... and I believe it to be the case when I was there, that the majority of debt service policy breaches were for high income earners, that is a mitigant which is acceptable and would have been reflected in the policy revision subsequently.  And I believe also that a very high proportion of those exceptions will have been minor exceptions - as in, very marginally above the policy limits.  It doesn't take from the fact - and it's very, very important, Deputy, I would agree - that where you do have exceptions arising, that they are challenged by the board and satisfactory explanations along the lines I've given or such other as they may be are arrived at to ensure that credit risk appetite is being adhered to.</p></speech>

I think it, in some ways, describes some of the strengths that Ulster Bank Group will have had, notwithstanding events that subsequently happened, that while we had a credit policy driven by and controlled by RBS Group, we had an independent board who saw fit to challenge these things and will have required that they receive detailed explanations as to the level of exceptions continuing.  So I believe and I'm satisfied that the board did get satisfactory explanations to give them the assurance that while specific policy lines may have been breached, the credit appetite or, in other words, the credit risks being assumed on this lending were within acceptable boundaries but I would absolutely agree that it's appropriate that such exceptions be challenged on a continuing basis.</p></speech>

Just before we go to the break, if I can just go into an area with either Mr. Torpey or Mr. Gallagher.  You might express me which one of you is probably more relative to it.  In the engagement with mortgage brokers, which was something that Ulster Bank done, alone with other banks, during the period, was there a part of the growth strategy that was outlined by Deputy Higgins, a thought given to developing partnerships or in developing relationships with independent mortgage brokers as a means of increasing your growth into the mortgage market?</p></speech>

UBI, B2C, Vol. 2, pages 19 to 30, and in particular page 27.  Chairman there was a worst-case scenario in stress testing.  Residential property prices were forecast to fall by 30% between 2008 to 2009, and commercial property prices were forecast to fall by 40%.  That would result in a total impairment charge of &euro;540 million.  The actual impairment charge for UBIL was &euro;1.7 billion.  Can you explain why the actual impairment charge was so much higher than that forecast in the stress tests?  Were there any more severe stress test scenarios considered by the bank or discussed at the board?  Were the in-house economists involved and were the stress tests different for residential, commercial development, speculative land banks? The question is directed to both gentlemen, in whatever order.</p></speech>

I am a little bit light on this one because it was subsequent to my departure from Ulster Bank but in general terms, the parameters of the stress tests that would have applied during my time with the bank were perimeters that were determined or dictated by the Financial Regulator, and as such the stress tests will have been conducted on the basis of those parameters that were indicated.  I think it is fair to say that stress tests failed to capture the outcomes that were to transpire over time, perhaps if for no other reason, that the scale of events was entirely unprecedented and off the scale of any past experience or expectation that might have been captured in an analysis conducted at that time, of even severe but implausible future events.  So that is a general comment on the approach to stress tests.  The financials that drove the stress test outcomes subsequent to my departure, it is not something I am up to speed on.</p></speech>

This was the result of behaviour.  Can you explain to us the behaviour that actually resulted in the 300% miscalculation?</p></speech>

The assumed outcomes from the levels of changes in property prices were driven through whatever financial modelling tool was used in that exercise.  I think what appears to explain to some extent the difference between what was seen in the stress tests that were conducted and the actual outcomes, is the severity of events and the pervasive nature of those events as they transpired over time.  While stress tests will have looked at percentage changes in values that are here, and while the actual fallen values was materially greater than this, that will have had its own set of impacts.  But I suggest also that the stress tests proved insufficient to capture the wider range of impacts, starting with the international crisis that happened at the same time, extending into the wider fiscal impacts of the downturn in activity in the economy.  Such that it is fair to say that the stress tests, however diligently done, however honestly they were appraising the potential for a downturn in the economy, it is fair to say that the actual outcomes proved to be dramatically more severe than those stress tests.</p></speech>

On the core documents, B2, pages 24 to 29, a letter from the Financial Regulator to UBIL, dated 12 March.  He was ... the Financial Regulator was concerned regarding the effectiveness of UBIL's credit review process as it related to commercial property lending.  Do our visitors think that UBIL had a sufficiently robust and effective credit approval and review process for its commercial property portfolio?</p></speech>

So every case was reviewed annually, and it was reviewed by relationship team writing a comprehensive paper, by that paper being supported or not by a separate document on risk, the combined papers going to Ulster Bank credit committee where challenge and update would have existed.  That continuing if the cases were in deal size of approximately in excess of &euro;35 million, it would have gone to an RBS committee which this letter reflects, again where challenge would have existed.  So there was a defined, communicated and comprehensive review process within Ulster Bank.</p></speech>

On page 6, you say that the treasury was transferred to Royal Bank of Scotland.  On page 7, accounting functions, accounts production, regulatory reporting and accounts payable were transferred.

The control ... the management of control processes, policies and so forth were required under the UK prudential rules to be driven from the centre.</p></speech>

I have many constituents, the nature of my constituency in the United Kingdom, and I think I'd have to say that compliance and the Royal Bank of Scotland don't actually go well in the same sentence.  Record finds for anti-competitive practices on 20/1/ 2011.  In fact, one of the executives was deprived of his knighthood by Her Majesty, so, I mean, it was not a compliant corporate culture.  I think I will just have to ... unless there are people from the United Kingdom looking into today, I know they have other things to do, but Royal Bank of Scotland did not have a compliant culture.  I'd have to put that proposition to you.</p></speech>

I believe, and my experience was, that the approach of RBS Group was one of very strong rigour in terms of compliance with the policies, procedures, prudential requirements and so forth.  I instanced, Deputy, the view taken by Ulster Bank Group and by RBS Group that the rules around sector exposures were seen as rules which we were not prepared to breach.  And that is symptomatic of the approach that I experienced in my engagement with, and management by, RBS Group that rules were there to be conformed with consistently and rigorously.</p></speech>

Yesterday when we had Cormac McCarthy and I asked why was there the need for 27 registered companies between Ulster Bank here in the Republic and, I think, eight more in ... that were registered in Belfast but were called things like Ulster Bank, Dublin Treasury and so on.  Why is it necessary to have 27 entities?  Because he, in his testimony, mentioned that there were three legal entities in the Ulster Bank Group and they each had a board of directors but yet, it seems within that, there were 27 registered companies.  Can you explain for the committee and people watching at home, why would that be necessary?</p></speech>

It was a bank in its own right and then ... in the United Kingdom.  And the two principal subsidiaries then were First Active and Ulster Bank Ireland Limited, each of them banks as well.  So the three principal legal entities were those three, which were licensed banks.  As will be quite normal in a complex corporate entity, there were a significant number of, what I'll call, minor subsidiaries, owned by any or all of the three aforementioned which will be in place for specific purposes.  So there, you know, you will have subsidiaries, for instance, related to property ... property ownership on behalf of the group, if there is a particular reason to do that or subsidiaries to accommodate various complex structures that may have been put in place.  They are all, and I think the important point to note, is that they are all wholly owned subsidiaries.  Each have their own boards in their own right, but they're single purpose companies, which are consolidated into the headline companies, the UBIL or First Active or UBL, for reporting purposes.  So the existence of those companies, while it is to facilitate individual activities or transactions within the group, all of those activities are captured in full at the consolidated company levels.</p></speech>

The consolidation of exposures was done at the banking levels.  The banks ... the three banks I have named, First Active, Ulster Bank Ireland Limited and Ulster Bank Limited, were the lending companies which did the lending.  All of the lending was done through those and recognised appropriately.</p></speech>

I believe that Mr. McCarthy clarified numbers in relation to loan-to-deposit ratio yesterday, that the true loan-to-deposit ratio was lower than that, but, leaving that aside, Deputy, I think the key to understanding the financing of the Ulster Bank balance sheet is the position that RBS Group adopted, where it would provide the funding and capital, the treasury needs of Ulster Bank as it went forward.  In treasury terms, loan-to-deposit ratio is a useful metric but has very great weaknesses, as has been seen in many instances, nationally and internationally.  The key ...the key issue in managing the balance sheet is stability of funding and for so long as RBS Group was ... gave the assurance and delivered upon that assurance, that it would meet the funding and capital needs of Ulster Bank Group, the stability of funding was assured and, indeed, you know, long after I left, when it was tested in the crisis, it's reassuring to see that RBS Group, indeed, did stand over those assurances.</p></speech>

There can be no doubt about that.  The reporting line ... I did, as you say, report to the CEO locally and to the finance director of the RBS Group, and that's very consistent with the pattern that you will typically see in a multinational organisation.  The conduct of the finance function, which was my brief, was driven very strongly through the RBS Group where we had to apply the standards, the controls, the processes, even the reporting timelines, that fit within the RBS Group requirements, so it is absolutely true to say there was a very strong degree of RBS Group control.</p><p>The advantage that you have, I suppose, in the licensed bank situation that Ulster Bank was ... within Ireland, is in addition to that control exercised by RBS Group, you had an independent board of Ulster Bank and Ulster Bank Ireland Limited here, which had duty of oversight to ensure that the bank complied with statutory reporting and governance and was fit for the local conditions, so it conveyed the advantage of the strength of the control environment of a multinational group together with the oversight of a local independent board to act as a check and balance on the behaviours ... within the Irish context.</p></speech>

In practice, what that meant was deposit-taking was the business, the normal banking business of Ulster Bank in Ireland, there was limited money markets activity in terms of local type activity, and any other treasury activity, and any surplus funding or funding shortage would be addressed by RBS Group treasury, so the control of that was exercised entirely ... as time went on, Deputy, and as the markets evolved, RBS elected to permit Ulster Bank to raise specific fundings ... on Ulster Bank's account and that's to do with relatively complex intra-group lending limits applied by the UK regulator.  So you will see specific instances through the documents where Ulster Bank did go into the markets under the direction and guidance of RBS Group treasury.  The method by which that direction and guidance was applied was that the assets liabilities committee in Ulster Bank had the attendance as a member by personnel from RBS Group treasury and such decisions to go into the market, even on specific transactions, such as the issuance of a floating rate note, such decisions had to be signed off or approved at the RBS Group assets and liabilities committee before they could proceed.</p></speech>

The entry in to the euro changed the availability of liquidity to financial institutions generally ... in this country.  We were now part of the euro, and it meant that our home currency was now a currency which was one of the larger currencies globally.  Liquidity in that currency was greatly enhanced and all financial institutions operating in the Irish market found themselves with the far greater facility in terms of accessing funding on the global markets through the years that followed.</p></speech>

I think the availability of liquidity, the relatively easy availability of liquidity, did undoubtedly influence the banking system and while any individual bank, and particularly a challenger bank, can seek to grow its market share, there is a reasonable question to be asked as to what is the impact if all banks have that access to liquidity and it drives up the scale of borrowing by all banks across the system.</p></speech>

Underwriting standards were independent.  I can't honestly comment on whether it was a driver of any changes across banks, across the system as a whole.</p></speech>

Given your own international experience, Mr. Gallagher, of banking, what is your view of Ulster Bank's growth strategy as compared with strategies that would have been seen or been involved with elsewhere during your international career?  Ultimately Ulster Bank was going to compete with two big huge, with two big players in the Irish market, your ambition was to get on to a level kind of pegging position with them.  And was it overly ambitious, in view of the size of the market and the dominance of the two banks ... was that a very ambitious and ultimately flawed approach or not by Ulster Bank to get into that space?</p></speech>

And if you think about the challenge for a challenger bank, versus the incumbent two banks, is that the challenger bank tends to have less deposit base than the two incumbent banks and the attraction of winning lots of small depositors is you have a stickiness about your deposit base, which helps your loan-to-deposit ratio.  So there was an active strategy both in the retail bank and the commercial business bank to win the completeness of a customer proposition and that is, deposits, clearing accounts and lending and that was the strategy as evidenced by the branch openings around the country.  So our growth strategy was about winning more customers in the completeness of our relationship with those customers, not about winning more and more property-lending business.</p></speech>

One of the challenges for all banks in this economy, which continues, Chairman, is that a lot of the industries which one would like to deploy capital to, don't require bank capital.  So, for example, Chairman, foreign direct investment companies broadly speaking don't require bank capital from the domestic banks, broadly speaking indigenous software companies or technology companies don't require capital and broadly speaking, heavy industry in the OECD world has migrated to the developing economies.  So if you think in Ireland, in Britain, in any other OECD economy, the asset activity that consumes loan capital tends to be skewed to property.  It's a challenge for the banking industry, Chairman.</p></speech>

Property is very subjective and notional and far more taken to sentiment and other factors, as would be a plastic bucket.  Therefore it comes with entirely different type of risks.  And, so if you are funding a plastic bucket factory, you are asking them how much is the manufacturing base, how much does it cost to get it retailed and on to the shelf of the shop and what's it doing competing with and is at a reasonable price. Property doesn't operate in that way, property has a capacity, as you would know better than I would, to absorb capital and the more it absorbs, the more it would further absorb because it's a notional cost.  So, because you weren't in the type of other areas that you were talking about, were you not aware that your growth was in one specific area, that area was property, and that that came with a type of risk that was very specific and contained within that sector?</p></speech>

Mr. Torpey, in September 2007, 45% of Ulster Bank's group funding was provided by wholesale markets.  By September 2008, 60% of its funding was maturing within one year.  I appreciate you may not have been at the bank at that ... in 2008, but you certainly are a banker so I'd be grateful for your view as to whether that kind of funding strategy was appropriate, and how would you evaluate the level of risk attached to that strategy, if there is a risk?</p></speech>

In that context, the key consideration for me will have been the stability of the funding, the level of assurance that I had that funding would be replaced upon maturity.  The objective in running Ulster Bank was to grow the business in Ireland, including the retail deposit base, to the extent that we could, certainly to put us into a proper, full scale, competitive position against the major banks, and the residual funding requirement, which was always going to be quite substantial for a challenger bank in a growth phase ... the critical thing was to ensure that that was stable funding, and the combination of term debt that was approved by RBS, and the provision of funding and the assurance of the continuing provision of such funding by RBS Group, were sufficient to give that assurance of stable funding.  The ... it's ... as you point out, as events progressed through 2008 and the international liquidity crisis and the developing domestic situation happened, the shape of that funding moved towards shorter term maturities, but even though I wasn't there, I think it's reassuring to see that the RBS Group, ultimately, stood by those assurances upon which I had relied while I was there.</p></speech>

The reality is that 100% mortgages, of themselves, did not fundamentally alter the amount of mortgage finance that was put in the marketplace.  You know, the amount, over a number of years, of 100% loan-to-value mortgages that were issued was in low single digit percentages-----</p></speech>

I would prefer we had not released that mortgage because it was one of those factors which arguably did contribute to the ... the heated state of the market.</p></speech>

However, Mr. Boucher, from Bank of Ireland, told us yesterday that, you know, he'd met with the Financial Regulator at the beginning of September to discuss INBS, and that it was very serious, and that, from memory, he'd been asked for a quantum of about &euro;4 billion.  This is on page ... I'm sorry, anyway ... page 17 of his testimony.  "A quantum of about &euro;4 billion, and we fed back to the regulator that we weren't comfortable, that that wasn't an accurate picture of what was needed".  So it was clear that in the market, people understood that INBS was in a perilous state, perhaps insolvent at that time, that Anglo was in a perilous state also, and yet, at Ulster Bank the impression we're ... we've been given is that it was all calm and quiet, there was nothing happening, apart from your boss ringing up the Financial Regulator to say everything's okay.  I'm very puzzled that there was this sense of calm at Ulster Bank, or am I wrong?</p></speech>

I want then, if I may ... I asked Mr. McCarthy yesterday about the fact that some of his statement looked like some of yours and he explained that he'd been briefed, and you acknowledged this morning that you were briefed also, by Ulster Bank, and given that you both left the bank ... all of you left the bank.  I have to say though I am very puzzled by the response that you've made in relation to the Financial Regulator, that ... we have letters from 2004, 2003, 2006, 2008, all raising very serious queries about what was going on in the bank, and yet, yesterday, Mr. McCarthy talked about the methodology that the regulator chose to use to come and review what was going on, and again, Mr. Torpey, this morning you talked about the nature of engagement, they weren't on the ground, they wrote their observations, it ... they weren't fully appraised of the condition or the position, they were bulky and complex affairs, files to trace through.  I'm very puzzled, I have to confess, that your testimony about these very serious issues is so very similar to Mr. McCarthy's, that you're both concerned about the process of the Financial Regulator.  I would argue that you've effectively thrown the Financial Regulator under the proverbial bus, that it was his methodology, or his office's methodology that you're questioning, rather than telling us exactly what was going on at the ... in your own bank.</p></speech>

I will observe, though, that the regulator had a certain approach to things, which was a very formal approach, and the regulator, in the way the regulator operated at that time, had a system whereby he made his observations, communicated in writing and, therefore, raised issues which might have been more rapidly and more easily defused had there been a different model of engagement directly with the business-----</p></speech>

There were, I believe, weaknesses in the way he operated.  I've expressed my view and it's only a view that it had might have been more effective if there had been more direct engagement rather than waiting for the formal communication of outcomes and I believe a lot of these issues would have been resolved more quickly.  That's my belief and I also believe that the change in regulatory approach in recent years has reflected the fact that there were weaknesses in the particular regulatory approach which I am glad to say have been very thoroughly addressed by regulators in the years since.</p></speech>

Quite frankly, it's odd that your answers are both so similar to what has to be serious issues that were raised by the Financial Regulator which actually you haven't properly addressed.  You've both talked about letters and you've both talked about files, but I still am at a loss to know was the Financial Regulator right at all with anything that he said ... I mean his office ..  and how seriously did you take it because you've not explained at all to us that you took it seriously?</p></speech>

What we're looking for here is that there is the regulator's behaviour with regard to what he or she considered to be problems with regard to an operation inside in Ulster Bank and there is a series of them. You'd have seen the witness books and rather than pulling them up and all the rest yesterday afternoon, but I think what the point the Senator wants to get to, we'll deal with the regulator in further engagements in this inquiry.  What we would like to know is why was the regulator finding all these difficulties.  We'll ... there's the content matter and there's the process which the content is actually dealt with.   That's content ... there was content here, quite significant content.  Deputy Higgins referred to nixers this morning and other matters.  What is your ... forget about ... we'll deal with the regulator in time, Mr. Torpey, but what is Ulster Bank's assessment that these things would have come on to the regulator's radar?</p></speech>

I would, frankly, welcome the fact that we had a regulator overseeing what we were doing so as to bring these weaknesses to light, particularly in instances where we mightn't have identified those before then.  To your point, I think the manner of engagement could have, in my view, have been different and maybe improved, but once these issues were highlighted, I can absolutely assure the inquiry that Ulster Bank will have taken them with the utmost seriousness.  Any and every issue identified by the regulator to Ulster Bank will have been the subject of very close examination and scrutiny to ensure that we either ... that we in the first instance established the nature of the issue, established the facts to see whether the necessarily brief look the regulator had, had captured the picture in its entirety and, thereafter, to make sure that we addressed the issue, corrected the issue as such that the issue was not to recur.  You know, we will have responded to the regulator's inquiries and the regulator to the extent that the responses were satisfactory, we'll have left the matter rest as you would expect.  And if there were issues that were not satisfactorily addressed, the regulator will have come back on those issues and I am not aware of continuing issues from the regulatory point of view that were not addressed by Ulster Bank.</p></speech>

It would be rare and very difficult to simply dismiss people for incompetence.  It would be entirely normal to bring them to a skill level which would equip them with the skills necessary to discharge their function.</p></speech>

So it was ranging between 3% and 2% and yet of the &euro;46 billion that were placed into Ulster via RBS, via the UK taxpayer, Ulster Bank took about a third of it.  How would you describe the handling of Ulster Bank since you joined from First Active to your leaving Ulster Bank?  And it's for Mr. Torpey, please.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding that, Senator, the scale of support required by Ulster Bank from RBS was extremely large and there is no denying that.  That requirement came as a result of a strategy which was implemented in good faith but proved with the benefit of hindsight to be founded on poor assumption, and, very specifically, the universal or near universal assumption of the continued growth prospects for the Irish market and all of the opportunity that that would offer, that assumption, which was a critical underpinning of the RBS approved strategy for Ulster Bank, proved to be an ill-founded assumption.  And the direct outcome of that was the level of provisions that had to be taken by Ulster Bank in relation to loans and while I wasn't there to see what the ... how that played out, I understand from the testimony ... part of the testimony I did hear yesterday, that related to provisioning levels, some of which may or not be clawed back in the future.</p></speech>

In response to developments within Ireland and internationally, in general terms, the authorities, the EBA in particular, have introduced guidelines in relation to remuneration, to ensure that remuneration structures are appropriate to the nature of the business and I believe that the EBA response is an appropriate response and will lead to pay levels being driven by competitive factors but being appropriate to the nature of the industry.</p></speech>

I think an earlier testimony, I think it was by Professor Lane, an American academic and significant commenter upon the financial sector ... I think one of the things that Mr. Lane said in his testimony at that time was that the penalties that picked up by the financial services banking sectors, post-crisis, is in around the figure of &pound;150 ... 150 billion euro ... sterling.  That's by the banks, globally now that figure is.  Quite a significant sum, &euro;150 billion, but that a behaviour in financial institutions will continue to carry the risk into the future if the financial penalty is borne by the bank, as opposed to actually borne by the individual executives.  Do you have a view on that?</p></speech>

And I think, as has been addressed earlier and is acknowledged, the assumptions on which we built the business were wrong.  There is a difference between that and a jump to an assumption that people acted with lack of integrity, or lack of good faith, or did their best.  In my opinion, and I speak for myself and I can't speak for others, but I did my best, I acted with integrity and I executed to the best of my ability.</p></speech>

I believe that, you know, banks did pay very significant penalties, as you have mentioned, and, indeed, executives did pay material penalties as well.  However, there are lessons that have been learnt from the crisis internationally and there has been a very major effort to ensure that interests are aligned, going forward.  And I would subscribe to that; I think it's very important that they are.  Shareholders in many banks had their shareholding values wiped out, they took a fair share of losses, there's no doubt about that.  Banks themselves suffered further penalties and executives in many cases suffered as well.  However, the measures that have been taken on the international stage to ensure the alignment of interest, to make sure that both short-term and long-term value is maintained, such that banks continue to act in a way ... or improve their actions in a way that will support the medium and long-term development of economies are very important.</p></speech>

You're very welcome, Mr. Torpey and Mr. Gallagher.  Mr. Gallagher, can I start with you and just tease out the impact of the bank guarantee on Ulster Bank and on your deposit base in the immediate aftermath of the guarantee?  You made reference earlier on to the &euro;4 billion.  Can you just clarify is that the quantum of deposits which flowed out of the bank in the immediate aftermath of the guarantee?</p></speech>

And the requirements, as I say, they are in the process of changing these rules because of the deficiencies that have been identified, but the rules as they applied were very clear, that only on an incurred loss basis could you make provisions, and that is a weakness.

T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte roimh, an tUasal Torpey agus Gallagher.  Mr. Torpey, if I can ask you just in relation to Ulster Bank, UBIL, relied heavily on intergroup funding from RBS Group to fund the growth in its loan book.  Did this ability to borrow from its parent company lead you to expand the loan book at a faster rate than you would have or could have if you had to rely solely on third party funding?</p></speech>

The reality of the marketplace through the years that we are discussing was that liquidity was ... pretty much freely available to all of the banks operating in the Irish marketplace because of the willingness of ... of international debt markets to ... to finance the Irish banks.  So the access ... the assurance of access to funding from RBS did not single out Ulster Bank from the other banks in the marketplace.  What it did do was create certainty of funding or stability of funding so it, to the extent that any financial institution would finance itself, particularly in short-term debt on the international markets, there is a risk that ... that might be repaid.  The advantage in relation ... that Ulster Bank had was the RBS assurance meant that that risk wasn't there on the balance sheet.</p></speech>

The full minutes aren't available in hard copy version of the booklets of the core documents but they have been provided in electronic form.  The electronic reference for the screen is UBI 00329-006.  The final paragraph and I will quote it anyway on the page states "The Board noted that the Group's percentage growth in contribution was in excess of its main competitors in the Republic of Ireland, notwithstanding the high level of business investment in support of the Group's ambition to be the Number One Bank in Ireland".  Can I ask you Mr. Gallagher, is that an accurate reflection of Ulster Bank to be the number one bank in Ireland?</p></speech>

It was to ... in-fill its physical presence where it didn't exist, to open networks that allowed it to win more customers and as part of, what was then the fifth biggest bank in the world, it was a legitimate aspiration to compete meaningfully with the top two banks.</p></speech>

So it was a strategy to create a universal bank across the banking needs of an economy ... supported by material investment by its shareholder ... material investment ... I would say reasonably unprecedented in the history of this State in terms of the number of branches and business centres opened across the country.  So the actions and the investment and the commitment were about actually building a permanent architecture, as opposed to a property business.</p></speech>

It said: ''Few, if any, financial institutions wanted to be left out of what was seen as a profitable business due to the larger lender margins and the relatively low operating costs''.  He went on to say "in the Irish market up to 2007, there was far too much bank funding available and, ultimately, it found its way not only to a finite number of development projects which were viable, but also to many other projects which could be viable only on very heroic and often mistaken assumptions''.  Did or did not Ulster Bank fund projects that in the words of Frank Daly could only be viable ... could be viable only on very heroic and often mistaken assumptions?</p></speech>

There were very real challenges internally in the bank, which had to be addressed.  The 100% mortgage question had to be addressed objectively in the context of what it brought, of what the risks were and so forth.  And it went through a very, very thorough governance process and the decision, to which I was a party, was that it was an appropriate product to bring in at the time, which, with the benefit of hindsight was not a good decision.</p></speech>

Were you aware that Michael Dowling, which was the president of the Independent Mortgage Advisers Federation said ''We were a little surprised that the product came on the market at a time when the Central Bank [had] been warning banks about the amount they are lending'' and there was others as well who wrote articles in relation to that time.  But you were ... were you aware that that body were critical of your product at that time?</p></speech>

But I have no doubt that there were people, for their own reasons who will have criticised the product.  But I would stress, Deputy that we ... did put the product through a very ... a very severe ... testing in terms of ... of our analysis.  We did engage with the Central Bank in relation to the introduction of the product and as such, we would have addressed, honourably and in an appropriate way, the ... the circumstance leading to the introduction of that product.</p><p>And I think it is worth recalling that the actual volume of the product which was issued on the market was a small, low single-digit percentage of the total mortgage lending that we did over those years.</p></speech>

So, it's more in terms of your perspective on the state of the banking system, the liquidity in the market, solvency in the market and did ... the actual ... the type of guarantee that was put in place.  So I'm running from that perspective.  But it is correct that you .. and I suppose I'm asking you in the context ... you weren't there on the night of the guarantee but you certainly were there up to a relatively short time prior to that, Mr. Torpey.  So it's in your role in Ulster Bank I'm asking you-----.</p></speech>

And, indeed, I was in Ulster Bank until the end of 2007 and there were the beginnings of the emergence of liquidity stresses in the marketplace at the end of 2007 but nothing at that point that would point towards a severe liquidity crisis in the marketplace.  Given my absence from the financial sector, and indeed from the country for much of 2008, I don't have a fact pattern as to how things emerged through 2008, so very much in the opinion space I would have to say that to the extent that the liquidity position of the banking system, in aggregate, deteriorated to a level where there was a crisis imminent, I can understand why the authorities would have had to look towards taking very severe action.  I'm not competent to opine on the appropriateness of the action taken because I simply don't have the information about the detailed events that led to that action and the action has to be a consequence of the circumstances.</p></speech>

The appetite of capital markets late in 2007 for such transactions had diminished to a point that the economics of doing such a transaction were not attractive and the view taken in Ulster Bank when I was still there was that the transaction contemplated would be deferred into 2008 rather than do it at the price obtaining at the time.  And, Deputy, I think that informs a lot because it describes an expectation internationally, if I use RBS Group as the international benchmark, that we were in a temporary liquidity crisis, not in what was going to lead to a sustained-----</p></speech>

The issue you spoke about ... the accounting standards, if you had wished, could you have put a note to the financial statements as distinct from ... could you ... a provisioning, could you have put a note to the financial statements that you needed to provide a potential contingent liability in terms of reduction in the, we'll say, in terms of provisioning for the loans?</p></speech>

The form of production of statutory accounts for the bank or, indeed, for any company I guess, at the time was highly prescriptive.

I joined Ulster Bank as part of an acquisition of First Active and I came from a background that was heavily rooted in treasury and capital markets.  I presided over an integration of financial systems such that the role ... and putting it as briefly as I can, the role became very much a specialist accounting role.

With regard to planning first of all, lending to unzoned land was capped by the speculative lending policy of Ulster Bank and speculative lending could not exceed 3% of the commercial loan book.  The effect of that is that Ulster Bank had a very, very modest unzoned planning exposure.  The bank did lend to zoned land, to planned land, and to land in process.</p></speech>

I'll come on to residential development property.  The assessment of investment property, two points: one, the bank had an entirely constrained ability to finance the development of office or investment space which had no tenant.  So we ... that was captured by the speculative lending policy, the same 3%.  So we ... the firm ... the bank was entirely constrained in that and did very little in any of it.  To the extent that the bank funded investment property, the bank would look at things like the quality of the tenants, the mix of tenants, the location of the asset, the level of cash coverage generated by the rental income, the term of the lease, and would lend based on that and an assessment of the owner and an assessment of the valuation.  And those assets on the investment portfolios tended to be large assets and tended to be in large conurbations, including London and Dublin.  And those assets had a repayment capacity through the cash generation from the rental income.  On development lending, Deputy, the location was critical; the nature of the number of homes that could be put on the asset; the assumption of a sales price; the cost to construct; a sensitivity that said, "Well, what happens if price drops?"; an assessment of how long the build is to take; a look at the track record of the developer - what has they ... what have they done in other sites?  Have they finished on time?  Have they had cost overruns?  Have they sold?  Who does selling for them? - a comprehensive assessment captured on paper over a detailed analysis; a second paper from the credit function of the organisation independent of the guy or individual sponsoring the proposition, either supporting or not; that going to a committee in Ulster, where it's challenged by a group of at least three people, one of whom has to be independent of the business ... or two have to be; then if it exceeds approximately &euro;35 million, it goes to RBS for the same challenge and approval.  So there is a first line, a second line, and a third line of defence.  So the process was robust.</p></speech>

Yesterday, following questions from Deputy McGrath on the matter of loan-to-deposit ratios, Mr. McCarthy indicated that there was an error in the 2007 figures, which was subsequently corrected.  I just want to ask you, Mr. Torpey, what was the error?  How did it occur?  How did the figures end up being published as the final figures for Ulster Bank for 2007?  You were, at that stage, still, as I understand it, the chief financial director, I think, was the title of your role within the organisation?</p></speech>

So I had no hand, act, or part in the putting together of the accounts, so I simply don't know what led to that number coming out.  I think, to the substance of the point, I think the funding of the balance sheet through 2007 was driven by the stability of funding assured by RBS, and so I think the substantive point is that the balance sheet was managed appropriately and stably through 2007.

That happened in the context of a dramatically changing environment in the Irish marketplace.  It happened in an environment where the cost of debt service, for example, was falling very substantially.

We sought to offer that in as competitive a way as we could so as to maximise the affordability.  And, we responded to the market forces in ... in that respect.  I think you have instanced the 100% mortgages, for instance, and in certain respects that would have been a help to people because our research at the time showed us that a significant number of people were actually borrowing the balance over the 90% or 92% through a credit card or other borrowings.  So our ... our efforts will have assisted affordability in that very tiny segment of the market to which we provided that ... that product.  So, I think ... I think, Deputy, it is fair to say that we were in a very competitive marketplace.  We competed in that marketplace.  We sought to offer the best value product to people who needed to borrow money to buy a house ... houses at the prices they were there at the time.</p></speech>

And the effect of that is that home ownership becomes more expensive.  And the effect of that is that ... that leverage can be created in society.  So in an environment which has a sustainable level of home price increase, which facilitates sufficient homes being built as opposed to no homes being built, is probably where we need to get to and it is probably where we should have been.  So the effect of high price ... asset price is problematic for all of society.  Young people, included, yes.</p></speech>

But just boiling it down to a business model, did at any time, at any level in Ulster Bank, was it considered that a product ... that the mortgage product that you were now issuing was becoming unsustainable given 100% mortgages, given LTV rates of 100%-  you didn't have to come up to ten ... with the traditional 10% - income ratios with regard to the price of the house were moved off the map several multiples of ... schedules moving from 20 years out to 40 years and just the affordability factor?  I mean ... like the basic business concept of selling cars, is if you want to sell new cars somebody has to buy second hand cars ... and it was becoming increasingly impossible for first-time buyers to come into the market because of affordability.  Did anybody ... at anybody ... at any stage in Ulster Bank say this is ... this product is becoming possibly unsustainable?</p></speech>

Mr. McLaughlin, Mr. Beggs and Mr. McArdle, you're very welcome before the committee this afternoon.</p><p>Before I commence proceedings, I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  So, therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.  And members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.</p><p>The witnesses have been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis, and you have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee, will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.

By way of preface to my opening remarks, might I say that I prepared my witness statement about a month ago.  I got the notice relatively late in the day and I was away when it came, so it was late when I got it.  Therefore, I hadn't the opportunity to do a full perusal, as I said in the cover letter.  So my opening statement will, in some senses, add to that and reflect the benefits of reflection and research over the past month.  It, therefore, is a bit different and if this causes confusion to some of the members of the committee, I apologise for that.  But I have here with me hard copies of it, if necessary, if you wish to accept them.  Do you wish me to give them to you?</p></speech>

My team's emphasis was on short-term forecasting and we produced and published quarterly forecasts for GDP, inflation, employment, etc.  These high-frequency short-term forecasts are designed to paint a picture over a two-year time horizon or occasionally less.  Longer-term projections in Ireland are published by the ESRI, which produces forecasts for up to a quarter of a century ahead every two or three years.  And, you've already discussed these with Dr. FitzGerald.  For the economic input into the five-year planning circle ... cycle, Ulster Bank used the ESRI medium-term forecasts.  As all ESRI forecasts, benchmark, high and low variants, envisaged a soft landing - and I refer you to my table in my supplementary witness statement - it follows that all UB medium-term planning was also predicated on a soft landing.  I effectively buttressed this view in terms of my rolling quarterly short-term economic updates and <i>ad-hoc</i>reviews.  My forecasts, and those of all other short-term forecasters, remained positive up until early 2008.  The turnaround was then dramatic.  At that time, the central expectation was that 2009 GDP would grow by 3.6%.  Eighteen months later, the consensus was that it would fall by about 8.3%.  This about-turn came too late to influence events, as the credit that fuelled the boom had been extended between 2004 and 2007.  I was generally regarded as being towards the more pessimistic end of the range of short-term forecasters ...certainly over that period.<br/><br/>I should add that any views in the UB publications were mine alone and there was no difference between the internal and external positions I adopted.  I was given freedom of speech by Ulster Bank, even if some of the things I said made them uncomfortable on occasion.  I was a trenchant critic of the loose fiscal policy adopted and I was an outspoken advocate of a soft landing.  In general, I did not input directly into the credit, the risk or the lending functions in Ulster Bank.  Instead, my job was to produce regular economic briefings and they used them as they saw fit.  However, there was the occasional exception and I recently came across a case where UB credit drafted a report based on my output and, somewhat unusually, I received a copy of it.  It summarises my views in early 2004 and if you don't mind, Chairman, I'll quote from it:<blockquote>UB Economic Research unit (Pat McArdle) views on the ROI Housing Sector remain positive in the updated report dated 25 February 2004.  Its rating however is amber, taking due recognition of the cycle. ... Neither of the usual major negative influences on the housing market (rapid rises and interest rates and unemployment) is forecast. ...<br /><br />Major changes are due on the supply side - last year['s] completions were in excess of 68 [thousand] but underlying demand is believed to be [around] 50 [thousand].  The difference is accounted for by pent up demand and holiday homes.  There are signs that the building industry is aware of this and has the capacity to orchestrate a smooth transition but this is not certain.  Pat McArdle does not rule out the possibility of a price correction of up to 20%.  Even if this were to happen we do not think that this would have major knock-on effects, given bank capital requirements and stress testing.</blockquote></p><p>A 20% fall in nominal prices would've equated to a much greater fall in real prices, about 35%, that's when you're after making allowance for inflation.  In effect, therefore, I warned, in February 2004, that real house prices could decline by 35% ... that's within the 30% to 50% range predicted by the two main contrarians some three years later.  My main regret, Chairman, is that I did not continue in this vein.  I should have stepped up my warnings as the housing market initially slowed and then regained momentum and even stronger growth.  However, if anything, my later pronouncements are more consensual in that I did not disagree with the projected 15% to 20% fall in real prices advocated by the Central Bank and the ESRI.  Of course, had I continued in the vein I just outlined, I would've been treated as a contrarian.  Few agreed with them, and while it's cold comfort, it's unlikely that I would've been listened to either.  Indeed, it's ironic that even though I disagreed with the contrarians later, we had stress tested in Ulster Bank for their more extreme predictions.  The problem was not house prices<i>per se</i>, but developer and real estate lending and we did not spot it or stress test for it, certainly sufficiently.<br/><br/>I want to make the following points.  A soft landing and it's perhaps no harm to dwell on it for a minute since this has received such currency and it may not be as understood in the sense that I understand it.  So a soft landing would've been quite bumpy, involving substantial job losses and up to &euro;3 billion, I had estimated, in tax revenue foregone.  In other words, it would've left a major hole in the budget.  The regulators, management and board bear most responsibility for the collapse here as elsewhere, and I'll come back to that.  Ulster Bank rejected the hard landing hypothesis, but stress tested for house price declines of 56% in real terms.  That was at the very upper end of the range predicted by the contrarians.  This was insufficient because the actual recession was much greater than anyone predicted.<br/><br/>I go on now, Chairman, to talk about the implications of a soft landing for a moment.  It could've been, as I said, quite bumpy.  A soft landing that saw house completions fall from their peak around 90,000 to the 50,000 sustainable medium-term level estimated by the ESRI would've had significant implications.  I'd calculated that every 10,000 houses represented one percentage point off growth and that a soft landing would involve 30,000 construction job losses and up to &euro;3 billion in tax revenue foregone.<br/><br/>I go on to speak about the regulator.  There were no strong incentives for banks to make arbitrary judgements about the prudent limits of credit expansion.  Hence, the infamous comment by Chuck Prince, chairman of Citigroup: &quot;When the music stops ... things will be complicated, but as long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance.&quot;  The regulator's job is to stop the music, or as it's more often put, &quot;To take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going&quot;.  All regulators failed to do this.  This was a major failing and much of the focus post-crisis has centred on improving bank supervision.  Indeed, responsibility for bank supervision of euro area banks has been removed entirely from national supervisors.<br/><br/>When I worked in the banking area of the Department of Finance in the '70s and '80s, I had the distinct impression that when the regulator said, &quot;Jump&quot;, the bank's response was, &quot;How high?&quot;  I was therefore shocked to read in the Honohan report that the regulator spent almost a decade in fruitless correspondence with one financial institution without ever achieving anything.  Clearly, the boot had shifted to the other foot and the regulated, instead of the regulator, were now calling the shots.  However, it seems, and I've only learned this recently, it seems that this only applied to prudential regulation, as bank representatives have testified to this inquiry last week that the regime on the consumer side remained quite strict, which would've been my memory of it from 20 years earlier.  Therefore, I disagree with the conclusion in the Honohan report that the major responsibility lay with the directors and senior managements of the banks that got into trouble.  In my view, the regulator had a higher degree of responsibility.  And this should go without saying, really, because the regulator's job is to promote the safety and soundness of the banking system.<br/><br/>If the banks were capable of regulating themselves, there would, of course, be no need for rules and regulations and regulators.  In saying this, I just want to emphasise that I am by no means trying to absolve the banks from blame.  As is clear from the Nyberg and other reports, that there were many actors involved and that the banks were up there at the top.  However, the regulator was the only one who had full information on large exposures and, critically, the only institution that could have sought to curb excessive balance sheet growth.  It was only when the loans were transferred to NAMA in 2010 that it was revealed that the big developers had multiple exposures to the different banks.  The regulator should have had full details from the large exposures reports that it received - I think they were quarterly - and it would've been a simple matter to add them up.  Finally, in this section, in 2009, Patrick Honohan, then Professor of Economics at TCD, wrote, and this has been quoted here yesterday:  <blockquote>A very simple warning sign used by most regulators to identify a bank exposed to increased risk is rapid balance sheet growth.  An annual growth rate of 20 per cent real is often taken as the trigger... Anglo Irish Bank, crossed it in eight of nine years, and indeed its average annual rate of growth 1998-2007 was 36 per cent... So this was a very obvious and public danger sign.</blockquote>On this basis the alarm bells should've been ringing for the best part of a decade.<br/><br/>Stress testing.  Ulster Bank stress tested for a 36% fall in nominal house prices in its severe stress scenario.  That was equivalent to a real fall ... a fall in real prices, sorry, of 56%, i.e. it was at the very upper end of the range predicted by the contrarians.  Indeed, it was slightly above the upper end, I think.  However, the real problem was commercial and not mortgage lending, and this was not adequately stress tested.  In 2007, at the behest of the Bank of England FSA, global adverse scenarios for the UK, US and euro area were produced by RBS Group economics and we commissioned the ESRI to help translate them into three Irish shock scenarios: a mild, once in a decade, a medium, once in a quarter century, and a severe, once in century recession.  I supplied the ESRI with the external ... these external global assumptions for the three shock scenarios in April 2007.  These scenarios are based on global economic shocks, which severely affected growth, employment, credit, etc., and we left it up to the ESRI and their model to determine the impact of this on the Irish economy and on Irish house prices.<br/><br/>The severe scenario envisages a downturn of a magnitude not seen in the post-war period, greater than the 2009 UK recession and greater than any ... anyone else ... there was no other one that was known at that time.  It entailed GDP everywhere going negative for a few years, unemployment rising to low double digits, short-term interest rates falling to be 1% or below, and Irish credit contracting by 5% per annum for a few years.  This results are given in the accompanying table.  In general, the outcome was worse than predicted ... that's the outcome in the event was worse than the scenarios we utilised I just should say for clarification ... and this was mainly because the impact of the construction rate of decline ... related decline, was vastly greater than expected, with new house completions virtually coming to a halt, whereas the model had predicted a fall of 20,000 units only.  The predicted nominal house price fall, however, was 36% and, of course, the actual, as we now know, was 50%.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Chairman, the financial crisis has been described as an example of groupthink.  In my experience, and I've now been through it, groupthink is almost impossible to understand unless you've experienced it.  I suggest that a useful way to approach it is, perhaps, to look at two more recent examples.  First, the Central Bank's proposed macro-prudential limits on mortgage lending were eminently sensible and less severe than the regime that applied when I took out my first mortgage, yet they were almost universally opposed, even by the Department of Finance, and were watered down in the event.  Second, the expansionary 2015 budget was condemned by IFAC, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, a body expressly established to advise on policy and also by most economists, yet the Government persisted with widespread support from beneficiaries and politicians.  So in my opinion, groupthink may well be alive and well.<br/><br/>The Bank for International Settlements was the only major institution I know of to warn of the crisis and I want to end with a quote from it.  In a presentation in 2013, Bill White, who was the former chief economist there, reflected on why his warnings were ignored, and this is also relevant to groupthink.  He said, and I quote: <blockquote>There were a few who did warn that there were serious problems building up under the smooth surface of the Great Moderation.  I would like to believe that we at the BIS saw it more clearly than many others, though certainly the timing and the precise nature of its unfolding eluded us ... Why were these warnings (both public and private) not heeded?  Why were the historical antecedents not given more emphasis?  I am going to suggest in the immortal line of Flanders and Swan, that it was &quot;A Tale of Seduction&quot;.  All of the parties who contributed to the crisis (borrowers, lenders, regulators, central banks, academics and politicians) were each seduced by [the] various influences into believing different things that were not true.  Moreover, since seduction normally involves more than one party, the relationships between these various parties also contributed to their having 'no eye to see and no ear to hear'.</blockquote>Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

Good afternoon, everyone.  Thank you for inviting me along to speak to you.  As requested, I've furnished a statement addressing certain designated lines of inquiry to the banking crisis.  I've also included some general points which I feel are relevant and rather than read out the full statement, I just want to summarise a few remarks.</p> <p>  Just by way of background, I was employed by Bank of Ireland in the role of chief economist from February 2001 to August 2013.  I think Mr. Chairman, you ... in your opening remark, you said 1999.  Just to clarify, it was 2001.</p><p>During that time my office was in the dealing room of global markets, which was responsible for executing the bank's funding strategy and in providing a service on foreign exchange and interest rates to the customer base.  I was in charge of the bank's economic research unit, which produced analysis and commentary on the Irish and UK economies and in developments in the financial markets.  The unit also provided support to other areas of the Bank of Ireland Group, including a written monthly summary of economic and financial developments to the chief executive.  As chief economist, I also participated in meetings with rating agencies, counterparty banks, and on occasion, debt and equity investors, as well as presentations to customers on economic outlook.  I reported to the head of global markets.</p><p> I now want to turn to a couple of general observations on the banking crisis.  The first relates to the banking system that operated in Ireland prior to the crash and to highlight that although there were common features, the range of the subsequent losses illustrates that the banks differed greatly in terms of credit standards, risk appetite, geographical spread and exposure and degree of loan concentration.  Second, banks are mainly staffed by specialists, and in light of the fact that the bank is a publicly-traded company, other than information published in the market, everything is done on a need-to-know basis, which is particularly true in terms of crisis.  A third point relates to the narrative that has developed around the banking crisis, which, given the benefit of hindsight, risks overstating what was known at any point in time.  Our knowledge of the outcome makes it difficult to judge past events.  We should also be clear as to what published data was available and when, an issue I address in more detail in my furnished statement.</p><p> In my view, there were three separate factors contributing to the crisis, each overlapping in exacerbating the other.  The first was the property market: Ireland experienced a residential property boom which lasted well over ten years, and in my view, until around 2005, was mainly driven by fundamental factors, including strong growth in employment, rising household incomes, a move to a lower interest rate regime following euro membership and an extraordinary increase in population of, it was a 17% rise in the decade to 2006 of 615,000.  It was only in the latter stages of the boom which saw an easing of credit standards and the Central Bank quarterly survey data of credit standards shows this, particularly from 2005.  Affordability also started to deteriorate and my own affordability model pointed to a marked increase in the cost of servicing a new mortgage in 2007.  Particularly following the monetary tightening initiated by the ECB, we saw the repo rate rise from 2% to a high of 4.25%, which wasn't reached 'till July 2008.  I initially felt, in 2007, that the slowdown in the housing market would involve flat or falling real prices and not a fall in nominal prices, as the latter had only happened once in Ireland over the previous 30 years.  The Irish economy is very open and hence heavily influenced by the international economic cycle, although from 1970 onwards, the Irish economy had contracted in GDP terms in only one year, which was 1982.  The consensus view in mid-2008, which I shared, was that any US recession would be as short-lived as had been the case in the previous two, which had been 1990-91 and 2001.  Both had lasted only eight months.  This didn't prove to be the case, of course, and I believed that the unprecedented collapse of the global credit markets which followed the Lehman bankruptcy in September 2008, was a second and decisive negative which hit the Irish economy and the banking sector.  The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, called it a "one in 100-year event". We will never know how steep the Irish property correction would have been in the absence of that collapse and I find it at variance with the facts that some people appear to play down its significance in relation to the banking crisis.  The impact of the credit crunch was certainly extreme, both internationally and in Ireland.  The S&amp;P index fell by 50%, GDP in the developed economies experienced its largest post-war contraction, and Irish GDP, which actually rose by 1.2% in the third quarter of 2008, on the initial figures that were published at that time, contracted by an extraordinary 7.1% in the final three months of 2008.  The total contraction in the recession was about 12.5%.  So over half of that was experienced in just three months, post-Lehman.</p><p> Commercial property prices also tumbled, a prime factor behind the decline in the value of bank assets, with record falls recorded in many countries.  UK prices fell by 26% in 2008, while the plunge in Irish values was also unprecedented.  Capital values had fallen by 10% in the first half of the year, before falling by 15% in the third quarter and 18% in the final quarter of 2008 and a further 18% in the first half of 2009.  It is also noteworthy that Ireland chose to mark to market these assets at an extreme stage of the cycle.  It is also noteworthy that not many other countries, if any, followed that example.  </p><p> Few, if any, envisaged the effective collapse of the global credit system, while the unprecedented scale of the policy response, including massive state support for banks, zero and even negative interest rates, which are still with us, seven years later, QE and new capital and liquidity rules for the global banking sector, is also testimony to the singular degree of financial disruption that emerged post-Lehman, with the ramifications still being felt, noticeably of course in the euro area.  Finally, a third factor emerged in 2010, and again I don't think this is given enough attention, which relates to the sovereign debt crisis, which by 2012 had developed into an existential crisis for the euro.  State support for the banking sector, initially seen as positive, was now perceived as adding stress to already high sovereign debt levels and the subsequent fall in government bond prices added to bank losses, given their holdings of government debt, a phenomenon that became known as the doom loop.  In that context, it is noteworthy that a number of official reports into the banking crisis in Ireland, including Professor Honohan's, was commissioned in 2010, presumably on the view that the worst was over, but ECB lending to Irish-headquartered banks was higher in early 2011 than in 2008, and ELA support also peaked in 2011.  New regulatory capital requirements also resulted in widespread bank deleveraging, so adding a further downward pressure to asset property markets.</p><p> In 2012, the Central Bank's housing models show that Irish residential prices were now as much as 26% below fundamental value.  It is also of note that the Central Bank's prudential capital assessment review, or PCAR, which began in, which was in March 2011, identified a large capital shortfall in the main Irish banks and that ... and then substantially overestimated the projected pre-impairment profitability.  In the event, the requirement to off-load assets and to increase deposits put significant pressure on net interest margin.  The scale and extent to private sector-deleveraging Ireland, which is still apparent, also resulted in a larger fall in bank assets than envisaged in the PCAR.</p><p> In summary, the correction under way in the Irish property market in 2008 turned into a crisis for the economy and the banking system in the wake of the post-Lehman collapse in the global credit system and a fallout from the subsequent sovereign debt crisis in Europe was a significant factor in delaying the return to bank profitability and in slowing the pace of economic recovery in Ireland.  Thank you very much for your attention.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-07a.1037" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Beggs" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050700002#LL00300"><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  You asked me to give evidence on eight lines of inquiry relating to my role as chief economist of Allied Irish Banks.  Now I've covered these as best I can in my written statement of 9 April, and I propose today just to summarise the main points of those lines of inquiry.  Before I do so, I want to clarify that I was not the chief economist of Allied Irish Banks in the period leading up to the banking crisis.  I was promoted to this role in a restructured bank in late 2011, a position I held briefly until my retirement in 2012.  My actual position from 1992 to 2011 was that of chief economist, global treasury.  My role was primarily focused on advice within wholesale treasury and supporting corporate and commercial treasury in relation to general economic issues, particularly around the outlook for interest rates and exchange rates.  The economic research unit which I headed was located within wholesale treasury in the capital markets division.  The AIB Group's property-related Irish exposures were in the retail Ireland division.  Overall risk management, capital management and relations with the supervisory authorities were handled at group division level.</p><p>Though part of global treasury, my unit was a limited resource available to other business units across AIB and provided on-demand services to other parts of the group.  One area of support was in relation to stress testing.  My unit produced and published research and I will deal with aspects of that in the questions following my statement.</p><p> In giving evidence before this committee, on the lines of inquiry indicated to me, I believe therefore it's important to clarify that I did not occupy a central role within the AIB Group, or a management role in the lending strategy of the retail division.  Furthermore, in relation to some of the lines of inquiry in which I've been asked to give evidence, I must point out that I had very little involvement with the Department of Finance or the Central Bank - Financial Regulator, during my career in AIB.</p><p> The first line of inquiry you asked me to comment on was in relation to banks' risk appetite and the appropriateness of their property-related credit policies.  In relation to risk appetite, I make the point in my statement, I use a risk appetite statement from AIB from 2007, and then contrast it with the concentration of property as set out in the bank's presentation on their results for 2006, which shows that property lending constituted 33% of total lending.  I make the point that reconciling the two is only possible, in my opinion, on the basis that AIB believed that its business was well-diversified geographically and sectorally, well managed, of good quality and low risk, based on its customer profile and knowledge of its customers' financial standing.  I believe that banks focussed primarily on what they perceived to be the quality of their individual loan books, with less consideration of the potential systemic risks in the Irish banking system as a whole, and the contagion risks, should serious problems emerge in an important bank, particularly given their overall dependence on external funding.</p><p> As to the appropriateness of property related credit policies, I'd make a general point that the sustained growth in the Irish economy in terms of real GDP and employment meant that the assets of the banking system became increasingly tied up in bricks and mortar in one form or another over the period.  As banks are the main source of finance for the Irish private sector, there is a high correlation between the growth in credit and GDP/GNP.  The appropriateness of Irish bank lending policies cannot be divorced from the stance of fiscal policy, other macro-economic policies, and the role of monetary and prudential policy.  Here, I want to integrate a comment on the third line of inquiry as to the appropriateness of macro-economic and prudential policy, in commenting on this first issue.  Strong growth in bank lending occurred against a very expansionary fiscal policy which provided misguided support to bank lending policies.  Monetary conditions were also very favourable.  Interest rates were too low.  Prudential policy was too deferential and failed to pick up on warning signs.  Last but not least, banks, as described by the Nyberg report, were engaged in high-risk growth strategies involving a significant expansion of credit.  There were no countervailing policies in operation.</p><p> Research shows that while the decade of 1990s was primarily driven by exports, the expansion of credit was also a key contributory factor.  Strong employment growth and the rise in the population led to a large increase in house building.  Furthermore, the ratio of private sector debt to GDP was well within the range of other countries.  In the period after entry into EMU, in my opinion, developments prior to around 2002-03 could be characterised as still within acceptable ranges for many key ratios.  A period of slower growth was warranted thereafter as the growth in total lending carried increasing levels of risk as property price inflation and investment and construction headed for unsustainable levels based on international standards.  I set out a number of statistics in my written statement relating to credit expansion which I won't go into here in this summary.</p><p> On the second line of inquiry, relating to risk concentration in base, and in adverse scenarios, I would say that stress testing was undertaken within AIB by the stress testing steering group which was part of the central group risk management framework.  My role was to present an overview of the economic scenarios to the STSG based on, for instance, the initial economic data provided by the regulatory authorities, either in the UK or in Ireland.  The aim was to provide group and divisional risk management, finance and credit units, with the fullest possible understanding of the transition from the base case to the adverse economic scenarios.  The actual calculation of the effects of the adverse economic scenarios on the bank's capital and other metrics was undertaken by analysts within the group and divisional risk and credit units.  When it comes to concentration risk, the methodology changed over time to include additional studies to examine the correlation between sectors, particularly in relation to property.  Adjustments were made to the impact on credit provisions to take account of this factor.</p><p> As to the third line of inquiry, the adequacy of the assessment and communication of both solvency and liquidity risks in the banking institutions and sector, here I'm really looking at the role of the three policy makers, and I want to focus particularly on fiscal policy, because it seems to me, and certainly from my experience of the Department of Finance, that far too much of the time of the Department is taken up with the annual budget process.  Macro-economic issues over the medium term, or other issues, are not really handled effectively within the Department.  And in terms of publications from the Department, they tend to just simply back up what's contained in the supporting ... what's contained in the annual budget statements.  So therefore, there were no commentaries, that I'm aware of, from the Department, relating to the property sector in the period leading up to the crisis.  The prudential practice covered both micro and macro policies and, I'm quoting here from the Honohan report which pointed out quite a lot of deficiencies in the way in which these policies were carried out, but at no stage did the assessment of the banking system, such as it was, show any concerns about liquidity or solvency issues.</p><p> On the macro prudential side there were annual financial stability reports published between 2004 to 2007.  These reports failed to trigger a more cautious approach within the banking system.  An important earlier point worth noting is that several research papers produced within the Central Bank and by the ESRI, the IMF and the OECD, consistently came to the conclusion that Irish house prices were overvalued, often by significant amounts.  I believe that the consistency of this conclusion should have alerted the supervisory authorities to investigate the implications of this more rigorously with the financial institutions.</p><p> On the fourth line of inquiry, appropriateness of the expert advice sought, quality of the analysis, and how effectively this was used, I again refer to quite a number of international organisations that provide analysis and advice to the supervisory authorities. However, I also feel that these reports are often subject to a little bit of suasion from the domestic institutions as to what's contained in them.  However a more ... I suppose, a better form or research from these organisations might well be found in the number of housing market reports published by the OECD and the IMF, in the 2003-04 period, and by the OECD in 2006, which raise quite a number of issues in relation to the Irish property market.  And other studies produced by the OECD in 2006 raised issues about adjustments in the property market in the context of a monetary union and these, I believe, were important and useful studies for consideration by the authorities and also by financial institutions.</p><p> In the area of contrarian views, I would say that, by the time these contrarian views became public knowledge and got a great deal of publicity, the Irish property market was already in slowdown mode.  I found the reaction to them to be quite surprising because research, I think that we had published, showed that by 2005 the ratio of house prices had already risen quite dramatically, affordability was deteriorating, interest rates were on the rise, investors were increasingly worried about the market, employment growth had levelled off, so we were in a situation where there was a turning point already on the way.</p><p> As to the remaining lines of inquiry, Mr. Chairman, I don't propose to read into my ... anymore out of my statement.  I will make the point, though, in relation to the liquidity issue in banks, I sat in the dealing room of AIB during this period and every event, and there were quite a number of them, from mid-2007 to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, was a big event and was quite troubling in the context of how the markets saw it.  I think, if you're not in that space, you don't really have a full appreciation of just how difficult that was.</p><p> So, Mr. Chairman, that concludes my summary of the main lines of inquiry, but with your permission, I propose to deal with the issue of Professor John FitzGerald's reference to me in his testimony to the committee on the 11th.</p></speech>

Well, first of all, I confirm that I did meet with Professor FitzGerald in relation to stress testing.  I do not recall the exact date but I'm happy to accept from his records that it was in October 2005.  Professor John FitzGerald himself, in his e-mail of 16 February to the committee, accepted the possibility that his recollection of the content of the meeting was faulty.  Professor FitzGerald's recollections of the content and the nature of the meeting were in many key respects very different from mine.  Specifically, I am certain that I expressed no concerns on the part of the AIB board about stress testing.  The board never authorised or was aware of the meeting.  I did not report back to the board on the outcome of the meeting.  The meeting was an exploratory, technical one between economists to ascertain whether the ESRI's model could be used to enhance the scene setting of base and stressed economic scenarios by providing more economic variables than contained in regulatory exercises at the time.  It was never the intention to ask the ESRI to carry out stress tests independently of regulatory ... of the regulatory ones and it was certainly never envisaged that the ESRI would apply macroeconomic scenarios to the bank's internal data.  I never asked Professor FitzGerald to carry out stress testing on behalf of AIB.  I sought to explore whether prescribed regulatory economic stress data, which consisted of only a limited number of indicators, could be run through the model to generate a more graphic and detailed economic picture of the stressed outcomes.  The meeting failed to produce any results.  As I recollect, Professor FitzGerald indicated that the ESRI would not undertake private unpublished work.  There were some limitations as to what the model could do, but he was prepared to make data from the forthcoming medium-term review available to us.  It was an inconclusive meeting and my unit never followed up on that.<br/><br/>If Professor FitzGerald did any other work for AIB or other banks on stress testing, I am not aware of it.The impression created by Professor FitzGerald's testimony is that the AIB board was concerned about the lack of severity in the stress test exercises as far back as late 2005, which may imply a broader level of concern.  I have no knowledge of the board's opinion on the matter.  I never received any negative feedback or reports from the board or board risk committee on stress testing.  As a result, I have no reason to believe that the AIB board had any misgivings about regulatory stress testing.  It was not my practice in AIB to attribute comments or opinions to other AIB business units or committees, least of all the board of the bank.<br/><br/>Stress testing in AIB is executed through the stress testing steering group, which is responsible for ensuring that a comprehensive stress testing programme is embedded in risk management and to ensure that an effective framework is in place to enable stress testing across the group.  I attended the meetings of the stress testing steering group when a stress test exercise had to be carried out.  My role was to communicate the evolution of the scenarios from base case to stress scenarios to the committee and onward to divisional risk management and business units, as appropriate.  I was not involved in the application of the economic variables to the bank's internal data.  This was ... sorry ... carried out by analysts within the divisional risk and credit units as well as in the group risk unit.  <br/><br/>From an early stage, probably prior to 2005, I felt that the regulatory stress testing exercise could become too procedural.  Banks were provided with stress tests, the work was carried out with great care and attention to detail, signed off by bank boards and reported on by the Central Bank in various reports, such as the annual financial report.  I also felt that the stresses were too mild, though not on every occasion.  I was also concerned that the moderate nature of the stresses were not conducive to maximising management buy-in of the risks involved.  This was my personal opinion and had much to do with the view that people performing the stress tests in various business units needed to understand the broader economic and financial implications of a given shock to a base case scenario.  To do this, one needed a model and the ESRI had one.  A model would provide more outputs for consideration, a wider context to the changed economic environment and given the likelihood of a growing stress testing framework, a more consistent approach to the exercise over time.  I raised these issues with the stress testing steering group and suggested that I talk to John FitzGerald in the ESRI to see what could be done.  I stated this would have some cost implications.  <br/><br/>I quote John FitzGerald from his testimony to the committee:<blockquote>We did macro-economic scenarios.  The difference compared to what the Central Bank and so on was doing was that we used the model, so it was consistent.  One did not get a house price crash and no change in unemployment; one got a housing price crash, unemployment going through the roof and Government revenues collapsing.  All coming together which is the way to do it.  That was my concern, it was not just the Central Bank.  It was interesting doing something similar for a British owned bank, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority, FSA, had a similar inappropriate approach to stress testing.</blockquote>So, I also felt that the amount of data provided and scenario scene setting between the base case and stress tests were too limited.  This applied to both Irish and UK regulatory tests.  I wanted to bring more information to bear on the process of assessing the risks to the business from the economic deterioration under consideration in the stress.  I carried out, personally carried out, most of the work on the macroeconomic inputs for stress testing in AIB.  From year to year, I endeavoured to be consistent in how I interpreted the shocks and in producing additional information for the divisional risk and business teams, particularly the changes in employment, which were not specified in the macro-aggregates in the base or stress scenarios.  This had to be estimated within individual banks from the changes in real GDP and unemployment rates supplied for the exercise.<br/><br/>In his testimony, Professor FitzGerald stated on several occasions that his recollection of the meeting in October 2005 might be faulty.  In his letter to the committee of 16 February he states: &quot;However, as my recollection of the timing of the meeting was faulty, there is always the possibility that my recollection of the content of the meeting was also faulty.&quot;  Mr. Chairman, much emphasis has been placed on the importance of this meeting between the ESRI and AIB in October 2005 at the committee hearing on 11 February but it did not have the imprimatur of the AIB board.  Thank you. </p></speech>

One of the key services that we provided within global treasury was to the corporate and commercial treasury and there we had quite a lot of our clients who were interested in particularly interest rates and exchange rates and, of course, general economic issues.

I should say that, perhaps with my colleagues here from other financial institutions, that I had a great deal of independence within AIB.  My research was not vetted by anyone.  It certainly wasn't vetted by the retail bank and it wasn't seen as supporting their business.  We produced research.  We obviously operated within certain constraints in relation to stock market and other, I suppose, compliance rules, but otherwise we were very independent and the bank were happy to have that situation prevail.</p></speech>

I have to say I was very, very surprised to hear what Professor John FitzGerald had to say at the committee meeting.  I've known him quite a long time.  We've worked together in the Department of Finance in the 1970s.  We've had some interactions, over the years.  I ... I suppose, at my own initiative, I decided that what we needed to do ... I was doing the stress testing, shall I say.  I may not be doing the stress testing, you know, indefinitely and I wanted to bring some consistency to the way in which these stresses and the scenarios were being presented to the risk analysts who had to carry out the exercise.  A model was one way of doing it.  So, I approached John FitzGerald with a view to, first of all, inputting the regulatory stress test, the data that we were given by, say, the Central Bank, which were very limited in number.  I wanted to run those results through the model to generate a wider scene setting because the model generates quite a lot of information.  And as Professor FitzGerald states in his ... in the letter to the committee, the model could do that and that, for me, was an important input into the stress test exercise to be carried out within the bank itself.  I wanted the business units to get a full sense of ... the fullest possible sense as to what this stress involved.  With the benefit of hindsight of what happened, it's quite clear that having the clearest and the most, you know, expansive version of a stress and what it would involve might have been useful.</p></speech>

Again, to try and simplify this down, I'm an early school leaver, I did my education as a mature student and there are people probably watching it this evening, saying, &quot;What was the model?&quot;  The model wasn't somebody from some model agency, it was an economic structure that was put in place and it's a bit like <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>, where they design a model in that that took so long that, when the data came out, they forgot what the data they actually put into it actually was, so the answer was of no use.  What I understand this meeting was about ... or maybe if you can answer what this meeting was about, was to further extend the model so to give a more comprehensive analysis as to what was actually happening.  Would that be correct in saying that?</p></speech>

It says:<blockquote><br /><br />AIB says that even if its forecasts prove overly optimistic, the downturn in activity is unlikely to derail the economy completely.  The economy will still hold onto virtually all the gains in output, employment and living standards achieved since 1993.  These are very impressive gains, with real GDP increasing by 167% and employment rising by over 75% in this period.  As the chart shows, there has been a very strong growth in GDP per capita in Ireland relative to the UK and eurozone over the past decade.</blockquote>What model was used to give us that information?</p></speech>

And they are, I suppose, informed opinions based on the information that we have at the time.</p></speech>

Of course, we were only months away from a significant change in the global economic outlook, which, just to answer ... to add some information to what you're asking me: the volume of world trade declined by 20% in the 12 months from April 2008 to April 2009, and the world economy went into recession.  So this is based on, as it says, "The fundamentals of the economy remain sound, though, so growth should pick up in 2009/2010 as the downturn in housing bottoms out and global growth improves".  So a key assumption is that the global economy improves.  That is not what happened.  And as Irish GDP or changes in Irish GDP are extremely dependent on changes in exports, given that in 2008 exports were probably 90% of GDP, the trend in exports determines the trend in GDP.</p></speech>

I think actually ... I reflected on the ... if I reflect on the very last slide in that presentation, where you can see the scale of the impact on the economy as a whole in terms of the public finances, what that meant in terms of the need for cutback in services, it shows you the benefit of a stress test exercise that is all-encompassing and gives you significantly more information than was used in regulatory stress tests back in 2005.</p></speech>

You know, the thing about once you'd remembered to put it into context is: when stress tests are done, you're looking at past data.  Ireland had had experienced, since 1975, one year in which nominal house prices had fallen, and they'd fallen by 1.7%.  One year since 1970 that GDP had fallen on an annual basis.  So to put in stresses of 2% or 3% falls in GDP, 20% falls in nominal house price would have been severe.  If you're suggesting that they should have had a stress test with a 67% fall in commercial prices, a 50% fall in residential prices, and a 12.5% fall in GDP, obviously they didn't, but at the time I don't think that was unreasonable.  Plus, the major problem for the Irish banks wasn't just Irish commercial property; US commercial property prices fell 40%, and UK commercial property prices fell 35%.  So I don't think it would have been reasonable at that time to have put in, given historical experience, to put in those numbers.</p></speech>

So you were given a range of variables.  I said in my witness statement I had limited involvement in it because you just got them.  It was a fact and I ... didn't ... I passed them over to the risk people and said, "You worry about that", right.  Yes, I would ... the only comment I would pass on them ... yes ... there were a limited range.  I can't remember how many there were but there wasn't more than half a dozen, at a guess of variables in it.  Whereas ... so ... so was I happy with them?  I was happy that they met the demands of the regulator.  They were not by any means the full whack ... in the sense that we were to go on and do later.</p> <p>  In 2007 we got our impetus from the Bank of England and the ... the regulatory authority over there.  And it was a totally different approach and now, obviously, there must have been some co-ordination between the regulators because I gather this happened because Ulster Bank was ... was regulated by the ... or part of RBS which was regulated in the UK.  But it also would ... UBIL which you're interested in, which was not an important distinction at the time for us ... UBIL was just a small part of the ... part of a big group.  We didn't ...

Can I just go back and ... Mr. McArdle, you made reference to groupthink.  And ... in late 2006, Morgan Kelly wrote a piece in <i>The Irish Times</i>that there would be a 50% fall in house prices.  Subsequent to that, right ... the AIB, Mr. Beggs around the same time, it's on page 49 of core documents - Bank Economists.  From the unit of which you were head of and you said: ''The Irish Housing Market - They think it's all over ... but it's not''.  Mr. McArdle, on page 55 ... you wrote that ... Mr. ... it was from an <i>Irish Times</i>piece and I quote:<blockquote><br /><br />Mr McArdle says he remained confident of a soft landing in the house market.  He expects that the &quot;modest fall&quot; in house prices seen recently will continue for the rest of the year.</blockquote>And Mr. McLaughlin, if I draw you very quickly to page 63, you gave a radio interview on 5 June 2007 ... Mr. McArdle, your piece was on 14 July 2007 ... Mr. McLaughlin, you basically stated that ... you said: ''Mr. McLaughlin said it was &quot;completely ridiculous&quot; to suggest that &quot;suddenly in 2008 that the economy would fall off a cliff''.  And you ... prior to that in January, you wrote a similar piece where you did ... it was in <i>finfacts </i>and you ... you basically ... more or less the same thing again, right.  And there was one final thing then.  On page 77 ... it's in January 2007 a extract from a transcript  of a Bank of Ireland business banking debate.  Interestingly, you said that:<blockquote>Some things we're fairly sure are going to happen.  United will still be dominant in [the] world football.  Christiano Renaldo will be the number one player in the world. But other things are....</blockquote>more than likely to happen.  You said that in five year's time.  Well, United are no longer the dominant in world soccer-----</p></speech>

The facts are there.  Obviously, I was wrong.  I have no problem in admitting that, clearly, in retrospect, the economy did fall apart but not until the final three months of 2008.  That's a fact.  GDP fell 0.3% in Q1, 0.5% in Q2, it went up 1.2% in Q3.  If you look back now at the data, you won't find those numbers because it's all been revised but at the time, which is the point I was making in my .. in my presentation ... we've got to be careful to be aware of what was said at the exact time.  And the economy contracted 7.1% in the final three months of 2008 ... 7.1%.  That's never happened in the history of the world.  And it happened in the final months of 2008.  That's why everybody got it wrong.  You look at the OECD or the IMF or the ESRI's medium-term forecast in the summer of 2008, what were they saying?  They weren't saying anything different.

If you look at ... if you look at what I actually wrote - it's very clear I said in 2007 the housing market was slowing down.  I forecast in early 2008 a significant fall in house price completions, which was actually correct.  It dropped to 50,000.  My mistake, in terms of the housing market, was to say that the correction would be in real house prices, not nominal house prices, because we hadn't had a fall ... a huge fall in nominal house prices.  Morgan Kelly's prediction was actually in real house prices as well, and all the analysis that people refer to are real house prices, not nominal.  So, in 2007, I and most other economists in Ireland could clearly see the housing market was slowing down.  What we ... what I didn't see was the fact that it would collapse the way it did, but I would argue, and this is where people may differ, I would argue that the liquidity collapse that happened in ... at the end of 2008 was a significant factor.

Come October, the market continues to grow.  Now there were some further deterioration's in affordability, which we note in the report, but, unfortunately, we were struggling with this market to understand what was happening.

I would have taken the view that if I were Government, I ask the experts what the situation is.  There's no point in me giving an opinion on that.  But, for what it's worth, the regulator told an Oireachtas committee on 14 October that all banks were solvent, so I would probably have believed that at that stage.</p></speech>

I didn't think, obviously, it would lead to the essential collapse of the credit markets for about nine months.  In terms of the medium-term forecast, the bank used the ESRI forecast, so my forecasts were just for a year or 18 months.  I didn't envisage that the global credit markets would collapse the way they did.  I regret now, obviously, that my forecast didn't reflect ... I think, if you look at some of the stuff I wrote, I was flagging some downside risk but I didn't think it would be as bad as it was.</p></speech>

I think, obviously, the funding ... the funding requirement of banks is an issue that probably should have been given more attention.  I'm of the opinion that that funding would not have been available to the Irish financial sector unless external analysts and economists actually had a positive view about Ireland.</p><p>They weren't just taking their cue from what Irish banks were saying.  And I think we need to be a lot more critical and sceptical about ... about trends, particularly when there is a trend in place as to how this is going to work itself out.  And that is true of the soft landing issue.  We never envisaged soft landing to be soft, there was a certain amount of friction going to happen in a soft landing and the soft landing we are talking about was only house prices.  We had no information or very little information about what was happening in commercial property.  We've done a lot of talking and analysis around housing because we had monthly statistics, we had population.  When it came to the commercial side, we didn't have that information.  So we were acting in a very, almost naive way in that we didn't have full information.  So more information around the sector as a whole and property as a whole, not just mortgages, would make a big difference in the future.</p></speech>

So the first quote, gentlemen, I don't expect you to be familiar with this, but the Oxford University Press published an extended article in 1999 by a Peter Englund from the Stockholm School of Economics. The article is called &quot;The Swedish Banking Crisis: Roots and Consequences&quot;.  And he relied extensively on a paper that was done for the IMF the year before by two analysts.  One is a director of research at the World Bank, for the record, Asli Demirg&uuml;&ccedil;-Kunt and Enrica Detragiache.  And Professor Englund sums up what they found, and I want to read what he says and just ... you'll be able to take note in your head, it's not very complicated.  So to quote:<blockquote><br /><br />[This paper] identifies 30 major banking crises from the early 1980s and onwards.  Most of these are in developing countries, the main exceptions being three of the Nordic countries (Norway, Finland, and Sweden) in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  The majority of these crises appear to have followed a common pattern.  They have (i) been initiated by deregulatory measures, which have (ii) led to overly rapid credit expansion.  This has in turn been followed by (iii) a sustained increase in asset prices, apparently unwarranted by fundamentals (a &lsquo;bubble&rsquo;).  At some point (iv) the bubble has burst, with a dramatic fall in prices and disruption of asset markets (in particular for real estate) and widespread bankruptcies.  This has been accompanied by (v) non-performing loans, credit losses, and an acute banking  crisis, in many cases intertwined with (vi) a currency crisis.  Finally, (vii), a weakened banking sector has inflicted a credit crunch on the private sector, the severity of which has depended on (viii) the government measures taken to salvage the ailing banks.</blockquote></p></speech>

I noticed none of you mentioned Mr. McWilliams in your introductory remarks, you did mention Professor Kelly.  Let me quote from the evidence David McWilliams gave to this inquiry.  He said:<blockquote><br /><br />I just want to make some opening remarks about the period in question, starting with 2000 and going up to 2008 and beyond.  [I'll just skip a little bit and then continue] In fact, I probably spent the best part of a decade trying to warn as many people as possible on as many platforms as possible that our property market was going to crash and that when it did, our banking system would be in a situation where money would fly out of the system and lead to a banking crisis.  <font color="#2F2F2F">[...] I made documentaries about this.  I had [my own] TV show [on TV3].  [...]  I warned people at every juncture that our housing market was a credit bubble and credit bubbles bust and it is not a matter of if they bust but when they bust.  [...] When I hear the view that nobody saw this coming or that this was in some way a shock or we were taken by surprise, I do not believe that is the case.  I think the Irish property crash and the banking crash were both incredibly predictable and absolutely preventable.</font></blockquote><font color="#2F2F2F"> And Mr. McWilliams then refers to a &quot;Prime Time&quot; interview he did in October of 2003 which he says was watched by 400,000 people.  And in that he said, and I quote:</font><blockquote><font color="#2F2F2F"> </font>The Irish housing market is a scam.  It is an enormous financial swindle that could potentially confine an entire generation of young Irish workers to years of bad debt.  Far from being a reflection of economic vitality and fundamental demand the housing bubble is, in the main, a vacuous financial confidence trick that has been foisted upon us by an alliance of banks and the landowners.  <br /><br />Today, in Ireland, the price of the average house is close to ten times the average wage.  This represents an economic failure on a monumental scale.  Behind this nonsense is excessive and irresponsible lending from our financial institutions.  The situation would be laughable if it were not so serious.</blockquote>Gentlemen, could I ask you to reflect on the two quotes, one from 1998 and then one from Mr. McWilliams some time ago and to give me your reaction?  Why did you not understand these basics, that these other economists did?</p></speech>

Most of the crises occurred in high inflation periods where the price falls were significant falls in real house prices not in normal prices.  I would argue, and I said in my opening statement, that I think you can explain a lot of what happened in the Irish residential property market up to around 2005 in fundamental terms.  There's not many economies in the western world that have an 18% rise in their population in ten years, so obviously there was a massive increase in demand for housing.  There's not many economies that grew by 9% per annum between 1994 and 2000.  There's not many economies that grew 5.5% between 2000 and 2007. So we're talking at a time when employment was rising very rapidly, population was growing very strongly so I think ... and they other thing I think which one should bare in mind which is ... I think pretty obvious, but most people don't seem to think it has any relevance, is that Ireland joined the euro.  And we went from a relatively high interest rate economy to a very low interest rate economy.  Sweden didn't do that or any of those other countries didn't do that so anyone who looked at any economic analysis or any theory of finance would suggest that if you ... if your average interest rate is 7% or 8% and it becomes 3%, asset prices will rise.  So all of those factors should be taken into account.</p><p>I think if you look at the Central Bank's quarterly survey of credit standards, which is done by the ECB all through Europe but the Irish Central Bank publishes the Irish one.  It is only in 2005 that you get credit standards loosening, I think.  Then I think it becomes much more credit driven.  So the last '05, '06, particularly '07, I think were not driven by fundamentals.  I think there was more of a credit driven element to it.  This committee, over the last few days, has been discussing for example the introduction of 100% mortgages for first-time buyers which, if I recall, I think it was in 2005.  So I think it is only over the last two or three years of the boom that we can say there was a bubble element came in.  But also, in 2007, most people including myself were saying the housing market would slow down.  Okay we weren't saying it was going to crash, but we were saying it was going to slow down.  You look at all the forecasts that were produced, everyone thought that house completions would fall.  By the way, is there a shortage of housing now?  </p></speech>

So people say there were far too many houses built, but can there be a shortage now if that were the case?  So that's basically what I would like to say.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-07a.1236" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Beggs" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050700002#VV00400"><p>Well, first of all, in relation to Sweden, clearly this was a relatively recent event that had occurred in Sweden.  If I am not wrong, the factor that led to that bubble bursting was German unification and the impact of the currency markets and what that meant for Sweden's fixed exchange rate.  There is always some factor that eventually leads to these.  In the case of the Irish crisis, it was a global crisis.  The European Commission produced some report in 2009 that said, and it actually referenced local shocks and problems, banking crises and mentioned Sweden, but it said this time it is different.  This is a much more significant crisis.  That only sort of explains why the Irish one is a much more significant crisis than maybe one that was managed in Sweden.<br/><br/>I reference in my written statement under the issue of the role of advisors in analysing the crisis and I said:<blockquote>Against the backdrop of so much data and analysis, it would be difficult to argue that there was not a build up of interrelated risks and uncertainties in the Irish economy and banking system.  After all, notwithstanding the belief in our economic fundamentals going back to the 1990s, the build up to the Irish banking crisis had previously occurred in varying degrees and circumstances in other advanced countries.</blockquote>So I would say we had ample warning through the period.  I referenced OECD reports, IMF reports, that the Irish property market was overvalued.  Econometric studies that were saying we were 70% overvalued and then of course they were then pared back by other studies that said no we're not, which led Morgan Kelly to say by the way all those previous studies did not take a long enough view of the timeframe for these analyses, and he came to the conclusion that we were 50%, 60% overvalued, and we would potentially have a fall of that magnitude.<br/><br/>So warning signs were there about what had happened in other countries.  I would agree that in the period from probably 2004, I would say, or 2005 to 2007, lending policies ...  lending was too rapid.  It seems from what I have heard from other witnesses before this committee that maintaining market share, growing market share, seemed to be a more important driver of why credit was growing than there being, if you like, underlying sound reasons for the expansion.  I agree with you that house prices were too high.</p><p>They were too high from a very, very early stage in this recovery, making it more difficult for people to buy houses.  In our reports we have ... I referenced this ... showing the impact of rising house prices, rising interest rates on affordability.  By 2006, affordability had deteriorated to its worst levels in ten years and that was only after financial institutions had provided 100% mortgages, 35 to 40-year loans, you know, trackers, whatever ... all the means they could to make it affordable for people to still buy houses.  And at the same time they were providing finance for property developers where there was, obviously, rampant inflation going on, on that side.  So, we were building up a problem, and the question is ... absenting the global economic crisis from mid-2008, how would we have managed that?  That's the, if you like, the counterfactual that can't be ... well, we could think about it, but we haven't really figured out or thought about what might have happened to the Irish property market in the absence of that global shock.  But it did happen and we are in this situation now.  So, I think the warnings ... warnings are there, even in our own research, we had sufficient warnings, that people in, you know, risk management, credit management, should've been saying, "Yes, okay, I hear you still think there's going to be a soft landing, but, you know, I'm going to be more sceptical than that about it."</p></speech>

There always have been, there always will.  Nobody's listening to the contrarians now, as I pointed out earlier, to the IFAC people, for example.  Nobody listened, by the way, to Morgan Kelly's other six warnings which turned out to be wrong and ... very aesthetic and condemned them very strongly, if I remember correctly.  So that's the first point, you'll always have contrarians.  I quote you then in my witness statement at page 8, where I quote Professor Honohan to a D&aacute;il committee in June 2010, where he said, &quot;regulators should always pay attention to [contrarians] with coherent but not necessarily right view&quot;.  He went on to say &quot;Contrarians are nearly always wrong but it is the &quot;nearly&quot; that matters&quot;.  So, here you're operating on a very small probability - it's the nearly that matters - and more attention was not paid to those two studies, you say, because warnings like that are nearly always wrong, in the words of Professor Honohan.  I accept that it looks different now when you look back, but I would suggest to you, Deputy,, that you got to put yourself in the mindframe that existed at the time.<br/><br/>The other thing I'd say as regards to a quote from the IMF.  When it counted and where it mattered, the IMF said there'd be soft landing here.  There's a rake of papers from the IMF every second week.  They're not actually ... they're by individuals ... under the signatures of individual, not the IMF <i>imprimatur</i>.  So when it mattered here, the IMF and the OECD and the Central Bank said, &quot;There will be a soft landing&quot;.  They discounted that paper that you referred to.  And I could quote you other examples, by the way, from other studies that came to different conclusions.  There were, you know ... there were quite a number of other studies there too, given the ... and, indeed, I also say in my witness statement, the Central Bank reran Professor Kelly's analysis and data and they came to a totally different conclusion.  So who are we to believe the Central Bank, with all their expertise and resources, or this one guy who had never been in this field and suddenly moved into it?</p></speech>

And, could I put it to you, you know, learned gentleman and experienced economists, but a child socialist with a very basic knowledge of some of the fundamentals of Marxism, would know that prices cannot defy the economic law of gravity, especially if they are driven into the stratosphere by endless credit and other factors.</p><p>And could I ask you in relation to, Mr. Morgan Kelly came, I think one of you suggested perhaps, late, but in an article of great perspicacity, it was almost 40 housing booms he had analysed, and could I just put it back to you, that really economists, bankers and everybody else, should have known, and again-----</p></speech>

One person you couldn't have failed to see, or hear, during the ten years of the bubble, was Mr. McWilliams.  None of you commented on that.  The substance of the quotes I gave, is that or is that not very accurate assessment of what actually happened?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-07a.1246" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Beggs" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050700002#XX00400"><p>You made reference to Mr. McWilliams talking about the high price of housing, or he may have described it in other terms, but essentially I agreed with the point that house prices were extremely high, had become and were increasingly becoming unaffordable for a growing number of people, which is where this housing market in late, in 2006, was headed.  I mean I do reference this in my statement, that we were running out of road when it comes to housing, that the affordability issue was reaching critical points whereby when you stress-test people's incomes and their ability to afford to buy a house, that we were running at a point where fewer and fewer people would actually be able to meet those criteria, and that, may I say, was against a backdrop where, of extremely expensive average houses.  I mean, I take the view and my comment, my written statement, I dismiss econometric evidence around house prices as being, you know, just that.  But I base my view about the housing market on my own personal experience of my own children in the housing market in 2004, 2005 and 2006, and the extremely high prices that they had to pay for average properties.  And, I'm thinking to myself, you know, how is this going to continue?  What way are we going to manage a business, a sustainable business, if house prices are of this level?  It's all right, you know, offering more and more better terms so that people can afford to buy it, but at the end of the day they are being pushed out to 40-year mortgages with, you know, interest-only or whatever.  This was, actually, running out of steam long before Morgan Kelly pronounced, in my opinion, and our reports, notwithstanding some of the titles we put on some of our reports, and our view that "we hope for an equilibrium", or "we hope for a soft landing".  The evidence is in the reports, and I did actually supply the committee with the full text of our April '06 report, because they've only given a Finfacts summary of it here, but it does contain, as I said, the evidence that things were becoming untenable.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-07a.1248" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Dan McLaughlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050700002#XX00600"><p>It was just another view.  I mean, as I said before, to go back and pick out papers that were written ten or 15 years ago, you can pick out papers that were written ten or 15 years ago that were wrong all the time, so it's just another view.  I'm looking at something, I ... the notion that nobody thought that, everybody thought the housing market would go on forever, is completely wrong.  It's absolutely, completely wrong.  Of course not many people thought it would collapse the way it did but in January 2007, I'm even looking at something I wrote myself, "the most likely outturn for the market is therefore a period of flat or only modest price growth ... until affordability is restored" - that's January 2007.  So the notion that everyone was saying it was going to go up 10% per annum is just not true.  The other thing I would point out is the major losses for the Irish banks were not in residential property.  They were in commercial property.  In commercial property.  Not many people, if I recall, wrote anything about commercial property, and that was what caused the damage for Irish banks' profitability and caused them to require significant capital inflow, injection from the State, not residential property.</p></speech>

All the evidence that was given is the commercial lending and so on was huge.  Just a last question to you three gentleman.  You covered property and construction in a number of your reviews.  Was the level of risk concentration apparent to you at the time, as it occurred, or did you recommend any action or have any discussion internally in relation to the concentration of risk?</p></speech>

I wasn't aware of the concentration of risk until I ... until evidence was either provided before this committee or set out in whatever presentations the bank would make in relation to its annual results, but obviously they didn't ... there were concentrations in terms of the ... the property buckets and the type of investments they were making, whether it was residential investment, commercial development.  AIB, and I can only speak about AIB, and what they said about that, that they considered that to be a well-diversified portfolio.  In that regard I would say that what all property has in common, whether you segment it into all sorts of ... whether you do residential or commercial or whatever, it has expectations of confidence as a ... as a cornerstone of it all, so if that falters at a national level, all of these components or this diversification, just folds into one ... one bucket of ... of risk.</p></speech>

I was never aware of the Ulster Bank risk concentrations.  I never made any recommendations about them and I don't think anyone ever discussed them with me either.</p></speech>

I would just make one point about ... or two points, briefly.  One, Bank of Ireland had 45% to 50% of its loans in residential mortgages, of which about half were in the UK, so ... and a lot of other lending was in the UK as well, so I think there was a view that that offered diversification.  I think what happened for all of the banks, in 2008, 2009, was that having commercial property in different jurisdictions didn't prove a very good risk diversification strategy, because in a crisis, unfortunately the correlations collapsed to one.  In other words, they all collapsed together, and that is a rare phenomenon but that's what happened.</p></speech>

Before I do that, however, though, I wish to advise the witnesses, and to remind them that once they begin giving evidence, their evidence, they should not confer with any person other than their legal team in relation to evidence or matters that have been discussed before this committee.

Agreed.  Okay, just one item there ... and can I address this to Mr. Beggs before we continue.  Just to clear up some matter on the earlier document that I asked to be displayed there.  It's that presentation we discussed earlier this afternoon, Mr. Beggs.  It refers to you as John Beggs, chief economist, AIB Group.  Could you just clarify that, because you were saying that you were in the treasury group and so forth?</p></speech>

There are many occasions in my career when I've been described as the chief economist of AIB and people putting together slides do this, and, to be honest, with you sometimes I just didn't pick up on them, but my role - and where I could I always clarified it because it was important to the bank that I was only pursuing the role that I had and not assuming another role that the bank hadn't assigned to me.  So that's ... that's an error.</p></speech>

By the end there was four, a unit of four.  For much of the earlier time there was only two, I think. right.  So we beefed it up towards the last few years in the knowledge that I would be leaving.  Who did I report to?  Maybe, rather than give you a misleading ... I can answer that technically and you might get a misleading impression from it.  Economists ... as far as I'm concerned the economists in Ulster Bank were in a bubble, which was. like, out there, right, so who we reported to didn't really matter much ... It was ... the work we were doing was diverged from the rest of the bank, and it was used as a utility player and I told you I was external in my focus with some internal demands that had to be satisfied.  I initially reported to the chief executive of markets, to his successor, then there was an interregnum period of a year and I reported direct to Cormac McCarthy, the CEO, for a year, then to Robert Gallagher briefly and then to one of Robert Gallagher's reports who ... I have forgotten his exact title.</p></speech>

You weren't involved in the bank's strategy or the bank's business model, that it was looking at the broader economic picture within which the bank was operating.  Is that ... is that essentially what the work involved, rather than looking at, you know, the bank's strategy?</p></speech>

Yes, that probably is a correct categorisation in the sense that my job was external so about 70% of my time was spent doing things outside of the bank altogether.  To the extent that I interacted in the bank, I provided for the ... you know ... copious briefings of various ... organise ... various committees and even the board, and occasional inputs into some medium-term planning, for which I used mainly the ESRI forecasts, right.  So, I wasn't involved in determining the bank's strategy.  I wasn't at that level, and I ... you know, it wouldn't really have ... seen it as my function.</p></speech>

And a number of you said already that you weren't asked your opinion on the concentration of risk, the dependence on, you know, the property and construction sector.  Is that a fair statement, that you were never involved in those type of discussions, that, you know, the bank were putting a lot of eggs in one basket here, "As an economist I see a risk"?  Would you have had a forum to do that or was that really outside of your mandate?  And, feel free, anyone, to take that.</p></speech>

I'm not sure as to what, in fact, I could have added to it, because most of the research we were doing was based on official, published figures.  I mean, our research never utilised AIB banking statistics in any of the reports that we published.  They were all official CSO or either Central Bank data.  So it wasn't an area that we ever really went into.  Most of my time-----</p></speech>

I think it's important that the inquiry understands your role, all of you, because there certainly would be a perception that the economists would have been looking at the ... you know, the risks that the banks were facing and perhaps giving guidance and advice to the banks on strategy.  That's not what I'm getting from listening to you today or listening to your statements.</p></speech>

They had about 20 sectors, which they graded red, amber or green.  So they were clearly integrated into the business unit.  Now, it was decided in Ulster Bank that I should be external, and we did not have the resources to do both.</p></speech>

I do think, probably, the ... what was included in the guarantee is probably a little bit puzzling because, you know, in general, most people would be aware that subordinated debt would be seen as, you know, higher risk, and obviously has a much higher interest rate to compensate, so the fact that that was included is probably surprising in retrospect, but that's my only comment.</p></speech>

I mean, I've listened to the testimony around this and what's been said about it and, really, I'm not in a position to judge whether it should have been four or six.  But certainly from the point of view of the way the markets had been behaving and how they were after that, it seemed at the time to be the right decision at that time.</p></speech>

Thinking back to the time, as I said earlier, I thought it was solvent.  I believed what I heard.  I believed that the regulator should know, I mean, hey have the ultimate authority, with the information... the only authority I think who would have had it.  So I certainly believed that, I was sceptical about Anglo from the previous St. Patrick's Day for reasons that are well known.  And I remember thinking, what would happen if they had nationalised Angelo that night and thinking "my God it will be chaotic, there will be queues outside the other banks."  This was what I thought at the time and I suppose afterwards, I'm not so sure about that any longer.  Or it could have been nationalised, as Professor Honohan has spoken about at length here.  But the one thing that I would just mention is that, Ashoka Mody who was part of the IMF team that came over here, and I think I have got the right man, when Anglo was eventually nationalised the following January, in the middle of January if I recall correctly, he wrote an article that said that all of the trouble in Europe started with that decision.  So, you know, it was never going to be an easy decision is the point I am making.  If you... and if you had raised the flag... the flag about Irish banks on the night in question or even the following week, there would have been fallout.  We'll never know what it would have been.  But all things considered, I probably agree with Professor Honohan's first conclusion on this, which is the one in his report, which said that a substantial guarantee on the night was necessary.</p></speech>

So in the United States, it's the Federal Reserve.  In the UK, it's the Bank of England.  One of the issues probably which I think is not covered sufficiently is it was not clear, and it is still to some degree not clear, is the ECB the lender of last resort in the eurozone?  And I think, had there been much clearer lender of last resort, and now of course we have, in theory we have one... well the ECB is the regulator of the Irish banks... the main Irish banks.  We also have a resolution process in existence, none of that existed, but I do think had there been a much clearer idea of who was the lender of last resort, it might have been slightly different.  But, you know, that's hindsight.</p></speech>

Gentlemen, good afternoon... or evening I suppose now.  There is only ten minutes, so I'd ask you to be as brief as you possibly can.</p> <p>  First of all, Mr. Beggs, just from your opening statement, and I want to put a quote to you.  On page one you spoke and I quote "From my perspective, there were limitations on Group-wide participation and decision-making in AIB arising from the divisional structure and the hierarchical nature of the organisation."  Can I ask you briefly to give examples, maybe, of that?  Did you raise those concerns within the organisation at the time, or were you... did you have discussions with other managers or management level people within AIB at the time about those hierarchical structures within the nature of AIB?</p></speech>

I thought I was joining AIB, I joined the capital markets division and it took some time for me to realise that I was in a division and not in a... in one bank, which of course is what has happened to AIB in recent years, with a unified banking model put in place.  I discovered this in relation really... the relationship between the retail bank and capital markets division, that people from treasury were, you know, that they were utilised by the retail bank but the retail bank made its own decisions.   I mean Nyberg refers to this about the siloed nature of AIB in particular in relation to the issue of transferring loans from the... from the sectoral teams in retail... the retail division to elsewhere, to be managed in a different way.  I  think that was a limitation, you know, I have to say we produced the research in treasury.  A bit like the way in which Mr. McArdle's research was produced, we were a bubble, if I can use that phrase, a unit that had a great deal of independence.  The research went to the retail bank, but it sort of... it was accepted by them but having a role in terms of pursuing an issue that you had really wasn't, you know, really wasn't possible.  They... I'm not saying they didn't listen, but I am just saying that you didn't have any management role in relation to the decisions.</p></speech>

I would think it was ... a lot of people were just simply doing their work within ... they were, within the division and they were ... in my case they were dealers in the treasury and that's it, you know.  On the corporate side, of course they had relationships with corporate banking and retail banking because the customers were ... were really owned, if you like, by the retail or the corporate bank.  The treasury service were provided with a treasury to those ... to those customers.</p></speech>

Mr McLaughlin, I want to ask you about ... in the period in question up until the crisis, Bank of Ireland - and perhaps other institutions - held a number of roadshows or briefing meetings ... seminars for customers across the country.  I remember them happening in my own part of the country at the time.  I believe that you were frequently a speaker at those types of events.  If you could briefly summarise the nature of the format of what happened.  Were sales people from Bank of Ireland present at those events and what really was the purpose, ultimately, of those ... of those seminars?</p></speech>

As I said, I worked in, what's it called global markets.  And what global markets did was ... primarily it responsible for executing the funding strategy of the bank but also we provided an interest rate and foreign exchange service to the customer base, which was a mixture of corporate banks, sorry, corporate customers and retail customers.  So, in general ... and this ... this started when I joined the bank in 2001, we used to do roadshows which would be organised around the country by, usually, somebody from global markets who was in charge of that region.  So we would usually have a breakfast, say, and they would invite our corporate customers in the area or perhaps people that didn't bank with Bank of Ireland that were interested ... that they thought might be interested.  So I would do a presentation, much as ... you examples of what I wrote ... the economic outlook, I'd would do a power point presentation, usually, about the economic backdrop, talking about Ireland, the global thing.  I used to spend ... emphasise, a fair amount, the foreign exchange rates because obviously that was the main ... one of the main things that the global market sold to the customer base ... facility to do foreign exchange -----</p></speech>

Can I ask you specifically then in relation to page 2 of your statement you say that "I was given freedom of speech by Ulster Bank even if some of the things I said made them uncomfortable on occasion."  Did you view this as an important, I suppose, attribute to have in your role as the head economist in the bank at the time?</p></speech>

That was a big mistake by me in that I played the man, not the ball, right.  That's the first thing and I apologised for it fairly quickly afterwards.  But I would like to come, if I may, to the substantive point of that which is, you know, I took exception to what he was saying ... severe exception and I ... I thought he was off the wall, frankly.  And I still take exception to what he said there and I think history has shown that I was right.</p></speech>

Round about 2009, '10, I was very uncomfortable with the way things were done here, in that you had .. an awful lot of people were talking down the Irish market.  This included a range of people who were trying to make money out of it such as hedge funds, and they had advisers here in Ireland as well.  And, for example, there was one character in the<i>Financial Times</i>, he was a former economist of the IMF, Simon something, and another ... there were two of them writing articles on Ireland, very, very negative articles.  I remember reading one of these and looking up the name of the second guy and I discovered he was a hedge fund manager.  I sent a note to the Irish ...  to the<i>Financial Times</i>, so it was the <i>Financial Times</i>, to say, &quot;Do you realise this guy is a hedge fund manager?  He's probably talking his book in the parlance and was making money out of this&quot;, and he never appeared again.  So, if I said that on &quot;Prime Time.  It would be the same with the Joe Duffy show, for example, which Brian Lenihan rang up Joe Duffy to complain about, when he was advising people to take their money out.</p></speech>

Okay.  So Mr. Beggs, I am just puzzled here because Mr. FitzGerald-the ESRI did do stress testing for the Ulster Bank.

There was also the issue, which he referred to himself, about the fact that they didn't have a very detailed financial sector in the report.  And this meeting took place in late 2005.  I'm not sure when the Ulster Bank stress test was done, it was some time later.  So clearly there is a...</p></speech>

In this 2007 stress test, which is the one where we involved the ESRI, we produced the ESRI with hundreds of streams of information, right?  And they ran their model and they gave us back equal amount.  So it was very different from what Mr. Beggs was talking about.  And then I passed that to the stress testing people, who were the risk people, and they would've stress tested for ... and I'm fairly sure they did it for everything, you know what I mean, it wasn't that we didn't stress test for real estate ... they stress tested for housing, they would've done it for commercial ... because I remember them coming to me looking for bank liquidations ... company liquidations to get some idea of how a bad time could affect companies.  So, I was not involved so I have no specific knowledge of what they did, but I ... from the information I have, they were fairly extensive.  Everything under Basel II and the ICAP was ridiculously extensive and expensive in terms of time, money, resources, and in the end, didn't make much difference.</p></speech>

It says in it, it talks about soft landings and that whole notion and it actually says: &quot;If a soft landing is defined as something that is <i>both mild and gradual</i>, there has not been a single case out of the 49 boom-bust cycles.&quot;  That's a fairly serious remark to make, and clearly you would have been familiar with that article, that report, at the time.</p></speech>

The idea that a soft landing, if you defined it as something that was mild and gradual, it never happened.  When we are talking about soft landings, we were talking about it in relation to the housing market, I'm really referring there to a soft landing on prices.  When you are at 93,000 units in 2006, it's very unlikely that we are going to have a soft landing, unless we have such a gradual deceleration in the rate of house-building over four or five years, the likelihood was, I think it was referred to by other witnesses here today, that the output drop from 93,000 units to something more sustainable, which in our view was somewhere around 50,000, if it happened in one, two years, was going to have a big impact on the economy.  So the soft landing really referred only to house prices, that house prices could stop rising, so I would agree with that and that was never ... our definition of soft landing was never quite as soft as generally supposed.  In fact, in our report, we make the point that we did not rule out prices falling over several months and at the higher end of the market, where you couldn't justify what people were paying for houses at the top end, that we weren't ruling out significant price declines there, but our concept was, that for the average house price, that that would not decline.</p></speech>

Again, in that same report, and I'm sure all of you saw it, the OECD said, Ireland, it is more exposed to a negative shock, sorry, <blockquote><br /><br />However, it is more exposed to a negative shock that reduces residential and commercial property prices simultaneously as more than half of the banking sector&rsquo;s loan book relates to property.  Hence, it would be worthwhile for banks to err on the side of caution.</blockquote>Now, is that a contrarian view or is that an important organisation giving a very strong opinion in 2006 or how did your bank view it at the time?</p></speech>

In general I think I made a point in my opening statement that there are pros and cons of NAMA and I'm sure you've heard a lot of the pros.  But one of the main problems with setting up such an institution at the time was that you are marking to market in a market that doesn't exist, and it's in ... you know, nobody ... virtually nobody ... I don't think anyone else ... Spain set up kind of a bad bank but about three years later.  So there was advantages of doing it, but the disadvantage is it crystalises, in this case, &euro;42 billion of capital losses.</p></speech>

I have never done any analysis as to why it was that large, but it's certainly from the point of view of, you know, AIB, and what had happened in AIB, all the business that it tried to do in the economy, that this was the bottom line discount, I just found that to be extremely disappointing.</p></speech>

I mean, the alternatives that were put forward was a type of insurance, which was basically adopted in the UK.  So, as I said earlier, you know, there are advantages and disadvantages but I think it is interesting to note that it wasn't a model generally followed elsewhere.</p></speech>

AAA corporate entities that would normally issue short-term paper for a month to pay bills or to buy imports ... none of that existed.  So, to try and get a price for commercial property or land in that environment ... anyone's guess and so, I think NAMA then said that subsequently, it had further mark-to-markets downgrades, I'm sure it did, but you're just crystallising losses at a stress point of the cycle and if you do that with any bank, you know, it's going to be problematical.</p></speech>

Number two, I was thinking about, while the others are answering the question there, I was thinking about the ... Ulster Bank didn't go to NAMA but it had obviously had some process by which it marked its book to market too and so, we would have had ... suffered from the same factors.  My view ... this leads me into my view of NAMA ... I'm on record on saying NAMA at the time ... when I was writing for <i>The Irish Times</i>, was the least worst option.  A lot of people disagreed with that, vehemently actually at the time in 2009, I still have that view.  In fact, I think it has turned out better than could have been expected.  What I would say, though, is that the process by which NAMA was set up, it took almost two years from the Bacon report to the transfer of loans was unfortunate.  That timeline was far too long.  Now, I don't think there was anything anyone in Ireland could have done about it because it was dictated by DG Competition in Brussels but it allowed time for the value of those assets to be marked down for a whole variety of reasons, some of which we touched on here earlier, the national interest, and that was unfortunate.  And the final thing I'd say now, is that it's obvious now that NAMA underpaid the banks for the loans they took.</p></speech>

I think it's ... sorry I'm not going to argue about this.  I toss it out because I was surprised when I saw it in the Honohan report and this is the first opportunity I've had to comment on it since then.  I think it's self ... as I said in my thing ... it's self-evident, really, when you think about it, at least that's the way it appears to me that the watchdog, you know, has a sort of a higher moral responsibility, a higher actual degree of responsibility, higher even than the banks I would argue, although the banks obviously and politicians who ran the budget are up there with them, right.  But, I think when you look at the order of things ... otherwise why have we got a regulator ... like ... why do we have a regulator at all?  I'll leave it at that.</p></speech>

I think ... it was Mr. Sheehy, when he was here before us there from AIB recently, used the analogy of describing the regulator like a referee in a very competitive environment and the referee would needed to engage to maybe modify behaviour but if there is a riot taking place on the football pitch, who is engaged in the riot, the referee or the footballers?</p></speech>

So, yes there was a riot on the pitch, I would say, yes.  I mean, looking back, there was a frenzy of competition.  I mean, we had ...  in my view, anyway, we had excessive competition in Ireland.  Too much of anything is bad for you and we had probably ... arguably, excessive competition.  When you look at all that transpired, when you look at the competition that came from Anglo, when you look at the foreign banks, when you look at the attitude of the regulator who encouraged it, had a whole division in the ... IFSRA ... the regulator, you know, really, effectively sponsoring competition.  So, I think we went wrong there and there was too much freedom to the banks, the model didn't work and the only ... well, sorry, to come back to the question, I can see your scepticism, but the only one who could have stopped it was the regulator.</p></speech>

We're trying to shed light on the &euro;64 billion, that's the terms of reference of this committee, and I take it none of you anticipated that we'd be here discussing the &euro;64 billion.  Even though you were senior people in banks, there were no signals, no alarm bells, nobody talking about it in the canteen, or in corridors or locker rooms?</p></speech>

I said earlier, on the morning after the guarantee, it was a surprise.  We all know what happened after that, when the &euro;64 billion effectively materialised over the following two-and-a-half years and I would think ... first of all, nobody there on the night at the guarantee envisaged it, I would say, No. 1, and certainly, as far as I'm concerned, for me, I certainly did not envisage it.  I had no idea that the commercial book for the banks was in such a state.</p></speech>

I had no knowledge, or even any inkling, that we could be in that degree of ... that degree of trouble and, you know, even, you know, talking to analysts outside of Ireland - bank analysts, credit analysts - they remained, you know, very, I suppose, positive about Ireland and the state of the Irish banking system.  I can't put a date as to when that might have changed, but, you know, in comparison with, say, looking internally, at how people felt internally about it, the external view ... and they were very good analysts, I have to say.  I had a high regard for their expertise and what they were doing, but this was still a very positive view and we had no ... I had certainly no inkling of it.</p></speech>

And, secondly, that figure materialised over a number of years, it didn't appear overnight, and it largely appeared when ... it appeared for different banks at different times.</p><p>But, you know, the Government injected preference shares into the two, what are called now the two pillar banks, initially.  Again under the assumption that the fall in asset prices which ... any fall in asset prices would not be as large as subsequently appeared.  But the stress tests in ... the PCAR stress tests in 2011, which the Central Bank did, they deemed that the Irish banks needed &euro;24 billion in capital at that time.  And so ... because &euro;64 billion appeared over a period of time, and secondly, two banks accounted for over &euro;50 billion of it. </p></speech>

And, you know, the people looking in will identify our three visitors this afternoon as the public faces of banks which cost them &euro;64 billion.  They're extremely annoyed.  You know, is there any regret here from the three of you, that you were in organisations which, you know, have imposed such a burden on Irish economy and the Irish society?</p></speech>

But let me add that it's not &euro;64 billion any longer, of course.  You're aware of the figures from the Governor and others, it's either &euro;40 billion or &euro;30 billion.</p></speech>

We were talking about short-term economic forecasts and ancillary things.  So I never had the feeling ... well, first of all, Ulster Bank didn't have a share price here, so it couldn't ... it couldn't arise in my case, so perhaps I'll shut up.</p></speech>

I didn't, but I would just like to make a comment about loan-to-deposit ratio, because it's instructive that under the new Basel regulations it isn't a requirement, and I think people may not understand that you could have two banks, one with a loan-to-deposit ratio much higher than the other, but all the deposits could be corporate deposits that are one week notice.  Whereas another bank could have far less deposit, but far more wholesale funding, that they've issued five and ten-year bonds.  So a loan-to-deposit ratio can be quite a misleading statistic, and under the Basel requirements, under Basel III requirements, it is not a requirement to have a loan-to-deposit ratio of a given figure, because it's not a very reliable figure.  What is required is now liquidity coverage ratios, stable funding ratios, which take account of the different types of funding you have, and the maturity of those fundings.  It's a much more reliable metric than loan-to-deposits.</p></speech>

I have to say, we do have evidence that the banks resented attempts to regulate them under a number of headings, and we'll be talking about that with the regulator.  Could I draw the attention of our visitors to UBI-B2, on page 16, and pages 24 plus, where Ulster Bank in this case, late August 2007, doubled a sectoral limit from 250% to 500%.</p></speech>

We are talking about saving the system in Ireland ... the whole banking system that cost that &euro;64 billion or &euro;30 billion whatever it is that you referred to earlier ... and in that way I said there was only one watchdog who could have done something about it, right?  And I also said that ... this ... while I am familiar with corporate governance and the responsibility of boards, I ... I think I illustrated how really, that doesn't work or didn't work.  And to come to the nub of your question, Senator, I knew nothing about the matters you refer to until I heard them raised here, I think it, was it yesterday?  So I have no comment on them.</p></speech>

You know I mean it is clearly here that there's a ... there's a misalignment of impression ... you know ... you ... the way things operate in ... I worked in both the public and private sectors.  The way things operate in both those areas, perhaps it's different in academia, is that you do your job, you're in an area and you are consulted or not.  Rob Wright who, was in with ye, he said that in the Department of Finance he was shocked to see that people went home on budget night without knowing what was in the budget.  That's perhaps an extreme example of the type of thing ... but the fact that I was in Ulster Bank doesn't mean I know ... I knew anything at all about the matters you are discussing.</p></speech>

Bank of Ireland I thought was diversified ... it was a ... 50% of its loan book was in residential mortgages which is historically is one of the lowest risk areas to lend into.

It just seemed to me to be ... you know, the rate of growth of lending in that period was excessive and ... ran risks of not being adequately managed and understood.

So as far as I - and I wasn't involved, I didn't have that interaction with any other part of the bank.  So as far as I was concerned, things looked relatively okay.</p></speech>

All the banks now, mind you, were growing at extraordinary rates when you lumped them all together, right.

In terms of the euro ... with the introduction of the euro and between competitiveness, which you have all spoken about and the highly competitive environment, and I suppose the additional facility and access to liquidity, or easier liquidity that the entry in the euro gave, did that drive down what you've referred to Mr. McLaughlin as credit quality or underwriting quality?</p></speech>

I think the euro had a massive influence in two ways.  One is the average mortgage rate fell very significantly, which gave a very significant boost to affordability for a good few years.  But I think the major change for the euro was it suddenly transformed the funding side, funding landscape for the banking sector, in that the Irish pound market was a very small market and suddenly Irish banks could issue bonds into the huge euro market.  So I think it was instrumental in facilitating the very rapid growth in credit because it was much easier for Irish banks to access liquidity.  I don't think you can say it directly affected the credit side, I think that clearly it must have been competition.  I remember some, I forget who it was now, some politician who said "There's too much competition in the Irish market", and in retrospect that was probably right.</p></speech>

I suppose what I'm trying to get to, did it loosen?  As economists, did it loosen the credit?  I mean in the early 1990s, I mean, you needed a letter almost from both parents over 90, and one from the Pope, and a five-years' savings track record, and a guarantee from mam and dad and everything else.  I mean, as more money became available, as competitiveness seemed to be driving each of your institutions to maintain market share, was the easier liquidity of the euro leading to looser underwriting approaches by financial institutions?</p><p>Do you want to take that?</p></speech>

I mean, the ... the ... the move to provide 100% mortgages, etc., I've said earlier had to do with the fact that prices were rising very rapidly.  So if you were to ... if you were to ... banks moved away from, you know, these normal conditions for approving loans to looking at, you know, affordability, proportions of disposable income and that sort of thing, and stress testing them for increase in interest rates.  But that was in a low interest rate climate, so I think competition ... I would agree with Mr. McArdle that there was excessive competition in the Irish market.  The introduction of the euro facilitated that and ... I believe, though, as I said at the beginning in relation to AIB risk appetite and the concentration risk - and this applies to its other ... mortgage lending - that it believed that, notwithstanding the volume of business that it was doing ... that it was doing it ... that it was of good quality, low risk.  So I can't ... I can't say that it led to a lessening of standards.  I think we had a volume of lending which put us at risk.</p></speech>

I think you've got the wrong end of the stick, Deputy.  What it did was two things: it drove down interest rates, right, in Ireland, it led to Bank of Scotland Ireland coming into Ireland and undercutting all the other Irish banks and the other Irish banks went down.  So interest rates ... and there was a low interest rate regime in Europe, so it was much cheaper to borrow.  That's the first thing.  But that's on the demand side.  And, by the way, tracker mortgages came and were promoted by the authorities, right, which were super low interest rates.  So you had big boost to demand on that side.  And the other thing it did on ... on this side was it funded.  Irish banks could now get virtually unlimited resources at low interest rates in the inter-bank market.</p></speech>

The system changed and it moved away from the two-and-a-half times to the after-tax ... the proportion of debt service cost as a fraction of after-tax income.  And we all had various indices which modelled that.  I had one.  I'm sure AIB had one.  Dan had one.  DKM had one and still has one.  So it ... and that captured ... that model captured a lot of things that improved affordability, such as massive reductions in income tax, extension of loans ... I've forgotten the other factors.  I have them here somewhere on a slide.  There are about five different things.  So ... and ... so ... when ... when ... it was only when the ECB raised rates round about 2006-7 up to 4%-4.25% that that affordability became stretched.</p></speech>

Can I also ask that, as economists, you know, with large institutions at the time, and looking back, and on the basis that you didn't, as you've told us, have any direct involvement in the guarantee, considering the fiscal cost to the Irish people, and it's been referred to ... with the benefit of hindsight, do you feel that by taking a different approach in terms of capitalising banks or in terms of the guarantee or in terms of when we capitalised or whether we allowed fail or didn't allow fail, would there have been much, if any, of a fiscal saving to the Irish people, as a result of an alternative approach?</p></speech>

I was in the Department of Finance too.  I went on those missions to Brussels, to the OECD.  I met the IMF when they came in.  In fact, it was my job for a long time to organise the meetings with the IMF.  When ... afterwards when I was in Ulster Bank, we met the IMF, I recall.  I don't actually recall meeting the OECD, but I have... I do not agree with Mr. Beggs, my esteemed college, that the banks influenced those ... I think it's an important point to make.  They certainly came and asked us a pile of questions, right.  I never had the feeling that I was... I never saw the reports, so I couldn't try and influence them.  And I never had the feeling that they went away massaged, quite the opposite in fact.</p></speech>

Well, no ... we didn't provide information really, because they got their information from the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the ERSI.  They came to us, and it was general chats about how the world is going, they were interested in our forecasts, I don't recall... I didn't discuss anything pertinent to the bank with them.  I can recall meeting them with the finance director of the bank at the time, and them ... in 2009, early ... and having a big discussion about provisioning and all that sort of stuff, which again wasn't my area.  So I... I'm going to take the position that I... Ulster Bank certainly, as far as I'm aware, did not influence any of those reports.  We never met the OECD, and we did meet the IMF.</p></speech>

Obviously, the big issue in many homes across the State is the fact that the State had to put in &euro;64 billion of funds into the Irish banks and that doesn't.... obviously, there is other concerns in different jurisdictions in relation to Ulster Bank.</p><p>And I would guess that the perception out there, the common perception out there is that that happened because of a housing bubble, that house prices had gone out of control and losses were incurred by the banks.  Now two of you have mentioned that it wasn't actually house prices that it was commercial property, Mr. McArdle made reference to that and Mr. McLaughlin you've made reference that it was commercial property losses that broke the bank.  Can I ask you to, both of you to expand on why it was commercial property losses and not the losses in mortgages or housing that actually caused the significant losses in the banks?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-05-07a.1580" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Dan McLaughlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015050700002#TTT00200"><p>Well first of all commercial property prices fell in Ireland 67% and land banks probably fell possibly even 90% I don't know.  Also commercial property prices fell in the other jurisdictions that the banks had assets in - the United States had a huge fall, the UK had a huge fall.  That fall in asset prices was ... what happened was NAMA meant that that was marked to market.  Obviously house prices dropped 50% and it's obviously a very serious thing for a lot of people that were in negative equity and some people obviously lost their homes.  But the banks did not mark to market that house price fall, and as we now know the banks have now if you like ... the level of arrears tells you that the banks did not foreclose on those houses and therefore mark to market the price change.  So commercial property was mark to market and that ... NAMA crystallised &euro;42 billion of losses for the Irish banking sector.</p> <p>  Now obviously a lot of banks had put provisions against some of that but ... Senator D'Arcy asked me earlier about the NAMA discounts and I just made the point that, you know, the ... the Bank of Ireland one was lowest.  But I was shocked, I think everyone was shocked that, how could banks, how could some banks have a 60 odd per cent discount on some of their assets.  I think just factually it is the commercial property price falls, asset price falls that opened up the huge capital losses in most of the banks.  And the problem or the issue with asset prices is that, in general, not always but in general, asset prices tend to rise over time.  So obviously if you buy an asset five years later, I'm talking about real asset like land, five years later it's generally higher in price and that's what we see now.</p></speech>

I didn't do it so I don't know, and I never heard the results but they were presumably reported up the bank.  Well I might not of heard of it .. whether they could live with it I don't know.  But let's assume that it was okay because no one ever reported these stress tests were going to cause any Irish banks to collapse, you know, we never got any inkling of that.  So the banks, some banks anyway, Ulster Bank had stress tested for very significant house price falls and there was no problem.</p><p>The problem was in the commercial mortgage book.  And why was the problem there was the second question.  I think it's because of the cross borrowings, right ... in that I think they only became... well two things. first of all.  The process by which NAMA did it, that two-year process, that caused Irish property values to go down.  We'd have never ... if we had been able to do it like the Americans did - virtually overnight and stuff the banks with capital - we might have got away with ... instead of 67%, with a much lower fall.  But I'm not going to go there because that's speculation and we'll never know the answer.  But what we do know, and what should be available to the authorities is, the cross borrowing that all these big developers, you know, 20 of them, it turned out, that borrowed from all the banks.  Now, that wasn't known to me and I suspect it wasn't known to the banks either.  So I think that was a key factor.</p></speech>

I mean, it wasn't house prices that ended up requiring the additional capital.  It was on the commercial property book, which had grown dramatically in the years leading up to the ... to the banking crisis.</p></speech>

We've had evidence to the committee that the commercial property sector in Ireland was very small.  We also have evidence from NAMA, for example, that 29 borrowers that went into NAMA - which was commercial property - had &euro;34 billion of par debt.   In relation to stress testing within your banks ... was stress testing done for commercial property?  You know, there was a mention ... I am not sure which one of you mentioned, that there was no focus on commercial property.  Was it-----</p></speech>

If memory serves, 40 odd per cent of the transfers to NAMA were foreign property.  So it goes back to my point.  You know, there was a massive property ... commercial property fall in America, in the UK.  Also, in fairness, commercial property should also include land banks.  I mean, the biggest losses where were banks were lending to developers or to people who were buying land, some of which was zoned and some of which wasn't.  And, it was that price that fell ... in some cases, 90%.  Now, just one very quick thing.  I don't mean to suggest that all the losses were due to commercial property because, obviously, if you are AIB or Bank of Ireland or Ulster Bank, you're very intimately connected into the Irish economy.  So the Irish economy contracts by 12.5% and unemployment goes from 4.5 to 15%, you're going to have a lot of losses on ... particularly on SME lending, which was inevitable as a consequence of the fall in GDP.</p></speech>

Can I ask you just in relation to the UBS investment research report ... it was on 28 January 2008 - I'm not sure if you are familiar with it - it issued a sell notification for AIB and it estimated that commercial property was going to drop by 30%, if rent stayed static, and could go further.  It mentioned commercial property was way overvalued.  What was the impression?  Did you as economists have a view on that?  Did the bank discuss that report, particularly with AIB, because there was a sell recommendation to its investors at the time?</p></speech>

I certainly don't recall it.  And that's something that probably would've been dealt with within group as opposed to capital markets.  I think,  in relation to stress testing ... I think it's been already reported and discussed at the committee here how AIB did a stress test in 2007 of commercial property, with estimated losses that were within ... within in tolerance limits.  So it's, you know, big drops in property prices ... commercial property prices had been stress tested and found to be manageable.</p><p>It all depends on how ... the degree to which the probability that you attach to that scenario and I think the ex-chairman made a point that they only stressed for a one in 25 year event and not more, which gave you, obviously, a lower outcome.  But, I would think, just thinking back, there were probably plenty of such research reports that were becoming quite negative on Ireland and, clearly, commercial property was an area that would've been very much in focus.  I mean, I'd say all the property portfolio, whether it be house prices and commercial property, they would've made assumptions of declines, given the height to which house prices had ... and property prices generally, had risen over the three or four years up to the crash.</p></speech>

In terms of commercial property, you could have a property that is ... that has tenants in it, like an office block, which is paying interest to the owner of the property.  You could have somebody going to build some commercial property, or also you could have simply land, which has nothing on it at the moment, that somebody buys with the intention of either it has planning permission to build houses on it or offices on it, or it may not have planning permission and they hope to get planning permission.

He says ... he goes onto to say: "All of the parties who contributed to the crisis (borrowers, lenders, regulators, central banks, academics and politicians) [I note there's no economists in that section], were all seduced by various influences into believing there are different things that were not true."

I mean this was a big source of funds, rating agencies had become concerned about the ... the amount of external funding in comparison with peer banks.  And that would have put it ... started to put a lid on it.  As I said earlier, the question is whether the soft landing would have been quite as soft as we envisaged ... but I think that in the absence of that we would have managed ... we would have managed through.  But it would have been with some cost of an adjustment in the housing sector, property sector.  We were always working on the basis that the weak export sector, which other people believed that our export performance was impaired by our focus on property, that that would have improved and given its weight in the economy, on a statistical basis, might have offset some of the worst effects of any ...even soft landing adjustment in property.</p></speech>

It was based on experience, what data were available, looking at international trends, some forward looking indicators.  There were quite a few indicators that were used in the financial markets, that had very good predictive ability for GDP over one or two quarters, and I'd say that was pretty much it.</p></speech>

My answer to this ... first of all, I take on board what my two colleagues have said, but I'd like to maybe add to it, to ... I really think some of the inquiry are putting too much emphasis on these short-term forecasts, right?  I gave you a table of them so you can see how they evolved in my supplementary statement.  The banks, and other stockbrokers, love having a tame economist, but they really don't need them, because you're producing short-term forecasts which is the same as for everybody else.  There was 15 people producing short-term forecasts in Ireland and if you look at my table you'll find they're all pretty similar.  So I know I'm arguing, I probably wasted ten years of my life doing this stuff, but in the end that's about the bottom line.</p></speech>

Yes, okay.  Mr. McLaughlin, just going back to the point of commercial property housing crash, etc.  Would it be true to say that there is quite a link between them in the sense that significant commercial loans would have been given, as you clarified, for what were to be extensive residential developments, and extensive loans would have been given for what became ghost estates, so that the crash in housing did go, very much, into the commercial side, in that regard, is that true?</p></speech>

And the last question, Chair, is this.  I think it was Mr. McArdle, it was yourself, I think, at an earlier stage you were beginning to take exception to the idea that forecasts, good or bad, may have had some input in relation to the bailouts, etc. that happened, when ... that ... could I just say to you that if the bank economists had what's, wrongly called, more contrarian views, but that you warned or challenged, early in the 2000s, and secured, as a result of force of argument, a change of policy, the bailout in fact might not have been necessary.</p></speech>

One of the difficulties in the way that the guarantee was shaped, was that two years later there was going to be a funding cliff because the guarantee was going to run out.  Did any of you do any forecasting in that regard as to where your banks would be when the guarantee expired?</p></speech>

I made the point in my statement that the Irish banks' liquidity take from the ECB and ELA peaked in late 2010, early 2011, not in 2008.  I was trying to make the point briefly that a lot of things happened from 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 which, I think, are also relevant to why banks ended up losing so much money.</p></speech>

Personally, from the position that I came from within AIB, I personally don't believe that no matter how many doors I had knocked on with a contrarian view would have made much difference.  But, I regret very much that I was not more contrarian than I had been.</p></speech>

I've amended that view as time has gone by.  I think it's a valid exercise ... a useful exercise in distilling all what went on and it may even find some new facts.</p><p>Preparing for it was an arduous exercise over the last month and I hope that what we've discussed here today in some, small way will help the committee and perhaps help repay some of the debt that I probably owe to society for the various things that I said and got wrong.</p></speech>
