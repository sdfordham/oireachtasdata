However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise witnesses that the opening statements they have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after this meeting.</p><p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I extend a similar note of advice to Members.</p><p>  This session is devoted to the following agenda.  First, we are engaging in a follow-up on the joint committee's report on tackling back-to-school costs and the announcement in the Budget Statement on 15 October to establish schoolbook rental schemes.  Last June the committee launched a report on tackling back-to-school costs.  The report was prepared for the committee by Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, as rapporteur.  It was drawn up following a public consultation process which was followed by committee meetings attended by a number of main stakeholder groups.  The report made a number of recommendations directed at the Department of Education and Skills and school boards of management.  It is timely for the committee to evaluate what progress has been made on this important matter and to consider what further action is required.  The committee will have noted the announcement made by the Minister for Education and Skills earlier this week on school uniforms.</p><p>  I welcome the following representatives to the meeting: Mr. Hubert Loftus and Mr. Matt Ryan, Department of Education and Skills; Mr. Ferdia Kelly, general secretary, and Fr. Paul Connell, Joint Managerial Body; Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch, chief executive officer and Ms Deirdre Sullivan, National Parents Council Primary; and Mr. Don Myers, president, and Mr. Jim Moore, national president, National Parents Council Post-Primary.  They will all make presentations on this important matter.  I invite Mr. Loftus to make his opening remarks on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hubert Loftus" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013111300004#D00100"><p>The Department welcomes this opportunity to respond to the committee on its report on tackling back-to-school costs and the proposal to establish book rental schemes.  The report on tackling back-to-school costs highlights the financial pressures for parents associated with schooling arising from the cost of schoolbooks, school uniforms, curricular and extra-curricular activities and voluntary contributions.  The Department notes that many of the recommendations in the report focus on the role of schools and patrons.  We will outline the Department&rsquo;s perspective on these issues and any actions it is taking on them.</p><p>  The report looked at the cost of schoolbooks.  To reduce costs, it made recommendations that schoolbook rental schemes should be available in all schools and that workbooks should be banned.  The Department encourages all schools to operate schoolbook rental schemes.  In the recent budget, it was announced that the Department is to receive &euro;5 million from the proceeds of the national lottery licence transaction to allow primary schools to invest in book rental schemes.  Further investment is to take place over the next three years to support the establishment of book rental schemes in all primary schools that do not currently operate them.</p><p>  With regard to workbooks, the Department issued guidance in 2012 to all schools outlining a number of strategies to avoid the need for workbooks or to allow for workbooks to be re-used from year to year.  Effective teachers use a range of active learning approaches in the classroom rather than over-reliance on textbooks and workbooks.</p><p>  With regard to school uniforms, the report recommended that schools should be encouraged by their patron bodies to introduce generic uniforms.  The committee will be aware that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, has expressed his concern about costs incurred by parents on school uniforms.  It is important that schools take account of the wishes of parents on this issue.  Earlier this week, the Minister issued a press release requiring schools to ballot their parental community on school uniform policy.  The Department will engage with school management on that point.  It will make progress in the coming weeks.</p><p>  During the course of the school year, the Minister intends to publish his plans for a parents' charter that will strengthen in general the position of parents within our school system.  Changes to the Education Act 1998 will be important in underpinning such a charter and will form part of these proposals.</p><p>  With regard to curricular and extra-curricular activities, the committee&rsquo;s report noted that extra-curricular activities are, in theory, optional.  In practice, this is not always the case.  The report also noted that curricular activities that occur during the school day should not incur any costs to parents.  The Department's position is that schools must offer full access to the curriculum during the school day.  Compulsory additional payments cannot be sought for any in-school curriculum provision, and all pupils should have equal access to the curriculum offered.</p><p>  With regard to voluntary contributions, the report recommended that the practice of requesting voluntary contributions should be greatly discouraged, if not completely eliminated.  Any discussion about voluntary contributions and funding of schools has to be considered in the context of the Government&rsquo;s budgetary programme to reduce public expenditure to sustainable levels.  The challenge for all schools is to ensure that whatever funding is provided by the Government is used to maximum effect.  The Department's position is that, apart from the recognised fee-charging second level schools, recognised schools are not permitted to charge school fees.  Voluntary contributions by parents of pupils in such recognised schools are permissible provided it is made absolutely clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay and that, in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition.</p><p>  The timing and manner in which such voluntary contributions are sought and collected is a matter for school management.  Their collection should be such as to avoid creating a situation where either parents or pupils could reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character.  The Department has no plans to prohibit such voluntary contributions.  The committee members may be aware from the draft general scheme for an admissions to schools Bill that schools will be required to declare that no deposits, fees or contributions will be sought or charged as a condition of application for enrolment or for continued enrolment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Fr. Paul Connell" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013111300004#D00200"><p>We welcome the opportunity to speak to the committee.  We have looked at the report carefully.  We are disappointed it did not take into account much of what was said on the previous occasion.  We have sent in a written submission on this point so I will not dwell on it.  We welcome some of the initiatives with regard to the book rental scheme put in place by the Minister for primary schools.  It is indicative of where we are that most of our colleagues across Europe have books provided by the state for all pupils.  That point should be made and is perhaps glossed over.  It is Government policy that has us in the situation where books are so expensive for our parents.</p><p>  With regard to book rental schemes at second level, there is a difficulty in the sense that we have a new junior certificate programme coming in.  It does not make sense for schools with the no book rental scheme to start one right now because they will put a lot of money into something that may not be used if the junior certificate curriculum changes.</p><p>  The second thing we noted when we were here is that technology is changing rapidly.  The use of e-books is coming into schools and that solves a great deal of difficulty with regard to the weight of schoolbooks.  It also has other advantages but we need to look at the area rather than looking at something that may be obsolete in a number of years.  The committee and politicians have a role to play in this.  E-books have a prohibitive rate of 23% VAT.  We mentioned that before but there was no mention of it in the report.</p><p>  The other area that needs to be tackled is publishing.  While we commend the Minister on his charter with the publishers, we must examine the business of licensing with regard to e-books.  If parents buy books for the first child, they can be passed on to the second or third child with no difficulty.  However, publishers are insisting a new licence must be issued each time for each child.  This is scandalous and should be tackled.</p><p>  With regard to back-to-school costs across the board, we welcome the initiative taken by the Minister with regard to uniforms.  We do not have a difficulty with this because we work very closely with parents.  We do not have a difficulty because our parents are at the core of what we do.  Without the parents, we would not survive.  The submission from the Department of Education and Skills recognises that funding is limited and the reality is that, as we see from the recent ESRI report, 30% of funding comes from our parents.  Without that funding, we could not exist.  The report suggests voluntary contributions should not be allowed.  We agree, but in the current situation it is impossible and our schools could not survive without the resources our parents provide for us.  We welcome any initiative and to do otherwise would be contrary to everything we have been doing for many years.</p><p>  Outside the fee-paying sector, it is accepted that financial contributions to schools must remain voluntary and that no linkage should exist between admissions procedures and the making of such voluntary contributions.  That continues to be the case in our schools.  As schools and school managers, we are acutely aware of pressure on parents but it is delivered through Government policy, which has cut funding by 11% over the past four or five years.  It continues as an ongoing pressure.</p><p>  We welcome initiatives such as the summer works scheme being restored.  It is important to us.  We hope other schemes will be put in place.  Our schools are doing their very best for our pupils.  We strive to give them the best education possible, including extra-curricular activities.</p> <p>A wide range of extra curricular activities are available in all our schools and to all our pupils at no cost to any of them.  The impression which might be given that these things are charged for is completely erroneous in our system.</p><p> Another issue on which I would like to focus is that patrons do not run our schools.  If members read the Education Act 1998 carefully, they will see it states that it shall be the duty of a board to manage the school on behalf of the patron and for the benefit of the students and their parents and to provide or cause to be provided an appropriate education for each student at the school for which that board has responsibility.  We do not represent patrons or trustees but we support boards of management which have the responsibility for running the schools.  To suggest that patrons have a role in school uniforms is nonsense.  It is a matter for the boards of management which work very closely with parents, parents' associations and so on.</p><p> Whole community involvement in funding was mentioned in the report.  Everyone should be aware that boards of management are representative of the communities from which they come.  Our finances, reports and otherwise, are available, contrary to what was implied in the report that they are not.  They are freely available.  I encourage the committee to continue to do the good work it is doing and to encourage the downward trend in school costs.  We would maintain it is Government policy which has, unfortunately, caused a great deal of difficulty for our parents.  We are at the edge of this.  We are trying to do our best for our pupils and our parents.  We work very closely with them and will continue to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013111300005#E00200"><p>I will not read through the report because I am aware members have copies of it.  I will refer to some of the key points in it.  We very much welcome the section on culture change.  We need a culture change within schools because for many years we have campaigned about the fact that the relationship with parents in schools is often a financial one, whether it is back-to-school costs, with parents' associations effectively being fund-raising committees.  We very much support what the report says around culture.  I suppose the parents' charter will be the initial vehicle which will bring about some of that culture change and how the education system engages in dialogue with parents around their children's learning.  We cannot see any progression on that at the moment but we very much hope the parents' charter will be the vehicle that will do that.  We look forward to being engaged in the development of that charter.</p><p>  In terms of the voluntary contributions, we call for them to be completely prohibited.  When we surveyed parents on voluntary contributions, we found that 65% of the parents who responded to us were asked for voluntary contributions but 35% were not asked.  We believe in those situations where schools are not asking for voluntary contributions, more work needs to be done on how they are managing their finances and what is happening in those schools in order that we can get a better picture of why those schools are not asking their parents for voluntary contributions.  We think that could lead to some insight into what other schools could put in place to avoid them.</p><p>  We were pleased the committee took up the National Parents Council's recommendation to establish finance committees in schools.  The role of the finance committee would be very different from boards of management in schools or parents' associations, but at the moment, the parents' association seems to be the main additional funding body within a school, so if additional funding is needed, it usually finishes up with dialogue between the parents' association, the principal and the board of management.  We would like separate finance committees to be established in schools which would represent all members of the school community.  It would mean, therefore, the parents' association would not be seen as a fund-raising committee but as having a very important job in the school in terms of a peer support group to other parents in supporting their children's learning.</p><p>  We very much welcome the budget announcement of an additional &euro;5 million towards schoolbooks.  We would like to see how that will fit into the suggestion of the five year template for the delivery of an entirely free book scheme.  While we very much welcome that initial commitment, the recommendation from the committee of an entirely free book system is something towards which we should work with that &euro;5 million rather than just inputting a sum of money and in a few years' time looking back and wondering where it went.  There needs to be a structure in terms of how that delivers what we all want.</p><p>  In terms of curricular and extra-curricular activities, I hear a number of people say there should be no charge for curricular activities during the day and yet we know they are being charged for.  One of the main ones is swimming.  There are few situations where a child attends swimming and is not charged for it.  There are many other instances during the school day where parents are asked for contributions towards curriculum areas.  It is very clear from the Department that this is not allowed but what are parents to do when they are put in a situation where they are being asked for this money and, if it is not provided, the curriculum activity cannot be provided to their child or to other children in the school?</p><p>  In regard to uniform costs, we very much welcome the announcement this week by the Minister and the fact all parents in the school will have an opportunity to engage in a ballot system.  Some parents are more vocal than others, so not every parent's view is heard when parents are being consulted on an issue.  Therefore, the aspect of this where there will be a ballot of all parents is very welcome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Don Myers" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013111300005#E00300"><p>I would like to update the committee on what we submitted last May.  The cost of school uniforms is a big issue for us.  This has always been a major issue financially for parents at post-primary level.  Last April, the National Parents Council Post-Primary, the National Parents Council Primary, Barnardos and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, with the support of all the other education partners, issued a document reviewing school uniform policy.  This was also done with the support of the Minister for Education and Skills.  As the committee will be aware, the Minister announced on 11 November that the education partners will now be invited to engage with Department officials on how to implement this change which will include compiling a template questionnaire that schools can use to consult parents on uniforms.  This is very welcome and is a sign parents need to be involved.  This is a start.  The National Parents Council Post-Primary will engage in that dialogue on preparing the questionnaire.  It is long overdue and a move in the right direction.</p><p>  The cost of schoolbooks is another serious issue for the National Parents Council Post-Primary.  We are aware of bills of &euro;450 and &euro;500 for books at post-primary level.  We welcome the extra funding for book rental schemes in the primary sector and hope that funding will be put towards book rental schemes in the post-primary sector.  We are aware that in the digital era, e-books are a thing of the future.  The big thing is that, as of late, parents are starting to realise the licence for an e-book is a one year or a three year one and that when it expires, the book dissolves.  They were not aware of that until now.  There is a relatively new publisher - I have attached an appendix to the presentation for members - which has produced books at much cheaper prices, including free e-books.  My argument with the publishers is that if one publisher can do this, why can the others not do so?  I am not a teacher but I respect the fact the people who put these books together are teaching our education system.  However, I have serious issues with the cost of books.</p><p>  In regard to the transition year programme, schools are finding it difficult to maintain the service given the costs incurred.  The mission statement of transition year is to promote the personal, social, educational and vocational development of pupils and to prepare them for their role as autonomous, participative and responsible members of society.</p> <p>We would welcome help from the Department of Education and Skills on this.  We are also aware that parents, in some instances, have helped schools to run programmes which would not have been possible otherwise.  It is a known fact that programmes cannot be carried out in some schools because they do not have funding.</p><p> The voluntary contribution is a major burden on parents.  It is sought to make up for the deficit in funding from the Department.  I have a copy of a letter which was sent to a parent recently stating that her child would be enrolled in first year in September 2014, but only if she paid &euro;300 before 25 October 2013.  I cannot condone that.  It is very wrong.  The other side of the coin is that schools are strapped for cash.  Funding is not available and such requests of parents are unfortunate.  The burden is being placed on parents.  Parents are overburdened and one must ask how light the lining in their pockets will become.</p><p> I welcome the announcement by the Minister of the proposed development of a parents' charter.  We will have a big role to play in that.  Empowerment of parents will make a big difference.  Up to now parents have had no say with regard to many aspects of their children's education.  Empowering parents will also help schools.  Co-operation between all partners in education is key, going forward.  If we can work together at national level, there is no reason co-operation at local level cannot work too.  We appreciate that schools are doing their best with limited resources and we would urge Deputies to work to provide more assistance to schools.</p></speech>

I will address my initial questions to the departmental representatives.  There was an announcement this week about the resumption of the minor works scheme.  How much funding is available under that scheme this year and how does that compare with previous years?  The representatives said it is not the Department's intention to stop schools from seeking voluntary contributions.  Has the Department information on whether the contributions have increased in recent years and, if so, why?</p><p>  I have a number of questions for the representatives of the Joint Managerial Body.  Who decides whether a school will have a uniform?  Are parents in general consulted on that question?  Where a school adopts a uniform policy, are there many instances of that policy being reviewed over time?  The Department made an announcement on school uniforms earlier this week.  Was there any consultation with the JMB prior to the announcement?  I presume there was some discussion or consultation in advance of that announcement.</p><p>  Fr. Paul Connell indicated that 30% of funding comes from parents.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013111300006#F00400"><p>I ask Fr. Connell for a breakdown of that figure.  What is that funding used for?  How much of the funding comes from voluntary contributions and how much from other sources, such as fund-raising?  Fr. Connell said he was disappointed that many of the points he made at a previous meeting of this committee were not taken into account in the report.  I ask him to elaborate on that.  If voluntary contributions were no longer permitted, would it be possible to continue to run schools?  I suspect I know the answer.  At present, schools are under-funded so if we want to get rid of voluntary contributions, we need to address that issue.</p><p>  I also ask the representatives from the National Parents Council to comment further on the issue of voluntary contributions.  The data suggest 65% of schools seek voluntary contributions from parents while 35% do not.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/984" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013111300006#F00500"><p>I thank the representatives of the various bodies for coming before the committee.  Ms Lynch referred to &euro;5 million for schoolbooks and I ask Mr. Loftus to clarify an issue.  I understood that &euro;5 million would be available every year for the next three years, giving a total of &euro;15 million.  When I discussed this issue with the Minister, he said the &euro;15 million would be sufficient to ensure that every school could put a schoolbook rental scheme in place by the end of this Government's term.</p><p>  In the context of some of the comments by representatives of the JMB, I fully accept that schools are not being funded adequately by the Department and that parents are being asked to make up the shortfall.  No one will argue with that basic point.  On the question of e-books, the representatives are correct in their contention that it is our responsibility, as legislators, to deal with the issues of VAT and licensing.  We have raised this matter with the Department and there are some issues with the VAT in the context of EU law, but I fully accept it is our problem.</p><p>  I was surprised by the tone of the JMB's response to the committee today.  Fr. Connell said the committee did not take on board much of what was said during our earlier hearings, but I disagree with that point.  The committee took on board a lot of what was said at those hearings.  On the question of school uniforms, the witness said it was alarming to discover that committee members demonstrate a lack of understanding of the respective statutory roles of patrons and management boards.  He cited the Education Act of 1998, section 15 of which reads, "It shall be a duty of a board to manage a school on behalf of a patron and for the benefit of students and their parents".  In the section of the JMB submission referring to book rental schemes and the allocation of text books, it is stated the JMB is the main decision-making and negotiating body for the management authorities of almost 400 Catholic schools.  Is the JMB suggesting there is no role whatsoever for patrons in terms of school uniform policy and that it is solely up to the boards of management to make decisions on that issue?</p><p>  The JMB asserts in its submission that this committee ignored a number of significant factors impacting on school uniform decisions, one of which is the fact that more expensive jumpers and so forth are generally multi-year items, while cheaper versions require frequent replacement.  As a parent, I can tell the JMB representatives that is not the case.  My children have to get a new school uniform every year and those uniforms are damned expensive.  The school uniform consists of crested jumpers, tracksuits, coats and pinafores.  There is no option in the schools my children attend to purchase generic school uniforms.  A school jumper alone costs approximately &euro;50 and one is lucky to get a year out of it.  I do not agree that more expensive jumpers are generally multi-year items.  That is simply not the case.  I am not too sure what the witnesses mean by their assertion that we cannot rely on big department stores for continuity and I ask them to clarify that comment.</p><p>  The submission concludes by suggesting that keeping recommendations grounded in the real world would be more helpful.</p> <p>Would Fr. Connell point out the recommendations in the report that are not grounded in the real world so that the committee can take the opportunity to revisit them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1018" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013111300007#G00200"><p>The idea behind the report was to move the debate on the cost of going back to school away from an annual airing by journalists in August and September which is then forgotten about to a constructive pragmatic approach to the annual struggle that families face to meet these costs.  Nobody is denying that the funding to schools has decreased in the past number of years as a result of the crisis in the public finances.  The joint committee is trying to open up the conversation on the issue of back-to-school expenses.  We launched the report in June and have invited the relevant bodies to come before us again.</p><p>  There have been welcome initiatives.  The decision on admissions policies is welcome.  I hope the payment of an enrolment deposit will be outlawed.  The recommendations on the school book rental scheme have been well rehearsed.  An announcement on school uniforms was made during the week.  </p><p>  An issue that I would like the panel to respond to is the competition between schools.  There are 4,000 schools throughout the State in a country with a population similar to that of Manchester.  Obviously schools are under pressure to boost their enrolment figures.  As a consequence, schools must present themselves to be more appealing to the parent body.  That is the reason extracurricular activities are put to the fore, crested jumpers come into play, and iPads are all the rage.  I would like to hear the witnesses' reaction to that.</p><p>  I think many of the suggestions that have been made are sound.  We must have a deeper discussion on how schools are funded.  The reason for introducing a finance committee into the mix was to give a clear picture of the financial constraints or pressures on an individual school and whether the money is spent appropriately.  If a school does not have the resources to provide heat and light there is obviously a fundamental problem with the funding mechanism of the school and that has to be made known and transparent.  The Department must be made to take responsibility for fixing it.  It should not necessarily be the case that a school should have to have a fundraiser.  The body that has responsibility in this area must deal with the issue.  </p><p>  Following on from Deputy O'Brien's comments, I too am disappointed with the submission from the JMB.  We are trying to develop a collaborative approach to finding answers.  The tone of the JMB document is all wrong; it is bordering on sarcastic, and I do not think it is constructive.  There is a leadership vacuum in the JMB.  If the members of this committee were to take a similar attitude in the topics we deal with, nothing would ever be done.  To suggest that the JMB has no voice when it comes to a policy on uniforms would strike most committee members and parents as bizarre.  We all know and accept that schools are under pressure.  We also know that parents are under pressure.  It is the responsibility of all of us to try to find solutions.  For the JMB to produce a document which in my view is dripping in sarcasm, to offer no concrete, practical, positive or generous solutions and to suggest that the committee is not living in the real world and to abnegate responsibility for the cost of uniforms that are being used by individual schools under the patronage of JMB is surprising.  If that is to be the level of engagement with the committee, I ask the JMB to revisit and be a little bit more generous the next time its representatives come before us.  This issue will not go away.</p></speech>

A total of &euro;28 million will issue to primary schools in the coming weeks.  That is the same level of funding as issued previously.  The make-up of that grant is a standard base amount of around &euro;5,500 and a per-capita amount on top of that for each pupil, with a minimum threshold for those schools that have fewer than 60 pupils.  It is the same as previous years.</p><p>  On the question of voluntary contributions, we said in our statement that it is not our policy and we do not have plans to stop voluntary contributions, but the Department policy is very clear that voluntary contributions are, as they state, voluntary.  We do not have specific data in the Department on the levels of voluntary contributions.  I know that public surveys have been conducted.  I know the National Parents' Council in its submission today stated that 65% of parents are asked for a voluntary contribution and 35% of parents are not asked for a voluntary contribution.</p><p>  Deputy O'Brien asked that we clarify the schoolbook rental scheme.

Paul Connell" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013111300007#G01100"><p>I will address a number of the points raised.  First, I very much regret the comment that our presentation was somehow sarcastic.  That would never have been our intention.  We respect the work of this committee and we all have the same goal in view, which is to provide the best education for our pupils while keeping the costs as low as possible for everybody.  That is our drive.  The last statement in our submission was that recommendations should be grounded in the real world.  One of the four main points as identified by Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in was a recommendation for the complete prohibition of voluntary contributions.  While we agree with that statement absolutely, and we hope it will come to pass eventually, in the real world, as the Deputy said himself, schools cannot survive without the voluntary contributions of the parents of our students.</p><p>  Deputy McConalogue asked what use is made of the voluntary contributions.  Our funding from parents comes from two elements: fundraising, and the actual voluntary contribution that we seek from parents after their children have been enrolled in our school, not as a condition of enrolment.  That distinction is very important to us.  It is completely voluntary.  To put it in perspective, yesterday I paid &euro;19,000 for oil for my school.  Last year oil cost us &euro;32,000 for the school year.  I would not have been able to pay that oil bill if I did not have the voluntary contributions from the parents of the students in my school.  That is reality I live with.  I report to a board of management, which is responsible for the finances of the school and must stay within budget.  There are no bailouts.  We must stay within certain parameters.  If we cannot get the money from the Department, we have to raise it from the parents.  There is no other way of doing it.  That is the reality.</p><p>  On the issue of patronage, the JMB represents the boards of management of our schools and not the patrons.  That is a misunderstanding.  The JMB does not represent the patrons and we are not here on their behalf.</p> <p>We are here on behalf of the boards of management of voluntary secondary schools across the country.  The boards of management make the decisions.  That function is delegated to them by the patrons in each of our schools.  Those boards are representative of the community and of parents.  They make the decisions about the running of the school in conjunction with the parents.</p><p> I wish to respond to Deputy McConalogue's question.  I am the principal of St. Finian's College in Mullingar, which was a boarding school until 2002.  We phased out the boarding element of our activities and became a co-educational school.  We did not have a uniform up to that point.  When we polled the incoming parents, 98% of them voted in favour of having a uniform.  That has been the position ever since.  We regularly consult the parents in each of our schools with regard to decisions being taken in the school.  While many of our parents' associations have started to help us to fund our schools, the role of the parents' council is entirely different from that of a fundraising body.  Rather than acting as a fundraising body, the parents' council assists the school in teaching, learning and communicating with parents.  It is vitally important to us to keep that communication open.  While fundraising is necessary, it does not necessarily have to be done by the parents' council, and often is not.</p><p> I was also asked about competition between schools.  Again, I would like to ground this in the real world.  During the Celtic tiger era, when things were very good in this country, education was not funded to the extent that it should have been.  Matters have got worse in recent years, since the budgetary crisis started.  All of our classes in all of our schools are at maximum sizes.  The pupil-teacher ratio continued to get worse until this year when, happily, it was not touched.  We welcome the decision not to interfere with the pupil-teacher ratio in last month's budget.  It is important to realise that many things have been happening in schools.  For example, guidance counsellors have been taken out.  If there is pressure on schools to have certain numbers - that may be an issue in some schools - I suggest that funding is an issue in that context.  We have small schools that are finding it hard to survive.  They do not know where they will get the money to do things by the middle of the year.  That is a very bad situation to be in.  I would like to make the point, in the context of what has been said about crested jumpers and iPads, that the goal of schools is to provide the best education possible for our children.  That is what we try to do.  We continuously have to deal with curriculum reform and change things for the better.  That is what the Department is doing.  We all try to do it together.</p></speech>

Connell.  I must express some dismay at Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's comments about our submissions to this body.  We have always treated it with the utmost respect.  I am looking at the submission on this topic that we made here on 10 October 2012.  We pointed out the reality of the financial situation in our schools.  We mentioned that between 30% and 33% of everything that is spent in voluntary secondary schools is raised locally.  That is done out of necessity rather than out of desire.  We also commended the return of the summer works scheme, the efforts of the National Procurement Service in saving money and the Minister's agreement with the book publishers on a code of practice, with specific reference to the five-year moratorium on changing books.  We acknowledged the publication of the draft guidelines on book rental schemes.  We pointed to the value and benefits of information technology as a learning tool.  We called for the abolition of the 23% VAT rate.  We raised an issue with regard to licences.  On the issue of uniforms, we acknowledged in our submission that "the cost of uniforms must be kept to a minimum and this can be achieved at local school level through a process of consultation on issues such as the style and content of the uniform [and] best value in sourcing the uniform".  We spoke about the key value of management, teachers and, most particularly, parents working together in the local school community to ensure the best possible education and, as Mr. Loftus has said, the best possible use of the resources.  That is a quick summary of our submission.  I am dismayed that Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has suggested that we were negative in tone or adopted an approach that was not appropriate in some way.  In our response to last July's publication of the report on tackling back-to-school costs, we did not intend to set out to be sarcastic - we intended to portray the reality.</p></speech>

As I have said before, it is good that the patrons are at arm's length from school management.  I would not welcome their interference in the management of the various aspects of school affairs because that would allow a hard line to be taken on ethos or some other matter.  It is just as well that they are at arm's length.  A great deal of work has been put into this good report.</p><p>  I would like to raise a couple of issues.  I would not like to be marking one of the people in attendance on the football field because if I gave him one rap, he would give me four back.  Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch raised the issue of money being paid for activities such as swimming and music.  I have mixed feelings on the matter.  I noticed that Mr. Loftus initially used the term "should not" but he later used the term "must not".  It is like the driving test.  I wonder whether there is wriggle room in schools.  Are there sanctions if charges are imposed?  I believe the very small amount paid by pupils for swimming in schools - perhaps &euro;5 per lesson - has saved a great deal of lives.  By providing this for a few bob, schools have saved many lives.  Many children who otherwise would never have learned to swim have been taught how to swim and how to deal with being in the water.  I feel there must be a wee balance in this regard.  There is an ideal situation.</p> <p>There is a practical day-to-day situation in the real world and we must work through that as well.  I would not take a hard line on those issues.</p><p> As regards school uniforms, there are more jumpers and shirts found in the lost property boxes of schools at the end of the year which, if redistributed, would not have to be bought the following year.  I was a school principal for a while and decided there would be no crest on the school uniform.  School uniforms are fabulous.  They stop fashion shows.  School uniforms are good and they are cheaper.  Even the dearest school uniform is cheaper than other clothes that children have to wear during the school year.  We did not have a school crest and I am proud to say my former school still does not have a crest.  It is the only primary school in Louth that does not have a crest.  Eventually things come into fashion.  At the moment schools are providing a Ferrari for the cost of a Ford Focus because that is all that is available.  I have a Ford Focus and that is the reason I mention that.  The schools are proving a great education.  Fr. Paul Connell said this is Government policy.  I believe Government policy in education is good.  Although I am a Fine Gael Senator, I believe the Labour Party Minister for Education and Science is doing a hell of a job with the resources available to him and did not increase the pupil-teacher ratio in most schools.  He played a blinder at Cabinet level.  I do not know how he got away with it.  He deferred it and then got it, but it is gone now.</p><p> The return of the minor works grants is the best news ever because schools will be able to pay for minor works and will be able to pay the oil bill next year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.45" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1154" speakername="Averil Power" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013111300009#J00200"><p>I will be brief.  I wish to ask one question and make a comment.  Much of the debate has been around a form of words which were used in a report.  It is important that this is done in a collegiate way.  It is fair to acknowledge that it is not the committee's job to fund schools but it is its job to give a balanced report of why schools are in the present situation.  We need to work on amending the wording to ensure we reflect that because principals are working in a difficult situation, as are all school staff, as a result of other funding cuts.  They are at the front line and must deal every day with parents of children, bills they cannot pay, fund-raising and asking parents for money for which they wish they did not have to ask.  We need to find a way around this difficulty.  I acknowledge the work Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has put into this report on which he has been working for a long time.  We need to find a form of words that can accommodate everybody and recognise that is the other half of the picture.  It is not fair for us to criticise schools without acknowledging they are working in an environment where they have seen their funding cut quite dramatically.</p><p>  I wish to put one question to the Department officials.  If I do not get to hear their response I will read it in the transcript.  A good point was made on e-books, a point we have discussed previously at the committee.  There does not appear to have been any move by the Government to address the issue of technology.  Some schools will look at this and ask what is the point in buying a load of books if nobody will be using them in two years time.  There is good practice for buying not just iPads, which are expensive, but other tablets can be bought quite cheaply.  We are in a bizarre situation where it can sometimes cost more to buy a book electronically than a new paper copy of that same book.  That is crazy. We have to find a way through that.  Within schools we should be at the forefront of technological change and ensuring we use it to educational advantage.  It addresses all the other issues we have discussed previously about children carrying heavy schoolbags and so on.  I appreciate that the VAT rate is an issue for the Department of Finance.  I know there are European implications and so on, but I would like to see more of a push on it at departmental level.  Is this an issue that has been discussed by the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Finance in the context of budget discussions or elsewhere?  It is an important point and a solution to many issues, and it should be recognised as such.  In our report I would hope we would make a recommendation that the e-books issue be pushed strongly.</p></speech>

I echo the comments of my colleagues in commending Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in on his work in this area.  It is an area in which he has a huge interest and he has dedicated much of his time to it.  I commend him on doing that.</p><p>  I wish to focus on two areas, uniforms and books.  In regard to uniforms, I was travelling from Glenbeigh to Caherciveen on Monday evening doing my clinic round and listening to George Hook interviewing the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  It was quite an interesting interview.  The issue of the tracksuit came up and George Hook said what a practical uniform it can be.  I would have to agree with him.  I remember my days in primary school when there was no uniform but usually a tracksuit was worn to school.  It was a very practical and adaptable form of clothing.  One could be sliding around in the muck playing soccer or football and a few minutes later in the classroom the muck could be brushed off and one would be dry.  It is a very affordable uniform for parents.  We need to be practical in the way we look at how we dress children going to school.  That is an issue that should be examined.  The day of the one or two shops being the only shops providing a very formal uniform with a crest are long gone.  We need to modernise and be sensible in our approach to this issue.</p><p>  In regard to schoolbooks, I welcome that the State is intervening and assisting in the rental schemes.  That is a positive development.  I am concerned that we are not getting the bang for our buck that we could be getting.  Mr. Don Myers mentioned, rightly, the substantial difference in costs of textbooks from the various suppliers.  It is important to point out-----</p></speech>

One particular company provides books in physics for leaving certificate students at &euro;17.95 while other competitors charge &euro;36.99.  It caters for the same curriculum and covers more or less the same issues.  It is used in some schools, in a small percentage of the market, and is an excellent book.  Similarly in the maths area, books cost &euro;15.50 versus &euro;29.50.  For construction studies, books costs from &euro;19.95 versus &euro;37.95.  Geography books cost &euro;19.95 versus &euro;34.95.  These are significant price differentials.</p><p>  There is a need to communicate this information to schools and if there is a fear among schools that new entrants to the market may not be up to standard or, perhaps because of a lack of familiarity, teachers are reluctant to go for new books, we should consider introducing a standard, a quality mark, from the Department of Education and Skills to textbooks that meet certain standards.  That would be a sensible way forward.  We have standards in restaurants, accommodation and various food items.  That would help teachers make decisions when choosing textbooks that are up to standard.  As far as I am aware there are no textbooks on the market that are not up to standard.  They are all up to standard but there are substantial price differences.  New entrants find it hard to get into the market because they do not have the same reputation.</p> <p> We need to look at this.  I raised this issue with the Minister previously and was referred to the guidelines in regard to how to operate schoolbook rental schemes.  There is not enough emphasis in the guidelines on encouraging teachers and those choosing textbooks to shop around for better value for money.  A potential 50% saving could be made in certain subject areas for schools and parents.  In some cases, the cost of buying the book from the alternative source is only slightly more than what it would cost through the book rental scheme.  This gives food for thought.</p><p> What is the view of the Department on how we could encourage better competition and on how to encourage teachers and those choosing textbooks to shop around and go for better value books?  A concern I have is that when a school enters a scheme, it is locked into that scheme for a number of years.  This is a barrier to emerging companies that are offering better value for money.  What is the view of the witnesses on that?</p></speech>

My first question is directed at Mr. Loftus.  I welcome the report and the further allocation of funds in the budget for the book rental scheme at primary level.  While I understand there are many constraints with regard to the roll-out of the book rental scheme at second level, are there any plans or discussions with regard to rolling out such a plan for second level schools?  I have taught in both a vocational school and in a voluntary secondary school.  The vocational school operated a book rental scheme and I found it more economical.  Students seemed to take greater care of the books because they had to hand them back at the end of the year in good order.  Senator D'Arcy mentioned school jumpers being left lying around at the end of the year.  In my 25 years teaching I have seen schoolbooks left lying around by students who had no respect for them at all.  Significant savings could be made in this area.  Are there any plans for rolling out the book rental scheme at second level?  I understand the issues that will arise with such a scheme, but we should collaborate and consider it.</p><p>  I am and have been a strong advocate of school uniforms over the years.  As a parent of five children, I know the cost of school uniforms with crests is significant.  I welcome the initiative being introduced by the Minister for Education and Skills and would give him an A1 for his effort in this area.  This is an initiative that should have been introduced years ago.  Fr. Connell referred to two particular clothing shops and implied that cheaper means a poorer quality.  I disagree.  Great quality can be obtained at a lower cost.  Some of my children were required to have a crested polo shirt for PE, at five times the price a normal polo shirt of equal quality was available elsewhere.  I find this unacceptable.  Parents are concerned about this and some have come to me to express their concerns that some schools have a policy of insisting uniforms are bought from specific shops.  I welcome the announcement made the other day in this regard.</p><p>  I understand the view expressed by Fr. Connell and Mr. Kelly and understand the difficulties with regard to instituting a new book rental scheme in secondary schools.  I have read through the lengthy task list they provided and appreciate it involves significant extra work at both the start and the end of the year.  How much work would be involved throughout the year?  I do not believe we should say "no" to a book rental scheme at second level because of the extra work involved.  What additional requirements are necessary to implement such a scheme?</p><p>  Does the JMB believe, as expressed in its submission, that it is Government policy to grossly underfund education?  I may be incorrect, but a comment the witnesses made was that it is Government policy to make books expensive.  What is the JMB's view on in this regard?  I may have taken this up wrongly, but I noted it at the time.</p><p> With regard to the link between parents and the JMB, it is stated in the submission that schools and parents should not be adversaries.  I agree.  While there were many positive comments on the management of schools in the recent chief inspector's report, it stated in the report that only 56% of parents surveyed during the inspections in 2012 indicated that the board of management reported annually to them on the work of the school.  This is something that needs to be addressed.  Only 44% of the parents surveyed that the schools regularly sought parental views on school matters.  The JMB has stated that accounts from the board of management are freely available.  What measures are in place to make parents aware that board of management accounts are available?  Sometimes parents do not even know their parental representatives on the board of management, not to mind having access to the accounts.</p></speech>

Deputy McConalogue asked about voluntary contributions, so perhaps we can have a response on that.  I hope Ms Lynch has taken note of the many other questions asked.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.52" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013111300010#K00400"><p>I have, and I will do my best to answer them.  We conducted a survey on voluntary contributions over a two week period at the beginning of this year and received responses from 900 parents.  The first important point to emerge from the survey was that 35% of schools did not ask for voluntary contributions.  This gives rise to the question as to what happens in those schools.  Another point that arose was that a significant number of parents felt they were put under pressure to pay the voluntary contribution and that they did not feel it was voluntary.</p><p>  There is a direction from the Department on the issue of voluntary contributions, but it is a bit like the curriculum issue where although the direction says one thing, when something else happens, there appears to be no sanction.  What happens to make a change?  Currently, there is no real direction.   People contact us sometimes and we refer them to back to the school, pointing out that insisting on a contribution is unacceptable in the context of the Department's direction.  If the school does not respond to that, there is little parents can do within the school, even at a collective parent association level.</p><p>  We must acknowledge that parents have children in the school and they will only go so far to cause friction because they must leave their child in that school every day.  They might raise an issue collectively or individually, but they will only go so far with it.  This happens with many issues brought to us.  People come to us, particularly when they have received a first, second and third letter asking for the voluntary contribution.</p> <p>Sometimes the colour of the writing in the letter changes.  Sometimes the child is given the letter in school and it is quite clear how the letters have been allocated.  It becomes increasingly difficult for the parent to engage with the school around education.  A parent might receive three reminder letters about not paying a voluntary contribution.  For a parent who might not have been able to pay for the swimming and whose child might be wearing half of the uniform, the dynamic is very different at the parent teacher meeting in October, if the parent goes at all.  We raised this issue at the first meeting here.  We do not believe schools set out to cause difficulties for parents, but because of the current financial situation the nature of the dialogue creates difficulty.  We are trying to create solutions without additional funding, although the solution is additional funding.  There is tension in the school system because schools feel they are not adequately funded.  That is not a tension with the Department but it is a Government issue.  There is a tension between schools and parents about getting that additional funding from somewhere.</p><p> We suggest setting up a finance committee that would change the dynamic from a very individual dialogue between a parent group and a school group to a more collective discussion.  This issue will not go away because, although 35% of schools may not be asking for voluntary contributions, we have anecdotal information that fund-raising has increased in those schools.  That becomes a collective responsibility because individual families are not asked directly but it is still a huge pressure and parents tell us they will not join parents' associations because they know that if they do they will be asked to raise money and they do not feel comfortable doing that.  As a national parents' association - I know our colleagues in the post-primary area are doing the same thing - we are trying to promote parents' associations as bodies that support children's learning and engagement with the school, as the joint managerial body, JMB, said.  If parents will not go near them because they feel they are fund-raising bodies that works directly against that mission, which research has shown is very important.  </p><p> In response to the question about competition between schools and appealing to parents with an iPad or extracurricular activities, when parents decide where to send their children to school they will look for the obvious differences between schools.  They will decide on the basis of distinctions such as iPads or extracurricular activities.  We hope schools would make distinctions based on transparency and openness, on working with parents and supporting children's learning so that parents would decide on that basis, rather than on whether the school uses iPads.  If schools use that form of dialogue, parents may engage at a different level rather than saying an iPad or an extracurricular activity makes the difference.  There is work to be done to educate both sides about the types of things that would differentiate between schools.</p><p> In response to the question about swimming lessons and how many lives they have saved, we would never say the extracurricular activities for which there is a charge are not useful.  We regard swimming as very useful and we have supported its inclusion in the curriculum.  There is no curriculum activity that should be charged for during the school day, regardless of its use.  If it is part of the curriculum, it must be provided as such.  Just as schools would not charge for the core curriculum subjects, they should not charge for music or swimming or any of the other curriculum subjects that are required.</p><p> I think the Department clarified the point about the schoolbook rental scheme and the &euro;5 million per year.  The &euro;5 million a year over three years will provide seed capital for the establishment of book rental schemes.  That is very different from having a free book scheme.  I am concerned that &euro;15 million over three years is a large sum of money to put into schoolbooks.  Where will they go?  Schoolbook rental schemes can be very different beasts in different schools, depending the number of parents involved, how many books they cover and how many are included.  We welcomed the recommendation for free schoolbooks, and believe this should be part of the framework working towards free books.  We would like that &euro;15 million to be put into that framework in order that it will happen in five years' time rather than turn around then and say, "Oh but we have book rental schemes".  We are not in any way down-playing the huge investment, we would just like to see how the framework continues to make sure that in five years' time those books are within the system and are being used free of charge.</p></speech>

There is no such thing as a school that does not get a contribution from a parent in some shape or form.  In our experience many schools do quite well in managing the parent who is not in a position to meet those demands.  Underpinning all of these discussions is an effective school community which will survive only when parents, staff and management work together.  That is utopian from the point of view of trying to achieve certain things in the short term but much good work is going on.  One of the difficulties for us is promoting what is good practice, making sure that parents are not isolated because of their inability to pay the subscription for which they are asked.  We all agree that no subscription should be required.  The isolation of parents is a particularly serious problem because in every other aspect of education we are asking for more parental engagement.  A chief inspector's report, which was commented on recently, referred to parents' associations communicating with parents, and boards of management communicating down to parents' associations.  That is where there is a big gap.  How do you overcome that?  We are a national body, primary and post-primary, trying to get parents to engage and we are being presented with obstacles that will create a greater divide if we are not careful.  That is very important.</p><p>  Voluntary subscriptions - the level of them, what they are spent on, transparency, etc - are a huge problem.  We would welcome the minimisation of that activity but we also want to acknowledge what is going on.  It is very important for parents to be involved in the financing of schools.  All too often we find the parents' associations being treated as fund raisers. We are trying to change the culture to one of effective school communities.  For example, post-primary schools are not included in the last budgetary recommendation for the book rental scheme.  The argument will be made that there is to be a new junior cycle, but we need to plan for that.  We need to make sure the transition to a new structure is effective.  That will be a serious problem because there is a momentum to get this in place but do we have the wheels under the wagon to make sure it is delivered in every school?</p><p>  The schoolbook rental scheme does exist in post-primary schools.  In some schools it survives only as far as junior cycle.  Some schools are very effective and apply it up to senior cycle.  We have had presentations from schools around the country that are prepared to show other parents' associations how well they can operate.  One school in particular has more than 800 students and the school management delivers a book rental scheme to each student.  Parents go to the school with their children in August to set this up and to make it work.  There is good practice but parents need to be empowered and equipped for that.</p><p>  Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy made an interesting comment about lost property and school uniforms.  There is a lost property department in every school.  I attended a school parents' association meeting last March and the parents asked the principal where was the lost property department.  They were then shown all the jumpers and jackets that were kept there.  They took them home, washed them and came back in and displayed them in the school for a day.  In some cases, students suddenly discovered where they had left their jumpers and there was a group of parents who were delighted to avail of the unclaimed good quality clothing.</p> <p>This was a small activity which had a significant impact on the school environment.  The pressure on parents is isolating a great number who will not come forward to parents' associations because it will mean getting involved in this type of struggle which they also have to deal with in their own homes.  We cannot let this run forever.  We need to be careful and aware of the pressure on parents.</p></speech>

We had done some work on this matter last year to produce some estimates and costings.  We estimated that to have a scheme like that at both primary and post-primary level would cost between &euro;35 million and &euro;45 million over a three year period.  We do not have that kind of funding.  The &euro;5 million we are getting in 2014 and for the following two years only allows us to do it at primary level.  That is the current situation and it is a resource issue.</p><p>  Deputy Griffin referred to textbooks and the variation in cost between different publishers.  While I acknowledge this is the case, the decision as to what textbooks are to be used is done at school level and it is not a diktat from the Department.  In essence, the school is free to source its books from whatever publisher it wishes.  If a publisher anywhere can provide books of equal value at a much cheaper cost, I suggest that schools should be going there.</p></speech>

We also advocate that similar collaborative work should be done at local level such as conversations around book schemes, uniforms and any other issues that arise.  I will explain to Senator Moran that boards of management in our sector are obliged under the articles of management to issue an agreed report from each meeting.  Mr. Jim Moore made the point about communication.  We remind the boards of management repeatedly about the importance of an agreed report being issued to the parents' council and to the teachers.  Likewise, we have issued a template to the wider school community for the reporting of annual school accounts.  We remind schools that this should be regular reporting.  We participate in communication processes, as we did in April with the National Parents' Council, as mentioned by Mr. Don Myers.  We were signatories to the document that went to all schools seeking a review of the uniform policy.</p></speech>

There are difficulties in communicating from the parents' council level to the parents in the wider community or the engagement or otherwise of parents.  The key point is the education of young people and we must work together to ensure young people get the best possible education.  We will take on board suggestions that are made in this committee and in other places and in our work with the National Parents' Council Post-Primary to ensure that because that is what we are striving to do at national and local level.</p></speech>

The second level school I attended was very innovative because my first school uniform was a 1960s Aer Lingus cabin crew uniform which the school had bought in a junkyard sale as a means of helping parents.  That was at the end of the 1970s.</p><p>  I will finish this section of the meeting by thanking all our guests.

Today's meeting is a pre-Council meeting briefing.  The European Union Education, Youth Culture and Sport Council brings together education, culture, youth and communications Ministers on three or four occasions annually.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, will attend such a Council meeting on 25 and 26 November 2013 in Brussels.  The meeting will address the issues of leadership in education, European and higher education in the world, open education resources and digital learning.  I welcome the Minister and his officials to the meeting.  He will brief members on the meeting and respond to questions from members.  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.74" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013111300012#M02000"><p>I thank the Chairman.  Members of the committee have been circulated with the information note prepared by the Department on the agenda for the next Council of Education Ministers meeting on 25 November 2013.  I will represent Ireland at the Council meeting, the only one being held under the Lithuanian Presidency.</p> <p>The Council, which is part of the education, youth culture and sports configuration, is normally held three times per year, with Ministers for each of the areas other than education attending for their respective segments.</p><p> At the meeting Ministers will adopt two sets of Council conclusions on the topics of, first, effective leadership in education and, second, the global dimension of European higher education.  The incoming Greek Presidency of the EU will also update the Council on its plans in the area of education and training for its Presidency in the first half of next year.  The meeting will close with the policy debate on open educational resources and digital learning.</p><p> I would like to provide some context as to the overall architecture of EU co-operation in education and training.  The intent of all texts is to progress the overall agenda set by the EU 2020 strategy for growth and development agreed by the European Council Heads of State and Government in June 2010.  They will also progress the agenda of Education and Training 2020, referred to as ET2020, which is the  strategic framework for European co-operation in education and training up to 2020 agreed by Ministers for Education in May 2009.  The education committee, which is the working group of officials who prepare the agenda for the Council, has negotiated and agreed the content of these texts.  The Department's officials present have actively contributed to this process.</p><p> Following on from Ireland's successful Presidency in the area of education and training, where we succeeded in reaching agreement between the member states, the European Parliament and the European Commission on what is now known as Erasmus+, the European Union's new Programme for Education, Training, Youth and Sport 2014-2020, I am delighted to see that the current Lithuanian Presidency is continuing an initiative we introduced in regard to policy debates which we found worked very well.  This involves the continuing use of the inner table of the Council chamber to facilitate more open debate, inviting two external experts to participate in the policy debate and requesting delegations to contribute to a free-flowing, unscripted debate accompanied by limited speaking time for each intervention.  By way of illustration, members should imagine a configuration approximately ten times the size of this room where the Ministers alone sit in the inner circle without two or three officials on either side.  The debate is much more about face contact and eye-to-eye engagement.  There is greater engagement because people are making speeches, one cannot see the person at the far end of the room and when the speech is made, they leave.  It reintroduces a sense of discussion and dialogue similar to the physical spatial relationship we have in this room.</p><p> I will provide more detailed information on each of the agenda items for discussion.  The Council conclusions on effective leadership in education proposed for agreement by the Lithuanian Presidency are a response to proposals within the European Commission's Rethinking Education communication in which member states were invited to revise and strengthen the professional profile of the teaching professions, including school leaders.  Member states were asked to enhance support to educational leaders, make educational leadership more attractive and promote innovative approaches to effective educational leadership.  The Commission and member states are jointly asked to promote co-operation and innovation in educational leadership, make best use of EU programmes, support educational leadership and strengthen support for national and regional networks of stakeholders dealing with that leadership.</p><p> Ireland supported the conclusions and updated the education committee on developments in the area in Ireland, most notably the work of networks of school principals and deputy principals in Ireland, known as NAPD, the Irish Primary Principals' Network, and the range of professional development programmes for school leaders provided by the professional development service for teachers, PDST, within the Department.  These are as follows: Misneach is a programme of induction for newly appointed principals; Spreagach is for principals or deputy principals delivered in collaboration with the NAPD and designed primarily for school leaders who have not had the opportunity to engage in a structured CPD programme; Forbairt is a capacity building programme for experienced school leaders; Torao&iacute;cht is a postgraduate diploma in educational leadership; and T&aacute;naiste is an induction programme for recently appointed deputy principals and acting principals.  There are more than 1,100 participants in these programmes annually.  The programmes are delivered by a combination of serving principals who are either associates or local facilitators and retired principals and deputy principals.</p><p> Ministers will adopt Council conclusions on the global dimension of European higher education.  The conclusions are a response to the recent Commission communication, entitled European higher education in the world, and take note of the recent Commission communication, entitled Opening up Education: innovative teaching and learning for all through new technologies and open educational resources.  The conclusions ask member states and the Commission to take a number of actions to increase internationalisation among staff and students of member states' higher education institutions.</p><p> Member states are specifically asked to pursue comprehensive strategic approaches towards internationalisation; promote international degree and credit mobility for students and mobility of staff; promote digital learning; and promote the creation of partnerships among institutions as a means of reinforcing institutional capacity in education.  The Commission is asked, first, to support members states' efforts through their programmes such as Erasmus+ and Horizon 2020; second, to promote the attractiveness and the diversity of European higher education institutions; and third, to promote higher education co-operation and development between the EU and its global partners.</p><p> Ireland is very active in this area, and at working group meetings in Brussels, officials from the Department provided information on Ireland's international education strategy, entitled Investing in Global Relationships: Ireland's International Education Strategy 2010-15.  This strategy is being reviewed, the outcome of which will be a revised Government action plan for the promotion of international education.</p><p> As the Chairman will be aware, international education is an issue I have prioritised during my time as Minister.  A global economy such as ours requires an internationally oriented education system which benefits both Irish and international learners.  In the past year I have visited China and Brazil, leading missions to promote Ireland as a centre of international education.  We are making significant progress in these and other markets.  Brazil is a major success story for Ireland and more than 1,200 Brazilian students are in Ireland on Brazilian Government scholarships under its Science Without Borders programme.  Last week we also got positive news from the United States where we have seen a 9% growth in American students coming to Ireland to study in this year.  It is vital we build on this momentum, and that is the motivating force behind the review the Department is undertaking.</p><p> The Greek Minister for Education will deliver a presentation on the priorities of the upcoming Greek Presidency of the EU in education and training.  Greece has not yet finalised its programme but it has indicated that it expects to focus on quality assurance, social cohesion and innovative education, with Council conclusions on innovative higher education and on quality assurance at all levels of education and teacher training.</p><p> It is customary for the ministerial debate to take place as the last item on the agenda.  My Lithuanian counterpart, Minister Dainius Pavalkis, has informed us that discussion will continue through lunch as well.  The debate will build on the European Commission's recent communication, entitled On Opening up Education: Innovative teaching and learning for all through new Technologies and Open Educational Resources.  It is an opportunity for us, as Ministers for Education, to consider the challenges and opportunities posed by digital distance learning tools such as open educational resources and massive open online courses known as MOOCs.  This is an important issue as it is considered that the EU is in danger of falling behind other regions of the world in this regard.</p><p> The Lithuanian Presidency has invited two external experts to introduce and respond to the debate.  This is in line with a format we introduced during Ireland's Presidency.  The first is a man called Uschi Schreiber, a global government and public sector leader with the international consultancy firm Ernst &amp;amp; Young.  The second is Professor Giovanni Azzone, rector of the Politecnico di Milano in Italy.  This illustrates the cross-sectoral nature of the debate.  We will be joined also by Commissioner Vice President Neelie Kroes, responsible for the digital agenda for Europe, and the Commissioner for education, training and youth, Androulla Vassiliou, will participate.</p><p> As Ministers we will be invited to outline the overall approach being adopted at national level towards open educational resources and, in particular, to share ideas on how issues such as quality assessment and the recognition of competences acquired by these means may be addressed.  Ministers will also be invited to indicate how action at EU level might provide added value in this process.</p><p> To encourage an interactive and free-flowing debate, Ministers are asked to make unscripted interventions and to speak for no longer than two minutes during each intervention.  This was the approach I initiated when I chaired the Education Council in February of this year.</p> <p>It resulted in some very open, informative and free-flowing discussion.  I was pleased to note that several of my Irish ministerial colleagues emulated this practice at Council meetings held during Ireland's Presidency.</p><p> As stated, the Presidency intends that the debate will continue over lunch and a Norwegian minister - obviously, Norway is not part of the European Union but it is part of the extended European family - has been invited to contribute another perspective at that stage.  I look forward to a productive meeting of the Council of Education Ministers.  I am happy to answer any questions which members may wish to pose.</p></speech>

I also thank the Minister for providing the committee with a briefing in advance of the Council meeting in respect of what will be on the agenda.  I must inform him that I will be obliged to leave for the D&aacute;il in a few moments.</p><p>  Will the Minister indicate the number of meetings that were held during Ireland's Presidency and outline the issues discussed at them?  Will he comment on our performance in the context of internationalisation?  The uptake in this regard is lower than in other countries.  The language barrier cannot be cited because this applies elsewhere.  Will the Minister indicate how the position in this regard might be improved?  I am aware a great deal of work is being done in the context of the report relating to this matter at present.  Will the Minister comment on those from Ireland who study their entire courses abroad?  The latter has become more prevalent in recent times.  Students who cannot obtain entry to particular courses here go to other countries to pursue such courses.  As a result of the fact that they are entitled to avail of the same terms and conditions as their counterparts in those countries, they are often obliged to pay less for their preferred courses than would be the case here.</p><p>  At our previous meeting, the subject of the VAT charged on electronic schoolbooks, or e-books, arose.  At present, VAT is charged on such electronic versions of schoolbooks but it is not charged on printed versions.  Reference was made to the fact that a difficulty exists in this regard in the European context.  Will the Minister comment on the position in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.78" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/984" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013111300014#O00300"><p>I thank the Minister for attending and I wish him well at the upcoming Council meeting.  Deputy McConalogue has covered most of the issues.  I wish to comment on one interesting statistic contained in some of the briefing material in respect of nine year olds who are studying in highly digital classroom settings.  The EU average in this regard is approximately 40%, whereas only in the region of 25% of nine year olds in this country study in such environments.  There is a great deal of work to be done.  One of our biggest problems relates to broadband provision.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, recognises that and has made such provision a priority.  Have the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and his Cabinet colleague discussed how high quality broadband services might be rolled out to schools in rural areas which are badly in need of them?  We will not be able to move towards a model whereby e-books and digital education will become more prevalent unless high quality broadband services are provided.  What is the Minister's view of the huge disparity between the EU average and the figure which obtains in this regard in this country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.79" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1174" speakername="Mary Moran" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013111300014#O00400"><p>I was also going to inquire about the roll-out of broadband services.  Even as recently as two years ago, broadband was not available in certain schools located in major towns.  I appreciate the work the Minister and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, have done in this area.  In the context of the increase in the number of Brazilian and American students coming here and the recognition of qualifications, I know a number of individuals who studied abroad and who faced a battle to have the qualifications they obtained recognised here.  Will the Minister provide some statistics regarding the uptake in respect of the specific programmes supporting school leadership in Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.80" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013111300014#O00500"><p>Deputy McConalogue has been obliged to leave but I am sure he will consult the transcript in due course to follow up on the replies I am about to provide.  Three Education Council meetings are held every year.  Two of these take place in the first semester, so those hosted by Ireland were held in February and May.  The final one takes place in November and that is the one to which I referred in my opening contribution.</p><p>  I understood Deputy McConalogue's question on internationalisation to relate to Irish students travelling abroad.  That was my interpretation about what he had to say.  In yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, the education supplement - which is quite accurate in my experience - referred to a trade fair held in the RDS on opportunities to study abroad in Europe, including in parts of the United Kingdom.  I have attended this event, which is expanding rapidly, for the past three years.  An indication of its growth is that it has had to be held at a larger venue each year.  Traditionally, people who wanted to pursue the course in physiotherapy for which a high number of points are required and who did not achieve these travelled to Maastricht or Utrecht to pursue courses in physiotherapy.  The fee involved is &euro;1,800.  The rules in respect of domestic fees are that all students from EU member states pay whatever is the going rate in the country in which they intend to study.  The amount which applies here is currently &euro;2,500, in Britain it is &pound;9,000 and in Northern Ireland it is approximately &pound;4,500.  All EU students are treated as being the same.  In the region of 1,500 courses are available in different universities in countries such as France, Spain, Hungary, parts of the Netherlands and Germany, and these are all thought through the English language.</p><p>  I met an Irish woman at the trade fair to which I refer who originally studied at Trinity College, who has been living in the Netherlands for some time and who is now a representative for a particular university there.  I asked her why the university is seeking Irish students and she informed me that there are many continental students who want to study in English but whose first language is not English.  She also stated that the university wants them to become used to the English vernacular.  She indicated that while students from England and North America attend the university, her experience - rather than any bias - has been that Irish students are an attractive addition to the campus.  She characterised the Irish students as being the social glue of the university.  This is because they will mix with anyone and do not have hang-ups about particular nationalities which others appear to harbour.  She informed me that others tend to cluster around the Irish and like to have them in the vicinity.</p><p>  To the best of my knowledge, we do not keep a register of the Irish students who travel abroad.  For example, the so-called league tables the newspapers publish at the appropriate time in respect of the number of students post-primary schools send on to university only capture data relating to Irish universities.  The newspapers ask the seven universities and the institutes of technology to indicate the number of students they take on in first year and the schools from which they came.  A small and very bright cohort of Irish students attend university in Oxford or Cambridge.  These individuals do not feature on the league tables to which I refer.  As a result, we do not have centralised information in respect of this matter.  If it existed anywhere, it would be in the control of the Higher Education Authority.</p><p>  On the other hand, we have a great deal of information in respect of incoming students.  Senator Moran referred to this matter.  In the first instance, the value of this business - and it is a business - if &euro;1 billion.</p></speech>

Is the Minister referring to what they spend as well?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.82" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013111300015#P00200"><p>It is &euro;700 million in third level academic institutions and it is approximately &euro;300 million in foreign English language schools.  A note I have, which is fairly up to date, states that there are 32,000 students registered in Irish higher education institutions, including international students on Irish programmes overseas.  These would include the Royal College of Surgeons and colleges in different parts of world where students are taking an Irish course outside this country.  The total number of students is 32,000.  This represents a 9% increase on 2009-10 figures.  This 9% increase takes account of a number of aspects.  First, there has been a significant increase in the number of Erasmus exchanges in short-term student courses, including US students on junior years abroad.  I will deal separately with the qualifications issue raised by Senator Moran.  Second, there is a significant increase in PhD registrations and PhD students in Ireland now account for 20% of all full-time international students.  There has been a significant growth in offshore study by international students on Irish programmes.  That total in that respect is 23%.  There is the medical college in Bahrain.  UCD is in the process of setting up joint ventures with education providers, universities and third level institutions in China.  It, together with the university of agriculture in China, has established a joint venture with a local city which has provided the land and infrastructure for a course that will cover two years in China and two years in Ireland and it will have a mixture of European and Chinese students.</p><p>  On Senator Moran's question on the qualifications issue, the vast bulk of our students come for short-term courses such as the year abroad programme, which is a classic American programme.  They get credit for their period of study here but they are not in a category in respect of which we would have an issue.  However, we have an issue with our colleagues in Northern Ireland.  The CAO system evaluates in points terms and accords 100 points to a leaving certificate honours grade of 90% plus.  The A star, as it is called, subject to clarification, is rated 150 points.  The people in Northern Ireland and the Minister with responsibility for higher education, Stephen Farry, have raised this with us and they would argue that this level of point value is less than what an A star should properly be.  We in the Department of Education and Skills, or in the Higher Education Authority which is in within the remit of the Department, do not score the CAO performance but what we have in the past, through the State Examinations Commission, increased the gradation.  There used to be seven grades of evaluation in the marking system.  At their request some eight or ten years ago we have, through the State Examinations Commission, increased the grading from seven to 14, which has allowed them to calibrate.  In that very tight marking system no student is more than 2.5 points away from either an upgrade or a downgrade.  That issue is currently under discussion for reasons the members will understand.</p><p>    This would extend to the whole of Britain, but there are different systems in terms of marking in place in the United Kingdom as the Secretary of State, Mr. Gove, has introduced a variety of different ways of marking in respect of the GCSE subjects and superior exams.  In terms of students in the North in particular, the concern is that some of the students who might want to come to the South will not come because they are not getting the full award that they would get for a similar qualification in the United Kingdom.  The understanding is that most of the interest would be in areas such as medicine, which would attract that kind of student.  Nevertheless, there has been an increase in the number of students from Northern Ireland studying in the South.  It is a relatively significant percentage increase but on a very small numbers base.    </p><p>  On the leadership courses, in terms of participants, I can give the members more details of on that if they would like.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, and myself have a programme, which will be completed this year, to provide a rollout of a 100 megabytes infrastructure to all post-primary schools in the country, which number approximately 730.  We are considering the primary sector but we do not have the same clear picture in that respect.  There is a wide spectrum of primary schools that are much more digitally turned on and that is a function of the size of the school.  Schools range in size from 50 to 60 pupils to 700 pupils.  We are talking informally to some of the primary school principals to examine how we can prioritise access to broadband in those schools.  A note I have on this area states that the Department is currently embarking on the development of a new digital strategy for schools.  It also states that consultation with all the stakeholders is a key part of the strategy and this will inform the Department in planning for the exploitation of the full potential for ICT in education at primary and post-primary levels.  There is the in-house equipment and then there is access to the wider area which requires access to broadband.  While we make no distinction at post-primary level between all 730 schools, it would not be physically or financially possible to adopt a similar approach for all 3,200 primary schools.  We are examining how we might link that infrastructure.</p></speech>

I can give the Minister an example of a school in Cork that is located 100 yds from a housing estate which has broadband access, yet the school does not have such access.  The school authorities have spoken to the engineers who are dealing with the issue.  It would not be cost prohibitive to extend broadband access to that school but there does not seem to be any joined-up thinking.  How can we overcome that?  It is crazy that this school does not have broadband access when it is located 100 yds from a housing estate that has such access.  All the students who attend the school have broadband at home but they do not have it in the school environment.</p></speech>

That would be from area to area.  If the Deputy has a set of areas that is of interest to him in this regard, I would be happy to explore that with him.</p></speech>

It was one of better courses I ever attended.  I want to put on record my support for that course and I hope it continues to be funded.</p><p>  On the broader aspect of leadership of the primary school sector in particular, has the Minister concerns?

On a related matter, I commend the Minister on his work on addressing the cost of school expenses for parents.  I heard his interview on George Hook's programme on Monday evening, and as I said to the committee earlier, his proposal is a positive step forward.</p><p>  The Greeks are finalising their Presidency programme for the next six months.  There is often insufficient long-term thinking or planning in the area of education.  Much of the approach is of the fire fighting type. Since the Minister has taken office he has unfortunately been tasked with the huge challenge of dealing with a much-reduced budget.  We need to consider where we want to be in ten years time in terms of our class sizes and pupil-teacher ratios.  Could a pan-European approach in this respect be included for the Greek Presidency?  We could examine this aspect and set ourselves targets.  We need to grasp this issue once and for all for the future.  Unfortunately, at every budget time we have a discussion on whether the pupil-teacher ratio would have to be increased by one or even two pupils.</p> <p>We had a discussion on whether the pupil-teacher ratio could be increased by one or two.  We must examine how we can reduce the pupil-teacher ratio and have it more or less set in stone so that one can say, this is where we are as a country and this is what we want to achieve and maintain for the future.  Does the Minister believe that could be factored in for the next Presidency?  Would he be willing to champion such an initiative?</p></speech>

That is done in consultation with the Commission and the three countries that form a cluster.  In the case of the Irish Presidency, I shared our perspective on the future with both the Lithuanians and the Greeks.  The Greeks were the third group of three countries.  Ultimately, it is for each country to decide what it wants to prioritise.  What we have succeeded in doing is maintaining a continuity in the format of communication.</p><p>  The discussion to which I referred was as boring as hell.  We could have all stayed at home and e-mailed and faxed information.  People read out their scripts and walked away.  There were bilateral meetings.  We might as well have been at Ballinasloe horse fair as at the meeting as there was no engagement.  What took place was not engagement.  We brought two outside speakers, David Puttnam and Andreas Schleicher on one occasion and Christine Blower who was the representative of all the teachers&rsquo; unions in Europe.</p><p>  I will come back to the issue of principal leadership.  On the long-term strategy for education, the junior cycle is being radically transformed and it will not be complete until 2020.  The first cohort to start second year will start next September.  They will do English under a new regime in 2017.  The next cohort starting first year in 2015 will take on five subjects including English, and so on until we have all of the full menu across the line.  In the meantime the change will inevitably have an impact on the senior cycle, including the future of transition year because it is seen as an antidote to the rigid scholastic rote learning that currently characterises the junior certificate examination.</p><p>  We are currently discussing a change in the points system with the universities.  There is a good paper from September 2011, which is available on the Internet from a retired professor, &Aacute;ine Hyland, about the transition process and the multiplicity of courses at levels 7 and 8 in institutions.  They have increased from just over 400 to 970.  Those members who are educationalists will have a better knowledge of the matter than many.  Less than 20% of students have any idea of what they would like to study.  They are faced with a baffling menu.  One could do computers with art, or art with computers and ICT or computers with a bit of art and a bit of ICT.  Universities and colleges are like premier league clubs.  They just want the best players, in this case, students.  The courses are hooks with a bit of bait on them to try to get students to do them.  We are trying to move to a simplified system where there will be less choice and better quality.  At the end of first year in college a student can then decide, as they can currently with engineering.  There is a foundation course in all of the engineering schools in year one and then at the age of 19, as distinct from the age of 17, which is currently the case or sometimes even younger, one can choose to become a mechanical engineer or structural engineer.  That leads to a better fit.</p><p>  On the landscape of third level education, the institutes of technology go back to the regional technical colleges of the 1970s.  They were the last project to be financed by the World Bank in this country before we joined the European Union.  That landscape is going to be unrecognisable in two years&rsquo; time, as will the universities.  There will be seven regional clusters of education across the country centred on the seven universities where there will be co-ordination in the delivery and supply of courses, the elimination of duplication and a fit between them.  Given that we have a national qualifications framework one will be able to go from a level 8 course &ndash; an honours undergraduate course &ndash; to another, but other access programmes will bring people into the system and one will be able to move around the third level system.  That will take us up to 2050 in terms of an educational landscape.  There is long-term strategic thinking.  By the end of this calendar year we will have a response from the higher education sector on the alignments and mergers of some of the current institutes of technology.  One would not set out today to build 14 regional colleges of technology across the country.  Our investment in the road network, communications, telecommunications and other changes have transformed the physical geography of this country in terms of time, travel and distance.</p><p>  In response to Deputy Daly&rsquo;s question about leadership and national school principals, there is a debate and a variance in practice across Europe.  For example, in Lithuania, there is a national competition for principals and one applies to become a principal by virtue of one&rsquo;s qualifications and then one is assigned a school.  We are at a tentative stage of taking some of those principles &ndash; no pun intended &ndash; and applying them.  One could ask whether there should be a maximum limit for holding the position of principal.  Ten years has been suggested.  Frank Feely, who was manager of Dublin City Council was manager for 19 years.  Nobody can be on top of their game for 19 years, no matter how good they are.  Even bishops have term limits and cannot hold the position after the age of 72.  The question is whether there should be a time limit, if someone should be a principal in the school in which they were deputy principal or if they should move around.  They are purely questions.  Lest anyone in the Gallery or anywhere else think I am enunciating policy, I am not; I am simply giving a description.</p><p>  Everyone comes from the perspective of their own background and place.  They say this is the way it has been done here and this is the way it has always been done and we have not challenged it.  The great virtue of the European experience is that with 27 other Ministers for education one hears how things are done differently or they have a different way of doing the same thing.  That exposes one to considering different options and how they would work.  One could ask what is the role of a principal in a school that has 750 children with special needs classes and perhaps a na&iacute;onra as well, as distinct from one third of our schools that have less than 100 pupils.  Could one equate the role of a principal in a school of one size with another of a different size?  These are all questions that we are now asking ourselves.  We will look at best practice.  Of course we will have consultations with all of the players who are directly involved.  Both the Irish Primary Principals&rsquo; Network, IPPN, and its post-primary counterpart are talking more and more in such terms and looking at the programmes to which I referred, including Misneach, as Deputy Daly outlined, and how one takes them a stage further.</p></speech>

There is just one issue to raise with the Minister in case it is relevant.  One of the issues that came up in the part of the meeting that dealt with back-to-school costs was e-books and the EU obstacle to dealing with the issue of lower VAT.  Could that be raised at the meeting?</p></speech>

It was raised by both Deputy McConalogue and you, Chairman, and Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien also raised it.  There was a time in the mid-1980s when the then Labour-Fine Gael coalition fell out of favour with Croke Park because we could not remove VAT from hurley sticks and Ministers were effectively banned from attending games there as a result.  One will be pleased to hear that VAT is still on hurley sticks and notwithstanding the ostracisation that occurred we are still allowed to go to Croke Park.  It was a long difficult journey to reconcile the different VAT regimes of 12 member states, or even nine of them.  One got a chance to put VAT on goods but the decision could not then be altered.  On foot of the issue being raised, I am prepared to explore the possibility of having the matter raised at Council level.  There will be a price distortion in the marketplace if there is VAT on one component of what is in effect the same product but there is not on the other.  I do not know the VAT rate on books.  It might be 23%.</p></speech>

The requester shall be required to pay a further fee for each separate request under this paragraph, or the requester shall pay the fee for whichever request or requests he or she may specify or modify the request so that no further fee is payable.<br />(<i>b</i>) A head shall assist or offer to assist the requester concerned in amending the request so that it no longer comprises more than one request.&rdquo;.</blockquote>We had made a lot of progress last night on substantial matters contained in the Bill before we reached this amendment.  This is very important legislation in that it seeks to restore the freedom of information legislative regime in this country, make it fit for purpose, take on board the advice we have received from the Information Commissioner and others since significant amendments were made to the original legislation in 2003.</p><p>  There are several principles captured by the legislation: the establishing of several key statutory principles governing the operation of FOI legislation, all of which incorporate international best practice; creating a legal presumption that official records requested will be released; strongly promoting the proactive release of official information by public bodies; and requiring public bodies to draw requesters' attention to the scope to obtain records other than through FOI legislation.  The freedom of information legislation is important, but I hope we are moving towards a different type of regime where we have open data.</p> <p>I made some commitments at the open government partnership, OGP, in London some time ago to indicate that our objective was to move towards an open data regime.  There are logistical and technical issues, but there should be a presumption that the default position is that information is in the public domain.  I will be relaunching my own departmental website shortly with more data on it, including all invoices and so on.  That is part of the regime we are working towards.  However, couched within this is the issue of reforming the FOI regime.  I said last night that I thanked the members of the committee for undertaking a lot of detailed analysis of the legislation and their thoughtful report.  The Chairman mentioned last night that he was not overwhelmed by the interest garnered by the report once it was published, but it certainly was important work and is instructive in terms of what we want to do and what is being proposed.</p><p> The one point of contention from the very beginning was whether there should be a charge system for accessing information.  I have indicated from the very beginning of this process that in the current climate I think that would be reasonable.  It should be remembered that it has been, in some shape or another, a feature of the FOI system in this country from the very beginning.  While the 1997 Act did not contain an up-front charge, there was a retrieval fee system that imposed a charge in recognition of the actual cost involved in the retrieval of information.</p><p> I thank all Deputies for their contributions on this net issue.  We had a long debate on the fees issue at the outset of Committee Stage yesterday.  I am conscious that it is a very small subset of what overall I regard as acknowledged progressive legislation, but it is an important one.  I have listened very carefully to everything that has been said.  In my response I made clear the Government's decision, following a very careful examination and taking into account the observations provided in the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report, to maintain the FOI application fee, while providing for a significant reduction in the fees for internal review and any appeal that may be made to the Information Commissioner.  The &euro;15 fee was not a particular hurdle, but the higher charges for internal appeals or going to the Information Commissioner were.  I am making proposals to provide for very substantial reductions in these fees.</p><p> As I said yesterday, there were a number of important considerations that informed the Government's decision-making, including the principle that there should be a charge, recognising the often significant and real cost of processing requests for non-personal information.  Of course, requests for personal information which comprise the bulk of FOI requests will remain free of charge.</p><p> I heard clearly the views expressed by a number of members that there should be no application fees or no fees of any kind for standard freedom of information requests.  I have indicated that in principle I broadly share that perspective, but there are realities that I must address, including the State's current fiscal position, the substantial reduction in public sector numbers, including Civil Service numbers, and the pressures in these circumstances on our administrative system in providing priority public services.  The conclusion that the Government drew on the issue of FOI application fees was, therefore, that maintenance of the fee was required for the time being to ensure the administrative system would have the capacity to effectively and efficiently manage the demand.</p><p> This is a reality recognised in other countries.  In that regard, I have noted the information reported in today's newspapers indicating that one in five of 94 countries with FOI laws in place have FOI application fees.  This is broadly the same percentage as applies to the OECD countries.  The right to information international rankings of national legal frameworks for FOI report that, in addition to Ireland, OECD member countries with FOI application fees include Canada, Switzerland, Japan, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Turkey and Israel.  </p><p> I have listened carefully to the concerns expressed by members of the committee which were articulated clearly and well yesterday about the specific proposals contained in the Bill to unpackage entirely separate and unrelated issues included in a single FOI application and apply a separate charge for each.  If we accept the principle that there should be an individual charge which I have said from the beginning I am proposing should remain - there is an up-front charge of &euro;15 - we really have to follow through and acknowledge that it is not possible to simply bolt on completely separate and extraneous matters and bundle them together as one request.  That undermines the principle of the fee system.  If the fee system is to be used, this will be a requirement.</p><p> I have listened carefully to the views of members of the committee but also to what has been written in the past few days.  There is a genuine fear that the actual amendment I put forward will not be interpreted in that way, in other words, that, somehow, requests for subsets of the same issue would be individually charged for.  That is not the intention of the Government; it is not my intention, nor is it the intention of the legislation.  Where there are separate, clearly unrelated issues bundled together, they should be disaggregated.  However, where there is a very long set of questions on the same issue - as long as one likes - that is one issue, one request. That is the way I intend it to be and that is the way I have explained it to be.  However, it is clear from much of the public comment on the proposal that there is confusion and a misinterpretation of the provision I have set out and its objective.  Today I read one article, a dislodged article because I had written an op-ed piece on freedom of information which was not carried, but the alternative piece which was carried referred to fees runnimg to thousands of euro.  There are a lot of &euro;15 fees in a sum running to thousands of euro, even with search and retrieval fees and so on.  That is not the intention, nor will it be the consequence of what I am suggesting.  Such estimates are based on a wrong interpretation of the intention of the legislation.  </p><p> It is very important that the very great leap on freedom of information in Ireland which is being advanced by the Bill is not overshadowed by unnecessary uncertainty or lack of clarity on what is a simple and straightforward intention.  An FOI request on a single issue or related issues requires the payment of one single fee.  Where multiple unrelated requests are received, of which I provided examples for the committee yesterday - I can provide further examples today because they come in all the time - the principle of charging for a FOI request must apply.  It is incumbent on me to take full account of the level of concern that the application of the legislative provision would in practice go much further than I have intended in a situation where there is such a sea-change in the legislative provision set out by me.  While I firmly believe that will not be the case, I am committed to having the legal drafting of the provision reviewed and refined to ensure there can be no doubt, no uncertainty and no misinterpretation by anyone who subsequently reads the Bill, such as an information officer or agent or applicant, about the objective I have put to the committee.  I hope that is crystal clear.  A single up-front fee of &euro;15 is required to capture as long an FOI request as is required on the same issue, but where there are separate, clearly distinct issues, they will be treated as such.</p> <p>My priority is to ensure the final provision, as enacted by the Oireachtas, will not support unreasonable concerns that the cost of freedom of information requests in Ireland is unaffordable, through requiring a single fee to be paid for entirely separate and unrelated FOI requests.</p><p> I have given some consideration to the views expressed by colleagues and, with my officials, re-examined the text of amendment No. 33.  On a simple, plain English reading, I am confident that it will achieve the purpose I have set out.  Nevertheless, I acknowledge that there are genuine concerns that the provision might be used by some on the administrative side of the house to implement a charging system that is not intended.  To that end, with the permission of the committee, I propose to withdraw the amendment and, in co-operation with my officials, devise a form of wording to take it beyond confusion, doubt or misinterpretation that what I have set out is what I intend to be achieved.  We have already begun working on it with the Parliamentary Counsel; had we been able to do so, I would have brought forward the revised amendment today.  I ask members to facilitate me to that end, with the objective of continuing our discussion on Report Stage.</p><p> I also acknowledge that some people hold the view that there should, on principle, be no fee regime.  It is a perfectly legitimate point of view.  However, I put it to the committee that if we accept that a contribution of &euro;15 for a distinct application is reasonable, we cannot allow that provision to be circumvented by bolting entirely separate, extraneous and distinct matters onto the same FOI request.</p></speech>

I admire his courage.  Some here seem to consider this a laughing matter, but others of us do not.  I said I admired the Minister's courage before the skits came from the other side.  It is unquestionably a U-turn, but it is a good man who is willing to change his view.  One can look at it both ways.</p><p>  In regard to the amendment, I was surprised that the Minister had referred to the State's fiscal position, as though charging a few additional &euro;15 fees would somehow have a significant impact on that position.  It is an argument I do not accept.  The Minister went on to say one of the reasons he was seeking to maintain the fee structure was, to use his words, to "manage demand".  What that means, of course, is keeping down the number of requests.  The Minister is afraid that demand would increase in a situation where no fees applied.  To reiterate, he is saying one of his reasons for preferring the retention of fees is to manage the demand for freedom of information requests, in other words, to restrict the number of requests.</p><p>  The amendment deals specifically with the issue of multiple possible fees at the application stage.  In due course, as we move through the amendments, we will deal with the broader issue of fees.  I am pleased at this point that we are at least getting some honesty from the Minister in so far as he acknowledges that one of the purposes of fees is to keep the number of requests down or, as he has put it, manage demand.  It seems clear that this is the Minister's and, by extension, the Government's position.</p></speech>

The Minister opposed our doing so when he was in opposition, but he is reinstating that provision now and proposing in this section to add to it.  He pointed out in the course of his contribution that one fifth of countries in the European Union and the OECD charged application fees in respect of freedom of information requests.  That means, of course, that fourth fifths do not and I argue that we should come into line with these countries.</p><p>  I welcome the Minister's proposed withdrawal of amendment No. 33.  However, it behoves me to point out that this provision could not have been read by any reasonable person in any other way than the way in which we have described it.  Whoever drafted it is bound to say that was not the intention, but the reality is that the amendment goes even further than merely dealing with multiple requests.  It provides that where a freedom of information request is made up of two or more parts seeking separate and distinct information-----</p></speech>

I gave the example yesterday which seemed to surprise the Minister somewhat that an FOI request to do with pensions might end up going to the human resources section, the audit committee and the corporate affairs section of the same FOI body.  My concern is that the amendment, as drafted, deals not only with separate and distinct requests for information but also refers specifically to requests going to different functional areas.  That in itself creates a separate layer of opportunity for a second level of fees.  One of the related amendments refers to the same issue and, I assume, will also have to be withdrawn.</p><p>  In terms of where we go from here, the simplest thing would be for the Minister to give us sight of the revised amendment which, as he has indicated, is already being worked on.  We might very well require an opportunity to amend his amendment on Report Stage.  It should not simply be dropped on us with very little time to review it before the debate.  I further suggest that between now and Report Stage, we have a separate session to deal specifically with this and the broader fees issue.  These matters were examined in the report, but we did not have sufficient information on the cost of processing fees.  Most people accept that, for many of the relevant organisations, the cost of processing the fee is greater than the fee charged.  In fact, it is damaging the fiscal position of many organisations to be obliged to have an accounting system in place for a &euro;15 fee.  If the argument is being made that it is nothing to do with money at all and is really about managing demand, at least if we got down to the net issue at the committee, we might arrive at some consensus or at least come to our separate views on the matter.</p><p>  I hope the Chairman and colleagues will agree to my proposal that we have a special meeting of the committee before Report Stage to discuss the fees issue.  I would have liked to have seen a report at this point, from whatever source, showing the amount of fees collected in each of the public bodies that come under the FOI regime and the associated processing costs.  That basic information would contribute significantly in informing our debate on the fees structure.</p><p>  I do not accept the analogy the Minister made yesterday linking this issue with the prescription fees payable by holders of medical cards.  It is not sound logic to argue that because people have to pay a prescription fee even though they have a medical card, there should also be a charge for FOI requests.  If one accepts that people with medical cards have to make a contribution to the services they receive - I do not accept it, but I am trying to follow the logic - it follows that a fee should be payable, even where a person is making a request for personal information under the FOI system.</p> <p>I do not accept the parallel to which the Minister refers.  If we were to use his logic, we would be moving towards introducing higher fees.  I do not believe that is what he intends.  Neither do I believe that anyone would agree with an increase in the fees.  Trying to link what is involved here to the cost of medical cards is not the right way to go about it.  I suggest that we agree to the withdrawal of all the amendments in this group and that we revisit and discuss them at a meeting to take place before Report Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.115" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/985" speakername="Dara Murphy" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22013111300005#D00200"><p>I did not make any contribution to yesterday's proceedings, which went on quite late into the evening.  I welcome the fact that the legislation is before us.  Regardless of the position in respect of fees, there has been an enormous gap in this area since the removal of the relevant provision approximately ten years ago.  There are those who may wish to concentrate on the issue of fees but for most people this is but a small aspect of the overall scheme.  We have heard two narratives on this matter today, namely, during Taoiseach's Questions in the D&aacute;il and at the very beginning of this meeting.  In the report produced following the joint committee's hearings last June, it is stated that the greatest amount of debate and concern related to the issue of fees.  There has been an attempt to suggest that this issue has been parachuted into the debate.  I attended the joint committee's hearings and not only were fees discussed, they were the first issue of concern.  I accept, however, that a recommendation was not made.</p><p>  The Minister has indicated that he is going to reconsider this matter but I do not see what he said as constituting a U-turn.  For what it is worth, I am of the view that a fee should be charged.  In light of the prevailing economic climate and given the workload involved, it is not unreasonable to expect people to pay a small amount of money.  As has already been stated, there will not be a charge in respect of personal information requests or subsets thereof.  These represent in the region of 70% of the overall number of requests.  Any private citizen who requires information on himself or herself will not, therefore, be obliged to pay a fee.  We are currently charging people for all sorts of things for which we do not want to charge them.  Given that the Minister is frequently credited with issuing requests to his colleagues in Cabinet in this regard, I am of the view that it is correct that there should not be a fee for personal information requests.</p><p>  In the context of managing demand, the report relating to the joint committee's hearings refers to more automatic publication.  The way to manage demand is to increase supply.  We must get the message across that taxpayers are paying an average of &euro;600 per request.  I do not taxpayers want this to be the case.  The document submitted by the Minister in respect of multifaceted requests is very interesting and, perhaps, somewhat amusing.  It highlights the fact that a large amount of the information involved should be made available as a matter of course in order to reduce the amount - currently &euro;600 - which the taxpayer is obliged to pay.  We have failed in this regard.  The position which obtains in the United Kingdom in respect of an expense of over &euro;500 for a local authority is reasonable.  The figure could perhaps be higher and it could automatically be put in place.  The Chairman and I previously served on the same local authority in Cork.  That authority frequently received FOI requests in respect of councillors travel and expenses, etc., and it eventually made a decision to publish these on its website.  That people were previously obliged to submit requests for this information implies that it was hidden.  Clearly journalists must be in a position to access such information.</p><p>  The debate on this issue has been quite one-sided in nature to date.  I am of the view that the fee is modest and reasonable and that personal information requests will not be affected.  I accept that the Minister is reconsidering the position.  We must continue to encourage all the public bodies which come under the stewardship of his Department to publish information because this will reduce expenditure.  I spoke to the FOI officer of a large public body about the workload involved and the issue of the fee.  He informed me that it may or may not be a cost to him but that the real cost emanates from being obliged to access the same documents year after year.  The information contained in these documents should be published on the Internet at the start of each year in order to reduce the both amount of work and the costs involved.</p></speech>

I share the view that it does not contemplate the intention as set out earlier by the Minister.  I have no doubt that the Parliamentary Counsel will find suitable language to clarify the matter.  The Minister will not be surprised to hear me repeat that I am opposed to the imposition of any charge for freedom of information requests.  He has conceded that the sum of money involved - namely, &euro;15 plus the search and retrieval fees - is tokenistic.  If one sets the money involved against the big mathematics relating to the State's finances, one will see that it does not even count as peanuts.  However, for people - not just journalists but also ordinary citizens - who might seek information through FOI, a charge of any nature will act as a barrier.  That is why the Minister, quite correctly and accurately, stated that the charging of a fee relates to demand management.  Of course that is the case.  I am of the view that this is wrong and that it runs contrary to his position of openness and of having open data and open government.  As he is aware, these are all matters on which I am very happy to support him.</p><p>  In addition to withdrawing amendment No. 33, it would be useful if the Minister also withdrew all of the other amendments relating to this matter and reconsidered the entire position prior to Report Stage.  For example, he needs to re-examine the position regarding the upfront payment of 20% of search and retrieval fees in light of the considerable concern that exists.  The Minister referred to media reports which referred to me as seeing an open goal and being over the moon at the opportunity to have a go at him.  That is not what this is about; what we are seeking to do here is get the legislation right.  The Minister threw his eyes up to heaven when Deputy Sean Fleming took him to task on the issue of fees.  Why should the Minister not have done so, particularly when we know who did the damage to the FOI legislation?  His job is to put the matter to rights and I am of the view that the elimination of any fee should be part and parcel of what he does.  The argument to the effect that what is being done involves easing the economic burden on the citizens of the State simply does not stand up to scrutiny and I believe the Minister knows that.  I do not know why he continues to repeat that argument because it is ludicrous.</p><p>  I am glad amendment No. 33 is being withdrawn and I invite the Minister to withdraw all of the other amendments, which he tabled very late in the day, relating to fees.</p></speech>

I will leave the discussion on fees, upfront charges, etc., until we reach amendment No. 53 because we will be able to deal with them in some detail at that point.  I will, however, use an example in order to clarify what I think the Minister as saying to us.</p><p>  I occupy an office in Agriculture House, the headquarters of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Let us imagine that someone submits an FOI request to that Department in respect of the inoculation of cattle throughout the country.  The officer who receives the request will recognise the need to contact local offices throughout the country - so there is a geographic break in functional area - the office charged with looking after the national herd, pharmaceutical experts, etc.</p> <p>If a single request, not a multifaceted one, is submitted and the receiving officer has to send it to multiple offices and functional areas to get a response to it, is it the Minister's clear intention that such a request will be treated as a single request with a single upfront fee of &euro;15?  I think that is what he is saying to the committee.</p></speech>

That is peanuts in terms of the public finances.  I ask the Minister not to make fools of us by suggesting this is important for the finances of the State.  Clearly, it is not.  If it not about raising &euro;87,000, it must be about something else.  The Minister should be open and up-front on what that something else is.  Deputy Sean Fleming was right when he said it was about managing demand.  A sum of &euro;15 is a good deal of money to some people, while &euro;87,000 is not even small change for the Government.  Applying a charge is a disincentive for ordinary people.</p><p>  On a point of clarification - I do not care whether this is a U-turn or a climbdown; it does not make any difference - I gather that the outcry is that pressure is being experienced, but that is what this committee is for and if the Minister listens, that is excellent.  That is what democracy is supposed to be about.  Nobody should be ashamed to say, "I am responding to pressure in the media or from the public."  That is precisely what we are all here for - to respond to that pressure. </p><p>  I draw the Minister's attention to examples he gave yesterday.  Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly gave a hypothetical example, to which the Minister gave a clear answer.  He provided examples - I have only had a chance to look at them now - of what he described as multifaceted requests which ran foul of his concerns and which, presumably, even with the new amendment he is proposing, involved multiple charges rather than a single charge.  FOI 213 1882 is a request I randomly read, a request for all records within the Department within the timeframe 9 March 2011 to 14 May 2013 related to a list of items.  It is clear from these eight items that they all relate to expenses incurred by the Taoiseach during the Minister's party's period in government.  That is what they are all about.</p></speech>

That was probably a request made by a journalist looking for a particular story about the costs incurred by the Taoiseach and perhaps Ministers - I acknowledge that point - which people might perceive to be superfluous or because there was controversy around such expenditure because it might have been perceived to be excessive and indulgent against the background of an economic crisis.  That is the logic behind that question and it is consistent through the eight parts.  The Minister is now telling us that in the case of such a request which was almost certainly submitted by a journalist with a particular story in mind to reveal information that the public might want to know about this expenditure, there will be eight charges instead of one, which would be problematic, or is he telling us that there will be only one charge?  His answer to that question will clarify if he has changed his position.</p></speech>

One judgment is that a reasonable person would not link the use of Farmleigh, including the steward's house, grounds, accommodation and overnight guest accommodation, all functions for which it is used, which would involve an extraordinary trawl of every Department, agency of State, the records of Farmleigh on who stayed there and all the rest - that is a very broad and distinct area - with the exercise equipment that might be used by the Taoiseach and then move on to the helipad and use of Government buildings-----</p></speech>

I suppose one could say any question with the word "Taoiseach" in it is the same; that seems to be the logic of the argument.  I do not think so, but the bottom line is, thankfully, that it will not be the Deputy or me who will make the determinations.  There will be a code of conduct set down which, as I promised yesterday, we will bring to the committee.  There will then be an appeal to the independent Information Commissioner who is probably more objective than either of us in these matters.  He will make the determination on what it is appropriate to link.</p> <p>Deputy Fleming started off with talk of a U-turn.  I have tried since I became a Minister and previously when I had the honour to be a Minister to engage on Committee Stage.  I accepted the second amendment proposed by Deputy McDonald yesterday.  I did not see the fireworks or U-turns announced when I accepted it because it was a sensible suggestion.  That is what Committee Stage should be about.  If we moved away from talk about U-turns and engage as mature people in a parliamentary committee, we could have more engagement and more sensible responses from both sides.  One has to listen to the arguments made.  I was never of the view that this side of the House or the Government in any guise was the repository of all wisdom.  The purpose of the parliamentary system is to parse and analyse legislation.  Let us grow up and stop trying to make political points on these matters.</p></speech>

He talked about managing demand.  What I meant by that was ensuring that the system works.  We could have a Rolls Royce system that just does not work because we do not have the resources, capacity or wherewithal to do it.  We must ensure that we are practical as well in terms of all the things we do.  There is no point in us in any sphere of activity pretending to be able to do things we cannot.  We must ensure that what we put in place is practical.</p><p>  Deputy Fleming and Deputy Donnelly both asked for sight of the amendment.  I will ensure they have adequate sight of it before we come to Report Stage.  Charging is a feature of the legislation from its inception in 1997.  It is a moot point whether one charges an upfront fee of &euro;15 or an hourly rate of &euro;21, which is what was specified in the original legislation.  There is a real cost attaching.  It does not make sense for Deputy Boyd Barrett to talk in terms of it being free.  I know he comes from a tradition that thinks everything is free but there is a real cost.</p></speech>

Deputy Dara Murphy made a compelling and clear case that there should be fees.  He is correct that in the context of my Ministry it is reasonable that I would ask for a contribution to maintain it.  He made a much more profound and important point, namely, about the automatic publication of data.  That is the direction in which we are going.  Embedded in the legislation is a move towards having open data.  I hope that in ten years&rsquo; time FOI will be a resort most people will not have to reach.  The default system is that information should be published.  We are working towards that now as part of the Open Government Partnership.  I have asked the chief information officer to work on systems that will allow that to happen.  We are working in my Department to do that.</p><p>  The final point Deputy Murphy made, which is a very good one, is that the main users other the general public seeking personal information are journalists.  By and large, it would rank against the need of journalists to have open data because they want to have their own ownership of the data because if it is not an exclusive for them and everyone has the information, it is not worth printing.  We must reflect on how we have open data.</p></speech>

Clearly, the logic of it is that it relates to the period since the Minister entered office.  It is the trappings of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office that is in question.

One of the things I have said from the very beginning and on which we have worked in the drafting of the legislation is that we must have a parallel code of conduct so that every information officer knows what is expected, that they are all trained properly and as the Deputy will have seen there is a requirement in the legislation on Departments and agencies to train staff.  They will work on a common basis and that will greatly improve the handling of requests, the certainty of the applicant, the way Departments and agencies deal with requests and have consistency across the system which is important.</p></speech>

The request selected by Deputy Boyd Barrett is interesting.  Some of the questions in FOI/2013/1882 are linked.  Given that it is being re-examined, could the Minister take this as an example?  I estimate that the cost of the request would be somewhere between &euro;60 and &euro;90.  It would be interesting when the Minister comes up with the changes to take this as an example and to say that it would end up costing whatever amount.  Equally, the public would be interested if he could tell us the cost to the Exchequer of compiling information.  Every body that has a FOI officer is a public body.  The cost to a journalist or someone else would be between &euro;60 and &euro;90 by my reckoning.  If the Minister could provide the information I would love to see what the taxpayer will pay for it.</p><p>  Many of the requests are very good.  I do not wish to create any ripples with journalists as most of my best friends are journalists, but is there any scope once a request is returned that at some point it would be published?</p> <p>It may even be possible to have a lag or whatever and then that it would be republished the following year.  If it is worth finding and publishing in 2013, it probably is worth publishing in 2014 and 2015.  Many of course are once-off requests about specific events about the Presidency or whatever but this reverts to the point I made on managing the supply of information and it may be a starting point to consider.</p></speech>

Along with that intent and drawing on Deputy Dara Murphy's point, because freedom of information, FOI, legislation is about serving the public interest in the broadest terms, could consideration also be given that when the freedom of information request is published, the cost of putting it together is placed into the reply?  In other words, were a freedom of information reply to be published in the morning, it would include the cost.  Thereafter, if such requests come that have cost &euro;5,000, one will note it took &euro;15 to get it and &euro;5,000 to produce it.  Perhaps the Minister might consider that in this regard.</p></speech>

The purpose, simply and straightforwardly, is to put in place a time limit.  A request can go into the FOI system, in which, from recollection, there is a requirement to acknowledge it within 28 days or four weeks.  However, it sometimes goes into a never-ending loop thereafter.  In many cases, there is no set time limit as to when the information will come out.  As a public representative, the reason I have proposed a time limit is that public authorities do not like legal timeframes.  The obvious one, with which all members are familiar, is the timeframe by which local authorities must decide on planning applications.  I am quite sure that if that had not been provided for in the legislation, some applications will run until we were all dead and buried.  The existing system, in which there is an initial two-month period, a period for further information, a period for reply and then a period of four weeks by which time a decision must be made, really improves the system no end.  It is probably the bane of planners' lives because they might realise in some weeks that they are obliged-----</p></speech>

I am merely drawing a parallel and that time-limited system works well.  However, in the case of an application that reaches An Bord Plean&aacute;la, that body does not have such a time limit and it keeps extending matters <i>ad nauseam</i>.  The same can happen in this case and I believe the adoption of legal time limits would lead to good public administration.  When a system is left without such limits, matters can be left to run on for ages.  The particular limit I included in this amendment was ten weeks and while some might suggest this is too long and I should have opted for a shorter period, at least it would provide absolute certainty.  I acknowledge people probably would work to the ten-week clock when they saw such a limit in place but I believe it is better to have such a time limit.  I would be satisfied, were the Minister to state he agreed with the principle and would agree to an eight-week time-limit.  As for amendment No. 40, it is the same issue and I seek a time limit in respect of publishing these matters.  The essence of these amendments is a time limit.</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, the Act already provides deadlines for the processing of requests and these are set out.  If the request is straightforward, with, for example, no third-party consultation involved, then the public body must respond within a four-week period.  I would be concerned that the Deputy's proposal would lead to public bodies actually moving towards a ten-week norm, instead of the four weeks.  There are a number of circumstances in which it is permitted to take longer than four weeks.  These include cases in which a request may need to be transferred to another public body, which can add two further weeks to what is promised.  If third parties are involved, an additional three weeks can be added.  If the party does not agree with the release of his or her information in the public interest, then a further two weeks are permitted before release of the records is permitted, to allow for the third party to make an appeal.  If a deposit is required, the clock stops until the requestor pays the deposit.  The public body may negotiate with the requestor, explaining, for whatever genuine reasons, the reason a request cannot be processed within a particular timeframe and a requestor himself or herself may extend the timeframe for a response, if he or she so chooses.  If there is an internal review, the reviewer has three weeks in which to make a decision and even more time is permitted in the event of an appeal to the Information Commissioner.  All this is set out, it is working reasonably well, and I do not discern valid reasons for setting new timelines, particularly ones that, for the generality of requests, might actually prolong, rather than shorten the process.</p></speech>

It is reasonable to have such a provision in the legislation because I can imagine, perhaps in exceptional circumstances, a request would be made of a magnitude that would prove disruptive.  That is fine.</p><p>  I propose to insert with my amendment that &quot;in such an instance the head will consider in consultation with the Minister publishing the requested information no later than six months after the request has been refused&quot;, in other words, rather than simply saying this is causing disruption and is unmanageable at this point and simply making a blanket refusal on that grounds, that there would be a capacity to return to the issue in different circumstances to see whether that information could be provided.  Clearly it would involve a consultation between the head and the Minister.  That is a more reasonable way to proceed.  It is to take a necessary, but blunt, provision and add to it, merely in terms of the effectiveness of FOI.</p></speech>

I am of the view that if the processing of such a request is likely to cause substantial and unreasonable interference with the work of the body concerned, then it is correct that such a refusal be made.  The Deputy has acknowledged that.  If the FOI officer of the body is of the view that processing the request would cause substantial and unreasonable interference and disruption to its work, that would be the case six months hence as well.</p><p>  Another concern I would have is that if somebody makes a request and it is viewed by the information officer of the body concerned that it should be refused on the basis that it is unreasonably disruptive of the work, the person has the right to appeal that to the Information Commissioner.  Where the person appealed it, the independent Information Commissioner might make a determination that it was perfectly correct to refuse it, and yet the body would be required to provide the information under Deputy McDonald's amendment.  That would be unreasonable.</p></speech>

I recognise the right of appeal.  I suppose there are a number of grounds upon which a request might be refused.  For instance, we discussed at some length the issue of commercial sensitivity at yesterday's meeting.  The grounds for this refusal is an excessive administrative burden.  I am suggesting in that instance that there would be something short of a formal appeal which allows for a simple review.  It could be that a review would prove that six months hence the administrative burden or the circumstance of the unit or function are still such that the request is excessively burdensome, but not necessarily so.  Workplaces and units have a rhythm to their work.  They have peaks and troughs.  What could be burdensome in December might not be the case in June.  I am offering this to avoid, if at all possible, a situation where the rationale for refusal is excessive burden and to allow merely that there would be that review process.  It is in an attempt to be helpful to the Minister.</p></speech>

That would be flawed.  There is merit in what Deputy McDonald argues and the Minister's response is comprehensive in respect of why it should not proceed.  Equally, the amendment is flawed in respect of involving the Minister, which would politicise the process and is something we should be getting away from.  Even if we were to accept it, freedom of information officers should not be obliged to consult the Minister.</p></speech>

Where there is a decision that the request is so unreasonable that it would be disruptive of the work and that is a discernment made, the correct approach is to address it at that level.</p><p>  One aspect in all the discussions I have had of late is something I have instituted in my own Department.  Sometimes one gets FOIs which are not clear on what the requester is looking for.  What happens is that significant chunks of information are gathered on the basis the staff hopes that within all of this the information is there.  What I hope we will be working towards instead is that the freedom of information officer - this will be a matter for the training - will telephone, for instance, Deputy McDonald, to ask what specifically she needs so that the officer can identify it, and address it in that way.  If it is not possible in terms of a request like this and it would be disruptive, then the correct procedure is for that to be appealed to the independent Information Commissioner.  That is the process.</p><p>  There should not be a parallel process.  It certainly should not involve the Minister.  I do not want to be involved at all in those determinations.  I have enough on my plate, but I thank Deputy McDonald very much.  It would not be proper in any event.</p> <p>Even with somebody else involved, there is an established mechanism for determining these matters, namely the mechanism of appeal to the Information Commissioner.</p></speech>

The ability to refuse a request on set administrative grounds is not a new provision but has been in the legislation since 1997.  The Information Commissioner specifically supports the provision.  The outgoing commissioner made this clear.  There needs to be a clear administrative basis for making a refusal.</p><p>  The question on frivolous or vexatious requests arises in respect of a number of legal instruments.  There are definitions that we can provide.  I am advised that there are very few occasions on which the measures on frivolous or vexatious requests are invoked.

Similarly, an FOI officer should state the reason for refusal to the maker of a vexatious claim and direct the latter to where he may gain an understanding of what is meant by &ldquo;vexatious&rdquo;.

We should not be conflating a vexatious request with one that is a little difficult, annoying, embarrassing or persistent.  For example, one cannot have a vexatious requester.  The Commons justice committee examined how someone who made a lot of freedom of application requests could be classified as a vexatious requester.  That is a point we strongly argue against.  Just because someone makes a lot of requests does not necessarily mean they are not valid or valuable.  Just because a person may have made a vexatious request once before does not mean future requests will be vexatious.</blockquote>He gave an example of a request to all councils in Britain on how much they spent on biscuits, which request one could construe as vexatious.

I am simply reminding the Minister of what Mr. Hammond said.  He made the point that what the Minister, I or a majority here might consider to be vexatious might be considered very important by the individual making the request.  He stated that we should not second-guess the individual's right to gain access to that information.  The point Mr. Hammond is making is that the notion of the vexatious requester is so problematic that we should not use it at all.</p><p>  Mr. Hammond stated that there is no evidence that if there is no provision blocking so-called vexatious requests, there would be a massive avalanche of so-called vexatious requests.  Therefore, the presumption should be one of free access to information.  Mr. Hammond, the expert witness called in by the committee, was absolutely spot-on in that regard.  The clause should be removed because its interpretation is too subjective.</p></speech>

I am aware of an individual who decided that he did not like a particular planning authority and declared publicly that he would forever more appeal every planning application granted by that local authority other than applications for a garden shed.</p> <p>When one makes that declaration in advance, obviously one is not looking at the merit of any other things.  One can construe that as a vexatious view.  There are issues where people can put in so many freedom of information requests on a small outfit that it would stop it functioning.  That goes back to the previous discussions.</p><p> I am advised that this has been used in our system very rarely.

This particular wording gives a hell of a lot of discretion for people to make quite a subjective judgment about people or issues that they may be annoyed by.  They may consider them to be frivolous and vexatious, but the requestor may genuinely consider them to be really important.  The point that Mr. Hammond made was that the bar should be very high.  If the Minister believes that section must be included, he should consider reframing it in such as a way that it is made clear that the bar is very high.  I do not know how we would put it.

More to the point, I ask the Minister and his officials to re-examine and pick apart the wording of the section because it is subjective in its nature.

They have been in existence since 1997 and have not caused a difficulty.  I do not think anybody here has heard of a difficulty concerning them.  The Information Commissioner has given guidelines on what would constitute "frivolous" and "vexatious" requests.  We will incorporate those into the guidelines we give to all information officers when we get to that point.</p><p>  "Manifestly unreasonable" is a very strong term.  It does not just refer to "unreasonable".  Beyond that, it is not only that the request is manifestly unreasonable, but it has to be a pattern of manifestly unreasonable requests.  There have not been issues concerning that terminology.  When these things arise - and they are rare - there has to be some mechanism whereby requests which are demonstrably vexatious can be refused.  Whether or not that refusal is correct can be objectively tested through the Information Commissioner and, if necessary, through the courts.

I accept the Minister's important point that we are not all hearing from serious freedom of information people that this is something that is being abused.  None the less, given Deputy Creed's point, in individual cases an information officer somewhere could abuse something that is open to interpretation.  I was thinking about the example used by the Minister of a person who has stated that they will oppose every planning application.  We deal with similar wonderful characters in Wicklow.  Even though they have stated they will do this, is the Minister saying we are going to deny them the right they have as a citizen to do this because we do not think they are serious about it and, in fact, they have said they are doing it for reasons we do not deem to be correct or appropriate.  On that basis, I wonder if we are not entering dangerous territory by denying them the rights that other citizens have.</p></speech>

We all have rights, but we must site things in the general public good.  I am advised that it is very rarely used.  If this section was to be used in the future, the individual would have the right of appeal to the independent authority - the Office of the Information Commissioner.  If the individual was not satisfied at that stage, he or she could have the matter adjudicated on by the courts.  We have a very open system of public administration.  If this is a rare issue, we need to provide for it, but that it would never arise is not a reasonable conclusion to reach.  There must be protections for the general good where it does arise.  If there is a situation where a section might be abused, that is why we have the checks and balances of the appeals mechanisms throughout this process.</p></speech>

I just want to discuss them.  As I looked at them, I thought there was good stuff in them if I was an officer or an official who just did not want to give out any information.  We have talked about section 15(1)(<i>c</i>) which states that a request may be refused if:<blockquote><br />In the opinion of the head, granting the request would, by reason of the number or nature of the records concerned or the nature of the information concerned, require the retrieval and examination of such number of records or an examination of such kind of the records concerned as to cause a substantial and unreasonable interference with or disruption of work (including disruption of work in a particular functional area) of the FOI body concerned.</blockquote>In a very small team an FOI request that is not mammoth could cause what the person in charge might consider to be interference or disruption of the work of the team.  Let us say it was a very small team and the request took up a few days of its time.  Are there guidelines on what constitutes a substantial and unreasonable interference with or disruption of work?</p></speech>

Donnelly one case that this committee would deal with.  There are requirements under law regarding information on bank statistics and targets which are subject to omerta because of stock exchange rules.  For example, when we were looking for the banks to come before the committee in July after the targets had been set, we could not see them until September owing to stock exchange and company law.  One could argue that because AIB is under State control, one should be able to request those statistics under FOI legislation, but there is a requirement in law that does not allow one to receive that information.  This committee which was anxious to see the banks could not see the statistics until September because of the same requirement.</p></speech>

It is not something about which I am terribly concerned, but I would like an explanation.  It relates to section 16(1)(<i>c</i>) which states there is a deferral on the basis that the record concerned is held by a Department of State where the record or part thereof or any matter to which it relates is of such interest to the public generally that he or she intends to inform either or both Houses of the Oireachtas of the contents of the record or part thereof.</p> <p>It seems convenient to a given Minister of State.  I am slightly nervous about this because it gives a Minister or a Minister of State a get-out clause.  If a brilliant FOI request finds something, the Minister can get out ahead of it.  It is quite loose: "the record or part thereof or any matter to which it relates".  It allows the Minister to go into the Seanad, say something vaguely related to one part of the record and then it can be deferred.  It seems handy.</p></speech>

The intention and implications of the original provision were questioned by some commentators following publication of the Bill.  It was clear from their comments that there was confusion surrounding the provision as set out in the Bill.  I want to address that issue.</p><p>  The provision, as originally drafted and included in the published Bill, was designed to take account of technological developments since the 1997 Act in so far as the searching for and extracting records from data banks was concerned.  We had a discussion about this issue on Second Stage.  The provision was intended to confirm that FOI bodies were required to take reasonable steps to search for and extract electronic data using the search and extraction facility available to them, but they were not required to develop new programmes or code to interrogate databases.  Since the current Act is silent on this issue, public bodies have found it necessary on occasion to have programmes coded to meet particular FOI requests which often do not seek particular official records but rather request information that can sometimes only be obtained by interrogating data banks of official information requiring analysis of the records contained in them.</p><p>  In addition, the current legislation provides for access to official records which are available and do not require the creation of new records.  This provision can represent an impediment in responding to FOI requests as the argument could be made that extracting information from a data bank of necessity required the creation of a new record.  To continue to provide access to the extracted data from data banks of electronic records, the amendment allows bodies to reproduce the relevant data in a new record and in such cases the record shall be deemed to have been created on the date of receipt of the request.  The proposed amendment is intended to make the same provision, but it uses more straightforward text.</p></speech>

I am sure that is not the intention, but the amendment states, "being steps that involve the use of any facility for electronic search or extraction that existed on the date of the request".

Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly is talking about the mechanism to extract the data.  I presume that would be fully covered.  The issue is reasonableness.  If it is extraordinarily convoluted and complicated to write new code to extract the data, that is a reasonable line for refusal.  I do not understand the systems to which the Deputy refers, but normal interrogation systems to extract the data and provide it by creating a new record are perfectly provided for.</p></speech>

One of my requests has been the subject of such a review and in fairness to the person who wrote the review, it was fine and thorough.  It should not be charged for, but we will get to that issue later.  Two of the committee's recommendations are tangentially related to this issue.  The first was that a user group be set up to review the operation of the legislation, while the second was that an oversight group be set up within public bodies, which is related to the section.  Is the Minister considering the establishment of a user group to review how all of this will play out in the coming months?  Did he do anything about the recommendation to establish an internal oversight group to do the same from the perspective of officials?</p></speech>

The amount of a charge under this subsection shall be equal to the estimated cost of the search for and retrieval and copying of the record concerned by the FOI body concerned for the requester.<br />(3) For the purposes of <i>subsection (2)</i> &ldquo;search and retrieval&rdquo; includes time spent by the FOI body in&mdash;<blockquote>(<i>a</i>) determining whether it holds the information requested,<br />(<i>b</i>) locating the information or documents containing the information,<br />(<i>c</i>) retrieving such information or documents,<br />(<i>d</i>) extracting the information from the files, documents, electronic or other information sources containing both it and other material not relevant to the request, and<br />(<i>e</i>) preparing a schedule specifying the records for consideration for release.</blockquote>(4) For the purposes of <i>subsection (2)</i>&mdash;<blockquote>(<i>a</i>) the amount of the cost of the search for and retrieval of a record shall be calculated at the rate of such amount per hour as stands prescribed for the time being in respect of the time that was spent, or ought, in the opinion of the head concerned, to have been spent, by each person concerned in carrying out the search and retrieval efficiently,<br />(<i>b</i>) the amount of the cost of the copying of a record shall not exceed such amount (if any) as stands prescribed for the time being, and the determination of that amount shall be in compliance with any provisions standing prescribed for the time being in relation to such determination,<br />(<i>c</i>) the total amount of a charge under <i>subsection (2)</i> shall not exceed the maximum amount prescribed for the time being as the appropriate limit for search and retrieval and copying,<br />(<i>d</i>) there shall be no charge under <i>subsection (2)</i> if, in the opinion of the head concerned, the total amount of the charge would be less than the amount (if any) as stands prescribed for the time being as the appropriate search and retrieval and copying minimum, and<br />(<i>e</i>) different maximum and minimum amounts may be prescribed under this section in respect of public bodies and prescribed bodies.</blockquote>(5) Where the record or records concerned contains or contain only personal information relating to the requester concerned&mdash;<blockquote>(<i>a</i>) no fee under <i>subsection (1)</i> shall be payable, and<br />(<i>b</i>) the search and retrieval and copying charge under <i>subsection (2)</i> shall be disregarded unless the grant concerned relates to a significant number of records.</blockquote>(6) Subject to <i>subsection (4)</i>, where, in the opinion of the head concerned, the estimated cost, as determined by the head, of the search for and retrieval and copying of a record<br />the subject of an FOI request is likely to exceed the appropriate minimum level as prescribed&mdash;<blockquote>(<i>a</i>) a deposit of such amount as may be determined by the head (not being less than 20 per cent of such cost) shall be charged by the FOI body concerned and paid by the requester concerned to the body,<br />(<i>b</i>) the process of search for and retrieval of the record shall not be commenced by the body until the deposit has been paid, and<br />(<i>c</i>) the head shall, not later than 2 weeks after the receipt of the request aforesaid, cause a request in writing for payment of the deposit to be given to the requester and the document shall include an estimate of the length of time that the process of searching for and retrieving the record will occupy and a statement that the process will not begin until the deposit has been paid and that the date on which a decision will be made in relation to the request will be determined by reference to the date of such payment.</blockquote>(7) A head may reduce the amount of or waive a search and retrieval and copying charge or deposit under <i>subsection (2)</i> or <i>(5)</i> if, in his or her opinion, some or all of the information contained in the record concerned would be of particular assistance to the understanding of an issue of national importance.<br />(8) In a case to which <i>subsection (6)</i> applies, the head concerned shall, if so requested by the requester concerned&mdash;<blockquote>(<i>a</i>) assist the requester if the requester wishes to amend or limit the request in order to reduce or eliminate the charges that arise or are likely to arise under <i>subsection (2)</i>,<br />(<i>b</i>) if amendments are specified under <i>paragraph (a)</i>, make such of them (if any) to the request as the requester may determine.</blockquote>(9) Where a deposit under <i>subsection (6)</i> is paid, the amount of the charge under <i>subsection (2)</i> payable in respect of the grant of the FOI request concerned shall be reduced by the amount of the deposit.<br />(10) Where a deposit under<i> subsection (6)</i> is paid and, subsequently, the grant of the FOI request concerned is refused or is granted in relation to a part only of the record concerned, the amount of the deposit or, if a charge under this section is payable in respect of the grant, so much (if any) of that amount as exceeds the amount of the charge shall be repaid to the requester concerned. <br />(11) Where a charge or a deposit under this section is paid and, subsequently, the charge or deposit is annulled or varied under <i>section 21</i>, <i>22</i> or <i>24</i>, the amount of the charge or deposit so annulled or, as the case may be, any amount thereof in excess of the amount thereof as so varied shall be repaid to the requester concerned.<br />(12) <i>Section 13(1)</i> shall be construed and have effect&mdash;<blockquote>(<i>a</i>) in relation to a case in which a deposit is payable under <i>subsection (6)</i>, as if the reference to 4 weeks were a reference to a period consisting of 4 weeks together with the period from the giving of the request under <i>subsection (6)</i> concerned to the requester concerned to the date of the receipt of the deposit,<br />(<i>b</i>) in relation to a case in which such a deposit is annulled following a review under <i>section 21</i> or <i>22</i> or an appeal under <i>section 24</i>, as if the reference to 4 weeks were a reference to a period consisting of 4 weeks together with the period from the giving of the request under <i>subsection (6)</i> to the requester concerned to the date of the decision under <i>section 24</i> or, as the case may be, of the giving to the requester concerned of notice under <i>section 21</i> or <i>22</i> of the decision, and<br />(<i>c</i>) in relation to a case in which an amendment pursuant to <i>subsection (8)</i> has the effect of eliminating such a deposit, as if the reference to the receipt of a request under that section were a reference to the making of the amendment.</blockquote>(13) Where the amount of a search and retrieval and copying charge under <i>subsection (2)</i> exceeds or is likely to exceed the maximum amount prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph&mdash;<blockquote>(<i>a</i>) the body concerned shall so inform the requester,<br />(<i>b</i>) the body shall assist the requester if the requester wishes to amend or limit the request in order to reduce the charges that arise or are likely to arise under <i>subsection (2)</i> to an amount less than or equal to the amount prescribed under this subsection,<br />(<i>c</i>) if the requester does not amend or limit the request such that the charges that arise or are likely to arise under <i>subsection (2)</i> are reduced to an amount less than or equal to the amount prescribed under this subsection, the body may refuse the request, and<br />(<i>d</i>) where the body decides to process the request, the requester shall be required to pay the full cost of the charges likely and <i>subsection (6)</i> shall apply.</blockquote>(14) An FOI body shall endeavour to establish a facility by which payment or refund of any fees due under this Act may be made electronically.&quot;.</blockquote>I have indicated to the committee my intention to withdraw.  The amendment relates to the introduction of a cap of &euro;500 on freedom of information search and retrieval fees.  The intention of the amendment from the point of view of requesters and public bodies was that there was a sharp focus on the estimation of freedom of information requests that would require up to 25 hours of search and retrieval time.  If the time spent examining records by the decision maker were included, this could account for approximately seven days' administrative work.</p><p>   The concept of a cap, as members of the committee will recall, was first suggested by Deputy Fleming in his Private Members' Bill on freedom of information.  Having reflected on the provision further, in light of the debate on the application fee, my assessment is that the same objective can be achieved by allowing a public body make the case, if it considers it appropriate, that a request exceeding the threshold of 25 hours in search and retrieval time, and &euro;500 in fees, is voluminous, and such a request can be refused on this basis under the relevant provisions of the Bill.  I propose retaining the &euro;500 cap on maximum search and retrieval fees and removing the provision allowing a public body refuse a request on the basis that the search and retrieval costs to the body would be above &euro;500.</p> <p>This will complement the further provision included in this amendment to provide that the first number of hours of search and retrieval time be free of charge to the requester, as I have indicated.  This is a significant confirmation of the fundamental objective of the legislation to facilitate access to public information to the greatest extent possible, consistent with the public interest.  It is my intention after this debate to withdraw the amendment and restate it with the cap but removing the capacity of the public body to refuse to process an application that would involve work beyond the 25 hours or the &euro;500 cap.</p></speech>

On Second Stage of that Bill I detailed the replies of a parliamentary question to every Department on the maximum and average fee charged for search and retrieval.  Some of the averages were approximately &euro;7.  One or two exceptional cases were in thousands of euro.  My concern was when a requester was told a search and retrieval fee would be &euro;3,000.  I put in a request once to the Department of Finance and was told that the search and retrieval fee was &euro;1,200, so I abandoned my request.  That is how I have first-hand experience and believe there should be a cap.  The Department of Social Protection does not charge a search and retrieval fee, as the overwhelming majority - although not all - information would be personal.  It is important that in the code of practice, Departments are told that &euro;500 should not be a standard search and retrieval fee.  It should be the cap.</p></speech>

It is moot as to whether it should be &euro;500 or a lower figure at this point.  The ceiling will give great certainty to people putting in a request, and they will not get a bill for &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000.</p></speech>

I am going to be discussing the amendment as it stands but without the paragraph described by the Minister.  That is section 17(13)(<i>c</i>), although there may be other bits and pieces.</p><p>  I and others disagree with an upfront fee for a variety of reasons.  The Minister has indicated two reasons to the committee for having a fee regime.  The first is that in the current economic reality, where citizens are being asked to undergo much hardship as public services must be reduced in certain areas, it would be unreasonable to take away the fees of the freedom of information regime.  A second reason, as given at the start of the meeting, is that this would also help manage the workload when the new Bill comes in.  Are these the two reasons for the fees?</p></speech>

There is a real cost to doing this.</p> <p>Asking people who avail of a service to contribute to its cost is a principle that I do not disagree with.  If we were in the time when, as a T&aacute;naiste of long ago described it, the country was awash with money, we might have a different focus.  As of now, we are required to charge for a variety of services, many of which I would like to see to delivered free, but it is reasonable to maintain that principle. </p><p> Much was made of my comment about managing the process.  That is done to ensure that the service we provide and the expanded requirement that is implicit in the legislation is delivered and that we are not being tokenistic by providing a legislative base for a service that we do not have the resources to provide.  In essence, when the legislation is enacted I want to provide the service that we have promised in it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.506" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1107" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="18:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22013111300018#T00200"><p>I thank the Minister.  The first issue is cost, which comprises two separate aspects.  The first is an issue of principle which says that as one is availing of a public service, it is reasonable that one contributes to the cost of or pays for the service.  I contend that such a measure amounts to double taxation because we will already have paid for the service through taxes.  One would not expect a garda to say to a person who reports a crime that the additional work will incur a fee, or a social welfare officer to tell the person who goes into a social welfare office to get something processed that he or she will have to pay a fee.  It is fine that the Minister and I disagree about the matter.  In my opinion, access by citizens to information held by public bodies for which they already pay is a service that has already been paid for.  I would prefer to see a regime under which the only additional cost - as in international best practice - is a that of reproduction, be it photocopying or whatever.  That is simply my opinion.</p><p>  The second aspect is quite relevant, regardless of one's opinion.  Dr. Nat O'Connor has provided analysis that suggests that the revenue generated by charging fees is used entirely to administer their collection.  Does the Minister have data on the total projected revenue from the proposed fee structure?  Has it been compared with the total estimated cost of administering the fee structure?</p></speech>

The claim that one has already paid for a service is an argument that can be applied at will.</p><p>  We will bring in a new fees regime but we do not know how much revenue will be generated.  As the Deputy can see from the attached schedule of fees, we will charge a fixed &euro;15 fee that has been place since 2003, and we will reduce the fee for appeal, including the review fee and the fee for appeal to the information commissioner.  I do not know what the take will be.  The cost structure depends on the organisation.  It would be onerous to embark on the analysis.</p><p>  I have not read the TASC report referenced by the Deputy, but perhaps the officials accompanying me have done so.</p></speech>

Of course if one sets up a new fee regime one expects that it will be a plus to the State.

It is a structural break and we do not know what the consequences will be.  I do not know whether all of the publicity generated will result in vast interest and an increase in FOI applications.</p><p>  With loads of respect to the Chair, we are saying that this is the regime and one can accept or reject it, but to parse and analyse it in the way the Deputy is trying to do will take us all night and will have little effect.

Clearly, analysis has not been carried out.  The Minister clearly said there had been no analysis.  Dr. Nat O'Connor has carried out an analysis and concluded that the fees regime was cost-neutral.  I do not know whether it is cost-neutral.</p> <p>If it is cost neutral, the first argument, that we cannot afford to do this because it comes at too much cost to the State, is a nonsense.  Maybe it is not a nonsense but the Minister cannot back it up as a credible argument.</p><p> The second argument concerns the workload.  The Minister said that he is bringing in a new regime and that the fees will help to deal with the workload and the volume.  In 2003, the introduction of fees by Fianna F&aacute;il halved the number of freedom of information requests.  It is reasonable to assume the fees regime will significantly reduce the volume of requests.</p></speech>

It concerns electronic versus paper records.  I talked to someone involved in trying to retrieve a record.  It was a 400-page document and the answer the person received was that a charge would cover the cost of finding, retrieving and printing a 400-page document.  Someone else had seen that the official in question had the document in electronic format.  It probably does not happen very often but it is a single example.  Is the Minister satisfied there is sufficient meat in the legislation to stop this happening, whereby fees are applied as if documents were paper records when, in fact, the electronic version is available?</p></speech>

We will have a single code of practice and all freedom of information officers will be trained in it.  We will have simplicity and consumer focus in respect of training.  I have said repeatedly that a freedom of information officer will propose that a document can be sent electronically and ask whether that would be better and have a dialogue about whether the person wants all of it or part.</p></speech>

If the information is held in an Excel document, the difficulty in issuing an Excel document is that it is open to further manipulation.  Someone can insert new figures into an Excel document and it can be transferred onwards.  The concern raised is that if information is provided in electronic format it should be issued in a format that is closed, like a PDF.  The person can get a copy of it but it cannot be manipulated.  The committee's recommendation was to provide records in machine-readable formats.  That is the concern of the committee.</p></speech>

Opposition Members cannot propose amendments that amount to a charge on the Exchequer.  The amendment states "An FOI body shall establish a facility by which payment or refund of any fees due under this Act may be made electronically".  I am pleased to see that the Minister has inserted, at the end of the amendment No. 53, "An FOI body shall endeavour to establish a facility by which payment or refund of any fees due under this Act may be made electronically".  It is not verbatim, or an absolute commitment with the phrase "endeavour", but it is almost the same as my amendment.</p><p>  The Minister has taken my amendment and has added a word to give himself a bit of latitude.  I acknowledge that although my amendment was ruled out of order, the Minister has taken the exact same amendment on board.  It is important to say that because we give the Minister grief if we are not happy and we may as well recognise when the Minister does something good.</p><p>  We have not yet come to amendment No. 57, which was also ruled out of order.  Amendment No. 57 deals with cases where the records concern only personal information and suggests no search and retrieval fee should apply.  In our discussion a few minutes earlier, the Minister said he wanted to provide for cases where there was a substantial amount of information.  I am sure the Minister will be prepared to reconsider this point.  The Minister tabled amendment No. 53, which states that the search and retrieval and copying charge under subsection (2) shall be disregarded unless the grant concerned relates to a significant number of records.  I was asking for no search and retrieval fees for personal requests.  In this amendment, the Minister provides for a search and retrieval fee if it amounts to a significant number of records.</p><p>  I draw the attention of the Minister to the legislation as published and as discussed on Second Stage.  Until last Friday, the legislation had the following provision in respect of search and retrieval fees in cases where someone makes a personal request.</p> <p>The section states the fees for search and retrieval shall be disregarded for a personal request if, in the opinion of the head concerned, it would not be reasonable, having regard to the means of the requester and the nature of the record concerned, to include the cost specified in that paragraph.  Up to last Thursday, the legislation stated that if the head of the section believed it was reasonable, having regard to the means of the person, not charge any search and retrieval fees, he need not do so.  The Minister's amendment now states that the head can charge a fee if there is a significant amount of records involved.  Will the Minister go back to what was in the legislation?  He is creating another row for himself by introducing search and retrieval fees where there is a large amount of records involved and where it is personal information.</p><p> It is important that when this legislation is passed, the Minister can say there are no fees, whether for applications or search and retrieval for one's own personal information.  That is the way it was until last Thursday.  The head had the discretion not to charge fees.  Will the Minister give the head the discretion he had until last Thursday?  He is after opening up a row for himself by introducing a fee for search and retrieval of personal information.  Bad and all as what we did in 2003, we did not make specific provision for a fee for search and retrieval of personal information.  We left personal information-----</p></speech>

There is no point in crafting legislation and giving people all sorts of rights which we do not have the wherewithal to deliver so people are on their own.  We have done that too often in the past.</p></speech>

I also put it to him that there is another reason.  In regard to the economic climate, the Minister told Deputy Donnelly he cannot make an estimate of the cost.  I refer to the evidence given by the former Ombudsman,  Ms Emily O'Reilly.  She said we currently get &euro;85,000 per year.  The number of areas covered by freedom of information has been expanded but surely we can make some sort of estimate.  Let us say it doubles or even trebles, is it not fair to say the amount of money about which we are talking is really quite negligible?  It is hard for me to understand how one can make a claim on economic or financial grounds for the retention of the fee when the money about which were are talking is so small.  What is the worst case scenario?  Is it a quadrupling of the volume?  Will the Minister comment on that point because the money seems so small?</p></speech>

There is a real cost.  Is the Deputy saying we should recoup more of the cost so that would bite better?  I am saying the economic reality of the times require a contribution for the service to be made by the service user.</p></speech>

I am reading directly from Ms Emily O'Reilly's evidence.  She said the total amount of money between research, search and retrieval fees amounts to &euro;85,000 in a year.  Even if it quadrupled under the new regime, which I do not think it would, the Minister cannot seriously claim, in terms of the Government's finances, that this is a significant amount of money, although it would be for an individual.</p></speech>

I am not saying it will solve the national debt but in a climate where we are charging for basic services, it is reasonable to ask for a contribution, however small, to be made towards the cost of freedom of information.  That is my principled position.  I was in the Seanad today dealing with the legislation on reducing by 10% the leaders' allowance, which we will now call the parliamentary activities allowance.  That reduction will not make an enormous contribution but it is important in terms of giving the signal that we are reducing things.</p><p>  There is a real cost for services.  If we are going to charge for other basic services, many of which I would not like to have to charge, it is reasonable to maintain a charge system for freedom of information in the current climate.  That is the point I have been making repeatedly.</p></speech>

The leaders of political parties get it while Independents get a different allowance.  All parties get a leaders' allowance per Deputy, something which the Minister sometimes does not mention.  The bigger parties get a bonus on top of that but let us not get into that.  That is a contentious area and some people would say politicians get too much.</p><p>  The purpose of this Bill, according to the Government, is to give the public access to information.  Therefore, if the money the Government is likely to drive is very small, but acts as an impediment to members of the public getting the information, then it is self-defeating in terms of the Bill.</p> <p>It is self-defeating in terms of the Bill and I will quote what Ms Emily O'Reilly, whom everyone praised as a wonderful Ombudsman, said in that regard: "The fee is an impediment to the public seeking records".  What she said is very straightforward - the fee is an impediment.  Does the Minister accept what she said?</p></speech>

I am speaking to the Minister's amendment, which I accept he is withdrawing.  I welcome that he is withdrawing this piece but that is as far as my welcome can go.  The Minister has referred to the issue of the fees as though it were a distraction or some bogus attempt to undermine or attack what is otherwise very good legislation.  Given that the Minister is withdrawing this element for redrafting, I put it to him that the reason the fees issue is so contentious and has been the subject of such long debate is that it cuts to the very heart of the commitment to freedom of information.  We know, and I am sure the Minister accepts, that in 2003, when Fianna F&aacute;il introduced this fee, freedom of information requests halved in the following year.  Nobody is challenging that.  It is an established matter of fact.  We do not have to speculate but know that the mere fact of a fee reduces the likelihood of individuals making freedom of information requests.  That is also a matter of established fact.</p><p>  I want to support this legislation and was extremely pleased to read in the programme for Government the commitment to reinstate full freedom of information.  That meant, for me and many others, by definition, a removal of any form of fee.  Unfortunately, the Minister has chosen not to do that.  I do not fully understand why although I am not going to exacerbate the situation by inviting the Minister to set out his position again.  He has cited reasons related to economics, fairness and management, none of which really add up.  The legislation contains significant checks and balances in terms of limiting freedom of information in the context of commercial sensitivity, vexatious or frivolous requests or where freedom of information requests impose such an administrative burden as to be disruptive.  All of those checks, balances and limitations are built in and should be sufficient to address any concerns the Minister may have about the prudent management of the system.</p><p>  The introduction of a fee, as the Minister is well aware, is a straight-up mechanism to depress demand and, as the NUJ might put it, to keep the light out.  It is a huge mistake on the Minister's part.  I do not say that to be patronising in any way because I know these are matters the Minister has considered long and hard.  I do not question his commitment but believe he is making a very big mistake.  The amount of revenue that might be returned to the State in respect of the fees must be balanced against the administrative burden involved in collecting those fees, particularly in the context of a civil and public service that is already under strain because of cutbacks and so on.  That has not been weighed up.  For me, this is a matter of principle.  I am not trying to be pedantic, to give the Minister a headache or to keep us in this committee room until all hours.  This is a fundamental mistake and goes against the very essence and grain of what the Minister is doing.  It is a mistake to maintain fees introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il in 2003 in a very deliberate ploy to halt the flow of information, which they succeeded in doing.  We have the evidence to show that.  This is a huge mistake on the Minister's part, especially if he is serious about open government, a principle which I support.  If he brings forward proposals for more open government, I will support him, of that he can be sure.  Not for one second, however, could I support a regime that attaches an additional charge to a citizen, journalist or anyone else for seeking out public information that rightfully belongs within the public domain.  It is outrageous and I cannot understand why the Minister has come to this position.  I am not inviting a long narrative on that but am genuinely surprised that it is the case.</p></speech>

I understand Deputy McDonald's position.</p> <p>She has restated it, but I do not want her to misrepresent the position of a Bill or of the Government.  Virtually every regime I have looked at has some sort of fee structure.  Some have basic fees for administration and photocopying while some have more elaborate search and retrieval fees.  There have been fees attached to the FOI regime since the then Minister, Eithne FitzGerald, brought it in.  We have decided to retain the up-front fee but, in acknowledgement of that, to give the first two hours of search and retrieval - which was to be charged at &euro;21 per hour - free.  For the vast bulk of simple requests, one will get two hours' work for the up-front fee of &euro;15.  We are reducing all the other appeal fees significantly, so I do not think it is fair to characterise it as anything but a reduction in fees.</p><p> I have made my point on the requirement to have some level of contribution to the actual cost, which is a real cost to an administrative system that, as we have acknowledged, has involved a greatly increased workload in recent times because of the financial situation we are in.  I think it would be reasonable to maintain some contribution to that.  Perhaps in the future we will be able to revisit these issues when our economic fortunes improve.  To have it characterised in any other way is unfair.</p></speech>

In 2009, &euro;115,000 was collected in fees from FOI.  Under reasonable assumptions, about &euro;64,000 was from the up-front fee of &euro;15.  Using a conservative assumption of a processing charge of &euro;7 per fee, the net gain to the Exchequer from the up-front fees in 2009 would have been about &euro;34,000.</p><p>  The analysis I mentioned earlier used less conservative assumptions and found that the net gain was zero.  We are talking about a potential net gain to the Exchequer of &euro;30,000 to &euro;35,000 from a regime that virtually no other country has and that is explicitly against the recommendations of the OECD and the EU.  I think it is worth sharing with members the amount of money involved.</p></speech>

It is their view, but there is more to the issue than the quantum of money.  In the current economic regime in which we are living, it is reasonable to expect, as we do for other services, a contribution to the real net cost.  The fact is that I am reducing the fees across the board, except for the up-front fee, which has not been increased.</p><p>  The argument could be made for dramatically increasing the fees, as the take is so low so that it would be worthwhile to do it.  I will not go down that road.</p></speech>

I concur with the view put forward by a person who I consider to be expert in the area, the former Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly.  In her view, the reason the fee was introduced was to dampen people's ardour for seeking public records.  It certainly worked.  Retaining the fee will have that effect, notwithstanding the fact that I accept that the Bill moves things forward.  Charges are being reduced in some areas, but I echo the point made by Ms O'Reilly: as long as we retain the up-front charge it can have no other effect than to dampen people's ardour for seeking out public information.  I believe the Minister knows that.</p></speech>

The manner in which policy decisions are made, and the equality impacts and outcomes associated with them, as assessed, have been the subject of live and ongoing debate for some time.  I am proposing that a new section providing that freedom of information bodies &quot;shall provide information regarding policy decisions and actions, to include but not exclusive to financial decisions and service delivery which impact on citizens in all instances,&quot; be inserted before section 28, which relates to meetings of the Government.  It would be good to include in this legislation a provision that will ensure citizens can use the freedom of information mechanisms to interrogate and get information on issues relating to decisions that have an impact on their circumstances or those of particular identifiable sectors of society, such as people with disabilities or women.  Along with other Deputies, I intend to continue to argue for mechanisms such as equality budgeting.  This is not the appropriate forum at which to rehearse that precise argument.  Nonetheless, I believe this amendment would add significantly to the legislation.</p></speech>

One of the main areas I have addressed relates to the treatment of Government records under section 28.  In that regard, section 28 now provides that the mandatory power to refuse a freedom of information request relating to Government records or records to be submitted to the Government, which was introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il in the 2003 legislation, is being removed and the discretionary power contained in the original Act is being restored.  The five-year rule for the release of Government records is also being restored.  The strict definition of what constitutes a Cabinet record and the definition of "government" are also being restored to what they were under the original Act.  The anomaly created in 2003 by the creation of a mandatory exemption for Cabinet records containing factual information which is already largely in the public domain is being reversed, and communications between members of the Government will also no longer be exempt.  Although I have reversed those unwelcome amendments that were introduced in 2003, I accept that there is an inherent need to protect sensitive Government records for a certain period of time.  Five years seems reasonable to me in that regard.  Exemptions are also needed to protect Cabinet confidentiality, as provided for in the Constitution, and the doctrine of collective responsibility.  I believe the protections afforded in the original 1997 Act, which we are restoring, constitute the correct way to proceed in the case of Government records.</p></speech>

As the Deputy has outlined, Ministers have many opportunities to provide information to the public on policy decisions and actions.  She will be aware that after the Government has made a decision on a policy issue, it is the practice for Ministers to make a detailed announcement, for the most part detailing what is intended in the policy proposal and outlining how much it will cost.  In the case of legislation, the practice is to conduct a regulatory impact assessment, which sets out details of the policy options and the expected cost to the Exchequer.  When the general scheme of a Bill has been agreed, the matter is discussed in the relevant Oireachtas committee as part of the new system of pre-legislative scrutiny.  All aspects of the policy can be considered in that context.  Of course it is up to the committees to bring Ministers before them at any time to discuss any policy issue.  I have asked various working groups in my Department to talk about policies such as the public service reform agenda.  That is done as a matter of routine.</p></speech>

It is all true.  I am asking whether it would be a good thing, notwithstanding all of the other parliamentary channels that exist, if this legislation provided explicitly that people could - in the here and now or retrospectively - obtain information relating to a policy decision, such as whether factors such as possible equality impacts were considered when that policy decision was being made.</p></speech>

The provisions of those two sections are being merged into section 42(l) in amendment No. 74 while section 32(1)(c) is being deleted.  The first part of amendment No. 74 merely provides for an amendment to the FOI Act 1997, which exempts from FOI certain papers within the meaning of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013, in lines which are proposed for deletion in section 32.  In amendment No. 65 the lines are being amalgamated with the text of section 42 in amendment No. 74.  The reason for this is that the protections currently afforded under section 32 are such that records might lead to the revelation or an identity of a person who has given information in confidence to an FOI body in respect of the administration and enforcement of the civil law and that may be refused.  There is a similar provision in section 42 which provides that the FOI does not apply to records which might lead to the revelation or the identity of a person who has given information in confidence to an FOI body in respect of the administration and enforcement of criminal law.</p></speech>

I had a case where a person sought personal information from the Department of Social Protection as to why he or she was refused illness benefit payment.  I advised the person to get a copy of the file from the Department in order to see what the medical assessment showed.  It took a long time to come through, the reason being that the applicant's doctor had completed a medical assessment and this is deemed to be information provided by a third party.  The doctor had to be asked if the information he released about his patient could be made available to his patient.  I put quite a loop and a hoop in the system when I said that on Second Stage.  Perhaps the case was dealt with by an over-zealous person in the Department and it went to a very high level.  Week after week we were getting clearance, we were told there were FOI issues and that, in effect, it was information provided by a third party.  Perhaps the doctor did not want to release to the patient the report he or she felt entitled to.  That was my suspicion of what happened in the case.  Perhaps the Minister would deal with that issue.  I will not force a vote on the issue.  I have made the point and I think the Minister understands it.</p></speech>

A head may refuse to grant an FOI request for several items which are listed - national interest, foreign investment and so on.  I was surprised when it came to paragraph (r), lines 2 to 5, on page 61 of the legislation, that it seems to be inserted at the end.</p> <p>It states that a head of a section may refuse to grant information that contains information "advising on or managing on public infrastructure projects, including public private partnership arrangements (within the meaning of the State Authorities (Public Private Partnership Arrangements) Act 2002)."  I do not agree with giving authority to a head of a department to refuse information concerning public private partnerships or with stitching that into legislation relating to the release of information.  This does not just relate to a commercial act , but to information advising on the "managing" of a public private partnership.  This provision in the Bill would block the provision of information from the National Development Finance Agency or anybody else who gave advice to the NRA or the Department of Education and Skills etc.  It is not right that this provision blocking information on the giving of advice should be stitched into the legislation.  </p><p> There are already ample measures in the Bill, and we have supported them, to ensure that where there are commercial interests at stake, they will be safeguarded.

Section 40(2) lists a range of records to which subsection (1) applies in addition to the class of records which could be protected under the original Act.  This is because we are extending the scope of this Act to the NTMA group of companies.  We have had discussions with those who will be affected and they have serious concerns regarding the impact of their discussions on advising and managing PPP projects and others.</p><p>  I assure the Deputy that the section does not restrict access to records automatically, but only in the circumstances where the grounds set out in section 40(1) apply.  Information may be released where the public interest would, on balance, be better served by granting rather than by refusing the request.  It is a balance between expanding the scope of the FOI legislation to this new range of companies, which had been preserved in purity from FOI requirements up to now, and doing it in a way consistent with not compromising the important State work they do.  We are inserting a caveat that they are not automatically exempt unless they prove that to release the information would impact on the way determined in section 40(1).</p></speech>

It was necessary to provide this provision because the information contained in some premises could be of such a highly sensitive and confidential nature that it would compromise criminal investigation.  I am advised it would not be appropriate or in the public interest for the Information Commissioner to have power to enter Garda premises to take those records and potentially remove them.</p><p>  A similar provision prevents the Garda Ombudsman from entering certain premises of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The Minister's position is clear.  He may respond if he wishes.  I am not trying to get back into a debate on the issue.  The committee recommended in its report that monopoly semi-State providers should have to comply with the rigours of the FOI Bill.  I think it is worth pointing that out to colleagues on the committee.  That would include Eirgrid and the harbour authorities.</p><p>  I know that the Minister will not get rid of the lists now.  I have thought more about the conversation we had last night about the public good of bringing these bodies in, while protecting the commercial sensitivity, which I fully support, particularly for the monopolies such as the harbours, Eirgrid the airport authorities, local or national monopolies.  It was the recommendation of the committee that these would be exposed to FOI, notwithstanding commercial sensitivity.  I know that the Minister will not move on it.  That is fine but I want to reiterate the idea that in the future it could be considered.  The more I thought about the interaction we had, the more I thought that the commercial sensitivity does what it needs to do.  There are a few examples in which there is a value in citizens' being able to access information.  By way of example, there is one that I deal with in Wicklow, and I will leave it at this.  Bus &Eacute;ireann runs a service with which the Minister is probably familiar because the No.2 bus goes from Wexford to Dublin.</p> <p>It passes along the road by St. Vincent's Hospital.  The company decided to change that part of the route.  We contacted the chief executive; he and his office were very helpful and they reversed many of the changes.  For example, in the case of the bodies dealing with disabled adults or children in my constituency or the Minister's constituency, there is a public good to those organisations, or the parents of children, being able to seek information about policies on access to health care and disability services that would not be commercially sensitive.  The Minister and I argued this point yesterday but I believe there is a potential opportunity to review it at a later date.</p></speech>

The semi-State sector encompasses a great number of employees and it has a significant impact on society, on our economy and on our environment.  Consequently I do not think it is acceptable to exempt those bodies.  I appeal to the Minister to vary the approach by deciding they should be subject to FOI unless they need to make a case around specific areas of sensitivity.  I wish to give one example.  It was suggested to me by an environmentalist who is very concerned-----</p></speech>

I intend to make Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann subject to FOI.  It became clear that the inclusion of Irish Rail will have to be refined to ensure that no unintended consequences would result.  Rosslare Europort is operated by Irish Rail but operates in a commercial environment and should be treated in the same manner as the commercial ports.  I do not intend that the commercial freight operations of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann would be subject to FOI.  I have been advised by the Minister for Finance that certain tax and legal advisers in certain tax avoidance schemes are using FOI to seek details of Revenue's expert reports and analysis of the schemes prior to the issuing of a notice of opinion under section 811 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 or relating to the formation of an opinion under that section.  I have agreed that my officials and the Revenue Commissioners would see whether an exemption from FOI might be appropriate.  I wish to signal these matters in case I need to bring an amendment on Report Stage, together with the other amendment I have signalled on the multifaceted aspect, and on fees.  I am also considering the administrative functions of the Office of the President.</p></speech>

I remind Members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile telephones must be switched off.</p><p>  I remind witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I ask the Minister to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.774" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013111300003#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee Members for inviting me to speak here today in advance of the ECOFIN Council of Ministers meeting on Friday, 15 November, in Brussels.  I expect that we will have a busy meeting ahead.  A number of key issues will be discussed and hopefully significant progress will be made.  I understand that the committee has already received the draft agenda and I will shortly discuss each of the agenda points.<br /><b></b>When I last spoke to the committee we had just concluded our Presidency.  At the start of July, we passed the baton to our Lithuanian colleagues who are now well advanced in their Presidency term.  They have set a theme that we fully support called A Credible, Growing and Open Europe.  Friday&rsquo;s meeting will be their fourth ECOFIN meeting as they held a meeting in July, an informal meeting in Vilnius in September and a meeting in October.</p><p>  In the Chairman's letter to me he asked if I would provide a brief overview of the proceedings that took place at the October meeting and I shall turn to that issue.  The October meeting took place in Luxembourg on 15 October.  As Members will all appreciate, that was budget day here and it was not possible for me to attend the ECOFIN meeting.  My colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, ably deputised for me at the meeting and there was an extensive range of issues discussed.</p><p>  The ECOFIN meeting took place just a week before the European Council meeting, so the Finance Ministers were involved in preparing for that meeting.  They particularly focused on the issues relating to the development of EMU and access to finance for SMEs.  On the latter point, the Council discussed an initiative led by the Commission and the European Investment Bank aimed at facilitating access to finance for SMEs.  This is something that we support.  The Council also took stock of lessons learned from the 2013 European Semester process and considered possible improvements for next year.  Finally, the Council also covered the outcome of the G20 and IMF-World Bank meetings that had taken place a few days before the October ECOFIN meeting and adopted Council conclusions in preparation for the upcoming UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.  </p><p>  That morning, as usual, Ministers held a breakfast meeting to review the economic situation.  They also discussed backstop arrangements for banks in the context of the asset quality review and stress test exercise and the proposed single resolution mechanism, SRM.  They also discussed how to accommodate public investment in the preventative arm of the EU&rsquo;s Stability and Growth Pact.  </p><p>  The October ECOFIN also formally adopted regulations creating a single supervisory mechanism, SSM, for the oversight of banks and other credit institutions.  Members might recall that agreement on the issue was reached earlier in the year during the Irish Presidency.  The SSM will be composed of the ECB and the supervisory authorities of the member states.  It will cover the euro-area as well as the non-eurozone countries that chose to participate.  The ECB will assume its supervisory tasks 12 months after the entry into force of the legislation, subject to operational arrangements.</p><p>  I shall turn to the ECOFIN agenda.  Members will see that it is a full agenda and I suspect that it will be a long meeting. I shall outline the key issues that are likely to arise and afterwards I will be happy to take questions and observations from committee members.</p><p>  First, I remind Members that this is a draft agenda and there may still be changes between now and the meeting in terms of content and the order of the discussion.  In addition, work is ongoing at the level of officials so there can also be more substantial changes in terms of how the discussions will evolve.</p><p>  The formal ECOFIN meeting is scheduled to commence at 10.30 a.m. on Friday.  Earlier that morning, as usual, we will have a breakfast meeting during which Vice President Rehn will comment on economic developments following the publication of the European Commission&rsquo;s autumn forecasts on 5 November.  I expect that he may also provide an update on other Commission publications due this week such as the annual growth survey and the alert mechanism report, which marks the beginning of the next Semester process.  There will also be an informal session that will cover items relating to banking union and I shall address these issues shortly.</p><p>  According to the agenda the first items to be considered are the legislative deliberations which will, as normal, take place in public session.  There are two issues to be discussed, savings taxation and the standard VAT return.  The savings taxation file was last discussed at ECOFIN in May of this year.  The aim of the EU Savings Directive is to enable interest payments, made in one member state to individuals resident for tax purposes in another member state, to be made subject to effective taxation in accordance with the laws of the latter member state.  The Lithuanian Presidency hopes to reach agreement on the matter by the end of the year.  Some member states still have difficulties with the file and I suspect that we might come back to the issue again at the December ECOFIN meeting.</p><p>  With regard to a standard VAT return, the Commission will make a presentation and there probably will not be much discussion on this point at the meeting.  The Commission see this as a business-friendly initiative and generally we are supportive of such measures.  We will need to be vigilant regarding the outcome of the discussion as it might necessitate changes to our relatively simple VAT return form.</p><p>  The next item for discussion is the fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive. <b></b>The Presidency's intention is to present a state of play paper and to assess the responses from member states.  There are a number of open issues on the file and progress at official and technical levels has been slow.  The intention is to finish the file by the end of the year.</p><p>  As members will know, we are working hard on banking union at the ECOFIN.  This week I anticipate having a long discussion, possibly late into the evening, on banking union and the single resolution mechanism, SRM.  The task of completing all aspects of banking union is urgent if we want to break the link between the sovereign and the banking sector.  This is a priority issue for Ireland.</p><p>  As I mentioned earlier, the single supervisory mechanism was formally adopted by ECOFIN in October.  This is an important step in creating a banking union for Europe.   Last June the European Council decided that, in transition towards the SSM, a balance sheet assessment will be conducted, comprising an asset quality review and subsequently a stress test.  This is to ensure that banks are adequately capitalised in advance of the ECB taking control of supervision.   There will be discussion on this point, and in particular on how to address any capital shortfall if it were to materialise.</p><p>  Another banking issue, the single resolution mechanism is also on the agenda for Friday&rsquo;s meeting.  This is the next essential step in creating a banking union.  The October meeting of the European Council underlined the commitment to reach a Council general approach on the issue by year end.  The Presidency is aiming for a general agreement on the issue at this week&rsquo;s meeting.  There are still a number of open issues such as scope, financing and governance.  We will actively work to ensure that as much progress as possible is achieved on Friday.  Our view is that it is important that the SRM should have a broad scope covering all banks that have potential to cause systemic difficulties either within individual member states or to the Union as a whole.  We support the Commission&rsquo;s proposal in this regard as even relatively small distressed banks have been the source of considerable systemic difficulties.</p> <p>Broad scope is also important to ensure a level playing field for European banks.  In addition, in our view, the ESM should be the clear public backstop for the SRM.  This is particularly important in the early years when the single resolution fund is being built up.  </p><p> Under the heading of any other business, the Presidency will, as normal, provide an update on other key financial services dossiers.  This is an information item and I do not expect a major discussion on any of the items at this particular meeting. </p><p> The first non-legislative issue is the EU&rsquo;s contribution to international accounting standards.  In April 2013, Commissioner Barnier appointed Mr. Philippe Maystadt as a special adviser with a view to strengthening the European contribution to the international financial reporting standards setting process.  Mr. Maystadt will present his report on the EU&rsquo;s contribution to international accounting standards to Ministers.  It is likely the report and its recommendations will play a significant role in shaping the conclusions of the expected Commission review of the international accounting standards regulation.</p><p> I understand the banking union item at this stage on the agenda could be to allow the Presidency update on the earlier discussions.  The final items listed relate to EU statistics.  The objective of the discussion will be to adopt Council conclusions on the annual statistical package, including the report on information requirements under EMU prepared by officials.  The conclusions emphasise the role of high quality statistics and emphasise the importance of statistical independence.  At the moment, nothing has been signalled under the any other business heading in this section. </p><p> We have a busy meeting on Friday.  We will debate a number of key issues that are very important to Ireland and the EU.  We will work with the Presidency and our colleagues from the other member states to ensure that progress is made.  I thank the committee members for their attention and, at this point, I am happy to respond to any questions or observations that committee members may have.</p></speech>

There has been a lot of speculation about the events in Newbridge.  PTSB was our final option and we would have preferred if it was resolved within the context of the wider credit union movement.  It is our policy and the policy objective of the Central Bank to maintain a credit union presence in Newbridge, whether by way of a strong credit union establishing a sub-office there or interested parties in Newbridge coming together to re-establish a credible Newbridge credit union.</p></speech>

I will personally brief the committee on a quarterly basis.  We can go through all the issues.  With regard to the budgetary process, I am open to suggestions.  Now that budgets have been brought forward to mid-October, it gives us greater scope.  Post-budget, there is a longer period of time when matters reflected in the Finance Bill can be discussed.  The Second Stage of the Finance Bill was a pretty good discussion.  By extending the time into yesterday, we had almost 11 hours of discussion.  If members have suggestions on alterations to the budgetary process, I am not averse to coming in before budgets and listening to the views of committee members.  I and my officials listen to the views of interest groups such as the ICMSA, the IFA, trade unions and IBEC.  I will meet all the big interest groups myself and it is a reasonable request if the views of colleagues, on a cross-party basis, can be given to me in a formal setting some weeks before the budget so that I can reflect on the committee members' advice and see what I can include.  I am not able to give a response until budget day so it will be a listening and debating exercise rather than arriving at conclusions.</p></speech>

It is about the format of filing VAT and has nothing to do with VAT rates.  There are some complicated VAT return systems in other countries.  The objective of the Commission is to simplify and standardise the VAT returns process across the Community.  In that context, we have a very simplified VAT return form and my interest is that anything that is standardised does not make our VAT filing system more complex.  We have a very good system.</p><p>  Ireland is strongly supportive of the simplified VAT return form proposals, which can lead to a reduction in red tape and administrative costs for business.  The prospect of a standard VAT form across the Union holds benefits for business and the Single Market in general.  In this regard, Ireland broadly welcomes the proposal.  However, since Ireland already has a very simple VAT return form, we will seek to ensure the appropriate balance is achieved between any additional burden on business and the benefits that a standard VAT return form can deliver.  In developing our position on the dossier, a stakeholder group is being convened representing business interests and tax practitioners with a view to ensuring any concerns and issues arising are identified by Irish businesses and communicated to us to be fully understood.</p></speech>

We were notified of it rather late and we think it will go late into the evening on Friday because it is one of the crucial policy aspects that must be discussed.  It runs from, and underpins, banking union.  The issues that arise include the scope and whether it will apply to important banks or all banks.  The Irish position is that it should apply to all banks because we have seen that quite small banks have caused systemic problems across European Union, which has led to a fear of contagion.  It is not necessarily big banks that are troublesome.</p></speech>

We welcome the single resolution mechanism as the next essential step in creating the banking union.  We must press on to complete discussions on the single resolution mechanism by the end of the year.  Taken with the SSM, the proposals will be an important step to achieving the objective of breaking the link between the bank sovereign and the banking sector.  It is important that the SRM should give have a broad scope, covering all banks that have the potential to cause systemic difficulties, either within the individual member states or to the area as a whole.</p> <p>We support the Commission's proposal in this regard as even relatively small distressed banks have been the source of considerable systemic difficulties.  Broad scope is also important to ensure a level playing field for European banks.  We strongly support the creation of a single resolution fund.  It will assist in achieving the objective established by the Heads of State and Government of breaking the link between the sovereign and banking sector.  The single resolution fund should have the capacity to borrow from private sources and to raise <i>ex-post</i>levies from the financial sector.</p><p> It is also important that there should be clear safeguards in the event that a call on funds has fiscal implications for member states.  The economic sustainability reference model, ESRM, proposal cannot be concluded until there is clarity on the backstop arrangements.  It is our view that the ESM should be the clear public backstop for the single resolution mechanism, SRM.  This is particularly important in the early years when the single resolution fund is being built up.</p><p> On governance arrangements, we need to strike a balanced representation in the executive board of the SRM which includes member states' interests but in constructing this, we must be careful we do not adversely affect effective resolution decision making.  On timing, we should aim to have the deadline set by the European Council and reach agreement on this proposal to allow time for conclusion of trialogue negotiations with the current EU legislative term.</p><p> Not every country would share the Irish position so there will be quite a debate on this.  Some countries would regard it as sufficient that the scope would apply only to the very large international European banks.  In respect of the resolution fund, some countries would be of the view that rather than relying totally on a centralised European fund, each member state who is party to this should have its own resolution funds and that resolutions should be conducted by a combination of the funds in the sovereign funds rather than a centralised European fund.  </p><p> There will be a debate about the backstop arrangements as well.  Quite clearly, we see the ESM as the necessary backstop arrangement but there will be a view here that once the fund is built up if it is a centralised European fund, as time goes by and one has a fully funded fund, there would be no need for a backstop at that point.  The question of whether one would continue with the ESM acting in a backstop role or whether after the ten-year build up of the fund, the ESM would drop out of the arrangements and the fund in effect would be strong enough to operate without a backstop, will also be up for debate.  I am outlining the Irish position.  There are very strong alternative views from powerful member states.</p></speech>

There is a standard item where there is a review of countries in programmes of one sort or another.  In the normal run through of agenda items, in discussions on the state of play in Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland, there is an opportunity for me to give the information about Ireland and for a very short discussion.

There is nothing mysterious about the date of 15 December.  The European programme ends on 9 December while the IMF programme ends on 15 December or maybe <i>vice versa</i>.  The date of 15 December is the third anniversary of one component of the programme and then the programme is over.  It is not that we are picking a date, that it is pre-Christmas or that there is a big hoopla about this.  It just happens to be the anniversary of the signing of the programme in the first instance.  To be precise, the technical arrangement for the final drawdown going into early February does not affect the ending of the programme.  It is just an arrangement that has been made to allow us full access to the full amount of money promised.  The anniversary date is simply the anniversary date but we will be making our decisions clear and announcing them before that date.</p></speech>

There is linkage being made between the technical arrangements for drawdown into February and as if the programme was being extended into February.  It is not.  The programme ends in December and it is purely a technical arrangement to access money due to us under the programme.  Of course, we will draw down the money that is available to us under the programme but we do not see that as an extension of the programme.

He still has a number of weeks in which to make a final decision.  The markets seem to be quite calm on the question of whether or not we take such a credit line.

I do not see big downsides.  I do not see downside risk on either approach but I see advantages both ways.  Having consulted with the principals of the troika and a number of European colleagues, we are reflecting and I am reflecting in particular on what way I will advise the Government.  The factors relate to what is in Ireland's best interest.  There is a window now where things are calm internationally - calm in Europe and Ireland.  The interest rate reduction announced last week by the ECB obviously reflects back into interest rates in general.  Consequently, we seem to be in rather a benign window.  If we had a precautionary programme, we would face this decision again next year.  I cannot predict what things will be like next December.</p></speech>

My next point relates to the SSM, the ESRM and all the acronyms people will find it hard to get their head around.</p> <p>In very simple terms, my understanding is the ECB will be taking over supervision of the larger banks, including five in Ireland, this time next year.  Before it does so, it wants to ensure these banks are in a healthy condition.  In that context, there is a two-part process.  The asset quality review or the balance sheet review is ongoing and full stress tests will commence next year.  I ask the Minister to put that matter in an Irish context for us.  As I understand it, the asset review is ongoing.  When is it expected to be completed and what will we find out from it?  When is it expected that the full stress tests will happen here?  Allied with this, if an issue arises in terms of a capital shortfall in any of the banks, one presumes the ECB will not want to take on responsibility for the banks until they have been fully repaired, not just in Ireland but also across Europe.  I raise this issue in the context of the fact that the Minister has outlined that the Government's view is that the backstop should be the ESM.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.803" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013111300006#E00200"><p>I will read the note on this issue first.  As the committee will be aware, in June the European Council indicated that it was in transition towards the single supervisory mechanism.  A balance sheet assessment will be conducted comprising an asset quality review and, subsequently, a stress test.  The purpose of this exercise is to ensure banks are appropriately capitalised.  This is seen as an important exercise by the ECB, as it wants a clean bill of health for the banking sector in advance of it taking control of supervision in November 2014.  The committee will also be aware that a similar exercise is being carried out on domestic banks by the Central Bank as part of our troika commitments.  It is expected that this exercise will be finalised by the end of November, but it is not expected that the results will be issued publicly, unless required to be released by banks to comply with market obligations.</p><p>  As a programme country, it was always part of the programme that, around the time of our exit, we would have asset quality reviews and stress tests.  We obtained the agreement of the troika that the asset quality review would take place in the autumn and I believe the phrase used with regard to the stress tests was something like "in close proximity" to the European stress testing but in advance of it.  The political and financial risk we identified with this arrangement was that we could get ourselves into a position where we would have to conduct the reviews and tests twice.  We had our agreements with the troika, but then during the negotiations on banking union it was agreed that, for prudential reasons, asset quality reviews and stress tests across the European banking system would be required.  It would, therefore, be a case of double jeopardy if we had to conduct the reviews and stress tests once for Irish reasons and again for European reasons.  As we wanted to avoid this, during my last visit to Frankfurt the banking authorities agreed that they would monitor and become involved in the asset quality review here in an advisory capacity.  It was agreed that we would do it once, that we would not have to do it a second time.  It was further agreed that the stress tests, rather than being conducted in advance of the European general round of stress testing, would be part of the Europe-wide process.  That is the arrangement and we have had no indication that we will require additional capital.</p><p>  As well as this, while the ECB has issued guidelines on the nature of the stress testing, it has not fully nailed down the absolute conditionality yet.  We are not quite sure what the position will be in that regard.  The last time we stress-tested, for example, we had to stress-test against a core tier 1 capital requirement of 10.5% and provided funding well in excess of that figure.  When Spain and Cyprus stress-tested, they were required to do so at a figure of 9%, but the European rules that have been issued state 8% core tier 1 capital is sufficient.  The ECB has not yet defined what financial instruments will constitute core tier 1 capital; therefore, we still do not have the full picture.  If the ECB varies what is counted as core tier 1 capital, a figure of 8% might not be an advantage.  We are not quite sure about this, but the matter will be clarified as the months go by.  The position is that we will stress-test in the same round of stress testing the entire European banking system.  We have no evidence from the Irish Central Bank that we will require extra capital, but a lot will depend on the rules for the stress testing and whether they will be more or less rigorous than those already applied to our system.</p></speech>

When does the Minister expect to receive the detail of the financial instruments that will be included in core tier 1 capital to be made available to the State which will give an indication of whether there is cause for concern?</p></speech>

I will give the Deputy one example of what I am talking about.  Tax credits arising from losses in the banks are regarded as core tier 1 capital.  Of course, there have been a lot of losses in the Irish banks which means that there are a lot of tax credits available.  During the Basel discussions a suggestion was made that tax credits would no longer apply as core tier 1 capital.  The terms of the Basel discussions will come into operation in 2017.  In the next round of discussions, however, allowance was made for a phasing-in period.  Initially it was agreed that tax credits would be allowed until 2024, but that has not been absolutely nailed down yet.  If the Irish banks could avail of tax credits until 2024, no additional problems would arise.  The Deputy will notice in the Finance Bill that one of the measures I included involved the removal of the prohibition on the banks from freely using their losses because I had this consideration in mind.  We have still not received definitive advice from the ECB on what instruments will finally contribute to the 8% core tier 1 capital that will be required.  It is not a dramatic crisis issue or anything like that because the stress tests for the European banking system will not take place until late October or November next year.  There is a long lead-in time.  I am simply alerting the committee to the fact that there are still decisions to be made on the protocols for the stress testing and the particular issue of core tier 1 capital.  We are watching matters very closely in the Irish interest.</p></speech>

Obviously, we do not know what criteria will be used for the stress tests, but if additional capital is required in any of the banks as a result of the stress tests prior to October next year, how would it be sought?  Would it be by way of a bail-in, since the rules will not apply until 2015, or how would it be provided if such an issue arose?</p></speech>

As we exit the bailout programme, we are going to align ourselves fully with the norm in Europe.  We see exiting the bailout programme not as a big dramatic event but as a normalisation process whereby we are back again as a fully fledged, independent member of the Eurogroup and the eurozone.  We will follow the advice coming from the Commission in this instance, with reference to what was indicated at its meeting last June.</p></speech>

The longer we discuss the issue, it gives credence to the theory that there will be a capital requirement.  We will be off again with another, "'We'll all be rooned," said Hanrahan, "Before the year is out."'  It is not like that.  The Irish banks are strong.  There will be a round of stress testing in the autumn.  The advice from the Central Bank is that has not yet identified a requirement for additional capital, but of course there is always the possibility that additional capital will be required where we will align ourselves with the European norm.  If there is a capital requirement, in the first instance, private funds and profit sharing will be the way to go.</p><p>  To develop the conversation further, Deputy, questions such as "do I think?" only give rise to speculation that would be adverse to our interests.</p></speech>

There is a great deal in the mix in terms of the ESM, bail-ins post 2015, etc.  I do not want a long drawn out discussion - it is not what I want to focus on.  I just want some clarity on that aspect.  In the event of a bank not being able to raise money, would it fall on the shoulders of the nation or from what has been negotiated in Europe?  Is there potential for a collective approach?</p></speech>

We have the CoCos within the banks and so on.  After profit sharing and private funds, rearrangement of provisioning by the use of CoCos and so on would be the next step in the process.  As I have said, I do not want to give rise to speculation about something about which we will have no information until the stress tests take place.</p></speech>

No one knows at this point in time.  We  must rely on the Central Bank's information.  We will wait and see.  I wanted to deal with the process.</p><p>  In terms of both the ECOFIN and the Eurogroup meeting, the Minister made no reference to the potential retrospective recapitalisation of Irish banks.  I wonder where this sits at this point in time.  The Minister will be familiar with the statements of leading people in Europe in the past while.  We are well into this process; it is 17 months since this was announced by the Eurogroup.  We have the letter from the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, to the leaders in Europe on the importance of Ireland's return to full market financing.  Is it sustainable that this commitment would be implemented?  My view, and I hope this will become a reality, is that there should be a re-financing of as much as possible of the funds we put into AIB and Bank of Ireland.  It is also my view that the door seems to be closing since that statement on 17 June last year.  I raised this issue with the troika when they were last here.</p></speech>

I wonder if this is still on the agenda.  I note the Minister stated that he does not want to tie the pillar banks to the ESM and there is a potential for selling shares in the market.  Is this still being aggressively pursued as it was suggested back in June 2012 by the State?</p></speech>

It has a defined agenda for its meetings.  I was asked to discuss the ECOFIN meeting on Friday and the agenda items.  The question raised by Deputy Doherty is not an agenda item for Friday's meeting.  I can see the Deputy's point of view, but if we are to have meetings every quarter along these lines, I do not think it would be fruitful that they would turn into a general trawl of Government policy on items that are not on the ECOFIN agenda.</p></speech>

The previous speaker asked a question that is not on the agenda of the ECOFIN meeting and the Minister answered him in saying that it is not on the ECOFIN meeting but there is a second meeting, which is the Eurogroup meeting at which country specific issues are dealt with.  The Minister then went on to answer the question.  If he wants to stonewall me on the retroactive recapitalisation of Irish banks, that would be fair enough, but he must be fair to speakers from Opposition parties who have an entitlement to put questions.  If the Minister is going to take a position at this finance committee that he will deal only with agenda items of ECOFIN, then he needs to be consistent in responding to other political parties and those who are not members of political parties on that matter.  The Minister has given the view that it is possible to ask questions on the second meeting that will take place this week.  It has been the norm for the Minister to answer questions on Eurogroup as well.  If he taking that approach with me, that is fair enough.</p></speech>

The issue about which Deputy Doherty inquired will not be addressed at the Eurogroup meeting because it is not on that agenda either.  What I am trying to say to the Deputy is that if we are to have fruitful discussions at these meetings, where the Deputies and I exchange information on a regular basis each quarter and the committee members are briefed by officials before every meeting of ECOFIN and the Eurogroup, we need to do it in an orderly fashion.  If Deputy Doherty wants a Punch and Judy show about other issue, I do not think this is the forum.</p></speech>

The credit line is not on the agenda of the Eurogroup.  As the Minister informed the committee, the agenda of the Eurogroup is specific country issues, in which there is a trawl through of the situations in Spain, Greece and Ireland.  As the Minister said, that gives him an opportunity to talk about exiting the bailout.  The question I am putting to the Minister is whether he will take that opportunity to talk about what was the game changer, the seismic shift 17 months ago, the retroactive recapitalisation of Irish banks, particularly in light of comments of senior leaders in Europe at this point in time that the chance was slim and it is very unlikely that retroactive recapitalisation will take place.</p></speech>

However, there is a long way to go in the negotiations and each case will be considered on its merits.  It would not be appropriate for me to prejudge the outcome at this early stage.  There will be no discussion on this at either the Eurogroup or at the ECOFIN meetings.</p></speech>

The Minister will attend two meetings for which we have the agenda and it seems entirely legitimate to ask questions about both meetings in advance of them.  The idea that there is some kind of iron wall between the Thursday and the Friday meetings does not make sense to me.  On Thursday, at 10.30 a.m. there will be a macro-economic dialogue at political level.  That seems to be pretty open as to what can be discussed in terms of the overall economic situation in Europe and how we fit into that.  We will then have the Eurogroup meeting and then there will be the ECOFIN meeting with the agenda items he has gone through and which he clearly wants to focus on, so that we do not discuss the other stuff.  Even in terms of the ECOFIN meeting, the main agenda item which will be discussed for ten or 12 hours is banking union.</p> <p>Is the Minister telling us that it is not relevant to a discussion on banking union to discuss the retroactive recapitalisation of banks?  I put it to the Minister that it is absolutely legitimate to raise it in that context because in so far as this issue has been presented to us, the whole narrative has been that if we sort out banking union, if we make progress towards banking union, then we will get some retroactive recapitalisation support for our banks which will lessen our debt burden.  I do not see why the Minister cannot raise it in the context of discussing the progress on banking union which he is reporting.  If he cannot do it there I certainly do not see why he cannot discuss it in a macro-economic dialogue at political level.  I ask him to clarify why he could not raise it in one or other of those contexts.</p></speech>

The rest of the member states will not be represented and our interests will be looked after by the Commission.  I will be in Dublin while that part of the process is happening.  At 10.30 a.m. there will be a meeting with the social partners - employer and trade union representatives - to discuss the macro-economic issues.

It goes through the programme countries and it may refer to other countries as well where there may be particular difficulties.  The Commission reports, the European Central Bank and the IMF comment and then the particular member states reply to the comments made.  This is a very brief process.  In the case of Ireland the comments will be of the general nature that Ireland is doing fine and is preparing for exit.  In the case of other countries there might be a longer period of discussion depending on the current state of play and any difficulties they have.  These are well ordered, well chaired discussions which do not always give freedom for raising matters.</p><p>  On the particular issue raised by the Deputy and by Deputy Pearse Doherty, as I said in the briefing note, it has been agreed by the Eurogroup that retroactive recapitalisation of banks on a case-by-case basis can be considered once the direct bank recapitalisation instrument comes into force.  That makes it very clear that in the first place the direct bank recapitalisation instrument is brought into force and after that, the discussion is on how retrospection might apply.</p></speech>

That is what we were told.  To my mind, that is a very big problem for us.  With the mountain of debt we have, the so-called exit from the bailout is a mirage.  I ask the Minister for clarification.  I ask if I am correct in assuming that under the fiscal treaty, as soon as we exit this programme, we have to start to move towards the debt and deficit reduction targets of the fiscal treaty and these are pretty stringent.</p></speech>

I advocated that we default.  By the way, I still advocate that we default on debts that are not ours because the Minister will not even ask these people for the reduction.  It is entirely legitimate when the Minister is going to a meeting with European finance Ministers for us to ask if he is going to raise the issue of the debt burden around our neck and ask for some relief.  What the Minister has made absolutely clear in his very masterful, clever way of trying to talk down the issue, is that he is not going to ask for that.</p></speech>

He has said it is not allowed, that it is not on the agenda, therefore, we cannot raise it.

It is obvious from the agenda that issues relating to banking union are forward-looking.  There has been much discussion about supervision and resolution.  I have a question about a matter that is rarely discussed.  We have put in our own backstop provisions and also lending targets and obligations for our banks.  A number of banks have left the Irish market.  I ask about the issue of inter-European competition and bank lending, as opposed to just resolution and supervision.  Is there any discussion at these meetings about how banks could be encouraged, by virtue of having the backstops, to improve the way they interact in other European member states?</p> <p>Will lending targets and other targets be stitched in to how they function as has been the case in Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.865" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013111300009#H00200"><p>Yes, this is generally in the debate on the provision of credit.  It is an issue I dealt with in great detail last night in the House.  Certainly the European banks can set up in Ireland and provide lines of credit but the general position on the European banking system is that because of the crisis and the deleveraging which had to take place right across the world, and particularly in Europe, the banking industry in Europe is smaller than it was and there is a difficulty in the provision of credit in certain countries.  One approach to that is to strengthen the Irish banking system, which we have done, but another approach is to follow the American example and not to rely so massively on the banks providing us credit and look for alternatives to the tradition of banking system for the provision of credit.  We have about &euro;2.5 billion available in the Irish economy from non-bank sources, ranging from situations such as Dell computers getting a banking licence to enable it not only to put information systems into companies but to finance it.  That is one alternative.  Another is Silicon Valley Bank which has a branch in London and a presence in Dublin, which is putting $100 million on the table for venture capital for small start-ups in Ireland.  There are three funds that have been negotiated with the National Pensions Reserve Fund and some lending funds.  That is on the record from my speech last night.  I gave all the examples of that as well so there is a general movement.</p><p>  In the European context the most fruitful source of finance is the European Investment Bank.  About 18 months, countries contributed extra capital to the European Investment Bank and the net position is that the additional capital leveraged up allows it to lend about &euro;180 billion extra over the next ten years across the European Union.  My general secretary is now on the board of the European Investment Bank and we are accessing additional funds there.  For example, it has put &euro;250 million into both Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks to fund SMEs.  While the source of the funding is the European Investment Bank we are using the pillar banks as a conduit for delivering that money to the SMEs.  We will build on this.  The idea is that we continue to build on this.  The European Investment Bank management will come to Ireland again before Christmas and look at various projects.  We think it will be a fruitful source of funding and that is the way it should be.</p></speech>

I am aware that Commissioner Ollie Rehn commented in The Economist  magazine last week.  We are all aware of procedures for countries in deficit but there are large European Union countries that have moved into excessive surplus and Ireland, as much as any other country, requires European growth.  Is there growing pressure in the EU to encourage countries with excessive surpluses, for example Germany, to take measures to improve European growth and growth within its own country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.867" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013111300009#H00400"><p>There is a general debate.  Commissioner Ollie Rehn got involved in that debate, according to an article I read last week.  The economic theory underpinning it is that if the periphery countries in difficulty are all running fiscal programmes to reduce their deficits and move towards balanced budgets and surpluses and if at the same time the strong creditor countries are running very large surpluses, all of Europe, as an economic unit, will run a very big current account surplus.  I saw figures showing that the big current account surplus was headed for about 3.5% in 2014 which would be a very significant surplus, the effect of which would be to make the euro stronger than, maybe, would be desirable under market conditions.  Therefore, there would be a very strong euro which would adversely affect exports.  That would be the economic theory and that the European Union internally should have a greater balance between the deficit countries and surplus countries because in the medium term it is tenable for the whole unit to run surpluses in a manner which would excessively strengthen the euro, strengthen the currency, which would adversely affect the European model of export led growth.  That is the general theory.  A discussion is taking place on the issue but I have not seen any proposals yet.</p></speech>

That adversely affects tax take in those countries.  Therefore, it is more of an issue for such countries, than for us but, obviously, we will participate.  There would not be a great incidence of Irish savings which would need to be taxed elsewhere but there is movement now and there is more transparency in countries, such as Switzerland.  It appears now that it will be possible for the savings directive to be implemented.  Therefore, if one is a citizen of France and has a lot of money on deposit in Switzerland there will be a mechanism whereby the income from one's savings will be taxed in that country if not in the country of one's residency.</p></speech>

Mr. Paul Krugman also had an article on it last week in which he stated that the German economy was benefiting from a cheap euro.  I understand the Commission is due to publish its opinion on member states' draft budgets on Friday and that this may address the issue of the German trade surplus.  The question is whether the German situation will be raised as part of the national budgets when the Minister is at the ECOFIN meetings.</p></speech>

If one does not correct problems within one's own control, I am speaking as a European rather than Ireland, then the markets will correct it.

I presume there will be discussion on Friday in regard to the standard VAT return.  When people hear the European Union talk about standardisation and taxation, they are concerned.  Are some of the countries bordering Germany considering the idea of a standardised VAT rate?  Has that been discussed or is there any sentiment towards that?  It is a concern for some people that we might see a standardised VAT form being issued, although some people want this.  Will the Minister elaborate on this issue?  I presume this will relate to the transport and food companies.</p></speech>

There is no suggestion that there will be a standardised VAT rate.  However, VAT is already controlled by European directives and we are quite limited with regard to what we can do in the area of VAT.  For example, when we were discussing the 9% VAT in the hospitality area, people were suggesting that we should put restaurants and hotels on a 9% rate and other groups on an 11% rate.  One of the rules under the directives is that we can only have two lower VAT rates.  We have rates of 13.5% and 9%.  I often hear the suggestion that I should reduce some areas to a 5% rate.  We cannot have a third lower VAT rate.  There are significant restrictions in that regard, but Europe will not dictate to us what rate should apply in particular areas.</p></speech>

For example, in the area of corporation tax we have seen some of our fellow European citizens push for a change in our corporation tax.  Is there any sign that anybody is pushing for a change in regard to VAT or is the change strictly for administration purposes?</p></speech>

I believe the Minister and some of his colleagues were able to achieve the break on the promissory note and on the interest rate notes without these being formally on the agenda of ECOFIN.

I have heard this from many organisations and from colleagues within the social democratic movement.  However, I believe there is an overly optimistic view in the international window as to how Ireland is performing.  When one explains the disconnect between individuals and the country, politicians internationally feel we have a lot further to go.  Last month, an article in <i>The Economist</i>  focused on the level of personal indebtedness that exists throughout Europe and said this would be the next wave that will hit the continent.  The article highlighted Ireland as being one of the most personally indebted countries.  This factor is being lost on the international community when we are trying to focus on our solution.  Is there anything being done to change the current sentiment regarding Ireland or must it be kept positive to try to build confidence all the way?</p></speech>

Market sentiment is also strongly in favour of Ireland.  We had people in London talking to the main group of investors who invest in Ireland and sentiment was very strong towards Ireland.  Market sentiment in the United States is also very strong.  This is not to say that the Deputy is not right in his assessment that this is sentiment towards the country as an economic unit.  We all know what Irish people have suffered in the course of the adjustment that had to take place.  We still have a lot of work to do in this country.</p><p>  With regard to the levels of personal indebtedness, these move rapidly.  A run of statistics published by the Central Bank earlier this week showed that personal indebtedness in Ireland had been reduced by &euro;10 billion in third quarter.  Getting a movement of &euro;10 billion in a quarter demonstrates how fluid the situation is.  I know we have many individual difficult cases and that many families are finding life very hard, but generally what is happening here is that people are paying off debt at a rapid rate.  This has a macro-economic effect of reducing demand in the consumer market.  While we have a lot to do yet, I see signs of increased demand in the market since the budget.  I hear all sorts of anecdotes from all parties here in this regard.  People who live in Dublin say it now takes them another quarter of an hour or 20 minutes to get to work.  Other people talk about all the trucks on the road.  There is significant soft debt in the system over the past two weeks which suggests there is a general perception of a pick-up.</p></speech>

I believe that when the European Union looks at Ireland, it looks at it from a macro-economic perspective.  One of the barometers that might resonate with Europe is the level of emigration.  Perhaps we should ask the French or Germans what would happen in their countries if  8% of their population had to emigrate to find work someplace else?  We need to impress this human dimension upon the European Union to get the breaks we need in the ESM etc.  It is unfortunate that the overwhelming attitude towards us currently is that we are doing fine.  This is too positive.  I urge the Minister to think about and convey that if he sees fit.</p></speech>

The sentiment coming from abroad is always a kind of overview.  Outsiders do not always have the precise details on sectors or individual hardship.  They only have an overview and must rely on the macro-statistics, which are very strong.</p><p>  On the issue of emigration, last years figures indicated that between 80,000 and 90,000 emigrated.  However, there was an inflow of almost 50,000 people.  There is constant flux in this area, with movement to and fro.  As the economy picks up, many of the young people who have emigrated will return, particularly if the trend follows the pattern of the emigration of the 1980s and early 1990s.  By 1994, people were returning to jobs here.  We always have some emigration.</p><p>  We must also remember that we are in a European economic zone and that we have a common currency.  Since 1922, we have had a free travel area with the United Kingdom.  While we are a rather small island country, we are in the same labour market in Europe.  Therefore, one should not be surprised if people move to another part of the labour market within an economic region.  It is quite common for people to move over and back to the United Kingdom.  Many English people came here during the boom and many Irish people moved to London.  Many people move back and forth.</p></speech>

The fund will be built up over a ten-year period.  Certainly in the meantime and maybe indefinitely we will need the European Stability Mechanism to act as a backstop to prevent any shortfalls from a series of burst banks across Europe coming back to hit European tax payers.  We will go the ESM route as a backstop.  That is the policy but it is not all firmed up yet and that is one of the key discussions we will have on Friday.</p></speech>

There is a strong view in some countries that there should not be a central fund but that there should be a series of sovereign funds which in the event of need would combine to resolve difficulties within banks.  Either way, whether it is organised nationally or centrally, it is the industry that will pay the levies to build up the fund, not the taxpayer.  If there is not enough money in the fund and a big international bank goes bust before the fund is built up over ten years, the backstop position that we want is the ESM.  These are the decisions that need to be made on Friday.</p></speech>

I welcome Dr. Vincent O'Neill and his colleagues from Irish Aid.  Members will be aware that since 2000 global development goals have focused on the achievement of the millennium development goals.  The global agenda has developed a slightly different focus in recent years, as it seeks, among other matters, to develop a common approach among EU members on the issue of how to engage in international discussion on financing the development agenda post-2015.  In addition, given the devastation caused by Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, I understand Dr. O'Neill will also give the committee a timely update on that issue.  It is timely that he is here, particularly in view of the disaster in the Philippines.  It is appropriate that he have an opportunity to discuss that and other issues with us.  </p><p>  We will follow the usual procedure: there will be a presentation for ten or 15 minutes which will be followed by an opportunity for members to raise questions or make comments.</p></speech>

I will outline the primary United Nations-led processes which are driving the international discussions, how the European Union is engaging with this process and, specifically, the role Ireland has been playing, most notably, during its Presidency of the Union in the first half of 2013 and, laterally, in its engagement at the United Nations.  I will also address the key issue of financing and the Commission's communication which is the first step in elaborating on an EU position on the financing issue relating to the post-2015 goals.</p> <p>The deadline for the achievement of the millennium development goals, MDGs, is 2015.  Although much progress has been made, there are still areas where poverty remains far too high and key MDG targets have not been reached.  The international community is now increasing its attention on what should succeed the MDGs after 2015.  At a specially convened UN summit in New York in 2010, the UN Secretary General was mandated to take the lead in considering and making proposals about the post-2015 framework.  In 2012, at the Rio+20 conference on sustainable development hosted by Brazil, there was agreement to develop a set of sustainable development goals and to establish an open working group which would make proposals to the international community about how the UN could develop these goals.</p><p> The post-2015 development framework refers to the process to establish a new set of goals to succeed the MDGs and to integrate this with the processes and work of the open working group in proposing sustainable development goals.  </p><p> There are a few elements of the UN leadership of this process that I would like to highlight.   The UN Secretary General appointed a high-level panel of eminent persons, co-chaired by President of Liberia, the UK Prime Minister and the President of Indonesia, to lead international consultations on proposals for a successor post-2015 framework.  Over the past 18 months, there have been many global discussions about this, including engagement with more than 5,000 civil society groups and engagements with parliamentarians, members of the private sector and so on to solicit their views.  </p><p> Secondly, the open working group on sustainable development goals, which was constituted after the Rio+20 conference, is in discussion at the moment and the intention is that it will submit a report to the UN General Assembly by September 2014.  Related to the work of the this group is an expert committee on sustainable development finance, which is looking more specifically at sustainable development financing.  Again, this committee will report to the UN General Assembly by September 2014.</p><p> Over the past two years, the UN has also co-ordinated global, country and regional discussions from different stakeholder groups about the successor frameworks.  A road map has been agreed following the UN General Assembly special session of September 2013 to move these discussions towards a definitive way forward for the UN to agree a successor framework by September 2015.  </p><p> That is the global process at play, but Ireland has been quite engaged with this and, given our Presidency of the Council of the European Union over the first six months of this year, we had an important role to play in engaging with the EU and member states in terms of their relationship with this process.  Ireland hosted an informal meeting of EU development Ministers in February 2013 which was the first substantive political-level discussion in the EU about the post-2015 framework, which became a priority of the Irish Presidency.   In April 2013, during our Presidency, Ireland, along with the Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice, hosted a major international conference on the interlinked themes of hunger, nutrition and the impact of climate change with the explicit purpose of giving poorer communities around the world a voice on the international stage where they could have their say and make proposals to key international policy makers about the issues of concern to them that need to be reflected in the post-2015 framework.  </p><p> During our Presidency, Ireland engaged with the Environment and Development Commissions, the European External Action Service and the respective Council Secretariats to agree an integrated set of Council conclusions, which were presented to the Foreign Affairs Council in June 2013.  For the first time, that brought together the environment communities and the development communities with a view to preventing duplication of international conferences and goals and agreeing a single set of coherent goals.  That was approved by the General Affairs Council in June 2013.  </p><p> Ireland has engaged with the open working group on sustainable development goals.  We are engaged with Denmark and Norway in a constituency as one of the 30 members of that group.  Ireland's role was further underlined by the appointment of our permanent representative to the UN by the UN Secretary General to co-facilitate the preparations for the September event to agree a timeframe and a process for the finalisation of the post-2015 framework.  The T&aacute;naiste was the only EU leader at these discussions, in addition to the President of the European Commission, who addressed the opening session of UN meeting.  The T&aacute;naiste also chaired one of the closing sessions.  At the UN, the T&aacute;naiste committed Ireland to supporting new global development goals beyond 2015 and focused on the need to bring together the different communities such as the environment and development communities to agree bold targets to end extreme poverty and hunger and to protect our environment.  He called for global goals with a clear commitment to implementation at national level, with specific new targets on hunger and nutrition; a strong new emphasis on agriculture, especially climate-sensitive agriculture; and a stronger and much more specific approach on the rights of women and girls.</p><p> That is the process for developing the post-2015 goals.  I will now talk about the means of financing them.  Over the past number of years, there have been many discussions about how the global community can finance new goals in support of poverty reduction and sustainable protection of the environment beyond 2015.  Since 2000, when the initial MDGs were agreed, there have been many changes globally which are reflected in the way we approach development finance.  In particular, the effects of the global economic downturn have had an impact on official development assistance, ODA, budgets.  In many situations, the volume of ODA assistance has declined.  There are new requirements in terms of international financing that have been agreed and brokered through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and are being further discussed as we speak at a meeting in Poland.  There are additional financing needs in the area of climate change.</p><p> There was a time when, for many countries, ODA was a major component of development financing.  That is not the case in many lower and middle-income countries at this point in time, although many of the least development countries are still very dependent on ODA.  There are other forms of financing - remittances, money from foundations, debt and global and country-specific taxation - which need to be considered as forms of financing for the new development targets.  To address this issue, the EU has issued a communication called Beyond 2015: Towards a Comprehensive and Integrated Approach to Financing Poverty Eradication and Sustainable Development.  This is the first time the European Commission has engaged with how to address the issue of financing in a coherent manner.  The development of this communication very much follows on from the Council conclusions agreed during the Irish Presidency, in which the European Union reaffirmed the need for a coherent and co-ordinated approach to the post-2015 framework.</p> <p>Similarly, there are now calls across the European Union for a common and coherent approach to reaching agreement on how the post-2015 framework will be financed.  The Commission's communication outlines the key issues for member states and the process and principles that should underpin a Europe-wide approach to the issue.  The Commission suggests that because of the various international processes working on finance for developing countries, they need to be made coherent and mutually reinforcing with a commonly agreed set of principles.  The Commission also argues that countries should be in the driving seat in determining where and how they generate the resources, where resources should be allocated and how resources should be prioritised at country level.</p><p> The communication notes that although the relative importance of ODA has declined in many but not all countries, it remains a key source of finance for lower income countries.  To support domestic resource mobilisation, it notes the need to reform tax systems, strengthen tax administrations and implement legislation to reduce corruption.  It highlights the need to focus on the effectiveness and quality of current spending, as well as on mobilising additional resources.  It also highlights the drain on the public finances of many countries of illicit flows such as the proceeds of crime, tax evasion and corruption.  It also raises the contentious issue of the future definition and role of ODA.  This was first defined in the 1970s and a number of voices in the international community argue that the role and contribution of ODA need to be redefined in a changed context.  The communication identifies the importance of private investments as the key drivers of growth and of remittances and private philanthropy as important sources of financing for developing countries.  Following from the communication, it is proposed that Council conclusions on financing poverty eradication and sustainable development beyond 2015 will be adopted at the December Foreign Affairs Council.</p><p> I will conclude by referring to Ireland's engagement with this process.  Ireland welcomes the Commission's communication as providing a good basis from which to build on our consideration of this complex issue.  Work has started in Brussels on a joint development, environment and political working group format and we are closely engaged with these discussions and communicating with other Departments such as the Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Public Expenditure and Reform in regard to Ireland's input.  The Government is strongly committed to Ireland's overseas aid programme and its place at the heart of Ireland's foreign policy.  The focus of our programme is on least developed countries, where there remains a significant dependence on ODA as distinct from other forms of development finance.  On a <i>per capita</i>basis Ireland is among the top eight providers globally of ODA as a percentage of GNI.  In the course of this year the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade launched a new policy for international development which highlights the fact that lasting solutions to poverty and hunger must be underpinned by developing countries' ability to raise revenue.  Aid is increasingly seen as a catalyst for development rather than the main driver.  The policy recognises that aid is a major form of development finance for 30 to 40 of the poorest countries in the world.</p><p> This year Ireland has broadly stabilised the funding for overseas development assistance, despite our difficult economic circumstances.  In 2014 the Estimates provide for &euro;602 million in official development assistance.  This will represent a small reduction on spending in 2013.  Ireland's achievement in protecting its aid budget has been recognised by partners among the G77 group of developing countries at the United Nations and the OECD DAC.</p><p> The Government's new policy on international development focuses sharply on the poorest countries and communities in sub-Saharan Africa and the goals of reducing hunger, building sustainable growth and good governance and enshrining human rights.  It provides a clear framework for the prioritisation of activities and the allocation of resources to maximise impact, strengthen accountability and demonstrate value for money in the coming years.  The new policy also reconfirms our commitment to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of gross national product for ODA when economic circumstances permit.</p><p> Ireland remains committed to a single comprehensive framework and a single set of global goals, as agreed in the June 2013 Council conclusions.  Building on the progress made during the Irish Presidency, we support a common and comprehensive approach to financing development beyond 2015.  It will be important for the Council conclusions to highlight the important role ODA continues to play and the European Union's global leadership role in providing ODA.  The European Union is the single biggest provider of ODA globally.  ODA remains a major source of finance for low income countries and the European Union supports a rebalancing of external public financing towards the countries most in need.  This is set out in the new EU policy on development assistance, which Ireland fully supports.  From Ireland's perspective, any suggestion about reforming the ODA concept will need careful examination.  It is important to maintain the integrity and credibility of the ODA concept.  There may be some efforts in the global financing debate to seek to reduce donor efforts in meeting agreed targets.  This would make the process of agreeing a new set of global development goals significantly more difficult.  While recognising the potential of using grants to leverage public and private sector resources, we need to ensure this does not divert ODA from the provision of basic services in developing countries.</p><p> It is important that the Council conclusions reiterate the importance of domestic resource mobilisation, including taxation, and highlight the importance of taking action to improve domestic resource mobilisation at the national level.  Ireland's position in this regard is reflected in our new development policy and our efforts to deepen the engagement of the Revenue Commissioners with the aid programme in order to help our partners to improve their institutions' ability to collect domestic revenues. </p><p> I welcome the active engagement of civil society, both in Ireland and internationally, on the complex issue of financing for development.  At the UN high level event in September the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Joe Costello, took part in dialogue between civil society, governments and UN representatives and launched Trocaire's report, My Rights Beyond 2015: Making the Post 2015 Framework Accountable to the World's Poor.  </p><p> I will be happy to take questions from members.</p></speech>

It is a challenging scene, given the global economic environment and the many demands for aid made across the globe.</p> <p>It is a challenging scene given the global economic situation and also the many demands for aid across the globe.</p><p> The preamble of the European Commission communication, A Decent Life for All, mentions human rights as an issue for aid.  The committee has discussed the matter and we feel that reference should go well beyond a reference in the preamble and should be part of the objectives, implementation and accountability.  What are Irish Aid's intentions with regard to the post-2015 development framework?  How can we capitalise on our membership of the UN Human Rights Council in order to place human rights at the centre of that debate with regard to international aid?</p><p> Dr. O'Neill referred to sustainable investment finance.  To what extent are the UN principles on lending and borrowing being endorsed, implemented and strengthened?  Lending, particularly private lending, is obviously an issue in developing countries.  Developed countries and particularly developing countries have been extremely badly affected by the global economic downturn over the past five years, which came about as a result of irresponsible banking and lending, and also a serious failure of regulation everywhere.  Of course Ireland was a prime example of that.  What emphasis will the review place on improving the regulation and supervision of the financial sector, and supporting developing countries' involvement in those particular reforms?</p><p> Dr. O'Neill made reference to value for money, which should obviously apply in everything.  Every euro of taxpayers' money that is spent should come under the microscope in that regard.  There is a need for thorough evaluations of development and poverty-reduction impacts, including whether the money could be better used elsewhere before promoting the diversion of scarce ODA to blend with loans that mainly benefit European companies.  There is a danger in this.  I know we have moved to sustainable development, which is important.  However, it is equally important that we do not allow that to become distorted.  It needs to meet the needs of the donee countries rather than trying to generate our own European economic development.  Therefore there is a need to refrain from pushing trade and investment agreements and perhaps international taxation standards that are detrimental to developing countries' economies.</p><p> I commend Dr. O'Neill on his presentation.  I am sure other members will have other issues to raise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.922" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013111300005#D00200"><p>I thank Dr. O'Neill and his team along with the political establishment of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, and the Taoiseach for carrying out phenomenal work on behalf of those suffering from hunger and deprivation.  Notwithstanding our small population of 4.5 million to 5 million, it makes us extremely proud to know that we are now recognised widely throughout the world as one of the leading countries engaged in the process of looking comprehensively at the world, its problems and their causes, and presumably solutions to why so many are living in poverty, so many babies are dying prematurely and so many people are undernourished.  I am very conscious that we have a programme running jointly with the United States on nutrition for children.</p><p>  After taking the credit for doing phenomenal work, I wish to move to some of the hard facts confronting the committee and us all as citizens of the world.  I congratulate the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on organising with the former President, Mrs. Mary Robinson, an event in Dublin Castle.  That event gave those who attended an insight into the grassroots throughout the world who felt they had no voice.  They were now facilitated for the first time with a voice and need the world to know of their predicament in their relative locations.  For example, the pastoralists of the Maasai were present and outlined the complication of their lives owing to land ownership.  The pastoralists desire to move around and restrictions are being placed on them.  There were people from tiny villages in Nepal and isolated fishermen and fisherwomen from Lake Victoria in the Great Lakes area.  For the first time politicians in the First World were listening to the voices of really interesting people from diverse regions who wanted their voices heard.  In the development of the framework I hope we will pay due consideration to their voices.</p><p>  This brings me to the kernel of the debate.  I congratulate the collective world on implementing those millennium goals which it has implemented to date.  We have been successful in three areas and we may have failed in another three areas.  However, in some areas we have succeeded in halving the extreme poverty rates in the world, halving the proportion of people without access to clean water - no mean task - and significantly improving the lives of at least 100 slum-dwellers.  However, we have not yet managed - the programme is to run to 2015 - to achieve the targets set on maternal health, access to sanitation and reducing hunger.  They apparently remain well off track.  We will be reviewing our strategy after the end of the 2015 goals.</p><p>  Ireland has experience of empowering people or capacity building as a means of providing aid to countries.  Does Dr. O'Neill believe capacity building is one of the most important areas in the provision of aid?  The Gulu region of Uganda has come out of a terrible war, with experience of child soldiers, impoverishment and hunger.  Ireland was supporting the redevelopment and integration of the people of that region.  Within the Ugandan Government the President's office was discovered to have been defrauding this country's aid to the tune of &euro;3 million and aid from Denmark and Sweden.  A total of &euro;12 million was being diverted by a sophisticated scam thereby depriving the people we are targeting of aid in vitally needed resources.  However, I understand that Irish Aid had actually empowered the comptroller and auditor general's people, who then discovered the president's men were engaged in diverting our &euro;3 million.  We immediately stopped and we got the money back.</p><p>  This is a classic example that shows if we provide strategic aid through capacity building it is possible to achieve so much more than just responding to the hunger pangs of malnourished children.</p> <p>This is linked to the question, which has been touched on, of empowering these countries to have a proper taxation system to prevent the drain on their public finances by the flow of the illicit proceeds of crime, tax evasion and corruption, which fundamentally undermine the work of the MDGs and the countries providing development aid.  Does Dr. O'Neill agree it does not sound as humanitarian as responding to an immediate crisis such as an earthquake, flood or tsunami but if we could provide services to weak governments to reform their taxation systems, for example, to strengthen their tax administration and implement policy, that would prevent corruption?  It is a hugely complex issue to consider the world in general and impoverished regions in particular and to come up with a set of proposals but I am happy having read the Commission's report and given the involvement of the Government along with our dear friends from Norway and Denmark that we have something to say.</p><p> If we can copperfasten human rights as the fundamental issue when providing development aid and support policies for these governments and it is enshrined in the master plan of the UN, NGOs would be empowered on the ground, although it might not necessarily resolve everything overnight.  I wish the officials the best with their work.</p></speech>

I attended a showcase in UCC last Friday by a student who had been supported by Irish Aid.  The organisation provided six-month placements in various locations.  While preparing for the meeting, I refreshed my mind on our new policy, One World, One Future.  Dr. O'Neill said the communication from the Commission on ODA will be agreed next month.  Is he concerned that there may be a shift in emphasis toward allocation of funding or support?  I accept his comment that Ireland is committed to giving support to the least developed countries and we do well in the context of our contributions on an international scale.  Is there likely to be a change in emphasis that may not suit our ambitions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.925" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013111300006#E00300"><p>It is most important in updating the development goals post-2015, which is incorporated in what Dr. O'Neill has told us, to have learned from the experiences of the past number of years and to put that to good effect.  It is also hugely important that there is accountability and that the ways and means are found to ensure international aid can find a way whereby the opportunities for interfering with the free flow of aid to the people for whom it is intended are limited.  The fewer the opportunities, the greater the efficiency and impact.  If the flow of aid is not effective, then at times of economic stress, public confidence in the system is liable to wane and that can be damaging.  The threat of fraud is greater in times of economic distress nationally and internationally, both from the point of view of the donor countries in terms of value for money and the recipients countries in terms of the temptation that might be there in certain circumstances.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.926" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Vincent O'Neill" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013111300006#E00400"><p>We have a statement on the emergency in the Philippines.  I thank members for their supportive comments and questions.  Senator Walsh and Deputy Byrne raised the issue of human rights.  They are correct that this is a core consideration in planning for co-operation with partner countries.  It is an interesting issue because in the report of the high level panel that David Cameron and the Liberian and Indonesian presidents chaired, it came across as one of the flaws of the MDGs as they are currently constituted, and a commitment to human rights is a prerequisite to development and poverty reduction.  One of their strong recommendations is that human rights should be centre stage in any post-2015 framework.</p><p>  This issue also came up in many discussions about the review of the White Paper and the development of a new policy in Ireland.  There were many submissions, including from the committee, and other organisations made the case strongly that a commitment to human rights needs to feature much more centrally in the way Ireland's new policy is put together.  Human rights has been inserted as one of the six core principles in the new policy, which will underpin everything we do.  I refer to the Vice Chairman's comment on accountability.  The importance of human rights governance and accountability is one of the three major goals that shapes how Ireland's future programme needs to be co-ordinated.</p><p>  The fear we have is that following the HIPC programme, we are witnessing worrying tends in some of these countries where levels of indebtedness are increasing at a time ODA levels are not adequate or other forms of financing are not available and government revenue is not adequate.  There is a fear we will go down this path again of countries becoming indebted and sometimes being loaned money by emerging economies.</p><p>  Ireland supports the key principles mentioned through UNCTAD and other multilateral arenas to try to work with our partner governments on understanding what constitutes sustainable lending and what are the pitfalls countries need to avoid.  It is easy to say we need our partners to comply with principles.  We also have to work equally hard to help them access the resources they need to finance their national development programmes.  That links to an issue raised by Deputy Byrne about the importance of revenue, which is reflected well in the Commission's communication.  In many of the countries in which we are working, the potential for them to generate revenue for development is ten times that what they could ever hope to access through international development co-operation.  This also came up in our discussions about the new aid policy and it is reflected in the policy but it is also integral to the discussion on financing for development.</p> <p> How the international community can work with key partners to help them to boost their revenue generation is one of the issues of long-term capacity building mentioned by Deputy Eric Byrne.  We have some programmes with Revenue which has been very enthusiastic about engaging more with us.  The key political message in the new policy is that we will work with our partners, but we will help to wean them off a reliance on overseas development aid over time.  The way in which we can do this is to boost national revenue generation.  We have a programme of support focused on Rwanda; we have just produced a guidance note for all of our missions on how to support better domestic revenue generation in our partner countries; and we are examining deeper partnership with the Irish revenue authorities with a view to building on the positive experience we have had to date.  We also support some of the work on taxation done through the OECD.</p><p> The issues of evaluation and value for money were raised and they are very important.  We have had a strong culture of evaluation in development and co-operation for the reasons mentioned by the Vice Chairman and this is absolutely necessary when working in high-risk environments at a time in Ireland when people are rightly asking questions about whether we know what we are getting back and whether we are getting value for money or being defrauded.  We must demonstrate not only that we can be accountable for every cent invested in the aid programme but what we are getting for the money we are investing in health, education, water and sanitation services, in other words, what are the returns.</p><p> A feature of Ireland's membership of the OECD is it subjects the official programme to scrutiny every five years.  In January 2014 the development assistance committee will undertake a formal evaluation of Ireland's commitment to development and co-operation.  It will be interested in meeting the committee as part of its deliberations.  It nominates two peer reviewers, in our case Austria and Portugal, and Lithuania will also attend as an observer.  They will identify one of our partner countries to visit.  They will come to Ireland and meet the Houses of the Oireachtas, non-governmental organisations, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other Departments.  They will make a judgment call on whether Ireland's aid programme adheres to good international practice, whether we are focused on the needs of the poorest countries and what recommendations they might make on strengthening our performance in the years ahead.  It is an important issue in giving assurance to the Oireachtas and Irish citizens that somebody is keeping an eye on this issue.  The report will be made available in the public domain.</p><p> I thank Deputy Eric Byrne for his comments on the Dublin Castle event which several of us attended.  For the reasons he mentioned, it was an important moment.  We brought many participants from local communities from throughout the world and gave them a say.  Their message is always that they are not being consulted.  Everybody speaks about these issues in the corridors of Geneva, Brussels and New York, but local communities are not being consulted.  They had an opportunity to give a view.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State gave a guarantee at the meeting that they would take these messages to the United Nations and the T&aacute;naiste honoured this guarantee.  He brought these messages to the United Nations General Assembly in September and they are continuing to inform.  We see ongoing participation and dialogue with representative groups and beneficiaries as important for financing development and shaping a post-2015 agenda.</p><p> With regard to capacity building, the example of Uganda was mentioned.  This has been an issue, with more failures than successes.  We speak about supporting our partners in capacity building and know how long it took Ireland to establish good effectively functioning key institutions such as the National Statistics Office, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Parliament and parliamentary committees.  This matter is related to the accountability issue raised by the Vice Chairman.  It takes a long time and sustained effort to work with these entities to help to build results.  We are in a position to do this through the bilateral aid programme.  It is also an issue which arose as a weakness in the millennium development goals.  Everybody was focusing on what we wanted to achieve without focusing on what institutions should be provided with in order to have long-term gains in these areas.  We have tried to reflect this in the policy approach, but we are under no illusions about how difficult it can be.  It is also an area in which we are learning.  We can have better linkages between Irish institutions and institutions in our partner countries.  We have a very good long-term partnership between the ESRI and the equivalent entity in Vietnam.  The ESRI relates its experience of generating useful data on economics and social development which can inform policy development over time.</p><p> To answer Senator Deirdre Clune, we are concerned about overseas development aid, but we are not specifically concerned about major changes taking place in the Council conclusions next month.  There is recognition that the overseas development aid concept fashioned in the 1970s is no longer as relevant as it was, but major elements of it remain absolutely relevant today.  The essential elements of overseas development aid relate to official giving from OECD countries.  It also relates to whether it is given as grants or loans.  It relates to the countries to which it is given and the activities for which it is given.  There are elements in the debate who would like to see the definition changed to justify a decrease in the allocation of budget and other reasons.  From our perspective, it remains absolutely valid to plan to give grants to least developed countries provided there is dialogue about their usage.  Ireland's assistance is 100% untied and we believe we have some solid ground to work on, given our history.  We will engage in the coming years as the debate unfolds, coming at it from a strong position of defending what is very positive about overseas development aid and trying to ensure these positives are not diluted by other interests which would try to justify a decrease in the allocation to their aid budgets.</p><p> I hope I have addressed some of the issues raised.</p></speech>

I am the director on the humanitarian side of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It is my pleasure to be in attendance to make a brief statement on the dreadful sudden onset crisis that hit the Philippines at the weekend.  Typhoon Haiyan which made landfall across the Philippines on Friday, 8 November was the strongest typhoon in the world this year and one of the most powerful storms ever recorded.  As members will be aware, it left a trail of devastation through the central islands of the Philippines.  With power and telecommunications lines down and vital infrastructure destroyed, the impact of the typhoon extends beyond those areas in the immediate eye of the storm.  On Monday the Government of the Philippines declared a state of calamity in Samar, Leyte, Cebu, Iloilo, Capiz, Aklan and Palawan provinces.  As with all natural disasters, local authorities and communities, as well as the Philippines Red Cross, have led the initial response.  Yesterday, however, the approach of a further tropical depression and anticipated heavy rainfall forced the suspension of the delivery of relief supplies to victims of the typhoon in certain areas.</p><p>  While the media are reporting unconfirmed estimates of up to 10,000 deaths, the official estimated loss of life stood at between 2,000 and 2,500 as of yesterday evening's announcement by the President of the Philippines.  Unfortunately, that number is likely to increase as the assessments continue.  An estimated 11.3 million people across 41 provinces have been affected, representing more than 10% of the country's population, with up to 800,000 people displaced.  As a nation prone to natural disasters, the Philippines has a relatively strong National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, NDRRMC.  I wish to emphasise that the country's government's proactive evacuation of hundreds of thousands of citizens before the storm struck the coast is likely to have resulted in fewer deaths than may otherwise have been the case.</p><p>  The response of the international community to the disaster has been rapid, with a large UN disaster assessment and co-ordination, UNDAC, team and a team of experts from the European Commission's Directorate for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection, ECHO, being deployed as early as Friday, 8 November to assist the national authorities to assess the impact of the disaster.  These assessment missions have fed into the development of a UN flash appeal, launched yesterday by Baroness Valerie Amos in the Philippines.  The appeal calls for funding of $301 million to cover immediate emergency relief and continued support for the affected populations during the coming six months.  A lack of safe drinking water has been identified as the most immediate threat to life, with supplies having been cut off in many areas.  Other high priorities include, as one would expect, the provision of shelter, health care, particularly for those with trauma injuries, the provision of food and sanitation and hygiene.</p><p>  In terms of the response to date, on Monday the United Nations announced an emergency allocation of $25 million to fund critical relief efforts.  This allocation came from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, CERF, a pooled fund from which financing can be made rapidly available in the event of disasters such as this.  It allows UN and NGO agencies to respond quickly to the needs of communities across the affected region.  Ireland was one of the founding donors to the CERF on its establishment in 2006 and we are making efforts to maintain our support for it.  We are consistently ranked among its top ten donors.  Our most recent contribution was in December last year in respect of 2013 operations and amounted to &euro;10 million.  We are hoping to be in a position to make a similar contribution at the end of this year in respect of 2014.  The Irish Government closely monitored the progress of Typhoon Haiyan over the course of last week and had put in place preliminary arrangements for a response prior to the storm making landfall on Friday.  As a result of this preparatory action, Ireland was one of the first countries to react to this terrible disaster and our announced funding is the seventh highest stated national commitment to date.</p><p>  As the scale of the destruction wreaked by the storm became evident over the weekend, our team worked to organise the airlifting of essential relief items to the value of &euro;510,000 from our stocks in Dubai.  An urgent call for proposals was issued on Sunday morning to our trusted NGO partners.  It is expected that, on the basis of the proposals received by the close of business yesterday, at least &euro;1 million will be released to support our NGO partners' relief operations, bringing the value of our total contribution to just over &euro;1.5 million as of today.  In addition, we have approved the release of &euro;300,000 in funds that had been pre-positioned with NGO partners for sudden emergencies such as this.  We expect to approve the release of a further &euro;125,000 by the end of the week.  We are also actively considering a further airlift of essential shelter items in the coming days on the basis of forthcoming needs assessments.  In addition, members of Ireland's Rapid Response Corps, a roster of experienced humanitarian experts available to deploy at short notice, are on standby to assist with and fill critical gaps in the relief effort at the request of our key UN and NGO partners.  We activated the corps on Sunday and 15 rapid response experts have declared themselves ready and willing to deploy.  We fully expect a number of members to be deployed in the coming days on the basis of requests we receive through the mechanisms at our disposal.</p><p>  I will highlight some of the many challenging facets of the response to the disaster.  It is inevitable and understandable that after a few days the media will begin to highlight the difficulties involved in getting aid into a country such as the Philippines.  Evidently, the damage caused to vital infrastructure, including roads, airports and telecommunications, is a critical challenge to the rapid delivery of relief items.  The very geography of the Philippines, a large archipelago of more than 7,000 islands, also complicates the delivery of relief.  </p><p>  Last but not least, it is important to recognise the immense strain already placed on humanitarian agencies in terms of their staff capacity and on donors' humanitarian budgets by the unprecedented requirements of the response to the Syrian crisis.  Just to illustrate this point, this morning I held a telephone discussion with one of our NGO partners about the dilemma facing it in terms of possibly needing to redeploy essential staff from Syria to the Philippines to meet needs there.  These are the real challenges faced by agencies on the ground.  The international community has learned many lessons from previous crises such as the 2004 tsunami and the 2010 Haiti earthquake.  Under the leadership of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, clear systems have been put in place to ensure the most effective, efficient and rapid delivery of aid possible.  Ireland has and will continue to make every effort to ensure our response is timely and effective and, within the means at our disposal, meets the most critical and urgent needs.</p></speech>

He referred to the NDRRMC in the Philippines, which seems to be good.</p> <p>The saying, "Fail to prepare, prepare to fail" comes to mind.  Is this is a feature of other at risk areas around the world, in particular in the Caribbean where similar disasters have occurred?</p><p> Reference was made to the Syrian crisis, which is another man-made disaster of significant proportions and emphasises the urgency in terms of resolving the conflict there.  Resources are being diverted there which could be made available to assist when natural disasters, over which we have no control, occur.  It behoves us to do everything possible to progress the Geneva II talks.</p><p> In complimenting the Department on its response, it appears that given the scale of this disaster, Ireland's contribution of &euro;1.5 million, which when the additions mentioned are taken into account will probably amount to approximately $2.7 million, which is over 10% of what has been provided by the UN, should be greater.  In saying that, I must surely then by critical of the UN.  Also as Ireland contributes directly to the UN it is indirectly making an additional contribution.  However, if as a small island we are providing more than 10% of what is being provided by the UN, then surely the UN should even at this stage be making a much greater commitment.  I would welcome a response from the witnesses on that issue.  I know a lot of countries are under pressure. The challenges being faced in Ireland, by citizens and the State, pale almost into insignificance when compared with this natural disaster.</p></speech>

I agree with much of what Senator Walsh had to say.  Is the Department satisfied that other countries, in particular the more powerful ones with huge populations, are making a contribution equal to that being made by Ireland?  I refer in this regard to countries such as the United States.  Is the Department satisfied that its contribution in terms of effort is equivalent to that being made by Ireland?  The witnesses might outline what oversight the Department has on the ground in the Philippines in terms of the outcome of Ireland's contribution.</p></speech>

Like previous speakers, I, too, would be concerned about the quickness of some of our larger European partners and other countries worldwide in terms of response and contribution.  Ireland can be proud of its being the seventh largest contributor per head of population.</p><p>  I am aware of the amount provide by the Irish Government through Irish Aid.  Do the witnesses have information on how much Irish people would be likely to contribute through the various aid agencies?  That information would be important and significant.  While obviously we have reputable agencies working on the ground and doing tremendous work people want to know that those in distress are able to access the aid.  The impression thus far is that some people have not yet been reached, in terms of aid, owing to transport difficulties.  I heard this morning that the availability of fuel, which is in scarce supply, will be a major challenge.  How is that issue likely to be addressed?</p><p>  From a learning point of view, from where are the emergency items accessed in an emergency?  Is there a stock of these somewhere?  I would welcome if the witnesses could elaborate on how an emergency situation such as this is handled on the ground.  We would like the message to go out from this committee that we would like the Government to do everything possible, and the Irish people to be as generous as always, to assist in this situation.  It is incumbent on all of us to help the most vulnerable people in their hour of crisis.  It is worrying that a  decision may have to be taken on whether to abandon the people displaced in Syria because of the crisis in the Philippines or to continue to help both vulnerable communities.</p></speech>

What amount of funding has been provided to date by the EU?  Do the countries that have traditionally provided overseas development aid through tied aid change their system of support when a humanitarian disaster occurs?  With regard to the unconfirmed estimates of death - while we would prefer if no deaths had occurred, I welcome that the number in this regard has decreased - am I correct that owing to communications difficulties there is a lack of intelligence or knowledge on the implications of the typhoon on various parts of the country?  Are the witnesses aware of the basis for the figures provided?</p><p>  Like Deputy Neville, I, too, would like to know the level of support provided by the Irish people through the non-governmental organisations, which funding is as important as the State's contribution, which I welcome.  I hope that the T&aacute;naiste and ODA will be in a position to quickly provide more assistance.  I read recently that some of the Irish NGOs, including Tr&oacute;caire, are working with sister organisations in the Philippines.  We wish all the organisations involved well with their work and support for these beleaguered people.</p></speech>

I would have thought that the series of measures to be taken immediately by the international community in such disasters would now be a prerequisite.  For example, it was known for 48 hours that the typhoon was approaching, as was the case in other similar disasters.  In my view, the first priority is organisation.  We discussed policy earlier.  With all the best intentions in the world, policy is of little benefit without the ability to activate that policy rapidly.  We realise this.  The country's affected must first make the call for and facilitate international aid.  In such situations the heavy lifting equipment needed for the reconstruction of bridges across rivers, fuel supply and so on are necessities.  They must be the first priorities in a disaster situation.  To what extent has the international community come to grips with this?</p> <p>To my mind, it has not just yet, and there is a necessity to do so.  With the best will in the world, this country has given a very good example to everybody else by making a donation at an early stage.  Members have already pointed out that other countries with much greater resources than are available here have not been as fast in addressing the matter.  It is a matter for them to consider.  The co-ordination of the effort and rapidity of the response are significant elements in the case of a natural or other disaster.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.937" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Kelly" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013111300010#J00200"><p>I thank the members for their many very important and relevant questions, and I hope I can do justice to them.  Senator Walsh asked about disaster risk reduction and whether it is a feature of disaster prone countries.  It is increasingly a feature of such countries, which are prone to these kinds of cyclical natural disasters.  Just last night I was listening to the President of the Philippines who said there are typhoons every year and the country suffered an earthquake not so long ago.  That is why countries like the Philippines have disaster risk reduction management councils and elaborate co-ordination structures in place.</p><p>  Irish Aid has also prioritised this area and not just at a policy level, where we have been promoting the concept of resilience, which is almost the opposite of fragility.  We are trying to build longer term resilience of countries such as this that would be prone to these kinds of disasters, which is why we have supported, in a number of countries that we are engaged in, local authorities and governments in building capacity for disaster risk reduction.  During our EU Presidency this was a major theme, and we helped to shepherd through some Council conclusions in the resilience area.  It is very important to say that although it is a calamitous loss of life in the Philippines, the very prompt and pre-emptive action of the Filipino Government in evacuating thousands of people did greatly reduce the number of deaths.</p><p>  There is a very illustrative example if one considers the impact of the earthquake that hit Haiti and the earthquake of similar ferocity that hit Chile; there were vast differences in the consequences and impact of those earthquakes because Chile had put in place elaborate systems around disaster risk reduction and management, whereas Haiti - which is a much poorer and less developed country - did not have those systems in place.  Disaster risk reduction is a very important aspect of what we do.</p><p>  The points have been well made about Syria and the crisis in the Philippines emphasises the need to come to a political solution.  Syria is very much a man-made conflict and crisis but the scenario in the Philippines is of a very different variety.  As I indicated earlier, real challenges have been posed.  Some very welcome comments were made about the scale of our response, and members have welcomed the speed with which we reacted while legitimately questioning the amount of support.  This year we have allocated over &euro;11 million to Syria, as there is significant need in that part of the world as well.  We have a finite set of resources at our disposal, and very often we are in a difficult position in trying to juggle those competing priorities.  I fully agree that this emphasises the need to resolve that crisis.</p><p>  On the question of whether the UN should be giving more, I should clarify that my statement referred specifically to the &euro;25 million from the UN central emergency response fund released by Baroness Valerie Amos.  This is a fund to which Ireland is a contributor but it is just one element of the UN's response.  It is a pooled funding mechanism that donors such as Ireland can quickly use to bring resources to the ready for distribution stage.  It does not represent the totality of the UN response, and a number of other UN agencies have issued separate appeals, such as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNICEF and many other agencies that will allocate resources.  It is important to make the point that the UN only has the sum of its member state contributions, and contributions made on a voluntary basis have also been affected by the global economic crisis.  I am sure talk of the need for additional resources would be music to the ears of UN agencies.</p><p>  Deputy Neville asked about what other countries are giving and if we are happy with the level of effort.  Currently, we rank quite favourably and the Deputy is correct in that the resources we are likely to allocate in the coming days will be in the region of &euro;2 million or $2.6 million.  The United States has allocated an initial amount of $20 million and the UK has made an allocation of &pound;10 million.  Japan and Australia have contributed $10 million each and Canada has contributed &euro;10 million.  The European Union made an initial allocation from emergency resources of $4 million and it has indicated that $40 million is foreseen down the line from development funding.  We are still very much in the early stages of identifying the needs of the crisis, and some of my colleagues have attended meetings in New York, Geneva and Brussels.  There is a great deal of energy around trying to gather the momentum and as many resources as can be made available.</p><p>  Deputy Neville also asked about oversight mechanisms for the aid at our disposal, which is a very legitimate query.  We do not have an embassy in the area, and although we have diplomatic relations with the Philippines, our embassy is through Singapore.  There is an excellent honorary consulate service to support Irish citizens in distress in the Philippines but we do not have an Irish Aid office or mechanisms.  On the humanitarian side we are working through reputable UN agencies, subject to audit, accountability and strict co-ordination mechanisms that we have audited in the past and which we will be able to monitor in the future.</p><p>  With regard to non-governmental organisation, NGO, funding that will be made available, this will be done through a set of reputable NGOs that we are confident has a solid track record of engagement in humanitarian interventions such as this.  Many of them already have previous or current presence on the ground in the Philippines, and through the accountability mechanisms we put in place through documentation, we will consider the possibility of field monitoring and ensuring we have the best possible value.  We must see that there is effectiveness in the response.</p><p>  Deputy Smith asked about EU funding, which I have mentioned, and queried whether the aid is tied or untied.  Humanitarian aid is seen as separate, and just as much as we maintain a distinction between programme development aid from Irish Aid, which is long-term in nature and programmed in a different way, humanitarian aid is very much driven by the humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence.  Humanitarian aid would be delivered in grant form and in an untied manner.</p><p>  Deputy Smith also asked why there was confusion about the number of deaths, and we have also asked that question.  Very often there are wildly varying estimates of numbers.  We have all seen the news coverage of the Philippines crisis and many areas have not yet been accessed and information has not yet come from many municipalities.  Roads remain impassable and we have not even been able to get telecommunication links with certain areas.  The President of the Philippines has put the variance down to emotional officials providing very high numbers.</p> <p>I am not sure on what basis those initial figures of 10,000 people were presented by the media, but the current official estimate we have from the Philippines is approximately 2,500.  Unfortunately and sadly, however, I expect that figure will rise.</p><p> I was also asked if I have an estimate of what funding will be available from the Irish public.  The answer is "No" but, as we are all aware, the Irish public is notable for the generosity it shows at times of crisis.  Even when times are tough at home, Irish people are known to be the world's most generous donors on an individual basis.  I am not referring to government aid, but donations from people's pockets.  We expect that the Irish public will probably respond to this with its usual generosity.  We, representing government aid, will of course wish to keep an eye on that and ensure that, in the context of the resources we have at our disposal, the Government is also responding in a similar way.</p><p> I will finish on the issue of the stocks, in response to the question asked by Senator Mullins.  However, the Vice Chairman asked about co-ordination and if we had learned any lessons regarding co-ordination and why the response always seems to be so slow and chaotic.  We have all seen the dreadful images of looting, chaos and desperate people, and we heard some very disturbing reports of eight people being killed in a stampede into a warehouse last night.  It always looks as if it is a very chaotic response.  The United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination, UNDAC, team leader in the Philippines in a media interview yesterday described it as chaos, but organised chaos.  In fact, there is a very elaborate system for co-ordination.  Lessons have been learned from the experiences of Haiti and the tsunami.  There is an elaborate system in place.  Valerie Amos, who has visited Ireland and whom the committee has met in the past, pulls rank as the senior UN person.  She comes into a country such as that and the UN humanitarian co-ordination system kicks into action.  There are nine thematic clusters for co-ordination at both the field and global levels, and each field level cluster is led by a UN agency.  I will not go through them all but, for illustrative purposes, UNICEF leads a nutrition cluster, the World Health Organisation, WHO, leads a health cluster and emergency shelter is led by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  Systems kick into action and the UN organisations we support fall in line with those systems of co-ordination.  Every attempt is made to ensure there is a co-ordinated response.</p><p> Of course, this is typhoon season and one can anticipate that there will be typhoons at this time of year.  However, I have outlined the reasons for how stretched the humanitarian system is.  That is not just NGOs and bilateral donors such as Ireland, but also UN agencies.  It is very difficult to have all of the resources at the ready for when something such as this happens.  Unfortunately, that is the case.  However, even in respect of Ireland's small contribution and the team I am leading within the Department, just yesterday - the Vice Chairman asked a very pertinent question - our evaluation and audit unit shared a document with me which contained evaluations of previous responses to Haiti and the tsunami, with six or seven lessons that I should bear in mind as I co-ordinate the response to the Philippines.  Therefore, there is an effort in Ireland and internationally to learn from previous experience.</p><p> I have spoken at length so I will conclude on the issue of stocks.  The question was about how that works and how it happens that we have tents, tarpaulins, ropes and such equipment at our disposal.  Basically, this is through Ireland's rapid response initiative.  The rapid response initiative was established in 2007 by the Government.  It involves having a roster of skilled experts at the ready, as well as stocks.  We have stocks such as those mentioned by the Senator in different depots throughout the world.  There are five depots - in Subang, Malaysia; Panama; Dubai; Accra and Brindisi in Italy.  These stocks are located at very strategic points around the globe so they can be readily made available to respond.</p><p> In fact, we were in something of a bind for the current crisis at the weekend because we had just utilised all of the stocks Ireland had ready in Subang, Malaysia, which is closest to respond to the Philippines, because we had responded less than a month earlier to the terrible events in Bohol in the Philippines.  In a situation such as that, the partnerships we have mean we were able to borrow the stocks of other donors and fly goods from Dubai.  Our stocks from Dubai will be the first airlift supplies to arrive.  We faced problems over the weekend securing the right aircraft that could land in these very difficult circumstances, but I am happy to report that, at 4 p.m. today, our airplane from Dubai should have just touched down in Manila.  It should have landed this morning but it was delayed.  By 7 p.m. Irish time it will touch down in Sebu, in the Philippines.  That will be the first of such airlifts.  We will plan to do more because even if our budget gets depleted towards the end of this year, happily we have additional stocks on hand to deploy for this crisis, if necessary.</p></speech>

Supply, transport and communications are basic requirements in any campaign, be it military, political or aid.  We have some experience of those too.  It is hugely important that the concentration is directed in the way that is most required at the time.  All of us have many constituents from the Philippines who have integrated very well into our society.  In that regard, it would be important to have some special diplomatic provision made, so in the event of circumstances such as this arising there can be a recognised path for communication and discussion.</p><p>  I thank you for coming.  I am sorry Ms Sarah Hunt, Ms Karen Millar and Mr. John O'Grady did not get to speak, despite having sat in the front row, and I acknowledge their two support colleagues sitting at the back.  We thank you again for a most interesting discussion.  No doubt, we will have to visit this subject at times again in the future.</p></speech>

Putting them on silent mode is not sufficient.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Anne Ferris and Senator Katherine Zappone.</p><p>  The purpose of the meeting is to consider two motions that have been laid before the D&aacute;il and Seanad: COM (2013) 258, proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of an agreement between Canada and the European Union on the transfer and processing of passenger name record data; and COM (2013) 259, proposal for a Council decision on the signature of an agreement between Canada and the European Union on the transfer and processing of passenger name record data.  Briefing information has been circulated to members.  I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and her officials for agreeing to assist us in our consideration of these matters.  We will begin with an opening statement by the Minister of State, to be followed by a question and answer session.

Two motions are required because the agreement itself is the subject of two separate proposals for Council decisions.  This simply reflects the EU procedure for establishing such agreements, whereby the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament are co-legislators.  It requires that the Council of Ministers must first adopt a decision to sign the agreement.  The agreement is then sent to the European Parliament for its consent and, if that consent is given, the Council of Ministers subsequently adopts a decision to conclude the agreement.</p><p>  The motions before the committee today are necessary to enable Ireland to participate in this measure.  They propose that Ireland should exercise the option provided by Protocol 21 to the treaty on the functioning of the EU - that is to say, the Lisbon treaty - to participate in the adoption and application of an EU-Canada PNR agreement.  The prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas is required, in accordance with the provisions of Article 29.4.7 of the Constitution, to enable Ireland to exercise that option.  In line with the provisions of Protocol 21 to the Lisbon treaty, Ireland has three months to signal its participation in any given measure.  In the case of this proposed agreement, the State must signal its participation by 26 November.</p><p>  The Government has approved the proposal of the Minister for Justice and Equality that Ireland should take part in this measure.  It is our view that measures such as these are to be welcomed and deserve our support.  They can provide important support to police and law enforcement authorities in the fight against transnational serious crime and terrorism.</p><p>  The proposal replaces the current EU-Canada PNR agreement which was concluded in 2005 and has been in operation since then.  Following the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty, the European Parliament requested a renegotiation of this and the PNR agreements then in place with the United States and Australia.  Members will be aware that revised agreements with those two countries have been established and put in place, and were considered by the committee under the same Protocol 21 in advance of Ireland's participation in them.  Subsequent to the European Parliament's request for a renegotiation of the agreement with Canada, the Council of Ministers authorised the European Commission to conduct negotiations on behalf of the EU.  It presented a draft agreement with Canada to the Council in May of this year.  It is intended to seek approval to sign the proposed agreement at the meeting of the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in December.  However, the deadline for opting into the agreement remains 26 November.</p><p>  The proposed agreement provides that air carriers operating flights between the EU and Canada will provide to the Canada Border Services Agency certain PNR data for passengers flying to or from Canada.  PNR data comprise information relating to passengers' travel reservations that is collected and held by air carriers as part of their reservations systems.  The proposed agreement will require the airlines to continue to provide a portion of this information to the Canadian authorities for the purposes of combating terrorism and serious transnational crime.  In practical terms, the proposed agreement will have no new or additional impacts for EU air carriers as the PNR data is already being provided under the 2005 agreement.  However, unlike that agreement, the new proposal encompasses comprehensive data protection provisions and safeguards to be built in as part of the agreement itself.  Under the 2005 agreement, on the other hand, data protection measures did not form part of the agreement.  Rather, they were included as a set of commitments by the Canada Border Services Agency in regard to the application of the PNR agreement.</p><p>  As I said, the proposed provisions represent an important tool in the fight against serious crime and terrorism.  However, I am conscious of the need to ensure the rights of citizens are not subject to unnecessary or disproportionate intrusion, notwithstanding the importance of protecting both individuals and society against harm.  It is essential to strike the right balance in measures such as these, especially with regard to privacy and the protection of personal data.  Accordingly, the agreement contains a number of important and specifically tailored safeguards in respect of the use of  PNR data.  In particular, the purpose of processing the data is strictly limited to preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious transnational crimes.  We can all agree that detecting terrorists, people traffickers and other serious criminals is worthy of support.</p><p>  Furthermore, the agreement sets out clearly a series of provisions relating to the arrangements for the handling and security of the PNR data and for data protection.</p> <p> I draw particular attention to the provisions which establish that an individual will have the right to access his or her own data, to have incorrect data corrected and to seek judicial redress, including compensation, for any violation of his or her rights under the proposed agreement.  </p><p> The retention period relating to PNR data will be limited to five years in total.  However, it is important to note that this data will be depersonalised by the masking out of passenger names after an initial period of only 30 days.  Furthermore, the full depersonalisation of the data, that is, the masking out of all other identifying information, will take place after two years.  Compliance with these rules will be subject to independent oversight by the Privacy Commissioner of Canada - the equivalent of our Data Protection Commissioner - in addition to the Recourse Directorate of the Canada Border Services Agency.</p><p> There are additional controls included in the proposed agreement to deal with the processing of sensitive data, that is, personal data revealing race, ethnicity, religious beliefs, political opinion, etc.  The processing of this data is limited to very exceptional cases and subject to strict additional conditions and safeguards, including approval by the president of the Canada Border Services Agency and the deletion of the sensitive personal data after a maximum period of 15 days.  The European Union is satisfied that the data protection provisions in force in Canada are sufficiently robust to protect EU citizens.</p><p> As stated, Ireland has until 26 November to decide whether to opt in to the adoption and application of the proposed agreement.  This proposal is one of a number of measures being taken at EU level in the justice and home affairs field which arise from commitments set out in the 2009 Stockholm programme.  The Government is determined that Ireland will have a full, active and constructive engagement in bringing forward the European justice agenda.</p><p> A number of countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Canada, Sweden and Spain, have been collecting PNR data for some years in order to help tackle transnational and serious crimes and terrorism.  The use of PNR data has proved to be a very valuable tool in a range of investigations, particularly those targeting drug smugglers, human trafficking and terrorists.  It is, as members will appreciate, difficult to provide details of the operational methods that police and law enforcement investigators might use, particularly when dealing with sensitive investigations.  However, I will give the committee a flavour of the value of PNR in contributing to investigations.  For example, the UK authorities targeted and successfully prosecuted a Chinese gang of people traffickers who had been bringing illegal immigrants into that jurisdiction and Ireland through other EU states.  The use of PNR data was a key tool in the investigation in identifying the people who were being trafficked and linking them with the trafficking facilitators.  I have no doubt that the committee will agree that human trafficking is a particularly reprehensible crime, a serious abuse of human rights and an affront to human dignity.  It is often characterised as the modern equivalent of the slave trade.  It is also often linked with the sexual exploitation of women.  We should never tolerate human trafficking and must use all the tools and resources at our disposal to prevent and combat it, to protect the victims and prosecute the perpetrators.</p><p> PNR data were also used by investigators in the case of David Headley who was convicted for his involvement in the atrocious terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India, in November 2008, in which 164 innocent people lost their lives.  By using details of the suspect&rsquo;s first name, his partial travel itinerary and a possible travel window and entering this intelligence into the PNR database, David Headley&rsquo;s full name, address and passport number were obtained.  He was subsequently arrested and pleaded guilty to terrorism-related charges.</p><p> We can be in no doubt either about the pernicious nature of the international drugs trade.  The supply and use of illegal drugs have a profound destructive impact on individuals' lives, as well as on entire communities.  Drug trafficking is a highly lucrative internationalised crime that has a very local impact.  As public representatives, we have all witnessed the impact of drugs in communities throughout the country.  We must seek to ensure that those who are working to disrupt this criminal activity can take advantage of the relevant tools such as PNR to put the people involved out of business.  Members will also be conscious of the potential value to police services of PNR data in contributing to the investigation of people who travel to overseas locations, often in the Far East, in order to have sex with under-age children.  This is a particularly depraved form of "tourism" and we can be very sure the victims are not willing participants in what is an organised trade.</p><p> Given the potential law enforcement value of PNR data, particularly with regard to investigations into drug smuggling, human trafficking and international terrorism, the Government has no doubt that it is important that Ireland should opt-in in to the proposed agreement.  Our participation in the measure is also a clear demonstration of our continued support and solidarity with our EU and international partners in the fight against these transnational criminal activities.</p><p> I have great pleasure in commending the motions to the committee.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.951" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013111300003#B00300"><p>Every public representative will agree that we must support the policing and intelligence services in combating serious criminality of the type outlined by the Minister of State.  She has also highlighted the need to balance the rights of citizens in order to ensure we assist in the ongoing war against serious criminality.  Said criminality does not recognise borders, particularly in the context of its impact on victims.  In the context of human and civil rights, is the Minister of State satisfied with what is contained in the agreement?  It appears that the original agreement will be strengthened by the new version.  Is the Minister of State satisfied with the protections provided for citizens.  In the past the European Commission's legal service had concerns about the categories of offences on which information was required to be given.  For example, a person who might have been convicted of an offence which was not that serious could have had his or her details passed on.  Will the Minister of State clarify the position on the types of offences involved?</p><p>  I am also seeking reassurance on data protection issues, particularly in the context of the information revealed by Edward Snowden during the past year.  Of course, the policing and intelligence services should be given what they need in order to combat crime, but we must also ensure they do not have too much power and that a Big Brother-type scenario is not created.  Will the Minister of State provide reassurance on the position in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.952" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013111300003#B00400"><p>We all share the Deputy's concerns and there is certainly a need to ensure a proper balance is struck.  However, we must also consider how we can combat human trafficking and the drugs trade.  People who are trafficked often do not know the language spoken in the country to which they have been brought; they can be extremely scared and their documentation will have been taken from them.  It is difficult to obtain a fix on how to combat serious crime, but the agreement will prove to be a major tool in that regard because the relevant experts will be able to use it to monitor the continual comings and goings of individuals and groups.  We will never be able to completely eliminate serious crime, but the agreement will increase our chances of detecting it.</p><p>  Let us ignore what happened during the past year and concentrate on that which has occurred in recent days in the context of people's personal information being stolen by those who are clearly not going to use it for any legitimate purpose.  It is welcome that the European Union has decided to renegotiate this agreement in order to ensure it will be more robust, which is extremely important.  </p><p>  The fact that people will be able to access the relevant information themselves is also very important, as is the fact that a data protection officer in the country in which the information is being stored will have responsibility for ensuring it is kept safe.  The only remit of data protection officers in any jurisdiction is to ensure data relating to individuals are both protected and used for the correct purpose.</p> <p>I am completely assured of that.  It is a good thing that we are coming back to this issue today and that we are building a regime of data protection.  The world has changed in that in 2005 I am not certain that we were as conscious of breaches of data protection as we are now, but we are very conscious of them now.  The robust mechanisms that have been built into this agreement will serve us well.  However, I share the Deputy's concerns.  We always need to be conscious that the details of an individual that are on the system for legitimate purposes could find their way into a space where they not should be.  The fact that individuals will have access to their records and there is a provision built into the system that, in the event that something should happen, they will have a recourse to action should give us some degree of comfort.</p></speech>

I share her view on value of the system of investigations into violent activity, criminal activity, drugs crimes, human trafficking and the exploitation of under-aged children.  However, I have a concern about an issue, which has arisen again recently, namely, the trust between the security services in different countries.  I saw a programme on BBC1 last night which showed that the PSNI had a major lack of trust and confidence in the intelligence service in the North.  That is in a divided community where they are trying build to trust in the relationship between the police force and the local community, and the Nationalist community in particular.  I have a concern about elements of security services in Europe and other countries having PNR data, and many people share that concern.</p><p>  I do not know if the Minister of State is familiar with Anne Cadwallader's book, <i>Lethal Allies</i>, which deals with the issue of collusion, an issue the joint committee covered at the time of the investigation into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  There was an issue of trust and confidence involved there.  The reason I raise this issue is that there are elements within the security forces about which many of us have concerns; their track record in terms of people's rights has let us down.  Does the Minister of State have those concerns?  She hinted at this when she said that when one has this type of information, it must be treated respectfully and there can be no violation of human rights.  The reality is that some people have major concerns about some of the data in respect of individuals that is being shared.  There is a lack of confidence and trust in certain aspects of security services.</p></speech>

It is good for all of us to have that approach and we should question matters.  The BBC programme to which the Deputy referred was about a time when things were very different.  I was here for the inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  Anyone who sat at the table and looked at the pieces we saw was very clear that we were living in an entirely different space.  In terms of transnational crimes, terrorism, drug trafficking, human trafficking and all such crimes, when one is negotiating an agreement with other countries, the only thing one can do is ensure that what is in that agreement is robust and one must then assume that the country which it is with will follow the law in their own land.  I believe we can be assured of that.  If that does happen, as I have said it to Deputy MacLochlainn, there are various of mechanisms in place to ensure people have access to their records and that they have a means of redress.</p></speech>

It does not refer to any other country.  Under this agreement the airlines will have to pass on passengers' names and details to the Canadian border authorities.  I went to Canada about 15 years ago and the Canadian mounted police were at the airport when I arrived in Toronto.  I never got as thorough a check in my life as I did then.  They told me that my passport photograph was not a good likeness and that I had deteriorated since the time it had been taken.  The Canadian authorities are quite thorough in their checks.  Is there a particular reason that it is only Canada that is doing this?</p></speech>

This is not something new.  This agreement has been in place since 2005 but we are now building in a more robust mechanism to protect people's data.  We have an agreement with Spain, Australia and the USA and the EU is negotiating agreements with different countries.  This one, which we have to opt into by 26 November, is with Canada, but this is not about our relationship with Canada in isolation.  It is about the EU's relationship with other countries.</p></speech>

I do not believe anyone could argue with the intention of the motions.  We would all agree that the type of information sharing is critical for law enforcement across borders.  How easy would it be for people to examine the data that is on system and to check whether it is correct or incorrect?  How user friendly will it be for the citizen to establish who has data and what are the data?  If there is anything wrong with their details, how would a person go about getting them changed?  It should be user friendly to ensure that people do not have to deal with a weight of bureaucracy to obtain their rights.</p></speech>

It will be on the printed material one normally completes on these flights.  The provision states that candidates shall ensure that any individual may access the PNR data .  I assume that the only way they can ensure that is by informing the person by way of written documentation.  It states that candidates shall ensure that a compliance authority, within a reasonable time, shall provide the individual with a copy of their PNR data and if the individual makes a written request for their PNR data, there will be a reply in writing to any request.  It further states that Canada shall ensure that the Canadian compliance authority makes the following available on its website: a list of the legislation authorising the collection of PNR data; the reason for the collection of the PNR data; the manner of protecting the PNR data; and the manner and extent to which the data may be disclosed.  There is a website, and there is also information on the transit cards we all complete from time to time.  It will be made clear where that can be accessed but if the request is made, the data must be supplied to the individual and if it is incorrect, it is the data protection officer in charge of that particular section who will alter the information online if the individual requests it.</p><p>  The protections in terms of depersonalising the information are very important.  There may be other issues connected to groups travelling and so on but they may not concern the individual on whom they have the data but it is important that this can be dealt with separately.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.962" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013111300004#C01000"><p>I should have included that in my contribution.  It includes a PNR locator code, date of reservation-issue of ticket  - it is a code with which everyone is issued - dates of  intended travel, name, and available frequent flier and benefits information.  If someone is on the frequent flier list, one's name could end up on this.  It also includes numbers of travellers, and I spoke earlier in terms of a group of people.</p> <p>It includes all available contact information, including originator information; all available payment billing information not included; other transaction details linked to a credit card or account and not connected to the travel transaction; travel itinerary for specific passenger name record, PNR; travel agency code share information - again, all of those details are numbered; split or divided information; travel status of passenger, including confirmation and check-in status; ticketing information, including ticket number, one-way tickets, automated ticket fare quote, all baggage information; seat information, including seat number; general remarks including other supplementary information, OSI, special services information, SSI, and special service request, SSR, information; any advance passenger information, API, data collected for reservation purposes; and all historical changes to PNR data listed in numbers.</p><p> Any of us who have done this know that it is not always necessary that the airline would collect all of this information.  It is only the information that the airline collects.  We do not expect that the airline would be obliged to collect all of the information outlined.  Usually, it is a case of name, address, postal code if one has one and country of birth.  In some countries the information might be requested internally more than externally.  The information available will simply be what the airline collects as a matter of course.</p></speech>

We have seen recent reports of serious data protection breaches.  We all know what I am talking about in that regard.  In the case of a data protection breach in this context, are there mechanisms in place so that citizens can be informed or forewarned?  What are they?  How will someone be told if there is a data protection breach?</p></speech>

I have never been asked for a credit card number on a transit card.  Such information is not usually collected which is a protection in itself.  If there is a breach then it is incumbent on the holders of the information to inform people.  That said, there is a depersonalisation after 30 days and all of the sensitive information which it might have been considered necessary to keep is gone after two years and all of the information is gone after five years.  Such a flushing out of the system will probably ensure that there would not be a great deal of information held at any one time.  It is incumbent on the holders to inform people where the information is still held.</p></speech>

Since its establishment, the commission has consistently expressed its concern regarding the human rights of the Irish Traveller community.  This concern has been reflected at various levels of the commission's work.  It was in the context of the State&rsquo;s first examination under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, CERD, in 2004 that the commission undertook a detailed consideration of the question of Traveller ethnicity.  That was in response to the State&rsquo;s assertion at that time that Travellers did not constitute an ethnic minority in the State.  A discussion paper was published which was a legal analysis of the recognition of Travellers as an ethic minority measured against international human rights standards, relevant case law and legislation.  At that point the commission predicted that the CERD committee would regard Travellers as an ethnic minority when the State&rsquo;s report was examined.  The commission was correct in its prediction and the CERD committee has made two recommendations, in 2005 and again in 2011, urging the State to work more concretely towards recognising the Traveller community as an ethnic minority.  In addition, the UN Human Rights Committee, in considering the State&rsquo;s compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, also made the same observation in 2008 and expressed concern regarding the State&rsquo;s approach to the matter.  It is notable that the UN Human Rights Committee has issued further questions to the State on its work towards the recognition of Traveller ethnicity.</p><p>  At Council of Europe level, the Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities expressed its concern in 2006 regarding the outright rejection by the State of Traveller ethnicity.  The advisory committee, in its most recent opinion on Ireland published in April this year, welcomed the fact that the Government was now demonstrating a more open approach to the question of Traveller ethnicity and recommended that the State finalised its consideration of the proposed recognition of Travellers as an ethnic minority so that they could access all applicable international and domestic non-discrimination rights.</p> <p>As for standards, in January 2013 the Irish Human Rights Commission published its most recent consideration on the question of recognition of Traveller ethnicity.  The commission's submission to the Government welcomed the more open response of the State to the question.  However, the commission also expressed concern that the State had shifted its position from outright denial of ethnicity to one which focused on what may prove to be a wholly-elusive consensus among the Traveller community and Traveller representative organisations as a possible prerequisite to recognition.</p><p> The commission&rsquo;s submission explores this position in detail and submits that the principle of self-identification as protected under the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, CERD, and indeed similarly enshrined in the framework convention, was being misunderstood by the State and that a universal form of self-identification as an ethnic group is not a necessary prerequisite for recognition of an ethnic minority by the State for the purpose of ensuring legal protection of that group.  We pointed out that the Human Rights Committee is clear that the existence of an ethnic minority in a State requires to be established by objective criteria.  This is nothing to do with opinion or consensus.  The principle of self-identification presupposes the existence of an ethnic minority but affords protection to each individual within that group from being coerced in any way to so identify.  One can think of many reasons from history as to the reason such protection is considered necessary for vulnerable minorities.</p><p> As to the question of whether the State should recognise Traveller ethnicity, the commission would submit that Traveller ethnicity essentially is a legal reality by which the State is bound, irrespective of any formal act of recognition.  Regardless of whether the State chooses to so recognise Travellers, it will in no way prevent the international bodies identified in our submission from continuing to recognise Travellers as an ethnic minority and to hold the State to account for their treatment in that light.  By its denial, the State puts itself in the anomalous situation of denying ethnicity but not being able to deny the protections that flow from that status.  We point out that the State has never itself put forward cogent reasons as to why it considers that Travellers do not satisfy the necessary criteria for recognition as an ethnic minority.  More positively, the commission sets out in its submission the reasons recognition of Traveller ethnicity will be of benefit to the Traveller community itself and to the State and society in general.  We also pose the question as to how the State should recognise the ethnicity of Travellers and observe the modalities for recognition of ethnicity are not set out in any international instrument or opinion and so there is no defined process in this regard.  In our written statement, we suggest a possible statement on the record of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, which then is reflected in the State's international reporting and is carried through into domestic law and policy.</p><p> In conclusion, the commission is presently anticipating its merger with its sister organisation, the Equality Authority, and it is appropriate that representatives of both organisations are sitting here side by side today.  We understand that new legislation is imminent and may confer on the new Irish human rights and equality commission a wider remit, including in respect of encouraging intercultural understanding, promoting tolerance and acceptance of diversity in the State.  At this juncture the commission respectfully urges the State itself to lead by example in this regard by finally recognising Traveller ethnicity.</p></speech>

It is the view of the authority that recognition of Traveller ethnicity is central to effective promotion of equality for members of the Traveller community.  Such recognition has significant practical implications.  International agreements and EU legislation will not name specific ethnic groups from particular states within their provisions on ethnicity.  Therefore, Traveller ethnicity needs to be recognised by Ireland to ensure Travellers can fully enjoy the protections and benefits that flow from these agreements and legislation alongside other ethnic groups.  In addition, Traveller ethnicity is a key factor that must be taken into account in identifying and responding to the needs of the Traveller community.  Furthermore, equality is not only concerned with access to resources or decision-making, important as they are, but must involve access to recognition, status and standing in society.  The recognition of Traveller ethnicity is in our view central to achieving equality of status or standing for the Traveller community and would provide a strong foundation for building new relationships of respect and solidarity between the Traveller and settled communities.  Our submission to the Committee consists of a detailed consideration of the issue of Traveller ethnicity, which the authority published in 2006.  Prior to this, as we have just heard, the Irish Human Rights Commission had already published an in-depth consideration of the question of the recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group from a legal perspective, which the Equality Authority endorsed.  Our report, therefore, has a different focus.</p><p>  It provides an overview of the evolution of public policy thinking on Travellers&rsquo; identity as a group in Irish society, drawing on the three major official reports on Travellers and related material, relevant D&aacute;il debates and various statements of Government policy.  What this overview shows is that official policy thinking has in fact moved to a position of strongly affirming the distinct culture and identity of Travellers as an indigenous minority within Irish society.  There is indeed general consensus on this matter.  It further shows that what this has actually meant is that in many ways, Traveller ethnicity has de facto been acknowledged.  For example, I refer to the decision in the Equal Status Act 2000 to incorporate in equality legislation a definition of the Traveller community that was explicitly modelled on the Northern Ireland Race Relations Order 1996.  Not surprisingly the incorporation of this definition in the legislation at the time was generally interpreted as confirming legislative recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group.  However, if in on the one hand it appeared as though Traveller ethnicity was being acknowledged, on the other it was being denied and specifically in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with the international human rights system.  In the light of the positive shifts in official thinking that were evident, the position then taken by Ireland when reporting to CERD, in explicitly denying that Travellers should be recognised as an ethnic group in the international human rights context, was surprising to say the least.  The basis for this denial was far from clear but at least in part was based on a claim that the argument that Travellers are an ethnic group was &ldquo;controversial within academic research&rdquo;.  Our report, therefore, specifically addressed this issue through a detailed analysis of the principal academic literature on Travellers' ethnicity.  This demonstrates that in fact, academic work overwhelmingly supports the recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group.</p><p>  In conclusion, the Equality Authority believes that the case in support of recognising Traveller ethnicity is comprehensive and compelling.  It is recommended that the Government should now recognise Travellers as an ethnic group and that this recognition should be reflected in all policies, programmes and institutional practices that affect the Traveller community.</p></speech>

The position of both bodies is clear and has been on the public record in the past.  However, I now wish to go through some of the implications of what appears to be ongoing ethnicity denial within this State.  As was pointed out in the presentations, in England, Wales and Scotland, on foot of a court decision, the ethnicity of the Irish Traveller community essentially has been recognised.  Through the equality legislation in Northern Ireland, there clearly is a definition of Irish Travellers as an ethnic minority.  Are there are legal implications for the State because the Government has refused to recognise ethnicity?  Are there possible legal implications for the State at a European level in the future if it persists in sustaining this position?  I am mindful the witnesses are not attending as legal experts but I seek their thoughts on this point.</p></speech>

We can then return to further questioning.  Are there particular reasons, legal or otherwise, in respect of European regulations or whatever, that directives for this cannot happen?  What are the implications if it can?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.979" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sin&eacute;ad Lucey" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013111300007#F00100"><p>The Commission's view on this would be that most protections from discrimination in terms of the Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, CERD, are linked to ethnicity.  Therefore, if one does not recognise Travellers as an ethnic group, one does not recognise that they are automatically entitled to the protections under CERD, the framework convention or any similar instruments.  In that regard, the State has been saying that it confers the same protection on Travellers anyway and, therefore, it does not make a difference.  However, it actually makes a significant difference in terms of how the State brings back what those committees are saying to it, how it discusses those issues with Travellers and how it seeks to resolve them.  If the State is having a dual relationship, stating at an international level it is affording them those protections but at a domestic level stating they are not entitled to those protections, that must have legal implications in terms of recognition of ethnicity.</p><p>  More specifically, a more obvious example that has been raised quite consistently is that under EU law, protection from discrimination for minorities is based on race and ethnicity.  It is far from clear whether Travellers can automatically rely on those protections, and that could come up in the context of domestic proceedings before the Equality Tribunal if a question arises regarding the interpretation of the EU race directive.  If it happens in the context of a case that is based on a race ground, there is no question that directive will apply but if it happens in a case of somebody claiming discrimination on the Traveller ground, it is far from clear whether the directive applies, and that merely creates an anomalous situation for Travellers.</p></speech>

Is there a legal reason or are there other implications?  Why is the State not going along with the recommendation of the Irish Human Rights Commission?  I think that is the gist of Deputy Mac Lochlainn's question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.981" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013111300007#F00300"><p>I will clarify.  I appreciate every state has its own laws and framework, but the English, Welsh and Scottish law clearly recognises, following a court decision, that the Irish Traveller community is an ethnic community within that jurisdiction.  They have made a legal judgment and it has been published.  Would Ms Lucey see that as also applying to Ireland, if we looked at it in the same way?  Are there legal implications for the State that it is not fulfilling its international obligations?</p><p>  I have looked through the judgment but I have not had a chance in the past 24 hours to go back over it in advance of the meeting today.  One presumes the judge or judges who made that decision were mindful of the international obligations of England, Scotland and Wales as jurisdictions and that they made the decision based on the evidence presented to them.  Is the Government exposing us to legal consequences because of its ongoing denial of ethnicity?  This position of the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority is not new.  They have had this position for a number of years.  They have given detailed evidence-based submissions and the denial is ongoing.  Could there be legal implications for the State, such as challenges, because of this?</p></speech>

There are quite different consequences, depending on the context.  The legal implications at an international level are being played out in the sense that we are being increasingly criticised by expert international bodies for not taking the step of recognising Traveller ethnicity.  Those observations are on the record and they do not do the State credit at this stage.</p><p>  At a domestic level, it depends on the type of case that arises and the exposure.  Ethnicity has arisen in the context of domestic proceedings, and while in general they have not gone to a full court hearing, there are certainly implications for the State.  It would be difficult to imagine a situation where the United Kingdom precedent would not be followed in Ireland.  The same evidence would be adduced before the court, and the same experts and the same arguments.  It would be almost impossible for the State to defend its position in that regard, and undesirable to be doing so as well.</p></speech>

That goes against the principle of self-identification.  It is internationally recognised.  That is dealt with.</p><p>  Perhaps Ms Lucey would elaborate on this matter she touched on in her earlier comments and in her response initially to my first question.  In terms of the international human rights treaties, what are the implications for the Traveller community of ethnicity denial and what protections under those treaties are being denied that would change if ethnicity were granted?  That is my final question.</p></speech>

Traveller organisations and Traveller representatives have set out some of the implications they perceive and it is difficult to expand further than that.  It is the fact that the State is patently in breach of its international obligations.  It is the way that, first, Traveller ethnicity has become something of a distraction and these committees are taken up with considering issues around ethnicity that should not arise when they should be focusing on the issues Travellers experience.</p><p>  Second, many of the recommendations of the committees tend to be linked to the ethnicity question and if the State continues to deny ethnicity, there is no need for the State to consider issues around nomadism.  There are implications beyond that.</p></speech>

Many of us hold a strong view on this issue of ethnicity, and Deputy Mac Lochlainn's questions go to the heart of the ongoing impact of denial of ethnicity.</p><p>  I am interested in focusing on an aspect of the presentation about the process of recognition.  If the committee is to recommend recognition of ethnicity, how does the Government go about implementing that?  I note the suggestion that it may not require legislation.  Perhaps I, as a lawyer, have been prejudiced and assumed legislation would be required, but I note the witnesses point out, rightly, that a statement of recognition could be made in the D&aacute;il and Seanad and the State, at an international level, could affirm ethnicity without necessitating legislation, although the witnesses state it would be useful.  Could Ms Lucey elaborate on that?  Would it be enough to make that sort of statement and to take that position as a State without explicitly setting it out in statutory format?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.990" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sin&eacute;ad Lucey" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013111300007#F01200"><p>From the point of view of the international community and the international bodies, what they want to receive from the State are reports stating it accepts Travellers are an ethnic minority, these are the issues that arise and these are how we are addressing them.  They will not be overly concerned about whether we have that in legislation unless there is a specific implication where Travellers are not able to access the range of protections against discrimination available to any other ethnic group.  It is only if it had a practical implication that they would become particularly concerned.  If it does not, I am sure they would be satisfied with a statement that cannot later be resiled from.  If it were on the record of the D&aacute;il, it would difficult for the State or the Government, having stated that in the D&aacute;il, to argue in any other context on a legal point that Travellers are not an ethnic group.  A statement in the D&aacute;il would be a positive first step.</p><p>  It is interesting that the international bodies have spoken less about recognising Travellers as an ethnic group and more about taking steps to recognise or moving in a concrete way towards recognition.  I would interpret that as meaning a series of engagements with the Traveller community to identify and discuss the issues in a meaningful way.  It would involve asking how have we not recognised Traveller ethnicity and what elements of our law and policy do not validate Traveller culture and way of life.</p> <p>It is also a matter of asking how we do not support Travellers in education and whether we do not recognise Traveller history in education.  We must ask whether there are barriers to nomadism or certain laws that are inimical to nomadism that have suppressed the practice of travelling?  The first step is a formal one that might include making a formal statement.  It could be legislation but it could be just a statement in the D&aacute;il.  A process must flow from that.  It should not be a case of making a statement of recognition and doing nothing further.  There should be a meaningful process thereafter.</p></speech>

As Ms Lucey said, Traveller status is recognised in anti-discrimination and equality legislation, including unfair dismissal law.  Seeking a statement could be desirable at first, and then one could engage in a process of examining other forms of discrimination.  This seems easier than beginning with legislation.</p></speech>

In this regard, I defer to the others present.  The statement of the Taoiseach on the Magdalen laundries is noteworthy.  This is an emotional matter associated with esteem and such issues.  The symbolic effect of a statement would be very powerful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.994" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Laurence Bond" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013111300008#G00400"><p>I wish to add to that  It is undoubtedly the case that Ireland, in its presentations to international human rights bodies, accepts and recognises characteristics of the Traveller community, such as its history, different cultural identity and its experience of discrimination, that in themselves are sufficient criteria for recognition as an ethnic group.  One of the difficulties associated with this issue and which probably causes some confusion internationally is our position that although we acknowledge and affirm in our reports all the characteristics that are taken in jurisprudence and anthropology as the characteristics that define a group as an ethnic group, and although we affirm these characteristics' importance and significance in determining how one thinks about policy on Travellers, we do not recognise Travellers as an ethnic group.  It causes significant confusion simply because it begs the questions as to what exactly is required and what missing criteria are not being fulfilled.</p><p>  A factor we addressed in our report was the suggestion that there is some academic reason for failing to grant recognition.  We found this did not hold.  A further issue that may have arisen is the idea that there must be universal consensus.  This does not hold either.  I have come across a suggestion that it is not so much an issue of principle but that there is a risk of significant costs.  I cannot see where they come from.</p><p>  In many ways, we have acknowledged Traveller ethnicity.  With regard to the specific provision in the equal status legislation, there was a specific discussion on adopting a form of description or definition of the Traveller community that recognised its ethnicity.  Having done so, we have done much of what is required.  The Government has affirmed that.  It seems to be counter-productive to achieve all this while holding back on actual recognition, especially with regard to respect and recognition of a people for who they are.  With that in mind, it is undoubtedly the case that the approach suggested by my colleague, that is, to have clear political recognition at Government level in the first instance followed by reporting to international bodies, is a clear first step.  The issue then arises in practice as to whether something further is required whereby particular issues may be identified.  One would have the option at that stage of examining the potential for amendments to our equality legislation or other legislation.  If one were to have political recognition and carry this over to the reporting to international bodies, it could be that one would have done most of what needs to be done.  One could then deal with whatever additional formal recognition is required as particular issues are identified.</p></speech>

I am learning a lot.  We have debated this issue before.  I recognise the presence in the Public Gallery of some witnesses who were present on the previous day.  I compliment Deputy Mac Lochlainn on the work he is doing in this area.  We spoke on the last day about Traveller history, education, music and culture.  We spoke about a potential visit to educate us on the tradition, culture and richness that exists.  Deputy Naughten is going to work on this for us at some stage in the near future.</p><p>  Ms Lucey's document refers to objective criteria and self-identification.  It also refers to shared history, culture, way of life, the practice of nomadism, etc.  I apologise if I am being a little crude but I seek clarification.  Are we talking about what is almost a box-ticking exercise?  Many Traveller families are not travelling anymore and do not practice nomadism.  If they do not, does that mean they are not part of an ethnic group, for instance?  Have we a set of criteria that must be fulfilled before somebody is recognised as part of an ethnic group?  Could one be half in and half out?  I apologise if I am being extremely crude.  How does one know whether one is part of an ethnic group, including the one in question?  Perhaps Ms Lucey could tease that out for us.</p></speech>

The main point of our submission was to argue that they are different.  With regard to ethnicity, it was stated at a meeting of this committee in the past that various legal tests have been set down in UK case law, most famously in the case Mandla <i>v</i>. Dowell-Lee.  It establishes the legal test that has been set out in terms of the criteria.  Certain criteria are essential and others are optional.  Irish Travellers have been found to fulfil the necessary criteria and also certain of the optional criteria.  In strict legal terms, it is an objective test as to whether an ethnic minority exists in the state.</p><p>  Self-identification, as the commission understands it, is in essence a protection that has been put in place for ethnic minorities for reasons related to historical events in which ethnic minorities were targeted in a particular way.  There are examples in the Irish context where Travellers were segregated in services.  This was because the principle of self-identification was not properly applied to them.  It would allow them to say they are not subscribing to a particular service in a particular way just because they are Travellers.  They could say they do not have to identify in a particular way to gain access to the service available to the community in general.</p><p>  It is probably more appropriate for Traveller organisations to address the question as to whether somebody is half in or half out.  There have been discussions on Travellers who may conceal their identity in certain contexts for reasons associated with negativity and the perception of Travellers in society, but I do not believe I could elaborate on it much more than the Traveller representatives have done.</p></speech>

In terms of the practical implications, I would see the starting point as recognising people for who they are and affirming that.  A key starting point in the history of public policy thinking about Travellers was in the 1960s when the Commission on Itinerancy published its report, 50 years ago this year.  This was the first time the State had tried to collectively reflect on the position of Travellers in Irish society.  I quoted some of that in our main report and it is well known that there was a specific suggestion that it was essential not to recognise Travellers for who they were.  The report said it would call them itinerants even though they refer to themselves as Travellers and want to be referred to as Travellers.  That was partly related to saying it was important not to recognise Travellers but rather to insist that they be absorbed into the general community and become like us.</p><p>  The core message of that report was that Travellers are a problem, and that problem is solved by absorbing them into the community.  The whole argument about recognition of ethnicity is fundamentally related to that.  This debate has been going on since the 1970s.  Not long after that report was published, many Travellers were saying this is not just about absorption into the community.  They said Travellers have a history, culture and identity and recognising who they are is core to treating them equally and on a basis of mutual respect between Travellers and the settled community.  Public policy has moved a certain way along that road but, clearly, has found it difficult to take the final step in terms of that recognition.</p><p>  One can think of many parallels.  The current argument about access to marriage for gay people is partly about saying one recognises people as not different or a lesser but as of equal value.  One recognises that by recognising people for who they are, not insisting they be like oneself.  That is our fundamental starting point for the significance of recognition of ethnicity.  If one takes that as factor at a symbolic and personal level, it clearly has implications for public policy.  If one is to take that seriously and apply it to issues such as development of housing and education policy, one thinks about what this means for how one teaches about Traveller children, teachers Traveller children, how Travellers are engaged in the classroom, etc.  We do a lot about Traveller education and housing, but it is about doing them better by taking this into account.</p></speech>

Copies of the order in draft were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 30 October and referred to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann on that date.  Members have received briefing material prepared by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.

The convention sets down the rules for the operation of international air transport and established the International Civil Aviation Organization, the UN body that oversees the operation of international air transport.  There are a number of technical annexes to the convention which set out standards and recommended practices that all signatory states must implement.</p><p>  Earlier this year the International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO, consolidated many of the existing aviation safety rules set down in the technical annexes to the Chicago Convention in one new Annex 19 &ndash; Safety Management.  Under national law, the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, has been assigned responsibility for implementing most of the Chicago Convention annexes in Ireland.  These responsibilities include all aspects of aviation safety, including, for example, ensuring all aircraft on the Irish aircraft register are airworthy and that air transport operations are carried out safely by operators.  It is intended that statutory responsibility for the implementation of Annex 19 will also be assigned to the IAA and that is the purpose of the draft order.  The assignment of Annex 19 to the IAA will not result in the creation of additional responsibilities on the authority.  As mentioned previously, the IAA has responsibility for the majority of the annexes from which the Annex 19 standards and recommended practices, SARPs, are drawn.</p> <p> Section 58(2) of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993 requires that any additional functions conferred on the Irish Aviation Authority be done by way of ministerial order.  Under section 5(7) of the 1993 Act, before the Minister can make such an order, a draft of the order must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving the draft must be passed by both Houses.  The draft order was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 30 October last and Annex 19 will become applicable on 14 November 2013.  In accordance with these legislative procedures, I hereby present the draft order to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.</p></speech>

While I accept it is purely technical, I will make a couple of comments that do not necessarily reflect on the Minister of State.  They are directed towards the Department.</p><p>  I welcome that the joint committee is discussing this issue.  While it is technical in nature, if the Government is to be realistic about the process of reform, where possible, it would be helpful if draft orders such as this one could be published sooner.  I note the discussions on this issue have been ongoing for some time.  It is largely a tidying-up exercise.  My party does not have a major problem with it but I would prefer if it could be published sooner.</p><p>  I note the order was laid before the House last week.  That is fine.  It should be laid before the House sooner than it needs to be signed.  We are at 13 November and it needs to be signed tomorrow.  I assume there will be something about it on the Order of Business in the D&aacute;il today, following on from here.  That is grand, but it is a little rushed.  In this instance, it does not matter because it is technical.  If it were a matter that provided for Members of the Oireachtas to have an opportunity to have their say, whether it be critical or supportive, it would not be available to us.</p><p>  This is as a word of caution or a request to the Government to try to facilitate Parliament a little better in dealing with such statutory instruments.  For far too long, successive Governments signed statutory instruments on the nod and we have seen problems arise in some cases.  That would be my only concern, that we would try to have a process that meant we were not dealing with it at the 11th hour.  Other than that, we will support the Government on it.</p></speech>

We will now deal with item No. 9, engagement with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  Representatives of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland are with us this morning to discuss the authority's recommendations on the future funding of public service broadcasting, published last July, and the report of May 2013, prepared by Crowe Howarth, entitled Review of Funding for Public Service Broadcasters.

The review of the funding of public broadcasters is one of the very significant responsibilities that is placed upon the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, under the 2009 legislation.  What is intended to be a five-yearly review hereafter was undertaken for the first time on this occasion.  It was, therefore, the first substantive opportunity the authority had to review, in full detail, the issues that had arisen in terms of determining what is the appropriate and adequate level of funding for public broadcasters.  To that end, we engaged external consultants, Crowe Howarth, to review the position, take account of relevant European practice, take account of the views of the Irish audience in terms of research, and review, in detail, the five-year submissions made by both by RTE and by TG4.</p><p>  We took the view that in considering the adequacy of funding and future funding for the two public broadcasters, it was not sufficient simply to consider those on their own and that we had to take into account the wider broadcasting environment, the role of the independent production sector and, clearly in a sense as an underlining starting point, the needs, expectations and entitlements of the Irish audience.  That is the reason in our view there is a regulatory framework to ensure that broadcasting serves the needs of an audience as well as ensuring that all of the other regulatory elements are discharged and there is compliance with domestic and European law.</p> <p>We were very conscious of a number of things.  The first is that we live in a time of significant economic difficulty from which broadcasters have not been immune.  Even if there had been no economic downturn, we live in a time of extraordinary challenge for broadcasting.  There is major change in terms of technology and how people consume content.  The range of channels available to Irish audiences is greater than ever and the rate of growth has been dramatic in recent years.  The transition from analogue to digital underlines and reinforces that reality.  Patterns of consumption are changing.  It is true that television channels as we know them are still very robust in terms of the extent to which they are the way through which people get access to their content, but we cannot be complacent because very significant change is taking place.</p><p> We are conscious of the fact that there is a growing imbalance between the range of domestic content and the range of international content available to an Irish audience.  This is significant for a variety of reasons.  It has very significant public policy implications but it has always been explicitly and implicitly the intention of Irish broadcasting legislation for more than 50 years that Irish content for an Irish audience is a key part of the role of public broadcasting.  We also recognise the fact that all broadcasting serves a public and social purpose.  Broadcasting has a crucial role to play in the democratic life of this country in terms of providing information to citizens on which they can make the kind of decisions that are central to the life of this State.  Broadcasting also has a crucial social and community role to play in terms of giving people a real sense of the realities of the communities in which they live.  Thus, we felt that not only was it important to look at the contributions RTE and TG4 make in terms of Irish content, it was important to recognise the contribution that other broadcasters like TV3 make.  TV3 has been consistently increasing the range of its Irish content while the same is true of Setanta in terms of its sports provision.  The comprehensive array of national, regional, local and community radio stations all contribute substantially.</p><p> Having reviewed the detail of the work undertaken by Crowe Horwath and the submissions made by the two broadcasters, we took a number of views and made a number of decisions which formed the recommendations we submitted to the Minister, as the law obliges us to do.  I will mention a number of those key recommendations.  The first is that we did not believe there should any reduction in the level of public funding to either RTE or TG4.  The second was that we believed there should be an increase in public funding for RTE.  In this, we disagreed with the recommendation of the external consultants.  We took that view because we believed the base case, which was the main proposal put forward by RTE in its five-year plan, was not sufficient in terms of the range of service that would be made available to an audience in Ireland at this time of such intense competition.  I think RTE would also share the view that this was not the limit of its aspiration.</p><p> That recommendation for an increase was conditional on a number of things.  First, there needs to be a detailed examination of the extent to which further cost reductions are possible for RTE.  A number of reports have indicated that notwithstanding the extent of reductions that have already taken place in RTE's cost base, some further reductions are possible.  We want that to be tested because there is no point in attempting to do the impossible and we want to ensure the responsibility that devolves to everybody to look carefully at the way in which public funding is expended is done in a context that makes realistic demands on a public broadcaster that is in receipt of significant public money.  Second, we wanted to ensure that within the limits of the commercial possibilities available to it, RTE realises the full potential of that capacity.  Third, we wanted to ensure there was an examination of the relationship between the making of in-house productions in RTE and the making of comparable productions by independent producers - not to convert RTE into a publisher-broadcaster but to ensure we have a serious and real basis for determining whether there is full value for the public money being expended.</p><p> Our recommendation was that at some point above the current level of its public funding, the Minister should determine a point at which any further increases in public funding for RTE would be matched by a reduction in its commercial revenue - to be achieved by restrictions on either its advertising minutage or sponsorship or a combination of both.  This would ensure greater opportunity for all commercial broadcasters to get a larger percentage of the commercial revenue spent on broadcasting in Ireland in order that they can enhance the domestic content of their schedules.  In respect of advertising minutage, we make a crucial recommendation from the perspective of commercial radio broadcasters.  We argued that the current arrangement whereby three separate regimes operate to determine permitted advertising - the Minister determines it for public broadcasters and the authority determines it for commercial television broadcasters but the statute prescribes it for commercial radio broadcasters - makes no sense.  It also results in potential and, we believe, real unfairness.  Without prejudging any decision that might fall to be made, we are looking at the possibility that all radio broadcasters should have the same scale of advertising minutage as is available to commercial television broadcasters.  We recommended that there be an urgent amendment to the legislation to centralise those decisions relating to advertising minutage in the authority.</p><p> Our final recommendation related to TG4.  We appreciate that it would be wrong to have any reduction but we wanted to see a greater examination of the way in which the current revenues are deployed as well as an examination of what might be achieved for less or far less of the increase that TG4 was seeking in its public funding.  I think that covers the main points by way of introduction.  We are happy to respond to any questions members have.</p></speech>

I wish to ask a few questions before I hand over to members.  In light of the news last week that UTV is applying for a licence to establish a television station in this jurisdiction, I would be interested in hearing Mr. Collins's comments on what is agreed is a very small market.  What is his interpretation of the possible effect on RTE and TV3?  Is there room for all three at a time when, as he says himself, the piece of cake is getting smaller in respect of the economy?</p> <p>In regard to public service broadcasting, we have brought the independent broadcasters before us on several occasions.  I find it hard to resolve the question of how public service broadcasting should be defined.  They maintain there is no recognition of the public service contribution of the local news, current affairs and sports they provide to their local audiences.  In 2013, RTE 2fm received funding of &euro;11.6 million for what seems to be very limited public service content.  The analysis by Crowe Howarth indicates that additional funding will be made available from the new broadcasting charge on top of the revenue from licences.  The BAI rejected Crowe Howarth's suggestion that the additional revenue should not go to RTE.  It is strange that the BAI would not agree with the recommendations set out in the independent report it commissioned.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.1026" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bob Collins" time="09:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013111300006#H00200"><p>I will take the questions in the order that the Chairman asked them.  One of the points I could have made in my opening remarks, except that I wanted to keep them as brief as possible, was that we need to ensure broadcasters are fully present in a  digital environment and that they are where their audiences access content.  We recognise the need for continuing investment by RTE in its digital presence so that it is always ahead of the audience and is available wherever its audience chooses to receive content.</p><p>  That is relevant to the discussion on UTV.  With the development of DTT, greater capacity exists for additional channels.  There were hopes and expectations that commercial digital terrestrial television might emerge with additional channels, all of which suggested that small as this market may be - if one considers it as a market - none the less by international comparisons it has relatively few domestic broadcasters.  The emergence of UTV is an important development.  It already has a strong presence in local radio and it has an established and long-term position in Northern Ireland.  Its plans to develop a new channel in this State to carry new domestic content will be a source of additional choice for audiences.  It will inevitably increase the level of competition for existing broadcasters and will probably have a greater impact on TV3 than on RTE because the ITV programming it will carry forms an important element of TV3's schedule.</p><p>  The entry of UTV highlights anomalies in the legislation, about which we have spoken previously, in that UTV will apply for a licence under a section of the broadcasting legislation that imposes far fewer obligations than are imposed on TV3, RTE or TG4.  It will not be obliged to pay the levy which funds the activities of the BAI even though RTE, TG4, TV3 and all the radio broadcasters contribute levies.  That is anomalous and, on the face of it, unfair but it is what the law provides.  Its entry will undoubtedly have some impact but it will probably also offer advantages to the audience in terms of additional choice and content made in Ireland if what it identifies as its plan comes to fruition and if the case it will make to the BAI for a licence is sustainable.</p><p>  The question of how to define public service broadcasting is as old as broadcasting itself.  The BAI and, I think, everybody else involved in broadcasting recognises that everybody who is engaged in broadcasting contributes to the public service and the public.  The services provided by local radio stations and the news and current affairs programmes broadcast by TV3 and all the radio stations undoubtedly add to the sources of information available to Irish audiences.  However, the law clearly defines public service broadcasting in terms of RTE and TG4.  The law provides that apart from the 7% going to the sound and vision fund which we administer and which is open in the main to independent producers and broadcasters, the funding raised from licence fees goes to RTE and TG4.  Our statutory review process did not give us the possibility of altering that fundamental statutory basis, which has been part of Ireland's infrastructure for the past 53 years.  We recognise that every broadcaster has been under pressure because of the economic difficulties of the last several years and we have on a number of occasions put on record our appreciation of the extent to which they have attempted to sustain schedules as vigorously as possible within their constraints.  Some of the newer radio stations are encountering more turbulent waters than others but the broadly based local radio stations are generally doing well.  In their applications for new licences and licence extensions, the processing of which is currently ongoing, there is a significant degree of confidence in they way they are approaching the future.</p><p>  The question of RTE 2fm needs to be raised with RTE because a clear distinction needs to be made between the way in which formal accounting is done for the allocation of licence funding and the actual costs and revenues of 2fm.  It does not appear to make sense to have a significant licence fee attribution for the operational running costs of 2fm.  The formal accounting for the deployment of the licence fee by RTE across its services is a different issue and it may not reveal the reality of the costs of 2fm.  That is an issue that would be more appropriately explored in detail with RTE.</p><p>  Crowe Howarth constructed its view on the base case, as RTE described it in its plans for the next five years.  That base case was essentially the range of services currently provided.  Crowe Howarth felt it could not interpose itself between RTE or TG4 and what it would like to see as the range of services available to an Irish audience.  RTE clearly stated that it would like to do other things and it outlined them in general terms in a part of its five year plan.</p> <p>That was insufficiently detailed to give us a clear view of what exactly would be in the schedule for the additional revenues that were returned.  We would have failed in our responsibility had we taken the Crowe Howarth report, put it in an envelope and passed it to the Minister because we have a statutory obligation to take account of the detail in that report and reach our own conclusions on what we think is appropriate.</p><p> Given the intensity of the competition and the extent to which external television programmes dominate the environment, we took the view that the interests of the Irish audience, broadcasting and democracy require that there be a stronger level of domestic content than is available in Ireland from the public or commercial television broadcasters.  For that reason we identified the need, subject to certain stringent conditions, for additional funding to be made available to RTE and for a rebalancing of the overall broadcasting funding to enable commercial broadcasters to have access to a greater level of commercial funding to improve everybody's capacity to produce more Irish-made content.  In the case of RTE, we specifically said the content produced should clearly be of a public service character and distinctively different from what commercial broadcasters would be expected to produce.</p></speech>

This is a fundamental issue.  When one examines and tries to define public service broadcasting and when one examines the differences between RTE and the independent radio stations and broadcasters, one finds they are all providing a service in current affairs or sport, some better than others.  Funding is a major issue.  Over 90% of the licence fee goes to RTE and it has 50% of the commercial revenue, yet it has a funding issue.  Independent broadcasters such as local radio stations and independent television companies survive solely on the commercial market.  One scratches one's head and asks why we have to subsidise to this level.  We constantly have the same argument.  With all due respect, it is almost as if we must preserve the <i>status quo</i> of RTE at all costs.</p><p>  The funding is to be changed and that legislation will be published shortly.  There must be a fundamental look at the value for money.  We have all seen, in various reports that have come before this committee and elsewhere, information about the cutbacks in the State broadcaster.  Are the witnesses satisfied that further efficiencies can be achieved in that organisation before they decide on the level of funding?  Will State funding or the licence fee, in whatever form it is collected, be kept to RTE and the minutes it can offer for commercial revenue reduced?  Independent broadcasters are under serious pressure and provide as good a public broadcasting service, and perhaps better regarding some aspects of society.  Would it be better to dispense the licence fee or transmission charge properly to ensure these independent stations have a future?</p><p>  It is very difficult in the commercial market.  Everything seems to be stacked in favour of the State broadcaster, which seems to be running huge deficits.  The independent operators are running on shoestrings but are still making do.  What is the difference?  The witnesses will refer to the legislation, but in layman's terms they are all providing an excellent public broadcasting service irrespective of whether they are State-owned.</p></speech>

We recognise they have had five or six years when business has been very tough.  When we talk about the rebalancing, we are proposing that the licence fee funding would go to the public broadcasters but that we would rebalance the situation such that there is greater potential for the commercial sector to get more money from the commercial sector, which would pay for the programming.</p><p>  We are not distinguishing between the programming they do.  We recognise the programming is public service broadcasting.  The issue is how that is funded.  Now it is funded through commercial revenue.  There are some restrictions on the commercial revenue and we have engaged with the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, IBI, on matters such as the sponsorship and minutage regulations which the Chairman mentioned.  There are restrictions on the amount of minutage for commercial radio but not for commercial television.  We will look to do something about that.  There are restrictions on the sponsorship and promotions area and the radio sector has asked us to examine that.  We have engaged with the radio sector and done that.  There is a balance between funding of the commercial sector through commercial activities and the public broadcaster through that combination.  RTE 2fm is permitted only five minutes of advertising per hour.  The commercial stations are permitted ten minutes of advertising per hour.  There are differences to reflect the fact that there are differences between the licence fee funding the public broadcasters get and the other funding the commercial sector gets.</p><p>  We recognise that, since 2008, it has been more challenging and commercial revenue has dropped dramatically.  That has had the greater impact on the newer, niche and youth music services, and we have recognised that and allowed them to make adjustments to their programming to reflect that.  The advertising revenue of the traditional broad-based local radio service has dropped.  It has probably stabilised this year and the applications they have made for the continuation of their licences, which process we are going through now, in general project the situation stabilising, with some growth over the next few years.  We are addressing the fact that the commercial marketplace for commercial radio has been tougher and there are things we can do, but we draw a distinction between that and the licence fee funding which should still go to the public service broadcasters, as it does now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.1033" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bob Collins" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013111300008#K00100"><p>We are unambiguous that the schedules of public broadcasters need to be different from the schedules of commercial broadcasters.  We make it clear that any additional funding that goes to RTE should only be in return for clear plans set out in detail in advance of what the money will be used for to ensure it will be of a distinctly public service character.  As Mr. O'Keeffe has said, we are the first to recognise what has been achieved by the local radio stations in particular and by commercial radio in general.  By the extent to which they engage with their communities they do things a national broadcaster simply cannot do because they can address local issues in the way that they do.  However, they are commercial broadcasters and that is the basis on which they initially sought their licences.</p><p>  We will be signing some new contracts today with broadcasters.  We have already signed new ten-year contracts with six or seven broadcasters.  It is clear from them that despite the difficulties, they are facing into their new contract periods with confidence in terms of their financial planning and with commitment in terms of what they hope to offer in their schedules.  The challenge for RTE in particular and for TG4 is that the distinctiveness of their schedules reflects the extent to which they are funded publicly.  Our view, which is not without some support, is that it is better to point a greater level of the available advertising revenue in the direction of the commercial stations and to limit RTE's access to commercial revenue as a share of its total income.</p></speech>

I am disappointed that the representatives of the BAI are persisting with the mantra of propping up RTE, which is basically what I hear.  In recognising the role of the commercial operators, Mr. Collins stated that they are doing fairly well because they manage their affairs fairly well and operate within budgetary constraints.  They do not have an insurance policy of knowing that the taxpayer can pony up an increase in the television licence fee when things start going pear shaped.  They also do not have the luxury of operating in an environment where their presenters are being paid multiples of what the Head of the Government is paid.  Recognition only goes so far.  Recognising the public service remit of independent broadcasters is not worth the paper it is written on unless it is backed up by some sort of financial consideration for the work they do.</p><p>  The witnesses rightly pointed to an anomalous situation with advertising at the moment.  I believe their proposal for fixing that would make a bad situation even worse.  It would result in everybody playing on the same advertising field, but the State broadcaster would have the continued insurance net regardless of the public service element of the commercial broadcasters.</p><p>  I contend that RTE is a commercial entity because it aggressively seeks advertising in the market.  RTE advertises its own advertising slots.  I do not accept that it is in some way different from the other broadcasters.  2FM is struggling to keep up with the listenership of commercial radio stations, but yet it receives a substantial subsidy from the taxpayer to keep it going.  The BAI should ask if continuing that represents value for money.  People in its target age cohort have voted by turning the dial considerably away from that radio station.</p></speech>

On the one hand we want to maintain having all the licence fee revenue going to RTE and also seek an increase in the fee.  The witnesses used the word "realistic".  When the country's economy has collapsed, how realistic is it to suggest that a State entity would receive an additional subsidy on top of what it is already getting even though it has a bloated element of expenditure and at the same time ignoring that others that are delivering commercial public service broadcasting on a daily basis are receiving no subsidy from the State?  I find that totally unacceptable.</p><p>  If the BAI's contribution to the debate on how we are to fund broadcasting in future is what I have heard so far, I would have serious concerns.  The BAI's role should be to be the overall authority for all broadcasters regardless of who owns them and to ensure that the content addresses what the public wants and needs.  It certainly should not be a safety valve or mudguard for the State broadcaster.  I find that very hard to take.</p></speech>

Under the law, we have an obligation to look at the funding of the public broadcasters.  That is what this task is.  That is why the focus is on the funding of the public broadcasters.  We are not here to prop up RTE.  RTE is perfectly capable of propping itself up and that is not our task.  We were looking at the extent to which RTE discharges its obligations based on the money it gets.  We looked at the extent to which its schedule adequately serves the Irish audience in the present and future environment.  We looked at what conditions would apply to any additional income.</p><p>  We did not propose an immediate increase in the licence fee; we specifically said there should not be.  We did not suggest that in this moment of economic difficulty additional funding should be given to RTE.  We specifically said that the level of service planned by RTE in its five-year plan is insufficient to meet the needs of an Irish audience.  RTE needs to look at every possible cost reduction available to it and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has initiated a review of what is possible in that respect.  If there are specific plans for additional programming which meet the needs of an Irish audience and which are public service in character, then we would support additional funding for RTE.</p><p>  At other times we focus on the needs of commercial radio stations and commercial broadcasters generally.  The issue of advertising is one where we believe it is unfair at the moment that minutage is available to commercial television stations that is not available to commercial broadcasters.  However, we cannot do anything about that because the law specifies what the provision is.  Whatever about everything else, we did not write the law.</p> <p>We also believe that there should be a mechanism to ensure that RTE has less commercial revenue in the future and that a smaller percentage of its funding comes from commercial sources in order that a greater level of commercial funding would be available to commercial broadcasters, whether on television and radio.  We did not write this document to prop up RTE.  We are statutorily obliged to support public service broadcasting.  Our statutory task here was to review the issue of the funding for RTE and TG4.</p></speech>

I always think of public service broadcasting in national, regional and local terms.  There are different levels and good public service broadcasting at national level is different from that at local level because they involve different levels of detail.  It is informative that Mr. Collins says the legislation directs BAI's support for RTE and TG4 because there may be a view within the Department that local radio stations are similar to local newspapers and they are independent and for profit but the difference is independent radio has a public service obligation that newspapers do not.  This needs to be examined but given oversight is legislatively based, it should be done by politicians rather than the BAI.</p><p>  The report states: "The station cannot do any more under its current operational model."  Does the authority have power to examine the operational models of RTE, TG4 and independent broadcasters with respect to public service broadcasting obligations?  For example, if RTE was to decide to set up a dedicated sports channel or children's channel, would the BAI have an input into, or power over, those choices?  What about the lower levels of the general operation model of these stations?</p><p>  I had not thought too much about the sound and vision fund until my local station, Ocean FM, the Glen Centre in Manorhamilton, Donal O'Kelly and many good people in the local community got together and produced a wonderful drama called "Francisco", which won a major European drama award.  It was a tremendous example of the potential of local radio and local people getting together to produce something of which we can all be proud.  We need to re-examine the criteria for this fund to encourage such local collaboration.  Perhaps the 7% limit on the fund should be increased.</p><p>  Other issues include the arrival of UTV in the Irish market and a ban on alcohol advertisement before a certain time at night.  Has the BAI factored in the impact that will have on advertising revenue for local and national broadcasters?</p><p>  DCTV is about to wind down its operations and will cease transmission next year.  Under the Broadcasting Act 2009, the authority is obliged to devise funding schemes to support the development of community broadcasting.  Has the authority fulfilled this obligation given the reduction in funding to DCTV and the announcement that it will cease transmission next year?</p></speech>

I was in Manorhamilton the day "Francisco" was launched with Donal O'Kelly and it was fantastic.  It is a great achievement to have won an international award.  We are trying to encourage stations through the fund to do more of that material.  Ocean FM has been a great supporter of the fund, as have many other local stations.  We are trying to encourage them to use it to increase the level of other programmes.  There is no question that they would not get to make programmes such as that if they did not have access to the fund and that is why it was established.  We are currently reviewing the scheme.  I met IBI representatives at their AGM last week and I encouraged them to participate in the review.  We are having a workshop in Croke Park on 2 December, which will discuss the next iteration of the scheme.  It is approved up to the end of next year and we will have a new scheme in place after that.  We are exploring how the commercial sector can utilise the scheme more and get more from it.  Many stations are putting effective programmes together and Ocean FM is a good example in this regard.  We want to see more of that and we will encourage the commercial radio sector to take a greater part.</p><p>  Radio gets approximately 15% of the fund, which is linked to the cost of producing radio versus the cost of producing television.  Of that, the commercial sector gets approximately 40%.  There is potential for the sector to access more of this funding.  The 7% limit is in statute.  It was 5% and it was increased to 7%.  This has provided opportunities for more programmes to be made.  We are not involved in changing the statute.  The view is that the level of the fee should not below where it currently stands but that is a matter for the Government to debate further.</p><p>  I am concerned that DCTV representatives came to us a few weeks before they made the announcement that they were to cease broadcasting to request that we allow them to continue projects we had funded under the sound and vision fund.  That would allow them to continue until February and we granted them permission to do so.  One of the challenges in funding a company such as DCTV is its funding model appeared to be very much based on securing money from the sound and vision fund and from other schemes.  There is a question mark over whether such a model is sustainable because the sound and vision fund is a competitive grant awards scheme and how one can base one's funding to such an extent on securing money from a scheme of that nature is challenging.  They have bought time until February to continue with the service.  Between now and then, we will explore with them whether there are ways to continue but they need to look at their funding model because one cannot rely on one scheme to be the mainstay of a funding model.  There may be potential for that in the future because DCTV has done good work and has broadcast good programmes.  We would regret it if they were not with us in the future.</p></speech>

We cannot determine what their schedules are or how they operate on a day-to-day basis.  They set their own objectives and our task is to evaluate the extent to which they have met those commitments.  We do not set the commitments for them.  Irish law is different from the law in other European countries where there can be more prescriptive regulatory provisions in that respect.</p> <p>That is not the case here.  While RTE or TG4 do not need to seek the approval of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland <i>per se</i>if they wish to develop a new service, they need to give the authority an opportunity to indicate its view.  Depending on the circumstances, the authority may undertake a public interest test regarding the proposed service and report its findings and recommendations to the Minister, who makes the decision in the last analysis.</p><p> Mr. O'Keeffe has responded to the point the Deputy made about local radio stations.  I think the sound and vision fund has produced some excellent programmes.  I strongly share the view that local radio stations could take more of that fund if they approached it more creatively and with greater regularity.  While I am happy to see there has been some increase in their engagement, I think there is unrealised potential in the sound and vision fund.  It is worth &euro;14 million per annum, which is not a small amount of money.  The local radio stations are independent and commercial.  In the past, many of them have been traded for very significant sums of money.  Many of them are still carrying the burden of those transactions on their balance sheets and their income and expenditure accounts.  This is having a negative impact on them.  In general, the local radio stations are profitable.  They are not indicating in their applications for new licences that they will cease to be profitable.  They have a special position.  It is worth noting, in the context of the parallel with local newspapers that was drawn by the Deputy, that nobody else can set up a local radio station in their own area.  We are strongly supportive of local radio stations and their role.  As a regulatory body, however, we must be at a distance from everybody.  We cannot act as cheerleaders for anybody.  We take a detached and even-handed view.  Our primary responsibility is to ensure the law is fulfilled and the needs of the audience are met.  We absolutely share the view expressed by the Deputy about the potential of local radio stations and their capacity to work with others and on their own to create programme content.</p></speech>

They mentioned that there are three levels of scrutiny or oversight.  The authority is responsible for commercial television.  The Minister is responsible for TG4 and RTE.  The commercial and local radio stations are governed by statute.  Can I take it from what Mr. Collins has said that the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's view is that this is not sufficient?  Would it like the current position to be changed by means of legislation?  How would it wish these matters to operate?  Would it like to have a greater involvement in the area of RTE and TG4?</p><p>  The fundamental recommendation made by the authority would involve a gradual increase in the public contribution to RTE, with conditions.  If that recommendation is to be accepted, this committee will have to think about where the money might come from.  I accept that the authority does not have a role in determining that.  Nobody has mentioned the resource opportunities that have been presented to the State on foot of the change from analogue to digital television.  It might be cynical to suggest the possibility that the authority is staking out a claim on those resources, to be allocated back into a television station.  I could be completely offside on this one.  Does Mr. Collins have a view on the matter?</p><p>  Mr. Collins mentioned that no increase would be appropriate for TG4 and, equally, there is no scope for reducing costs at the station.  Is it being suggested, as a corollary of that, that there is further scope for cost reductions in RTE?  I would like to hear Mr. Collins's view on that.</p><p>  I note in the authority's report that legislation is coming forward.  We look forward to seeing that.  A fundamental economic assessment of the advertising market is also being proposed.  That will be a very significant body of work.  I understand the authority assisted in the tender process that was done in advance of the economic assessment.  What level of work was carried out by the authority to assist in the tender process?  Did the authority's document lead to the tender?  Was it the authority's tender?</p></speech>

It does not make sense that three separate agencies are responsible for the minutage for the three separate sectors.  We believe a single agency should be responsible for that and we suggest the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland would be the most appropriate agency.  We recognise that the Minister might want to reserve the right of approval in the cases of RTE and TG4, in line with the statutory position that has prevailed since 1960.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.1058" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bob Collins" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013111300010#M00500"><p>That is not the case in relation to the advertising minutage.  It makes no sense that three separate agencies are involved.  It makes no sense that the limit on the advertising minutage for commercial radio stations is set in statute and primary legislation is required to amend it.  With the greatest respect to the Oireachtas that passed the legislation in question, it makes no sense.  An anomaly in the respective positions of Irish-based stations and stations coming in from abroad meant we were able to change the permitted minutage for commercial television.  Stations from abroad are allowed far more advertising minutage than local Irish-based stations.  I refer to stations like TV3 and Setanta.  We believe there is an argument to be made for additional minutage to be available to the commercial radio stations.  At the moment, there is nothing we or anybody else can do about it unless primary legislation is introduced.  That is why we have recommended that the legislation be amended urgently.  We think this provision should be taken from the face of the Act.  Frankly, the question of who does it is a less important consideration.  As we do it for the commercial television stations, we think it makes sense that we would do it for the commercial radio stations and that we would have a view on it in the cases of RTE and TG4.</p><p>  Our primary focus is on the rebalancing of RTE's funding between public and commercial funding.  That was the major element in our recommendation.  We think there is a need to progressively reduce RTE's dependence on commercial funding.  The ratio between public and commercial funding needs to be altered.  That was the key and, if I may say so, the most radical element of the proposal we made regarding the long-term funding of broadcasting.  I do not see it happening immediately - that was never the plan - but it has radical implications and possibilities.</p><p>  The Deputy also referred to digital television.  There is no question of the resources arising from the sale of spectrum going back into the broadcasting sector.  The money from the very successful disposal of the spectrum that was liberated by the transfer from analogue to digital has already gone into the Exchequer.</p><p>  The Deputy also asked about TG4's costs.  TG4 and RTE operate quite differently.  TG4 makes a very small amount of its own programming.  It gets its news from RTE.  The rest of its programming is produced by independent producers.  It has a small-scale operation.  The potential for reducing costs would make no material difference to the overall cost of TG4.</p> <p> RTE is a large-scale operation and makes a significant amount of its own content, including virtually all of its own radio content.  It has a symphony orchestra and a concert orchestra and a legacy in terms of its buildings, location, etc.  It is in this context that we felt there was a need for a definite, independent, external review of the extent to which RTE could reduce its costs further.  This may not be the most productive time to consider the disposal of land, as was in RTE's consideration some time ago, but that work is being done by NewERA.</p><p> The review of the advertising market, which chimes exactly with our point about considering the implications if our rebalancing proposal was put into effect, is being done by the Department.  We engaged with it on the tender process.  It was not our tender document.  Rather, the Department undertook this work independently, making an important contribution to the decision making as regards the rebalancing.</p></speech>

Like other members, I was a bit perplexed by the outline they supplied of their role and remit.  I understand that it is constrained by legislation to some extent.  In the previous D&aacute;il, even before the BAI was set up, our communications committee spent a long time arguing and debating issues about top earners and the many thousands of excellent staff at RTE who work hard on a daily basis.  We were told that the payments made to top people were down to the advertising they brought in, but that situation has changed.  Is there a justification for the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, IBI's suggestion that the funding model as proposed is effectively a Montrose tax aimed at propping up RTE?  The BAI must answer questions like this.  It is the regulator, or the watchdog for want of a better word.</p><p>  To my mind, it was quite muddled in the BAI's outline, but what did our guests mean by the term "public service objectives"?  What types of programme constitute public service content?</p><p>  I will not go on because a lot has been asked already, but I have many concerns.  One that I have had for a long time relates to a main evening radio programme.  I love RTE Radio 1.  It does a good job in the main.  The programme is sponsored by Danske Bank.  That is totally wrong because many people have banking issues.  I have raised them on behalf of people.  One cannot have an open or honest debate when the banks are sponsoring the programme.  That bank is now exiting the country and I hope that the programme will not go with it, or the presenter.  It was a terribly wrong signal to those people who are struggling under this and other banks.</p><p>  There is much food for thought.  For generations, local media outlets - newspapers and now stations - have provided a huge public service.  RTE will lose out if there is not seen to be fairness and equity.  There are lots of issues for the BAI to address.  It appears to be just an extension of RTE in what our guests have said so far today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-13a.1064" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bob Collins" time="10:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013111300011#N00600"><p>I am not sure how many times we can say that we are not here on behalf of RTE.  The committee would need to discuss some of these issues with RTE.  We are attending as an independent statutory authority that is asked by the statute enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas to examine the public funding of RTE and TG4.  Addressing those stations is all that we can do when performing that task.  We are not their extension.  When we submitted our report on our section 53 investigation into "Prime Time Investigates" and appeared before this committee, no one in RTE or on this committee believed that we were an extension of RTE.  Let us get our positions clear in that regard.</p><p>  The issue of what people at RTE are paid is a matter primarily for RTE.  Like everyone else around the table, we are human beings and taxpayers.  We share some views and have our own on what is to be appropriate to be paid, particularly given the changed circumstances.  The characterisation, be it that of the IBI or anyone else, of the licence fee as a tax to prop up RTE makes it difficult to hold a constructive debate on the purpose of a licence fee.  Sometimes, I would like it if the BAI had the statutory authority to identify precisely what public broadcasters were expected to do in return for their public funding, for example, to have a clearer sense of the balance of content in public broadcasters' schedules and what are appropriate and inappropriate programme ranges, but that is not what the law permits us to do.  The law reserves that power to the boards of RTE and TG4, which it describes as being independent.  This matter could be debated, since we are out of kilter to a certain extent with some of the European experience of public broadcasting regulation.  With the greatest of respect, however, the legislation was enacted by Members collectively, not by us.</p><p>  I dislike the sponsorship of current affairs programmes.  It is inappropriate and raises some of the questions that Deputy McGrath identified, but it is not precluded by law at the moment.  There would also be serious implications for local radio stations if the sponsorship of current affairs programmes on radio were to be precluded.  If I may express a personal view, although I am not sure that it is only a personal one in terms of what approach the authority will take, the sponsorship of news is obviously precluded, but the sponsorship of current affairs poses difficulties for broadcasters.  When we developed our code of fairness and objectivity in news and current affairs, we were seeking to ensure that the audience had a clear indication of, for example, interests that a presenter might have by needing to declare those interests and, at certain times, standing back from involvement in a programme.  It complicates matters if that very same programme is being sponsored, but the law does not preclude it.  Does Mr. O'Keeffe wish to clarify?</p></speech>

If issues arise about how a programme is being influenced by its sponsor, they can be brought to the compliance committee and a broadcaster might be required to make adjustments or so on.  There is a mechanism to address conflicts of interest.  Generally speaking, however, stations behave themselves in terms of how they operate with sponsors.  Sponsors are important to them, but they recognise that sponsors must not have an input into the editorial elements of the programmes.  It is a balancing act and one can see where there may be potential difficulties, but we have fallen on the side of the broadcasters, as it is a source of income for them.</p></speech>

I welcome the BAI.  This has been an important and good debate.  We need to continue it, as it is in everyone's interests to have a sustainable, fit-for-purpose public broadcasting service.  The BAI has an important role to play in that regard.</p><p>  I will mention some of the challenges facing the television sector.  I do not know the BAI's opinions, but our guests mentioned satellite channels, including external channels, entering the country.</p> <p>The online challenge is growing rapidly.  Perhaps the witnesses would elaborate on the challenges presented for the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland by, for example, Netflix and Love TV, which have been quite successful in terms of eating into broadcasting time.  This is a growing trend.  </p><p> I want to put on record my acknowledgement of the significance of supporting Irish content within the public broadcasting service.  We are all aware of the good work being done by RTE and TG4 in terms of broadcasting issues of national interest, in particular TG4's coverage of our national sports and so on.  However, this does not give <i>carte blanche</i>for consistent support through the television licence.  Our licensing system supports a great number of ineffective broadcasting services.  </p><p> Mr. Collins referred to RTE's property portfolio and what the current organisation has inherited.  It has inherited a cumbersome costly organisation.  Deputy O'Donovan referred earlier to the contracts of some of the broadcasters within that service as compared to those employed in private or commercial stations.  Some of the commercial stations deliver as good, if not better, service.  There is a conflict in terms of what we have inherited.  There is no doubt but that RTE has been and continues to be a bloated organisation.  In response to this, services within the organisation that we need have been cut, there were a great deal of repeat programmes broadcast over the summer and much of late night broadcasting is imported material.  </p><p> On the radio side, RTE 2FM, which is aimed at the 15 to 24 year old category, has an audience of only 8%, which is very small.  A commercial station in the south east region, Beat 102-103, has an audience of 59% among the 15 to 24 year old category.  The percentage in this regard for Spin is 43% and for RedFM is 45%.  Are we subsidising something that is not sustainable in any event?  This is the type of question we need to ask.  Perhaps that is what the witnesses are trying to get at when they say they wish to support the RTE and TG4 subject to a review.  Am I correct that it is the intention of the authority to review areas that are not sustainable and in which savings can be achieved?</p></speech>

I was taken aback by some of what Mr. Collins had to say, in particular his belief that there is a particular confidence in the local radio sector based on their presentations to the authority.  What we are hearing from the independent broadcasters is that they are struggling to maintain their current level of service.  Mr. Collins stated that they are profitable, which in the main is true.  However, much of this might be to do with their being smaller commercial operations that can right-size more quickly.  I would argue that this is, in some instances, to the detriment of the audience.  As these stations are commercial they have to get their costs down as soon as their revenues decrease, which results in the listener losing out in terms of coverage of sporting events, rural pursuits and various other local activities that previously local stations would have endeavoured to cover.  To suggest that the solution to this is increased minutage is, in my view, not to recognise the commercial reality.  It is effectively spreading the same amount of money across a greater number of minutes.  The level of competition in the franchise area among various newspapers that are struggling, including some of the free sheets, is increasing because advertising is currently a stressed environment.  I do not believe that increased minutage is the solution.</p><p>  I acknowledge that given the authority's remit it is somewhat precluded from giving direction or its views on this issue.  In an environment where there is an expected increase in revenues - if I am correct an increase of &euro;30 million by way of changing from the licence fee to the broadcasting charge is expected - there exists the potential for an increased pool of money.  I contend that the BAI or the Department or whomever will ultimately make the decision needs to look at the role of the local commercial stations in terms of the provision of public service broadcasting and content.  I accept what has been said in relation to the availability of funding to these stations for specific projects.  However, rural communities depend on daily coverage of sporting and local events.  They see this as an important aspect of a public service offering.  From that point of view, I would argue that there needs to be a recognition in this area in terms of financial allocation. </p><p>  I was taken aback by the comment that a source of disappointment in the case of RTE is that its plan for 2013-2017 does not set out the clear sense of vision and ambition that might have been hoped for.  It was also stated that the authority did not accept Crowe Harworth's position that RTE did not require any more money to meet its demands.  Would it not have been better for either the authority or Department to have engaged with RTE to flesh out its vision to a greater extent before making a recommendation that it get more money?  Should the notion of the decision of it getting more money be based on a fleshing out of its vision?  I am not in this regard being critical of RTE and neither do I want to see a situation whereby an increase in funding to local stations would somehow disenfranchise RTE because I do not believe that would be helpful either.</p></speech>

I am glad the authority recognises the role of local radio.  I come from a rural part of Kilkenny-Carlow, the communities of which depend greatly on local radio.  In winter 2010, practically everybody in isolated parts of Ireland tuned in throughout the day to their local radio stations to get information on what was happening.  People in isolated parts of Ireland are utterly dependent on local radio stations.  Like Deputy Dooley, I would like greater recognition of these stations in terms of funding.  I accept many of them are commercial operations.  They pride themselves on their public service broadcasting of current affairs and local sports events rather than on the level of commercial sponsorship or advertisements they receive or attract.  People in Kilkenny are dependent, almost exclusively, on the local radio station in terms of Sunday coverage of hurling matches and so on.  The time has come for recognition of the unique relationship between the local radio stations and their listeners.</p><p>  It was stated earlier that an attempt is being made to rebalance the commercial sector.  What content is to be provided by local radio stations if they are pushed almost exclusively towards raising their revenue in the commercial sector?  As pointed out by Deputy Dooley, the advertising environment is currently very challenging.  While it was stated earlier that many involved in this sector are profitable, based on what I am hearing, they are struggling.  I would like some recognition of them in terms of funding.</p> <p>I would like to see some kind of recognition in that for them.  It is a marvellous service.  I am also thinking of the local elections coming up, and this issue is very important in that regard.  Local radio will provide the electorate with a forum for many candidates, so it is an important element.</p></speech>

The report was submitted to the Minister last July and I was extremely interested in the key findings.  The witnesses are saying that RTE is not living within its budget and they agree that it needs more money.  This is sort of being held against local radio stations as the witnesses have said four times that they are profitable and working away.  The witnesses can contradict me if I am wrong.  Have they indicated that local radio stations are okay paddling their own boat without State funding as they can manage?  We all agree they are providing an excellent service.  In my own case of Radio Kerry, the people of the county live and breathe their local radio station, which tells people who is dead, what the people who are alive are doing and keeps them informed about sport and everything else that is important to them and their families.  I would go as far as saying that Radio Kerry is the lifeline of older people.</p><p>  The witnesses are indicating that the likes of Radio Kerry are profitable and managing so they do not need assistance.  They are surviving because they must do so; there is nobody throwing money at them, which is what is happening at RTE and what the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, wants to continue supporting.  I have nothing against RTE or our national broadcasters-----</p></speech>

A local radio station could have a person presenting at one stage and five minutes later that person could be sweeping up around the hall.  They survive because they are workmanlike in what they do.  If there is waste, it should be cut.  The right answer is not what the witnesses have argued.  They may not think RTE should get more money but they seem to think that if it is to provide a proper service as a national broadcaster over the next five years, they should recommend throwing more money at the organisation.  Would they not recommend tightening up, as everybody else in the country is doing?</p></speech>

I would like the witnesses to address the statement that local radio stations are profitable.  Every one is struggling, although they might appear to be surviving only because of their work ethos and method.  They know they must survive on their own merits.</p><p>  There is to be a new licensing system and people without a television must still have a licence because of the new structure.  Anybody with common sense must believe that some of the extra revenue to be created should be given to the independent broadcasters.  There is no reason they should not get some of it.  If the authority is to be taken seriously against an argument that it is a mouthpiece for RTE - I accept the statements that the authority is not a mouthpiece for that broadcaster - the authority should indicate that if people pay the licence fee, some of it should go to independent stations because of the massive role they play in people's lives.  If the independents are passing out the national broadcaster, it is not the fault of the independents that they are good at what they do.</p><p>  I can see the battle that independent radio stations and broadcasters have with national broadcasters, and it reminds me of Independent politicians being up against the might of political parties.

Deputy Healy-Rae's comments may be entertaining but they paint a caricature of what I said, and an unfair one at that.  I pointed to the fact that local radio stations are profitable as a tribute to their performance and not in any sense as a marginalisation or dismissal of them.  To characterise the careful report we submitted to the Minister as being a proposal to throw money at RTE is inaccurate, unfair and, in my view, inappropriate at an Oireachtas joint committee where the Deputy and his fellow members have greater freedom of speech than I have.  They also have greater latitude in the style and approach of contributions than anybody who appears before a committee.  I will leave the matter there.</p><p>  Deputies Dooley and Phelan spoke very clearly about the values they see in local radio stations and without question I agree with them, as does the BAI as a whole, which in its previous incarnations as the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and the Independent Radio and Television Commission has had a sustaining relationship with local radio stations.  Viewers and listeners everywhere have suffered in recent years as the texture of every schedule has been challenged with the reduction in available funding.  At the risk of being perceived as a spokesman for RTE, it and TG4 have had to cut back substantially and their schedules are not as rich as I believe the broadcasters would like them to be.  We have stated before that it is a significant achievement by all broadcasters that they have sustained schedules in the manner they have in recent years.  They have managed to provide schedules despite significant reductions in expenditure and revenue.</p><p>  We want to speak about now but look to the future over the next five years, when everybody hopes there will be an economic upturn and some renewal of the advertising revenue available to broadcasters.  We want the commercial broadcaster to have a greater share of that than has been the case in the past, and that is what we mean by rebalancing.  Deputy Coffey referred to the online platform and that is directly related to these two considerations.  One of the major shifts that has taken place and which will affect all media in Ireland, including newspapers, local and national radio, public and private, is the move to online in terms of consumer expenditure, advertising and the manner in which people consume information.</p> <p>There is a public policy debate to be had in the future about how, whether and in what way online can be regulated.  I am not looking for additional work for the BAI, but there is a serious issue to be addressed in terms of the extent to which online activities are wholly unregulated in this State.  There is a major public policy issue in terms of the strength of Irish media generally.  Local and national newspapers are suffering and we have spoken extensively about the extent to which broadcasters have been affected.  That has public policy implications beyond the individual service to a community or the individual experiences of a particular broadcaster.</p><p> I said earlier that in other places there is a different regulatory framework where there is a somewhat more prescriptive view of what should constitute the work or output of a public service broadcaster.  We must be careful to ensure that we do not mean that it should carry only those programmes that people do not want to see or hear.  I am not suggesting that anybody takes that view, but sometimes the debate can veer in that direction.  There is a major challenge to develop a regulatory framework that is clear and specific in terms of what is expected of a broadcaster that is in receipt of public money, without infringing the editorial independence of that broadcaster.  That is primarily a matter for legislatures until such time as the regulatory framework is given some element of that responsibility.</p><p> The issue of 2fm has been raised again.  Beyond saying what we said earlier regarding the distinctive character of output that should be the hallmark of a publicly funded broadcaster, that must be a discussion the committee has with RTE.  Whatever views we or I might have, it is not a matter on which the BAI can express a view because it is, by statute, reserved to the board of RTE.</p><p> There were a number of references to the broadcast service charge.  We know nothing about this beyond what we have seen and heard in news outlets.  It is a matter of government policy.  I have no idea of to what extent there is an expectation of additional revenue from that, nor do I have a view as to whether there are government intentions relating to it, nor do I particularly wish to express a view at present as to what I think the Government's view should be.  It does not follow, as night follows day, that any additional funding should automatically go to commercial broadcasters but we have clearly said, and I will repeat it for a final time, that when we talk about an increase in funding for RTE, we clearly say there should be no increase at present and, to this extent we agree with Crowe Horwath, there should be no increase in public funding for its current level of output.  We believe its current level of output, in terms of the range and extent of Irish-made programmes, is not adequate for a public broadcaster in the Ireland of now and the future.  To secure that and exclusively based on a clear, specific plan as to the nature of the programming that would be broadcast, we think there is a strong argument for saying that the level of programming available to an Irish audience needs greater investment, coupled with tight absolute control of RTE's costs, making the best possible use of its commercial opportunities but limiting those commercial opportunities so more are available to independent broadcasters.</p><p> That is as much as I wish to say.  If the committee wants any further information, we will be happy to provide it and return to the committee if necessary.</p></speech>

I thank the members for their participation.  It was a very interesting debate and I hope I gave everybody a fair crack of the whip with regard to questions and comments.  It is important to acknowledge that you are working within the remit with which the authority was established.  Undoubtedly, over the next year we will hear contributions from both the State broadcaster and the independent broadcasters in the commercial sector.  We will give them as thorough a quizzing as we have given you today.</p><p>  As there is no other business we will adjourn until 9.30 a.m. next Wednesday, 20 November, when the anti-electricity pylon groups will appear before the committee.</p></speech>
