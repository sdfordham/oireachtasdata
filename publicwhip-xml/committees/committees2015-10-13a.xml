I understand Deputy Wallace will attend in substitution for him.  As we are in public session, I ask those present to turn off all mobile telephones as they cause interference, even on silent mode, with the recording equipment in the committee rooms.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister of State and his official to the meeting.  Before we begin, it is important to comment briefly on the recent events which resulted in the tragic death of a number of people.  In particular, I wish to pay tribute to Garda Tony Golden who was killed in the line of duty while protecting another citizen.  Garda Golden leaves behind a wife and young family and our thoughts and prayers must be with them at this most difficult time.  His actions were selfless and brave.  They are the actions that members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engage in every day on our behalf.  I also wish Ms Siobh&aacute;n Phillips, who is very ill in hospital, a speedy recovery from her injuries.</p> <p>  There was a further tragedy at Carrickmines, where a fire caused the deaths of so many innocent people.  The entire nation was shocked and moved by this terrible tragedy.  On behalf of the committee, I wish to extend my deepest sympathies to all of those who have been bereaved and injured by these events.</p></speech>

Some of the people who unfortunately died at Carrickmines were from Bray in my constituency.  The local community and the Bray Travellers development group are surrounding those they left behind with every bit of support that they can give.  The wider community has come on board.  It has been an awful weekend.  I thank the Chairman for raising these events at the start of the meeting.</p></speech>

Such reports could prove useful in the context of, for example, the development of policy in relation to policing services.</p><p>Having considered the wording of this amendment further, the Minister considers that requiring the authority to submit a report within the period specified is not fully appropriate in the context of the independence of the authority.

Section 48 of the Bill inserts a new subsection 4(<i>a</i>) into section 102 which enables the authority to refer matters to GSOC for investigation.  This provision replicates a similar power for the Minister to that in section 102(5).  </p><p>Referral under these provisions will always result in GSOC initiating an investigation.  This is appropriate where the authority or Minister is satisfied that an investigation should be initiated.  However, there is no mechanism under the current provisions to deal with a situation where, for example, the authority or the Minister is uncertain as to whether an investigation is required or where GSOC might have already completed an investigation but the authority or Minister is unaware of this fact.  The amendments now being proposed seek to address the situation by allowing the authority or the Minister to refer matters to GSOC on the basis that it will determine whether an investigation under section 102(4) is warranted.  Amendments Nos. 163 and 164 are technical amendments.</p></speech>
