I thank him for his contribution to the Committee of Public Accounts.  He was a very effective member who analysed the subject well and had a great grip of the general work being undertaken by the committee.  He will certainly be missed but no doubt he will excel in his role as Minister of State.</p></speech>

He manages to combine ability and being a nice person, which do not always go hand in hand, but in his case they do.  I wish him well in his future role.</p></speech>

Nos. 3A.1 to No. 3A.5, inclusive, deal with the Wicklow Enterprise Park and were deferred from the last meeting.

Agreed.</p><p>  No. 3A.6 is correspondence dated 1 July 2013 from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, regarding Waterford Institute of Technology and the Quigley report.

It includes a new section.  The compellability legislation, dating back to 1997, has been completely replaced.  The advice was that we should deal with this issue under the new legislation because if we were to do so under the old legislation, there was a likelihood we would end up in trouble.  There was a slight risk somebody could have said we were compelling him or her under legislation which was no longer on the Statute Book.</p></speech>

We have dealt with this.</p><p>  No. 3A.11 is correspondence dated 9 July 2013 from Mr. Brian Purcell, Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, regarding the additional information requested at the meeting of 16 May 2013.  It is to be noted and published.</p><p>  No. 3A.12 is correspondence dated 17 July 2013 from Mr. Paul O'Toole, director general of F&Aacute;S, providing additional information requested at the meeting of 4 July 2013.  The correspondence, which is marked confidential, relates to the lease of a property in Tolka Valley business park that could not be used for its intended purpose.  We should come back to this in the autumn.  I will be guided by whether members think this matter warrants further examination.  When Deputy McDonald raised this issue, she asked for those papers to be submitted.  Maybe we will check with her to see how she wants the matter to be pursued.</p><p>  No. 3A.13 is correspondence dated 15 July 2013 from Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general designate of the Health Service Executive, providing additional information requested at the meeting of 20 June 2013.

We will return to this matter in the autumn.</p><p>  No. 3A.14 is correspondence dated 17 July 2013 from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the parliamentary and regulatory affairs division of the Health Service Executive, providing additional information requested at the meeting of 25 April 2013.

It is to be noted.</p><p>  No. 3B.3 is correspondence dated 3 July 2013 from Mr. Bev Cotton of Clonakilty, County Cork regarding Youthreach Macroom and County Cork VEC.  It is to be noted.  We are getting a great deal of correspondence from employees and former employees of County Cork VEC.  While we cannot deal with the individual grievances, the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit of the 2011 accounts will examine whether these complaints show up systemic weaknesses at the VEC.  If they do, we will deal with them in that way.</p><p>  No. 3B.4 is correspondence dated 10 July 2013 from Mr. Brendan Ryan, chief executive of the Courts Service, providing a note previously requested regarding digital audio recordings.  It is to be noted and a copy forwarded to Mr. Kevin Fitzgerald, who was the original complainant.  A further letter was received from that person this morning.  We will ask that it be circulated to the various Departments for response.</p><p>  No. 3B.5 is correspondence dated 10 July 2013 from Mr. Dick Brady, assistant city manager of Dublin City Council, providing a note previously requested regarding issues raised by Mr. Tom Bourke.

This relates to a dispute between a private company and a State body in relation to the sale of property.  I suggest we should ask the Accounting Officer of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to review the papers to ensure all appropriate steps were taken by Shannon Development during the disposal of this property.  We will forward the correspondence in the expectation of an early reply.</p><p>  No. 3B.7 is correspondence dated 9 July 2013 from Ms Anne M. Nolan, secretary of the Montenotte Park residents association, regarding a note previously provided by the Department of Education and Skills regarding the use of funds allocated for school buildings.  It is to be noted and a copy is to be forwarded to the Department of Education and Skills for a note on the issues raised.</p><p>  No. 3B.8 is correspondence dated 17 July 2013 from Mr. William Treacy of Portlaoise, County Laois, seeking a correction of the record of the committee in respect of previous correspondence submitted.  It is to be noted.  The request has no basis and he will be informed accordingly.</p><p>  No. 3B.9 is correspondence dated 17 July 2013 from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the parliamentary and regulatory affairs division of the Health Service Executive, regarding a list of internal audit reports for the third and fourth quarters 2012 released under freedom of information.

It is her opening statement and is to be noted and published.</p><p>  We will move on to reports and statements and accounts received since our meeting of 4 July last.  We have received a number of such documents, including from Limerick County Enterprise Board, Cork Institute of Technology, the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, the National Oil Reserves Agency Limited and Microfinance Ireland.  We have also received the annual report of IDA Ireland, which will be of relevance to our next meeting.  We will note all of those documents.</p></speech>

They relate to the year that ended last December.  Why are 2011 reports still coming in at this stage, more than a year and a half after that year ended?  I know I have asked this question previously.  Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General might indicate why this is happening.</p></speech>

The issue is that they basically do not have the resources to produce annual reports.  They generally want to submit their financial statements with their annual reports.  It takes time for the boards to put those reports and statements together.  When that has been done, the documents in question go to the Department before coming to the Oireachtas Library.  That is the position with regard to the county enterprise boards.  Some of the financial statements were not certified until the end of 2012, or even until 2013 in a few cases.  That might have been because explanations were not provided, for example.  That is why some of these reports are delayed.</p></speech>

I think it is fair to say there was a consensus about doing something through the committee about what Matthew Elderfield said when he attended a committee meeting approximately a month ago.

The covering letter reflected the views of the committee on the matter.  We included the transcript with the letter, as I have said.  We asked the Taoiseach and the Ministers to undertake a root and branch review of legislation governing individual liability, for example by legislating for offences such as reckless trading in financial services and the concept of presumptive liability for directors.  We also asked them to review the structures involved in investigating white collar crime, which are currently spread across three bodies - the Garda, the Central Bank and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.

When Matthew Elderfield came before the PAC, in my opinion he came specifically to make the point on white-collar crime and the lack of support on that.

Mr. Elderfield put huge emphasis on the matter on the day he came before the committee.</p></speech>

These valuations are used as the base for the levying of rates by local authorities.  The appropriation account indicates that, in 2011, the Valuation Office cost &euro;9.6 million to run.  The expenditure includes around &euro;650,000 in respect of the work of the valuation tribunal, which handles appeals against valuation determinations by the Valuation Office.</p><p>  The Valuation Office has two major streams of work.  First, it carries out revisions of rateable valuations, based on the existing valuation norms for a specific geographic area.  This is required where there are new developments or alterations to existing rated properties.  Second, the Valuation Office has been engaged since 2001 in a phased national revaluation programme, designed to bring the valuation of all properties into line with recent rental values.  Previous work by my office, reported on in November 2007, outlined these Valuation Office programmes in detail and drew attention in particular to the slow pace of the revaluation programme, due to certain operational inflexibilities.  I understand that faster progress is now being made in relation to that work.  The Accounting Officer will be in a position to update the committee on developments in that regard.</p></speech>

On the last occasion the Valuation Office appeared before the committee, in October 2011, two particular areas of concern were discussed.  These areas were, various shortcomings in the financial controls and governance arrangements in the Valuation Office in 2010 and the pace at which the office was conducting the national revaluation programme.</p><p>  In regard to the financial control issues, significant progress has been made in implementing the necessary measures to address the shortcomings.  A number of these are set out in the progress report provided to the committee in January 2012 and in the updating document we have now provided.</p><p>  The committee is aware that conducting a national revaluation programme has been Government policy since the enactment of the Valuation Act 2001.  After a very slow start, the Valuation Office has achieved considerable momentum in the programme over the past two years.  The current position is that the programmes for three authorities in Dublin are complete.  Revaluation of the three Waterford rating authorities and Dublin City Council will be concluded by December 2013.  This landmark will increase the amount of the revalued commercial valuation base in monetary terms, to over 50%.  Work in regard to the two Limerick authorities is well under way and we have also initiated the statutory consultation process from which orders for the revaluation of an additional five authorities can be expected imminently.</p><p>  The case for conducting a national revaluation programme is compelling.  The rental values of individual properties and categories of property change over time as a result of differential shifts between categories and locations.  Apart from the rating authorities that have been revalued to date, commercial rates in all other areas are, at present, based on valuations which reflect market conditions and relativities prevailing in 1988.  The only comprehensive way to address this is through a revaluation programme from which some ratepayers will obtain a reduction, while, inevitably, others will experience an increase.</p><p>  The committee will already be aware of the efforts which have been under way to accelerate the national revaluation programme.  This requires a multifaceted approach from the staff and management of the Valuation Office.  We have concentrated on bringing about improvements in how we organise and carry out our work, using a wider range of data sources to inform or validate our valuations, and developing innovative approaches to valuation, including proposals which require legislation.</p></speech>

I would like to thank him and Mr. Declan Lavelle for meeting me in Waterford recently.  It was very informative.  I am interested in this issue because of the revaluation process that is ongoing in Waterford and the impact it will potentially have on businesses there.  Over the last two months, I have been trying to ascertain whether different Departments are up to speed with the revaluation process in which the Valuation Office is engaged, which is a technical exercise and analysis, as Mr. O'Sullivan pointed out.  I did not find a lack of understanding, but a lack of cohesion in respect of the implications of the revaluation process throughout the Government, which I think is improving.  Due to the statutory independence of the Valuation Office, there is perhaps a lack of appreciation in some Departments of the implications for businesses of the results of the valuation process, but I think that is changing.</p><p>  Where are we now?  I had a very positive meeting with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform this week.  At this stage it is fair to say there is an acknowledgment within the Government that there is a problem and that something needs to be done about it.  I would describe the process in which the Valuation Office is engaged as a system that was outdated and needed reform - it goes back to 1998, and there is acceptance of that - mirrored with a disastrous business environment, especially as it affects small businesses outside Dublin.  What does the Government do to cushion the blow of a revaluation process that has resulted in some cases in a sharp upward adjustment for small businesses that do not have the ability to pay?  That is where my interest comes from.  I know these businesses.  I know the profiles of the individuals involved and I have a serious concern that they will be put out of business.  This will certainly assist them in going out of business.</p><p>  The larger issue is that this is self-defeating.  Our rates base has shrunk and it is unsustainable in many cases to increase rates.  I have examples from my home town of Dungarvan which were given to me by the chamber of commerce.  Rates for a clothes shop are potentially going from &euro;800 to &euro;9,000.  There is an appeals process and a potential tribunal process that goes with that and the office works with the individuals involved, but that is unsustainable.  I know the individuals involved in many of these businesses and it will lead to unemployment and non-hiring of people in future.  There is an issue for the State in that respect as well.</p><p>  Following the meeting with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, I can say the problem is being acknowledged.  There is legislation in the pipeline.  Over the next two months, departmental officials will take a look at that legislation, potentially amending it in respect of issues such as spreading out payments over time.  That leads to an issue of funding with regard to any deficits at local authority level.  That is what will be examined over the next couple of months.</p><p>  I understand that the Valuation Office is given a role that is underpinned by legislation, and officials at the office go about their work based on that legislation.  There are policy issues here that obviously they cannot address and I accept that.  A comment was made to me by a number of local authority officials as I was educating myself in this process.  They were critical of the fact that there was not more interaction between their offices and the Valuation Office.  They understand the statutorily independent role that the Valuation Office has, but they believe their local knowledge and local experience with particular small businesses is being ignored.   When they tried to communicate that to the Valuation Office, however, they were told frankly that they should not call the office.  I can understand why political interference would be guarded against by the Valuation Office at all times, but I heard this comment so many times I have to take it seriously.  Local authority officials say that there should be a role for local authorities to have more input into the process than is currently the case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.102" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Sullivan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013071800006#F00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for his comments, and particularly his opening remarks about our meeting.  I understand the point that he is making.  It is a very important point.  Everybody in the Valuation Office is very aware of how difficult the current environment is out there for business survival and for trading.  However, as the Deputy said, the functions of the Valuation Office are limited by the legislation under which we operate.  Our primary remit is to conduct the revaluation in accordance with the Act.  The outcome of the revaluation and measures to address or ameliorate its impact are issues of policy, as the Deputy acknowledges, which go beyond the remit of the Valuation Office.  We have no remit whatsoever in the legislation in respect of any of those issues.  Our job is to estimate the net annual value, which in real terms means the rental value.  The proposition is to figure out what the rent for a particular property would command on the statutory date if it was vacant, on the basis that the tenant would pay the rates, look after the repairs and look after the insurance.</p><p>  I am very interested in the comments made to the Deputy by the local authority officials, because I like to know about particular difficulties to see if we can address them.   As the process currently stands, there is a consultation period before the Commissioner of Valuation ever signs a valuation order.  There are two parties to be consulted as required by the legislation.  The first party is the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, presumably on the basis of having a policy input into whether the order should go ahead.  The second party is the local authority in question.  There is a consultation process that takes place at the very beginning.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.104" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013071800007#G00200"><p>That is where the problem lies.  There is no argument there.  As Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan said, it is a technical exercise and analysis.  The difficulty is that we are living in extraordinary economic times and these businesses cannot pay.  I know that.  When there is a 1025% increase for a clothes shop that has seen its footfall decrease by 50% there is a problem.  There is a problem for Government generally.  When I raised this before in committee I said we should look at the rates arrears in this country, the amounts that have been written off.  When I asked the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government how it works from one local authority to another, there was not much of a response.  It seems to be an arbitrary, subjective issue within local authorities as to who writes off, or how they write off, particular arrears in different rateable local authorities.  There are very significant issues there.</p><p>  At the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform an undertaking was given to work with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to examine the legislation to see if some facilitation can be made for businesses that are in trouble and cannot sustain the kinds of increase that will result from the revaluation process.  I do not want to say too much more than that because the specifics of this have not been nailed down.  None of us can ignore the reality on the ground when it comes to the businesses about which we are speaking.</p><p>  The technical exercise of analysis is flawed because it does not take into account ability to pay and in many cases there is no ability to pay for some of these businesses, even though we are looking at a system that has been updated from 1988.  When an assembled group of businesses and retailers in Dungarvan recently asked one of Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s employees why they were going to be asked to pay these increases his response was, &ldquo;Because you are the ones that are left.&rdquo;  It was an unfortunate comment.  I understand why someone would say that because in many cases these are the businesses that have survived, they have cut their cloth and let employees go but they feel victimised by Government.  They think what is happening is unreal considering what has happened to their businesses and the potential down the road.</p><p>  A motion was sent through the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on impact assessments and I received a very good response in which the Department indicated that it will conduct an impact analysis in Waterford, which is great news.  It mentioned that post-revaluation impact analyses have been carried out in South Dublin, Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  Dublin is a different economy from Waterford, as we all know.  Is the Valuation Office involved in that post-revaluation impact analysis?</p></speech>

In respect of some of the examples he quoted, we have a process whereby representations can be made.  There is an appeals process.  There is a full opportunity to work out any particular difficulties or errors that might remain.</p><p>  I also did a quick analysis of some of the extreme increases that are <i>in situ</i>.  They are still a work in progress.  I found one of the increases was down to an amalgamation of several units that had previously been rated separately but were now all lumped into one.  There was a case of change of use from what was previously a store room to retail.  I would expect to see a significant increase in that case.  There were examples of major extensions and improvements having been carried out.  One would have to ask whether it is really fair that there would not be an increase in such circumstances.  There are sometimes explanations in the background.  I take no issue with the Deputy on that case because I do not know its circumstances.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.106" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013071800007#G00400"><p>That is fair enough.  Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan is picking out particular examples to make his case.  What people want to know is, considering where retail is right now, why is it the case that manufacturing and industrial ratepayers have seen a very substantial decrease while in many cases it is the retail sector that will see an increase when it is on its knees?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.107" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Sullivan" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013071800007#G00500"><p>This goes to the heart of the valuation system and what it is all about.  The current set of relativities goes back to 1988 and when we do a revaluation across the board in the three rating authorities in Waterford and Dublin city we bring that forward to the situation in this particular case, October 2011.  The short answer is that it is because our analysis of the evidence put before us leads us to believe that the rental levels for retail have gone ahead of the rental levels for industrial units in relative terms.  It is that simple.  Everybody would accept that there has been a big falling-off in rents from the height of the boom down to modern levels but not all have fallen at the same rate.  We are asking what was the situation in October 2011 <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> 1988.  It is normal and natural to expect that some sectors will have moved at a different pace from others.  That is the simple explanation but even within that there would be many examples where the opposite would be true.  One will find examples of retail that has come down in particular areas of Waterford city, I could give the Deputy examples of that, and the industrial sector has gone up.</p></speech>

There is a problem with that.  The problem is that rental values have changed in the past two years and that is not taken into consideration in the new revaluations.  That was accepted and the Department will examine that.  It is a big issue.</p></speech>

I will give him an example.  One lady dropped her rents 30% in January and she made the point that the revaluation is based on October 2011 levels.  I have been coming across these people over the past two years.  Retailers in my home town -  I know many of them - have told me that this year is the worst since this crisis hit, and the first three or four months of this year have been the worst.  The figures bear this out.  When Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan makes the point about 2011 figures I make the point that they are out of date.  I did not have to make this point because the Department made it for me, it is coming around to the opinion that it is out of date.</p></speech>

It takes time to run a revaluation. It is a very thorough and extensive process.  Time has to be made available for due process in terms of the representation and all the other stages.</p><p>  In respect of 2011, a couple of aspects arise.  First, all volumes will be down.  Values would be down right across the market in 2013 compared with 2011.</p></speech>

The damage this will do to the economy across the board is not worth it.  Mr. O'Sullivan made the point about the reason for doing this but I ask why legislation is being introduced.  A vehicle was introduced in the Seanad which allows for a system of self-assessment.  This is not a panacea and some people may presume self-assessment will mean an automatic reduction in the rates but I know that is not the case.  Why was this legislation introduced?  The reasons have been given but I ask how will it improve the situation.  The question for people who are being rated now is whether under the new legislation they will be given the opportunity to use self-assessment in Waterford and other places after the Valuation Office valuation has been completed and the new legislation has been adopted and enacted.</p></speech>

We will certainly be supplying information, data and statistics to the Department and provide any assistance that is required but we would have to acknowledge that the Department has a policy role while ours is very much a specific statutory role.  We will, of course, provide any information and that would always be the case.  We would abstract information from our database, analyse it and provide the figures to the Department.</p></speech>

We have not asked anyone else about that.  As the commissioner said, there is a compelling argument in favour of revaluation and even though the theory stands up to examination, that theory must be constantly tested to see that what happens in practice follows through.  To date, we have looked to see whether the results are within the expected range as to the winners and losers and to what degree they have won or lost.  A range of plus or minus 20% might be acceptable.  We examine how many are in the extreme position.  As the commissioner pointed out, we examine the extreme positions in more detail and review them.  There is an explanation in some cases.  One cannot simply look at the percentages and sometimes one must look at the absolute increase as well.  Some of them can be explained and then one is left with a small number.  One then makes a judgment based on that number and the process of representations and appeals, the time gap between the 1988 valuation and the new valuation date.  It is a case of judging whether the results brought about by the revaluation are within the expected anticipated range and if the revaluation process is working.  On this occasion we would have no objection to going further if that can add to the analysis.</p></speech>

I presume Mr. Lynch understands my point that things have changed and are changing rapidly with regard to small businesses in this country.  There is also a difference between Dublin and the rest of the country as regards the size of the economy.  I refer to the implications of this revaluation on businesses that are barely hanging on.  My concern is that this needs to be done in depth and in a timely manner in order to gauge the kind of impact it will have on those small businesses.  That policy decision will need to be fed into the entire process and the legislation being considered by the Oireachtas.  If that means staggering payments, then there will be a funding issue for local authorities and the resultant deficits.  The situation is moving quickly and this needs to be taken into consideration.</p><p>  The damage that this revaluation process will do to businesses in Waterford city and the county is very considerable.  Dungarvan has an ARV which is lower than the county rate.  As a result of amalgamation and the abolition of town councils, it is expected that there will be a harmonisation - a wonderful word which means an increase - in the ARV to the county rate, potentially.  In that case, Dungarvan will move to the Waterford County Council rate.  This is a double whammy in that businesses will have to face that and then have to suffer a revaluation and an increase.  The Valuation Office impact analysis needs to take that into consideration.  In my opinion, nobody in Government has thought about that up until the meeting I had last Tuesday with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Those are really serious issues which are causing upset to businesses.  They do not believe that the Government is taking a holistic view of the issue and the impact this may have on their businesses.</p></speech>

The legislation to speed up the process is designed to update the valuation base.  Therefore, things have to be taken step by step.  We have committed to looking at the outcome of the revaluation within Dungarvan.  As the commissioner has said, this is a work in progress and the draft searches that have issued at this point will be subject to consultation with the ratepayers and with reference to the appeals that are coming through.  We will have to take into account the outcomes of this appeal process because they will ultimately impact on the next step which is rating.  We have to keep the distinctions.</p></speech>

All these processes are related.  Up until this week I discovered that everyone in government is saying it is nothing to do with them and that it is the job of the Valuation Office.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will levy and collect these rates but it does not regard itself as being involved in the revaluation process.  Unfortunately, I found that with regard to government there is a lack of cohesion and communication and linkage to the end result which is that businesses will pay a lot more in rates and who may go out of business as a result.  This revaluation process was begun for a very good reason.  The system dated from 1988 and it needed to be updated but the implications and the results of this process has not been thought out with regard to the effects on the small business environment.  I refer to Mr. Lynch's analysis and my point is that things are moving very quickly and all the factors I mentioned need to be brought into play before we cause too much damage, frankly, to a rate base that has shrunk massively.  In my home town and county, half the shops such as clothes shops and small retailers are gone.  The footfall and the spending power is no longer there.</p><p>  Mr. O'Sullivan referred to pilot studies for the new legislation.  Where will the pilot projects be located?</p></speech>

I will begin with the Deputy's relaying of the comment about the shrinking base and his contention that the burden is falling on fewer businesses.</p></speech>

In regard to ARVs and amalgamations, that is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, not the Valuation Office.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about the central thrust behind the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012.  It is essentially a series of measures to accelerate the revaluation programme and thus allow us to complete it more quickly across the country.  An important aspect of the 2001 legislation is its provision that once a first valuation is completed, a rolling process then kicks in whereby it must be redone not less than five years and not more than ten years thereafter.  The difficulty at the moment is that after such a long period of time, a range of anomalies is emerging in the first revaluation.  The principle under the new legislation is that once the first assessment is done and the more modern valuations are <i>in situ</i>, the revaluation exercise will be conducted on a repetitive basis far more quickly thereafter and we will be able to pick up on economic movements that have happened and so on.  That is the thrust of the 2012 Bill.</p></speech>

It is matter for the Oireachtas to decide what is ultimately enacted and what ultimately transpires.</p></speech>

This is a point I have raised before in regard to the legislation.  I am concerned that we might have a situation where one set of businesses in a particular local authority area is assessed under one system but, once the law is passed, another set of businesses is assessed under a different system.</p></speech>

It is important to note that self-assessment will be introduced on a pilot basis, which we have decided to do in the Galway City Council rating authority area.  My intention would be to sign an order very quickly once the legislation is in place to commence that programme.</p><p>  There are always two elements to conducting a revaluation.  The first involves the measurement and assessment of the physical dimensions of the property, and the second is the application of valuation levels in order to determine the rental rate per square metre.  The plan is to request ratepayers to undertake the measurement of the premises and convey their assessment to us.  We intend to provide considerable support in this regard.  We will have a presence in Galway City Council rating authority area, for instance, and we plan to produce a series of explanatory videos to assist ratepayers with the process.  A good deal of support is needed and will be provided.  In the meantime, we will conduct our market analysis of the rental situation, which we will provide to ratepayers.  The latter can then put the two together and provide us with a self-assessment.  To be absolutely clear, it cannot and will not be a case of write your own valuation.  Nobody wants that.</p></speech>

However, the question I asked is whether businesses that are being revalued under the existing legislation will be allowed to self-assess under the new system that comes into force when the new Bill is enacted, which could be as soon as early next year.</p></speech>

Five years is the minimum point at which the cyclical revaluation will occur.  I can come back to the Deputy on that point if he wishes.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Sullivan has indicated that he does not envisage businesses in that situation moving over to the new system.  In that case, we will have certain groups of businesses in Dublin, Waterford, Limerick and so on being valued under an entirely different system from other groups of businesses and having to wait five years to come under the new system.</p></speech>

What we must bear in mind, however, is that regardless of whether the valuation is done by self-assessment or by direct assessment, the commissioner will ultimately have to stand over the quality of the valuations set out in the published list.  That list must be robust and correct in so far as it possibly can be and must thereby provide a solid basis for the whole valuation system.</p></speech>

I maintain, however, that we are facing into a major problem  in places like Limerick, Waterford and Dublin.  I understand the appeals rate in Dublin is some 40%.  The bottom lines is that we are bringing in a new system, on grounds that have been well argued.  Mr. O'Sullivan referred to streamlining appeals, but streamlining actually means reducing the number of criteria under which an appeal may be submitted.  It is, in short, a different system; let us be clear about that.  It is limiting the grounds on which an appeal can be made.  The major concern is that we will have large numbers of business throughout the country which remain valuated under a system that is being completely reworked.  If there were no significant reworking involved, we would not bother to legislate.</p></speech>

At is stands, quite a lot of the delay is to do with having physically to inspect properties and do these types of calculations.  If the ratepayer can help us with that element of work, we should be able to get to a stage where we can publish lists much more quickly than heretofore.  It will allow us to address the criticism the Deputy made earlier that it is taking two years to get from the beginning to the end of the process.  The intention is to get the recycles into much tighter time lines.  At the end of the day, the basis of the valuation, as set out in the legislation, is not changing.  It is still about estimating the net annual value on a valuation date.  The Bill provides that the commissioner will be allowed to make regulations as to how the mechanics of all of this will actually work.  As we see it, there are several important points to consider.  We will, for example, have to conduct very stringent audits.  We cannot simply accept at face value the measurements and so we get back.  In fact, we must have power under the legislation to override what the ratepayer is proposing.  Ultimately, the published valuation levels will reflect assessments that have been determined by the Valuation Office and over which we can stand.  The self-assessment element is about speeding up the information-gathering process and facilitating us to analyse the correct net annual values for the rating authority area.</p><p>  The Deputy referred to limiting appeals and streamlining the appeal process.  The proposal in the Bill is that one of the current steps in the appeal process, namely, the appeal to the commissioner, will be removed entirely.  There is a history to this in that prior to the introduction of the 2001 Act, there was no concept of representations as they currently operate.  Representations are a relatively informal and straightforward way for the ratepayer to interact with the Valuation Office and help us to get the list right before we publish it.  After publication, as things stand, there is a right of appeal to the commissioner, which is sometimes called the first appeal.  It is essentially an internal appeal within the Valuation Office, after which the ratepayer can proceed to the tribunal if he or she remains dissatisfied with the outcome.  The proposal under the Bill is not only to retain the representations facility but to bolster it by allowing greater time for the ratepayer to interact with the Valuation Office.  The right of formal appeal to the tribunal thereafter is also retained.  It is a question of streamlining the process to address the types of time delay the Deputy mentioned.</p></speech>

The way manufacturing and industrial properties can see a sizeable reduction in rates compared to small businesses in small towns which are seeing increases of 40% to 50% does not add up.  I seriously question this.  Thought has not been given to the effect this has on small businesses.</p><p>  A new word is being used in terms of the Government in that people now like to talk about group-think, but it is being used for a different purpose.  The problem is that there is no group-think when it comes to the Government and rates.  There has been a lack of connectivity, communication and linkages with regard to different Departments that have a stake in this issue. That is a problem, notwithstanding the work Mr. O'Sullivan does and the efficient way in which he does it.  It is not a criticism of his office as I have said to him previously, but this has implications for the Government and a sector of society that funds local government and which is finding it far more difficult to stay in existence.  This has implications for the Government and the funding of local government.  I do not think these issues have been taken into consideration.</p></speech>

There is new legislation and a new system.  Mr. O'Sullivan's interpretation differs from mine in terms of what is and what is not new and we should wait in that respect.  We should all examine issues such as arrears and the reason it is the case that arrears are being written off in some local authorities and not in others.  As I said to Mr. O'Sullivan, it is an arbitrary and subjective decision by officials in many cases.  It is being done piecemeal.   I cannot believe that in some cases the Department does not have an answer to the question of whether there is a manual or there are rules and regulations with regard to writing something off.</p></speech>

It is welcome that I had a meeting with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform this week.  In the next few months my understanding is that the Department will get together with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and examine the issues surrounding everything about which we have spoken today, the legislation that has been introduced and ultimately the viability of small businesses based on the revaluation process.  I look forward to this and thank the Chairman for bearing with me.</p></speech>

Therefore, I may be going over ground already covered, but when Mr. O'Sullivan says in his presentation that this landmark - he was referring to Waterford and Dublin - will increase the commercial revaluations in monetary terms to over 50%, does he mean that the overall valuation of the properties involved will increase in monetary terms by 50%?</p></speech>

What I mean by that is that if we add all of the values of commercial properties across the State, by the end of this year we will have revalued half of them in value terms.  In percentage terms, it will be less than that because we have started with the larger urban centres which have more commercial properties and properties that tend to have a higher commercial value and, therefore, a higher valuation level.</p></speech>

If I understood him correctly, Deputy Deasy said there appeared to be a differential between the revaluation of industrial properties as distinct from the revaluation of retail properties; that in some cases the valuation of industrial properties had decreased, while the valuation of retail properties had increased.  Mr. O'Sullivan might outline the position at a macro level and then drill down into the respective areas.</p></speech>

If we look at the prevailing valuation levels in 1988 for industrial properties - I am talking about a typical factory unit, a typical warehouse and a typical workshop facility - and the levels we would have applied, we are applying similar levels today because that is what we see in the marketplace.  There is very little demand for industrial property throughout the State and the situation in Dublin versus places such as Waterford is very similar.  There has been little or no change since 1988.</p></speech>

I am talking in general terms.  One will always have unique situations or pockets where it is different, but, generally, that is what we are seeing.  Throughout the revaluations completed to date, since 1988 rental growth on industrial properties has occurred at much slower rate than in the case of retail or office properties.  Whether we are talking about south Dublin, Fingal, D&uacute;n Laoghaoire-Rathdown, Dublin city, Waterford or Dungarvan, retail rents are increasing, while industrial rents are pretty much static by reference to 1988 levels.  That is only one factor that affects-----</p></speech>

Rents have dropped, but rates are the key factor for many of them in making a business decision.  The danger is that businesses, particularly those on the high street - I see this happening in Limerick city - will be pushed over the edge in being revalued purely on a market value basis.  The new Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 provides for self-assessment.  Mr. Lavelle might guide me through that process.  Will there not be an appeals process?  There is the possibility that if we revalue based on market value alone for the retail sector, it will force many businesses to shut down.</p></speech>

If there is nothing on offer people will not come into the city centres.  Mr. Lavelle might tell me the constraints affecting his organisation in terms of the office's valuations, and the new legislation under which it operates.

I ask Mr. Lavelle to consider the person on O'Connell Street, William Street, Patrick Street or Roche's Street; if I omit some streets I will be killed.  Mr. Lavelle is nodding his head; I have no doubt he is familiar with Limerick city.  I am talking about the spine of the city, which runs from O'Connell Avenue down to Patrick Street, and all the streets off that.  I mentioned William Street, but there are also Roche's Street, Thomas Street and Patrick Street, which are all the areas that are vital to the heart of the city.  The retail sector is under phenomenal pressure.  I do not believe people realise the pressure it is under.  I want the people in that sector to stay in business.  I want to know if there is something we can do within the constraints that curtail Mr. Lavelle's office in terms of valuing the retail sector.  Obviously, the industrial side is more straightforward, but Mr. Lavelle might elaborate on that.</p></speech>

We must do that for every property.  The idea is that we produce a valuation list at the end of the day, that all the valuations are set by reference to the same date, and that there is a certain degree of equity and uniformity across the list.  That is what is required from us.</p><p>  Operationally, from a valuer's point of view, it is all about information.  It is all about getting in as much market information as we can.  We are very much at an early stage in Limerick.

We always form the view that the measures the Deputy has mentioned towards ameliorating some of the circumstances do not really belong properly in valuation legislation.  They belong elsewhere because they pertain to policy and to having scope to change that policy from time to time, whereas by its very nature, valuation law should be independent of all those economic circumstances.  However, as Mr. Lavelle noted in terms of how we do the job, it is all based on evidence and the first and most important source of evidence is the ratepayers themselves with regard to the quality of information they give back to us.  However, we also have access to other sources of information.  For example, we have access to the Revenue Commissioners e-Stamping database.  In addition, when it becomes available shortly, we will have access to the Property Services Regulatory Authority's new commercial leases database.  Both databases should be extremely informative and we should be able to cross-validate what we are getting on the ground versus what is coming through those transactions.</p></speech>

Is it 8%?  Obviously, it will take into account a number of factors to come up with what is a rental value but typically, what does the office regard as being the return?  From my recollection, the traditional, historical return was approximately 8%.  What does the Valuation Office now typically take as a rental return?</p></speech>

The situation obtained in which the Valuation Office came up with a valuation and there was an appeal at that stage.  Prior to 1988, one could then go on and appeal to the Circuit Court from the Valuation Office.  In 1988, the valuation tribunal, which is an independent separate body, was established and that took over the role of the court.  However, there still is provision for an appeal on a specific point of law to the High Court and on afterwards to the Supreme Court, if necessary.</p> <p>Under the current system, post-2001, there are three possibilities of interaction.  There is the representation stage, before the certificates are made final, which is where we are at in Dublin city and Waterford.  The certificates are finalised and the list is published.  Before the Bill becomes law, there is an appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation, that is, a formal process conducted internally within the Valuation Office.  Thereafter, one may go to the tribunal and on to the High Court and the Supreme Court on a point of law.  The proposal in the Bill is that the second stage, the appeal to the commissioner, would be removed on the basis that what was introduced in 2001 and what it is proposed to enlarge in the 2012 Bill provides adequate safeguards and the supports the ratepayer needs to be able to challenge the process and get his or her point of view and information across.</p></speech>

If someone receives a valuation from the Valuation Office and is not happy with it, can he or she appeal it to the appeals commissioner?</p></speech>

It is being done in the belief that the representation stage is probably more useful to the ratepayer and, possibly, also the Valuation Office, because it allows us to get to the heart of the matter more quickly.</p></speech>

If one is the hypothetical tenant and going to rent a shop on the main street, obviously, all these factors feed into the decision one will make in terms of the rental bid.  That is, essentially, what our valuers are trying to do - to get down to the details of the rental bid, strip away all of the incentives, inducements, advantages and disadvantages inherent in a traditional lease and say, "What would the rent be today on the open market where the tenant pays the rent, insures and maintains the building and pays rates?"</p></speech>

One can have two identical buildings side by side and because of the various negotiating strengths of a tenant, the rent levels might be slightly different.  From a valuation perspective, we tend to look at both and balance it out such that we actually have a standard level and a degree of equity inherent in the rating system on that street in order that one ratepayer does not have an advantage over another, or face a disadvantage.</p></speech>

The subhead for the tribunal has actually to do with the workings of the tribunal which is made up of a number of members who are appointed by the Minister.  There would typically be 20 persons on a panel for the tribunal - something of that order.  It would have to do with the expenses of running the tribunal over the course of the year.  There is a fee for the sitting of the tribunal.</p></speech>

I do not actually have to hand the date on which the rates were last reviewed, but, as far as I know, because they were subject to the 8% reduction that applied across the board to members sitting on boards of semi-State bodies, the same level of reduction would have applied to the tribunal's fees.</p></speech>

Under the legislation, the tribunal is required to have three members.  There will have to be a chairperson or a deputy who heads the tribunal and two other members.  The Valuation (Amendment) Bill 2012 is intended to provide that there will be more flexibility for sittings of the tribunal in order that it could sit with fewer than three members, or hold hearings by written submission only without necessarily having to sit, thus giving it the potential to be more efficient in its operation.</p></speech>

As a ratepayer, I notice that businesses generally throughout the country, particularly small businesses, are in serious difficulty.  The delegation has stated the person holding the lease or the person renting the property pays the insurance and the rates.  My experience of dealing with the SME sector and its information on leases suggests leases are not worth the paper they are written on and are generally just being held together in terms of the relationship with the landlord.  The landlord is now probably paying the rates and the insurance and this is affecting the level of rent, which is becoming increasingly lower.  This is a feature of the marketplace that the delegates must have discovered in their interaction with the sector, regardless of the county.  Will the witnesses comment on this?</p><p>  The office has stated the make-up of the rent, leases, etc., on a street is identified.  What about the streets in every city and county on which there are but a few shops open and quite a number of premises on which no rent or rates are being paid?  How is this factored in to the office's evaluation of the businesses on such a street?</p><p>  With regard to the subsequent occupier clause, whereby a new tenant becomes responsible for the previous tenant's unpaid rates, it is causing a problem throughout the country because it is making properties more difficult to rent.  The issue of previous tenants' rates not having been paid is beginning to emerge and becoming a problem in every county.</p><p>  Will the witnesses address these three issues?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.348" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Lavelle" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013071800014#O00900"><p>Consider my comment on the tenant paying the rent and insurance and for repairs and the maintenance of the building.  It has more to do with the fact that our definition of net annual value, as defined in the Valuation Act, assumes that the rent is the amount left after the tenant pays these outgoings.  If I am told the rent payer is paying &euro;100 per week and that, in addition, the landlord is paying the insurance and rates and maintaining the building, we would say that, under our definition of value, the &euro;100 per week is not the rent.  It is a figure less than this and we have to adjust it to reflect these outgoings.</p><p>  I agree with the Chairman on the reality of the marketplace; however, in terms of our deciding what a value is, it is not gross value that the landlord gets but essentially the net rent.  That is our definition of value.  Therefore, when we publish our new valuations in places such as Waterford, for example, and Limerick next year, we will actually be publishing the net annual value or net rental value.  That is the rental value we are putting on the property.</p><p>  Vacant properties on streets present a valuation challenge, about which there is no doubt.  Sometimes there is an extreme where there is so much vacant property on a street that it actually affects all values on that street.  Generally, thus far our experience is that we do obtain rental information and it is a question of analysing it when we get it and making the judgment call.</p><p>  On the third point to which the Chairman referred which concerns the subsequent occupier, sometimes the clause will lead to a property being vacant.  If one examines a number of properties on a street and asks why they are vacant, it may be a factor.  We receive additional information from the stamp duty people, etc., but it is much more challenging for valuers in a recession to value property because many market incentives and other factors must be accounted for by the valuers.  During the Celtic tiger period leases were much more standard, as were letting agreements.  Now we find they are bespoke.  However, that is a challenge to our valuers.  Ultimately, they must stand back and decide what property would be let for on the market, assuming it is vacant to let and the tenant is paying rent knowing that he or she must insure and maintain the building and pay the rates.  That is the statutory definition of value.</p></speech>

I will try to answer it for him and tell him what is happening: when tenants inherit a rates bill on renting a vacant property, the procedure is arbitrary from local authority to local authority.  Some local authorities are writing off the arrears in order that the town and county will not lose the business, while in other cases they are not.  It is completely piecemeal and there is no rhyme or reason to it whatsoever.  It is entirely subjective in respect of the local authority officials in a given authority.  They are taking it on themselves to write off arrears for fear of losing business.  That is what I have found.</p></speech>

When applying the "rate in the pound", as it was known by the councillors, or the county manager in bringing forward his or her rate every year, there is unevenness across the country.</p></speech>

The establishment of the ARV is a matter for them and rating legislation is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It is certainly true to say that the Government is very conscious of the impact of rates.  Various efforts have been made by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to exhort local authorities to maintain the ARV at or below the level of the previous year, and most local authorities have done that.  However, it is not a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to dictate to local authorities what the ARVs will be.</p></speech>

It is part of the issue that Deputy Deasy raised.  I understand the policy element of this, as well as the valuations and what local authorities do.  A solution to this for the country, including the SME sector, will not be established unless all the participants talk to one another.  There is a role for local government, the Valuation Office and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  If we ignore that by saying that it is a devolved function for members, we must examine that in terms of policy.  I know this is not a policy-making committee but the matter is affecting people and is part of the debate that was raised this morning by Deputy Deasy and Deputy O'Donnell.  We will have to find some way of delivering that message.</p></speech>

Obviously, Ms McLaughlin was not at the meeting I attended at the Department during the week.  It was acknowledged then that no one is spearheading this in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Taking those five Departments, it was felt that someone needed to spearhead this matter.  There was an acknowledgement that it needed to happen right now and that it would happen.</p><p>  The two critical Departments are the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I have some faith that the Government has now acknowledged that there was a dearth of leadership when it came to the issue internally in Government.  The interconnectivity between Departments was very poor when it came to thinking about issues that everybody had a stake in but no one was specifically tasked with.  The line Ministry was the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but that has changed in the last year.  There has been an indication that this is going to improve.</p></speech>

It is designed to provide speedy and flexible assistance to people who do not qualify for other scheme payments or who are awaiting decisions on claim applications under other income support schemes.  Supplementary welfare was formerly administered by the community welfare Services division of the HSE on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  In October 2011, the community welfare staff transferred to the Department, which now has direct responsibility for scheme administration.</p><p>  The assistance available consists of basic income support and a range of payments to cover certain living expenses that claimants may not be able to meet including urgent and exceptional needs payments.  Rent supplement and mortgage interest supplement are also elements of supplementary welfare.  Together with basic income support, these account for more than 80% of supplementary welfare expenditure.  These are the three elements covered in the report before the committee today.</p><p>  Each category of supplementary welfare examined has distinct target groups albeit with some overlaps.  In effect, they are different schemes administered within a common organisation structure.  Due to the different scheme risks and claimant profiles, the report recommended that the Department should treat them as separate schemes and that separate control policies should be developed for each.</p><p>  Three out of every four claims for basic income support relate to people who are awaiting decisions on applications under primary schemes such as jobseeker's allowance or disability allowance.  Expenditure on basic supplementary income support in 2011 was &euro;169 million after recoupment of around &euro;137 million from other schemes.  The Department's policy is to check interim supplementary welfare claims weekly.  The report recommended that an automated link should be established to trigger an immediate review of a claimant's basic supplementary income payment when a decision is made on an application under another scheme.  This should ensure that when decisions are made about the primary scheme applications, appropriate action is also taken promptly on supplementary income support including any required recoupment of interim payments.</p><p>  Rent supplement is an additional payment available under certain conditions to tenants in private rented accommodation who are in receipt of any social welfare or HSE payment or are on low incomes.  It is not restricted to those on supplementary income support.  Expenditure on rent supplement in 2011 was over &euro;500 million.  Almost 100,000 households were in receipt of support at end year.  While rent supplement was originally intended as a short-term support, many recipients depend on the scheme over the medium to long term.  At the end of 2011, more than half of the dependent households were in receipt of rent supplement for a year or more.  The duration of claims may be understated because claimants who change address may in some cases be recorded as new claims.  It would be preferable to measure the duration of claims based on length of household claim rather than length of tenancy.  The Department sets maximum eligible rent rates for the scheme by reference to the location of the property and the composition of the claimant's household.  In contrast, rents in the market are set by reference to property type.  For risk management purposes, it was recommended that the Department develop its scheme management system to record and analyse expenditure by household composition and the type and location of accommodation rented.  </p><p>  A review carried out by the Department in 2011 estimated that the rent supplement scheme was funding about 40% of all households in the private rental sector.  Analysis indicates that the maximum rent limits set by the Department have a significant influence on the rental market with evidence of many landlords using the rent supplement limits as benchmarks in setting rental prices in the respective areas.  As a result, the Department has potential to influence the residential rental market to a significant degree.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is also a significant market player through the rental accommodation scheme.  The Department carries out reviews of the maximum rent limits about every 18 months.  A review carried out at the end of 2011 resulted in reductions to the rent limits in almost all locations reflecting market decline in rents.  I understand that another market-based review has recently been completed resulting in further adjustments to rent limits.</p><p>  Controls are required to verify the accuracy of rental amounts paid by claimants because these determine the level of rent supplement that may be payable.  Scheme guidelines require claimants to provide evidence of their tenancy and of the amount of rent being paid but the examination found that such evidence was not on file in 80% of sample cases examined.  The Accounting Officer stated that additional staff training would be provided on the proper maintenance of records and that powers of enquiry have recently been granted to appropriate staff to request and oblige landlords to provide information in respect of rent supplement tenants.</p><p>  The Department rarely refuses to pay rent supplement on the grounds that the accommodation is not to an acceptable standard.  Staff administering the rent supplement scheme are not required to make a judgement on whether accommodation is of a suitable standard as they are not qualified to do so.  Staff can refuse to pay rent supplement where the Department has been notified by a local authority that the relevant accommodation standards are not being complied with.  If a notification relates to an existing claimant, the situation is discussed with the claimant and the Department staff attempt to act in the claimant's best interest.  Home visits by staff provide evidence that the claimant is living at the address they have stated and can also be used to assess the standard of accommodation and its suitability for the claimant's needs.  In two local offices visited, the examination team found very different approaches to the conduct of home visits.  In the Bishop's Square office in Dublin, all 15 cases examined had a home visit at claim award stage.  In contrast, the examination found that 14 of the 15 rent supplement claims examined in Galway had never been the subject of a home visit either when the claim was put into payment or at a later review stage.</p><p>  The discrepancy between offices in the home visit rates is striking and may reflect different legacy approaches taken in HSE regions.  Given the level of expenditure incurred and the vulnerability of many of those dependent on welfare assistance, it is important to ensure that accommodation of an acceptable standard is provided.  For that reason, the report recommends that occasional home visits to rent supplement recipients should be undertaken.  In cases where deficiencies in the standard of accommodation are evident, the Department staff should refer the accommodation to the relevant local authority for inspection.  Results of such referrals should be monitored and taken into account in reviews of claims.</p><p>  Mortgage interest supplement is paid to assist eligible households with the interest portion of their mortgage repayments.  The number of claimants increased from around 3,700 in 2007 to 18,700 in 2011.  Expenditure in 2011 was around &euro;67 million.  A review published by the Department in July 2010 confirmed that the overall objective of the mortgage interest supplement scheme remained valid but recommended a number of changes.  Legislation enacted in June 2012 provided that applicants must have secured alternative payment arrangements with lenders for at least 12 months prior to applying for mortgage supplement.  The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee in respect of other changes to the scheme and their impact on eligibility and expenditure levels.</p></speech>

I understand that the committee wishes to examine the chapter on supplementary welfare allowance in the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report for 2011.  As requested, I provided the committee with an update on the conclusions contained in this chapter.</p><p>  In 2013, the Department will spend &euro;20.243 billion on a wide range of schemes, services and administration.  It is estimated that almost &euro;718 million will be spent on supplementary welfare allowance schemes this year.  The committee will be aware that there have been significant changes in the management and administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme within the last two years with the transfer of the community welfare service and some 1,000 staff from the HSE to the Department on 1 October 2011.</p><p>  As chapter 24 of the Comptroller's annual report confirms, the total scheme expenditure on supplementary welfare allowance in 2011 was &euro;911 million.  As the committee will see from the material I have provided, the provisional outturn figure for the scheme for 2012 is &euro;787 million.  I and my staff in the Department are very aware of the responsibility we carry in ensuring the proper disbursement of Government funding.</p></speech>

The economic downturn, which began in 2008, caused huge problems for, and placed huge demands on, the social welfare system across all its schemes and services. That peaked in 2010 and 2011.  Many of the schemes we provide are demand-led and, therefore, if somebody meets the eligibility criteria, he or she qualifies for payment.  It is not a question of the scheme being budget capped.  The person who meets the eligibility criteria will receive the payment involved.  In 2010 and 2011, because of process difficulties the Department experienced across a wide range of primary scheme areas, there was increased recourse to supplementary welfare payments.  That demand not alone translated into claims on our primary schemes but also to claims for BASI payments while people awaited a decision on their primary payment.</p></speech>

Beyond this being plausible in a general sense, however, the Department has no means of tracking.  Obviously, the Department's figures show quite a dramatic drop of over &euro;200 million in supplementary welfare allowance over two years in times that are still extremely tough for people.  From a systems point of view, does Ms O'Donoghue have any other information other than those general observations?  Does she see what I am getting at?</p></speech>

As the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out, supplementary welfare allowance is a broad brush that applies across a significant number of schemes, the big three being the three that are the subject of the report here.  What we track is the number of applicants and recipients, and changes in the eligibility for the scheme also have an impact in terms of the expenditure levels.  It is both the claimant numbers and the actual level of support that is being provided, one way or another, and whether that is made up through their increased contribution or whether it is that the eligibility criteria have tightened, as in the case of mortgage interest supplement, for example.</p></speech>

I know there has been some improvement in respect of some schemes.  However, I am sure other Deputies might also verify that, increasingly, there is a view among the population that when a person makes an application for a payment, the first instinct of the system is to refuse, and the person is then into an appeals process.  My own evidence, which is subjective and entirely unscientific, is that this is increasingly the case.  Yet, Ms O'Donoghue said "we have got our act together" in terms of the primary schemes and, therefore, this has alleviated the spend.</p></speech>

I appreciate there may be a perception that there is a higher rate of disallowance now than there was, but that is not necessarily the case.  Obviously, across a number of our schemes, a higher number of people are applying, so there might be more people not meeting the criteria because there is a greater number of applicants.  There is no doubt, however, and we can absolutely show, that our ability to process primary claims speedily has a direct impact on recourse to BASI.</p></speech>

The INOU will tell Ms O'Donoghue, as my own experience tells me, that very often jobseekers find a very disjointed, sometimes very confusing and sometimes misleading - I use the word advisedly - system when they present themselves.  Is she aware of that?</p></speech>

However, I would make two distinctions.  First, the Intreo service is about integrating the service provision.  It is about bringing together the community welfare service, the employment services and the income support services, and being able to deal with somebody in a holistic way.  There are elements of that service in terms of integrated decision making and customer profiling, and, certainly, we can take the first steps of activation even in advance of physical changes of infrastructure, and we are doing that - hence the reference to the 28 offices and the fact we will be rolling out the service elements of Intreo to all our local offices by the end of the year.</p><p>  There is a longer lead-in time where we need to change the physical infrastructure.  In some cases, we have to relocate staff, acquire new offices, close down certain offices and bring staff together in a new configuration to try to make sense of customer engagement.  We are working very closely with the OPW to deliver that.</p><p>  We work very closely with the INOU and talk to its representatives very regularly in regard to its experience with us.  Certainly, the INOU would wish us to be able to progress more quickly but, generally, where we have the integrated service in place, there is very good feedback from the recipients of that service.</p></speech>

Somebody would come in to make a claim in the Department of Social Protection, complete their paperwork and give us the claim details.  Having provided all of that, they might have had some expectation that they would get a decision within a couple of weeks from the Department.  If they had immediate income need, they would have been told they had to go and see the community welfare officer, and they would get assessed there and then and get paid BASI, probably within a couple of days.  Having the integrated decision teams in place in the Department more or less guarantees that the person will now have a decision within a day or two, certainly within a week.</p></speech>

With regard to rent supplement, how does Ms O'Donoghue account for the lack of home visits which has been identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.397" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh O'Donoghue" time="12:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013071800020#U00100"><p>There are a number of different elements and the Comptroller and Auditor General has raised the issue of suitability and standards of accommodation.  The community welfare service officers are not responsible for gauging or monitoring the quality of the accommodation because the tenancy agreement is effectively an agreement between the tenant and the landlord and is a private contract to which the Department is not party.  Our view on home visits is that the person from the community welfare service or the social welfare inspector should have the opportunity to visit a premises where such a visit might be warranted.  As in the response I provided already, we have taken legal powers to reinforce and extend the facility available to inspectors to visit accommodation, but it is more about ensuring the terms of the scheme are abided by rather than the quality of the accommodation.  I am very conscious other State agencies are involved in this, such as the Private Residential Tenancies Board and the local authorities, and we work closely with them.</p><p>  What was pointed out by the Comptroller and Auditor General were inconsistencies in practice throughout various regions.  We have put together a working group in the Department comprising staff who were previously involved in the community welfare service with a view to looking at and trying to standardise practice where it is appropriate and issue guidelines to staff so there is clarity on what is expected of them in terms of dealing with claims.</p></speech>

Unfortunately until recently all of the State agencies and some local authorities stood off this issue.  Whatever about giving good practice to the Department's people working in the area what about the bigger picture of knitting together the efforts of the various State agencies to ensure they are not shelling out considerable sums of money, for slums in some cases, to very dishonourable landlords?</p></speech>

There is no getting away from the responsibility of the local authorities.  We have good communication links with local authorities, and where local authorities determine that accommodation is substandard we are given this information which informs our decision on whether rent supplement is granted.</p></speech>

However I must be mindful of what our relationship is, which is providing an income support towards meeting a housing need for the individual rather than assessing the standard of accommodation.  Absolutely we should, and do, play a full role if we are aware of accommodation not being of good standard and ensuring those who have the appropriate powers take action can do so.  Where we are aware there is a problem we will not sanction payment of rent supplement.  This is a moving feast because the purpose of rent supplement was supposed to be a very short-term income support.</p></speech>

It is not acceptable to have people literally living in kips with the State shelling out money and agencies with responsibilities looking the other way.  Working on a case by case basis is all very well and good, but to address the issue in any significant way there needs to be a much tighter framework and consideration.</p><p>  Ms O'Donoghue stated the Department reviews rent limits and is mindful of market conditions.  Is the Department mindful of the fact many people - I do not have a figure - in receipt of this payment are topping up to an enormous extent to keep a roof over their heads?  Ms O'Donoghue made the point the Department is not party to the contract between the tenant and the landlord and this is true, but in recent times it has written regularly to people telling them the threshold has dropped and they must negotiate the matter with the landlord.  I accept the political and budgetary decisions are not the Department's, and the blame for them lies squarely at the Government's feet, but is Ms O'Donoghue aware of the hardship this causes for people in vulnerable situations who are sent off to negotiate again and again a downward reduction in their rent?  It is entirely within the landlord's prerogative to say "No", which leaves the person concerned potentially homeless.</p></speech>

The primary interest of our service is with the individual at the centre of the service, and it is to protect the rights of this individual.  If the rent limits are reduced, it is in line with the market at the prevailing time.  Any suggestion somebody should renegotiate is in the context of the market conditions which prevail.  Where this negotiation is not successful, as the Deputy mentioned, and the landlord refuses to reduce rent, our service will work closely with the tenant to secure alternative accommodation.</p></speech>

From 17 June this year, that rate increased to &euro;850 per month.  Across the spectrum, the lowest increase was &euro;20 for a couple sharing, whereas other increases were in the order of &euro;45, &euro;50 or, in some instances, &euro;75.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned top-ups, which can arise in two circumstances.  First, if someone is entitled to rent supplement but the primary scheme under which he or she receives a payment allows him or her to earn an income, an agreement is possible whereby the individual can stay in accommodation of a higher standard if he or she is in a position to make an adjustment to the rent supplement.  That is perfectly legitimate.  As the Deputy referenced and has been alleged to us, under-the-counter top-ups are being made in some instances.  This is not within the confines of the scheme and forms part of the reason our inspectorate has additional powers to query rent information with landlords.  It is also why we have data exchanges with the Private Residential Tenancies Board and the Revenue Commissioners, providing for a multi-agency approach to this potential problem.</p><p>  Second, we will pay above the rent limit in certain instances.  For example, if accommodation has been adapted for someone with a disability and the rent is higher, the community welfare officer has discretion to pay above the rent limit.</p><p>  While limits are in place for the majority of tenancies, some exceptions are acceptable within the confines of the scheme.  If there is evidence to suggest top-ups are happening outside the scheme, we would be interested in receiving that information.</p></speech>

Ms O'Donoghue could go online or read the <i>Evening Herald</i> and see this for herself.  I accept that, in the final analysis, it is a political decision for the Government to recognise that people cannot spirit quality accommodation for themselves and their families out of nowhere on a shoestring.  Asking them to negotiate to and fro with their landlords is an abuse of the people concerned.</p><p>  I have a final point.  Will Ms O'Donoghue discuss direct provision for asylum seekers?  She will be aware of a case involving a woman who, having applied for supplementary welfare allowance, was unsuccessful.  Her appeal was successful, yet the allowance was not paid to her.  She went through the entire system and received damages as a result.  Ms Emily Logan, the children's ombudsman, had much to say about this issue last week.  Is Ms O'Donoghue in a position to reassure us that there are no other such cases?  As the woman in question had arrived in the State prior to the 2009 legislation, she had an entitlement.  It was refused and then granted but wilfully ignored.  This raises a concern about the system, its decision-making structures, the culture of the organisation and the attitude of some but not all individuals within it.</p></speech>

The sequence of events, including the failure to comply with the appeal's decision, happened before the service formally transferred to the Department in 2011.  We have been trying to ensure greater consistency, bearing in mind that the community welfare services were operating out of more than 700 locations and numbered approximately 1,000 staff when we took them over.  While respecting the discretion of community welfare officers to deal with the situations that presented, we wanted to bring to bear the Department's principles, values and experience in trying to ensure consistency and adherence to legislation and statutory entitlements.  A great deal of work has been undertaken in terms of providing training supports, workshops and the development of guidelines in order that people can be clearer about their roles and responsibilities.  Unfortunately, I cannot give the Deputy an absolute guarantee, but I am confident that we have taken many measures to try to ensure such issues do not arise again.  If we become aware of any, we will do our best to resolve it as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

Some of the experience gained in having an holistic focus on young people and seeing what we could do with the Ballymun initiative will inform our thinking on the national plan which we are required to develop by the end of this year.  In other words, every member state has been asked to formulate specific plans for the youth guarantee and bring them to the European Union by the end of the year with a view to a full programme being rolled out from 2014 and 2015.</p></speech>

That is a much more positive experience than can be seen across Europe, so much so that a number of other countries have asked for details of the scheme and are seeking to learn from our experience in that regard.  There has been much analysis and reporting in recent years on progression rates under the community employment scheme, for example, and they do not necessarily recognise that the community employment scheme potentially satisfies a number of aspects.  It absolutely provides a vehicle for people to receive training and gain experience to allow them to progress, but in other instances, it can satisfy a social or community need that may not necessarily have the aspiration of progression.  We must recognise that there are a number of strands in that respect.</p><p>  We are aware of and try to track or improve analysis of the continuing significant churn on the live register, with significant numbers coming on and off the register every month and year.  People move for a variety of reasons, with approximately one third going back to employment, which might be short or long-term.  In other cases, people move off the register in order to take up a training place or avail of an educational opportunity.  Others move off the register in order to take an opportunity abroad, or they may sign off because they no longer meet conditions of the scheme.  We certainly hope to try to improve our ability to report on the issue, but it is complicated.  Given the degree of churn, it is very difficult to make absolute assessments of what does or does not work.  We must try to do this over time and consider our experience, as well as what is happening internationally.</p></speech>

This gateway programme is targeted at long-term unemployed persons becoming involved in the scheme.  It is not in every instance that the person might necessarily progress to employment.  We must try to satisfy a number of elements.  For example, we must keep people as close to the labour market as possible and try to ensure they can access the appropriate skills or training that might enhance their ability to secure employment.  We should also recognise that there are a number of people, particularly in vulnerable positions, who may never be able to work in a commercial market, where assistance and engagement are required.  Support is needed for such cases.</p></speech>

There is conditionality attached to rent supplement.  That is why the decision on the housing assistance payment will be different.  In a sense, these are policy issues and the Government has clearly outlined policy in that direction.  The expectation is to try to remove that disincentive to engagement by moving people to the housing assistance payment.</p></speech>

It was caused by a failure to provide enough council housing over the years.  Does the Department monitor the number of rental properties available?

I am concerned that there is insufficient examination of rental properties where State money is paid to cover the rent.  I was glad to hear the Secretary General say there was some sort of review group.  It is important that robust proposals result from the process because substandard housing is a serious problem.  One or two estates in my constituency have been seriously dragged down.  In one estate 70% of the houses are rented out and some of them are in an appalling state, but most of the tenants receive rent supplement.  I am appalled that our money goes towards renting substandard properties.  Can the Secretary General do anything more to alleviate my fears about the damage caused in renting substandard housing?</p></speech>

My Department is charged with trying to support an individual through the provision of income support.  We are not responsible for standards of housing; other agencies have that responsibility.  It behoves us to work as closely as possible with the agencies involved to ensure there is communication and synergy between the two.  That means that if we become aware that accommodation is substandard, we take the appropriate action to make sure others are aware of it and there are health and safety or local authority inspections, as required.</p></speech>

Given that so much State money is being invested, it would be far better to ensure better outcomes.  For example, there is a view that no more than 30% of houses in a private estate should be rented.  We should try to maintain that proportion.</p><p>  I have further queries.  I have read the report and it seems that there were few rental agreements in place.  Why?  How can the matter be rectified?</p></speech>

One of the things we have said is that there are a number of aspects where we need to have proof of tenancy and have it on file for further examination.  Again, it is an item at which the working group has been looking and in terms of the training provided for the community welfare officers on the consistency of records, files and necessary documentation to be kept.  We are having regard to the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendation.  One of the points to bear in mind is that it is ideal to have the tenancy agreement.  However, it may not always be the tenancy agreement but something that gives us information of similar standard.  We keep some documentary evidence on file.  We take the matter seriously and it forms part of the working group's agenda.</p></speech>

Perhaps we referenced this in the documentation returned to the committee.  The claim form requires the landlord to give us far greater information on the property than ever before.

Therefore, I really need to put pressure on councils to do something about the matter.</p><p>  Disruptive tenants are a problem.  Social housing was never meant to be a long-term option and I know this it is not always done as successfully as either the county councils or I would like.  There is a system in place to deal with anti-social tenants.  In some instances involving private rented accommodation, it can be appallingly difficult to make progress in dealing with anti-social tenants.  The lives of other residents who may be tenants or owner-occupiers can be made hell in certain instances.  I can cite half a dozen cases where people in my constituency are going through hell.  For example, there are serious drug dealers who are willing to endanger the lives of others.  The other residents are terrified of protesting and believe they cannot use the PRTB's mechanism.  This issue must be tackled.</p></speech>

The rent supplement scheme involves a contract between the Department and the individual, but the contract between the individual and the landlord is separate.  Nobody wants to see a situation where the State subsidises somebody who is engaged in socially unacceptable behaviour.</p></speech>

Where a housing authority has provided housing to an individual and rent supplement is being paid, we are empowered to suspend or disqualify rent supplement.  The best way of creating this as part of the agreement is when the longer term accommodation arrangements move into the new structure being put in place, the housing assistance payment, HAP.</p></speech>

It is an issue in my constituency but not to the same degree as in hers.  Social welfare officers have drawn my attention to the inconsistency in some of the amounts payable.  For example, a couple in my area are entitled to a higher level of rent subsidy than the equivalent of two single people.  I forget the exact rate but there is some &euro;100 in difference between what a couple receives as opposed to two single people.  They drew that to my attention as being a problem for some people.</p></speech>

It is a difficult matter to examine.  Some work has been done on this and it has improved the situation but we should keep a close eye on whether levels of rent subsidy are appropriate around the country.  One of my colleagues spoke about the difference between rent supplement in north Kildare and south Kildare and how levels need to be higher.  The point has been taken on board to some degree but needs to be constantly watched because there are likely to be changes in that situation.</p></speech>

We started on the theme of how State agencies can operate in concert.  A number of people have an interest in the area.  We have an interest in terms of rent supplement, the PRTB has an interest in recording rents that are actually paid and the requirement on people to declare what is being paid to the PRTB, and the Revenue Commissioners have an interest in terms of what is being declared as income by the landlord.  There are significant data exchanges between the three bodies at this stage and it allows us to identify inconsistencies in the information provided.  In addition, we have taken powers and our inspectors have greater powers to visit landlords, even though our contracts are not with landlords, to verify the information in support of the rent agreement.  We will be doing so and some of the visits have already taken place.  We tend to use those resources in a targeted way.  If there is information about a particular area where there is a problem, we will welcome it.</p></speech>

Control savings are payments that would have arisen had an intervention not occurred.  An intervention stops something, such as the continuation of a claim or a claim being put in payment or matching information that changes what people are entitled to.  Some of that is fraud, some is error and some is people not declaring changes in circumstances.  They may have forgotten or deliberately omitted to do so.

We are dealing with this on the ground every day of the week.  The vast majority of people getting social welfare payments go about it in the normal way.  Many of them are struggling and are under an awful lot of pressure.  However, there are abuses of the system.  For example, 84,000 people were on rent supplement at the end of June this year.  What is the average length of time a person is on rent supplement?  Is it six months, a year, two years or three years?</p><p>  The majority of people on rent supplement are totally above board but have fallen on difficult times.  However, there is a very small cohort of people who crop up all the time - I am sure it is the same in every constituency - and they move from house to house.  The landlords are as culpable as the tenants because they are renting dives and hovels.  These people wreak havoc when they move into a neighbourhood.  We cannot pull the rent supplement because it is not our role.  We are making a payment to the tenant; we are only a conduit providing the funding to pay the rent.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why the rent is not paid directly to the landlord, so he or she is held in some way accountable.</p><p>  As Ms O'Donoghue is probably well aware, RAS has, by and large, worked for myriad reasons.  Invariably, there are proper controls and the houses are of a very good standard.  However, a small group causes untold havoc with the rent supplement scheme.  The same names crop up all the time.  It is unfair to the reputation of the scheme and to the people availing of it and it gives them a bad name.  I have a major problem with that.  For some reason, they appear to be able to abuse the scheme.  I have no doubt this is nothing new to Ms O'Donoghue and she has heard it before but it appears to continue.  One could pull rent supplement based on perhaps Garda reports and one could pay the rent supplement directly to the landlord.  Something must be done.  Is this new to Ms O'Donoghue?</p></speech>

Everybody recognises that it is in a space currently in which it was never intended to be.  I welcome the Deputy's comments about the success of RAS, which provides further evidence that where accommodation needs are regulated and monitored, through the housing authorities, that is the appropriate way to deal with it.</p></speech>

They stay on rent supplement in the long term.  The scheme at that level is open to abuse.</p></speech>

That inevitably will have to make changes to the rent supplement scheme.  Some of the issues we have become alive to over the past number of years will have to feature in any consideration of that.</p><p>  To correct the record, when the Deputy asked me earlier how many assistant secretaries there were in the Department, I could not remember, which is appalling.  There are 13 members of the management board, which includes ten assistant secretaries. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.519" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013071800025#Z01000"><p>I take Ms O'Donoghue's point about the principal officers.  For the general public and for the vast majority of people who are claiming social welfare in the normal way, it does them a disservice.  There is a perception that we have not got to grips with fraud.  I would like to hear someone on the airwaves from the Department of Social Protection at assistant secretary level, who is heading up fraud, saying it is great if people are complying with the terms laid down.</p><p>  However, side by side with the ordinary person who is on basic social welfare and who is barely getting by, there is an abuse of the system in various areas.  Where people engage in anti-social behaviour and move from house to house, through rent supplement, and terrorise neighbours, that is an abuse of the system and it must be stopped.  I would have thought the wherewithal was in Ms O'Donoghue's Department.</p><p>  The CWOs do great work on the ground but they are curtailed in what they can do.  I have brought this up before and I will do so again.  When one gets a representation that there is a problem with a particular house, the occupant of which is in receipt of rent supplement, the Department could bring in the person and contact the landlord to ask what is going on.  If the garda&iacute; have been called, account could be taken of that and the rent supplement could be withdrawn until such time as the person agrees to normal standards of behaviour.  I do not think that is too much to ask.  Perhaps I am different from other colleagues, but I am hearing that it is an ongoing problem and that it never seems to go away.  With a small amount of goodwill and effort by the Department at local level, in terms of the procedural rules, it would make a difference to the operation of the rent supplement scheme on the ground for a tiny cohort but it would have major positive ramifications for people living in those areas.  Will Ms O'Donoghue look into that matter? </p><p>  It is something about which I feel strongly because it comes up so often.  Side by side with that is the extremely important matter of ensuring landlords are not letting houses under the rent supplement scheme which are hugely substandard.  Once again, there is a commonality between the landlords and the tenants.  The same landlords crop up as do the same tenants.  It is just too frequent.  If I ignored this issue I would not be doing my job as a public representative.  Will Ms O'Donoghue look at putting-----</p></speech>

That inevitably means that we will have to look again at how we configure rent supplement-----</p></speech>

In doing that, I think we need to look again at how we can take on board the restructuring of rent supplement in a way that might take some of the issues raised by the Deputy into consideration.  We have to be aware that this will fundamentally alter the nature of the scheme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.523" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013071800026#AA00200"><p>We need to look at the reality of what will happen when the 80,000 people who are on rent supplement are moved and differentiated.  The good and normal people who are on that scheme will be moved on because it will be easy to accommodate them.  The Department will be left with the cohort I am talking about.  They will be left on the former rent supplement scheme unless the Department provides for certain controls, for example, by holding over or withdrawing the rent supplement.  I accept that the Department does that on some occasions.  When that happens, the tenant and the landlord should be pulled in and the Garda reports should be taken into account.  People are perfectly entitled to stay on so long as they behave by normal standards, but that is not what is happening.  Can I take it that the Department will look at that?  The housing assistance payments scheme, which is a variation on the rental assistance scheme, will end up being taken over and looked after by the local authorities, rather than by the Department.  I am talking about now.  I would have thought that the Department, rather than saying there is nothing it can do about this matter, would have the wherewithal to issue a directive at local level to ensure it is taken seriously.</p></speech>

I think the Department has been engaged in quarterly meetings with the troika.  We have serviced those meetings along with our colleagues from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance and other Departments.  There is a significant engagement by the Department every time the troika comes to visit.  Three different areas are generally discussed as part of that.  The first area of focus is the financial outlook for social welfare expenditure, which accounts for such a substantial element of Government expenditure.  It involves an examination of whether what is actually happening on the ground mirrors what had been estimated or projected to happen.  That process relates not only to social welfare expenditure, but also to PRSI income because that is the other side of the coin in terms of social welfare expenditure.  The second area of focus tends to relate to activation measures and the commitments that were made in Pathways to Work.  That process, which gives rise to a great deal of discussion of what might be possible, involves looking at trends in the live register and some of the issues I mentioned earlier in response to Deputy McDonald, such as the institutional reform that is required to bring the organisations and the services together in order to roll out the Intreo programme.</p></speech>

That is part of the Government's agenda anyway.  It is not just a matter of troika interest.  It also involves engaging much more quickly with customers who need activation support and help and putting in place the kinds of resources and mechanisms that enable us to engage with customers as quickly as we can.  Reference has been made to the question of whether the best way to make sure courses are designed to meet the demand we are seeing from our customers is to focus on community employment or to develop links with SOLAS and the educational training boards.  All of that is in the activation space.  There is a great deal of interest in that.  There have been many detailed discussions about what we are positioned to do, what we are capable of doing, what our plans are and whether we are achieving the targets we have set out to achieve.  The third area of focus tends to relate to the question of structural changes in the social welfare system.  There has been a particular focus on payments to people of working age.  Equally, there has been a focus on the housing assistance payment, which we have just been talking about, in light of its role and the role of rent supplement.</p></speech>

We have been able to demonstrate that a great deal of work is being done and attention is being paid in order to meet the agendas that have been set out.

We have a few hundred.  We know there is great interest in various efforts in areas throughout the country.  As the Deputy is probably aware, we have employer engagement teams as part of the integrated service we now have in place.  We have an employer engagement division.  Specific people in each of our local divisions are responsible for engaging with employers.  I will set out what we are doing at the moment in the context of the JobsPlus scheme.  We are alerting employers to the availability of the scheme.  We are encouraging dialogue about what the circumstances might be and what the reward is.

In 2012, a figure of &euro;52.7 million was paid out for that.  While that is a significant figure, it is important to note that it has dropped consistently since 2008, under almost every heading.  This is good.  On the general scheme, how is the money for exceptional and urgent needs paid out?</p></speech>

A degree of discretion is involved for the officer with regard to how that claim is validated and paid.  We have done considerable work in this area since the community welfare service became part of the Department in 2011.  A group of former community welfare officers looked at the range and scope of payments being made around the country and came up with guidelines for guiding principles to inform officers.  However, it is critical to be aware that officers still have discretion.</p></speech>

A person will come into the office, sit down face to face with the officer and go through the exceptional circumstances that require the payment.  That officer will then, based on his or her judgment of the situation, make a call regarding payment.</p></speech>

Payments are also made for household repairs and maintenance, funeral and burial expenses and confinement costs for attending hospital.</p></speech>

Therefore, one can see at a glance what the customer has received over the past number of years on the payment system.</p></speech>

I apologise if I have cut Mr. Shannon off in coming in to respond here.  One advantage of the system is that because of the way this information is now being recorded, the community welfare officer or the person providing the service can assess a situation if somebody re-presents a case.  We have a record on the system as to when payments were made.  Therefore, if the person re-presents in a different office, the record is on the system and we know we have already made a payment.</p><p>  Significant change has taken place since the scheme came to the Department and what we are talking about here is about the structures and controls we have put in place since 2011.  Progress continues on that.</p></speech>

Can she get that breakdown also?</p></speech>

The entire purpose of a scheme like this is to allow an officer exercise discretion.  However, within that, we must ensure that we continue to review and assess what is happening on the ground and whether there is consistency in the way in which that discretion is being applied.  That should not be contradictory.</p></speech>

While all of the staff involved in administering the scheme operate out of local offices, we have a central policy unit in Sligo which constantly monitors expenditure and performance on the scheme across the country.</p></speech>

One area of reform has received significant attention over recent years.  When we got the group of community welfare officers to look at what was happening on the ground in regard to exceptional needs, it became clear there were very divergent practices, particularly with regard to paying people for first communion expenses.  In some areas of the country there was no history or track record of exceptional needs payments being made for these, but in others modest or large payments were made.  The group then came up with a view as to what might be appropriate and this was rolled out in 2012.  This was changed again at the end of 2012 and now there is no specific provision for religious services.  However, there is still discretion to make a payment for clothing.  An officer can make a judgment in that regard, but within the guidelines that exist.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.595" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1034" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013071800028#CC00100"><p>The total being spent in this area in 2010 was just under &euro;70,000 which dropped to just over &euro;50,000 in 2012.  That is a considerable drop.  That has come from a mixture of the kind of work about which Ms O'Donoghue was talking, where officials look at different practices and investigate why they are happening, but is it also because of what the Department's fraud and detection unit has been doing also?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.596" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh O'Donoghue" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013071800028#CC00200"><p>There is obviously a heightened focus on control now that the community welfare service is part of the Department.  We have three principal objectives.  The first is to pay people what they are entitled to be paid; the second is to activate people of working age - if that is an appropriate verb to use - and the third is to apply controls in order that the right person receives the right amount of money.  There is that tripartite focus across all of our activities.</p><p>  By their very nature, exceptional needs payments occur by exception.  They are demand-led and there is no budget cap.  They are for unforeseen expenses and even the weather can have an impact, in terms of whether it is an urgent needs payment.  During instances of flooding, it is precisely this service that was on the ground to provide immediate support for people who faced expenses in that regard.</p></speech>

As it is now part of the Department and the staff operating the scheme are part of it, the expertise, history and tradition of the Department, in terms of how it informs income support, are brought to bear on the scheme in a much closer way than would previously have been possible.  We have standardised where it has proved possible to standardise.  However, I am mindful of the fact that discretion has to be part of that service and that is held dear by those who traditionally worked in the service.</p></speech>

The first is new accommodation kit and I take it someone can apply for that only once.</p></speech>

Had it been taking place in any other country, we might have had a difficulty finishing it by the end of June.</p><p>  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person in the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I apologise for the late change of venue to Room 2 in Leinster House.  There was a little bit of uncontrollable water in our normal committee room, despite the dry weather.  I understand this is quite a historic table, as it is a table that was previously used by the Cabinet.</p></speech>

In terms of how the available money is distributed, it is important that the committee is not presented with a <i>fait accompli</i> but is engaged throughout the process.  The Minister stated that he did not want any dramatic shock.  The first day this issue was discussed, I stated that the changes should be introduced over time.  There have been dramatic shocks for farmers in the past five years while we and the Minister were in government.  For many farmers, rural environment protection scheme, REPS, payments exceeded the single farm payment and the disadvantaged area payment combined.  When it came to an abrupt end and was replaced by the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, many people could not access any scheme, resulting in a significant loss to farmers in every county who had been receiving substantial REPS payments.  The idea that there have been no shocks is not borne out by reality.</p></speech>

There have already been dramatic shocks that we need to address.  It is good that a minimum payment was included, but my understanding is that &euro;103 million must be realised as a result.  The Minister has been working on figures, so I will work on the 2010 numbers on the basis of which the &euro;103 million figure is calculated.  They do not include deductions for young farmers, the national reserve, etc.  We are discussing redistribution.</p><p>  The next question is how to remove the money from farmers above the national average.  We are not discussing something that will happen in 2015, but the endgame in 2019.  There must be objective reasons for taking money from one group versus another.  The system must be as objectively fair as possible by 2019.</p><p>  The Minister has made available figures on stocking density per hectare - this is a fair reflection of productivity and is the best we will get - for everyone but tillage farmers.  Using this as a measure, we should try to bring farmers in a similar output category - as we do not know individual outputs, we cannot work on that basis - to the same level of payment by 2019.  There is no reason to pay someone more in 2019 just because he or she received many grants in 2000.  It would be more logical to connect payment to average output per hectare of the relevant cohort.  This would lead to a fairer single payment system, as the current system is riddled with inconsistencies and there is no relationship between productivity and euro per hectare.  This is important, as many farmers in the 350-450 ha bracket are productive.  I do not know why they should be penalised because of history as opposed to a rational reason.</p><p>  Will the Minister confirm whether regionalisation is off the agenda?</p></speech>

While I am encouraged, I am also at a loss to understand the proposed consultation process.  From my understanding of the Minister's comments, he hopes to undertake it this autumn.  That seems to be a short timeframe for maximum consultation.  Will he outline how he hopes to do it?  He stated that he would accept written submissions as well as open public debate.</p><p>  What we are about to undertake before 2019 and 2020 will determine the viability of small and medium-sized farmers in particular.  How the budget is shared out will determine their survival.  The negotiations have allowed the Minister certain flexibilities.</p><p>  I welcome the young farmer and generational change aspects.  The top-up for young farmers is to be encouraged.  It is a step forward and will be of considerable help from the point of view of generational change.</p><p>  The Minister mentioned moving to an open-market approach.</p></speech>

Many people will welcome the abolition of the milk quota system and the move into the open market.  However, I am concerned that only the strong will survive and the weak will perish.  I hope I am wrong.</p><p>  I welcome the opportunity presented by the abolition of the sugar quota for Irish farmers to resume production of sugar beet.  This is dependent on the provision of a facility by the private market.  The Minister stated that, if it were to happen, a processing centre would have to come from the private sector.  Will consideration be given to State support in this regard?  It was always a great industry.  For many, it was a good cash payment at Christmas.  They depended on it.  I welcome the opportunities that will be offered.</p><p>  I look forward to the consultation process, which should be open to everyone.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v will concur that many meetings in the west heard of dissatisfaction with the way in which the previous CAP regime was operated.  The move towards convergence will depend on the flexibility shown by the Government.</p><p>  I look forward to working with everyone for the common good - that is, for all farmers.  The Minister stated that 60,000 farmers would gain up to 30% from convergence.</p></speech>

The Minister also mentioned flexibility in coupling.  Will he elaborate?  No one wants people to get money for nothing.  There was a gap, in that it was not just the small, weak farmer who availed of it.  Reasonable coupling should be considered.</p></speech>

People will approach us.  I appreciate that the Minister wants to consult in phases, but the early autumn deadline for Pillar 1 is short.  If he has a date in mind, it would be easier for us not to misguide people on when the moment will pass.</p><p>  The Minister stated that the sugar issue would be a purely commercial decision.  Is that set in stone?  It is strong language.  Only private enterprise will be involved.</p></speech>

Our own group had a meeting with the Minister when he came back from Brussels with the deal and I said I would hold a public meeting in my area, which I did.  I was asked specific questions which I e-mailed to the Minister's officials.  The biggest issue arising is land.  The land system in Ireland is very complicated, whether the land is leased, rented or owned, as is the transfer of land and the transfer of entitlements.  I do not know whether the Minister or his officials are expert enough to deal with specific issues.  I would welcome a meeting with somebody who is an expert in that area because we all have specific issues in regard to land which has no entitlements.  Does that receive the minimum payment now?  Who owns the entitlements to land that is leased?  Is it the owner or the farmer who has been farming it for the past seven or five years?  I do not want to go into specifics but I would welcome it if the Minister would make an official available to the committee to go through aspects such as that.  We would all be better informed, because those are the questions we are being asked.</p><p>  I welcome the measures in regard to young farmers.  If we are to achieve the Food Harvest 2020 targets, we must make a big issue of getting more young people involved in farming.  I agree with Deputy Deering that we will have to provide an incentive at the other end to try to get people to move out of, or to retire from, farming and let younger people take over.  I do not know whether it could be done through Pillar 2, but we should look at a scheme.  </p><p>  I will welcome the consultation process and I hope this committee will play a very active role in it.  I was very alarmed last week to see a headline in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> stating that penalties are up by 500% in the past three or four years.  That is frightening people.  It is easy to forget, given the weather we have had over the past three weeks, that farming has had its toughest 18 months, and to see a headline like that and money being taken from people is frightening.  I know there is the issue of cross-compliance and so on, but a headline like that does not do any good.  With a new scheme coming in, we must ensure it is farmer-friendly in terms of how one applies for it and how one stays within the guidelines.  If it is too complicated, it will frustrate people and their livelihoods could be affected if they face penalties.  When the new scheme is devised, it should be farmer-friendly in regard to how farmers must comply with everything.  We should not get tied up in bureaucracy and red tape.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.718" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013071800007#F00300"><p>I agree with the last thing Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, which was that we need to work to ensure farmers get the best price they can for their animals.  We have been doing that.  We now have the highest price ever being paid for milk.  Over the past five or six months, we have had pretty high beef prices also.  The way in which we do that is to support farmers, to ensure we have the maximum demand for Irish products, to protect our reputation as we did during the horse meat crisis, and to open up live export markets when we can to provide competition, which we have been doing, with boats going to Libya.  Discussions are taking place as to whether we might be able to export live cattle to the UK, because UK prices for beef are the highest in Europe.</p><p>  We are doing what we can to work the market to ensure Irish produce is sold into premium markets and that Irish farmers get the highest value they can.  However, farmers need to respond to that too, with more farmers entering into the beef quality assurance scheme and the lamb quality assurance scheme.  Approximately 80% of the beef produced in Ireland is under the quality assurance mark while approximately 50% of sheep and lamb meat is.  There is no reason a farmer should not be operating out of that quality assurance scheme.  That helps us all to market Irish meat as the best in Europe from the point of view of quality, safety, animal husbandry, environmental controls and all the other things the quality assurance scheme guarantees.</p><p>  The whole point of having a national reserve is to support new entrants into farming, farmers who have been farming without any payment on what is called naked land who should be eligible for payments in the future, and farmers who may have been ill during the reference year, or were out of action for some other reason, and got a raw deal in terms of their entitlement.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.721" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013071800008#G00300"><p>The Deputy advocated that we redistribute more than what the Commission was proposing.  Regardless of that, if we chose the payment per hectare flat rate model, then we would have had to break the country up into different regions to reflect different productivity levels.  That would have been almost impossible to do and I did not want to do it, which is why we chose the approximation model.  I think we got a good win on that and now we have to design it with the flexibility that we have.</p><p>  The question about making a direct connection between stocking rate and payment is a fair one, but it is not the only issue on the table.  Even if we wanted to do so, we are not allowed under world trade rules to directly link payments to productivity, which is why the only option we had available to maintain any link with productivity and stocking rate was to maintain a link with the historical payments.  We are moving away from those historical payments and converging towards an average.  That was the only way we could maintain some link, and we have done a reasonable job at that for the next seven years.</p><p>  The redistribution figure is about &euro;103 million.  There are dangers in taking the table that I sent to members and using it as the accurate table.</p></speech>

These are 2010 figures.  We are talking about a payment that farmers would have got in 2010 and the payment they will get after the redistribution effect of what we are proposing.  Figures have changed slightly since 2010 for some farmers.  The average payment will also be less because redistribution will happen after the 3.3% budget cut is applied, after the 2% for young farmers is applied, after the 3% national reserve figure is applied, and after the 1% crisis reserve is applied.  The figure that everybody gets before redistribution kicks in will be less.  We may not use a full 2% for young farmers.  In my view we are unlikely to use the full 3% for the national reserve, but these are maximum figures that could be cut.  The reality is that some money will be taken from farmers' payments before the redistribution kicks in.  Money will be given back to farmers on the basis of young farmers and the national reserve, and money will be given back from the crisis fund if it is not spent.  I have heard farm organisations stating that farmers are going to lose 9% before they even start.  In my view, that is the maximum possible that could be lost before we start, but it is very unlikely to be 9% because most of these funds will not reach their full amount, and in most years the 1% crisis fund will be reimbursed to farmers the following year as we do not have a crisis every year.  People need to understand that.</p><p>  Some of the figures we read about are accurate, but some of them also factor in maximum losses without factoring in gains.  When farmers say that they will lose 2% to give to young farmers, their sons might be gaining from that, or they might be gaining from it if they are under 40.  Some of them might be losing 2% and gaining 25%.  Let us not just focus on losses, because that is what makes the dramatic headlines.  Let us try to look at what is lost and what is gained, because all of those initial losses are for very strategic reasons that all of the farming organisations support.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.726" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013071800009#H00300"><p>Yes, exactly.  Coupled payment is a double-edged sword.  It benefits the sector that we want to support, but it has to come out of the other sectors.  If we were to support suckler beef, for example - there are approximately 80,000 beef farmers - we would be giving the money back again.  For someone who is not benefiting from a coupled payment it could result in their getting a more significant payment.  It is not fair to say that they could have a 19% loss because we are not going to couple 10%.  If we do couple it will be a much lower figure.  We would try to put a scheme in place.  The obvious sector would be suckler beef farming, but it is interesting to consider how we would do that.  For example, rather than introducing a coupled scheme we could transfer money from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2 and then design a scheme that would not simply give farmers money for producing beef.  We could introduce something like a suckler cow welfare scheme that would give farmers money for producing beef but would also ask them to do some other things that would add value.</p><p>  It is possible to transfer money from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2 without any co-decision funding requirement.  In other words, we could do something more strategic with that money, but it would be the same as coupling.  There are options available to us to do strategic things with the money that we have.  Every time we spend money in one sector it costs another sector and that is what we need to understand.  If we couple beef, that is at a cost to the sheep, dairy and arable sectors.  If we couple sheep it is at a cost to other sectors.  We have the flexibility to do that if we want, but that coupling debate is a very divisive one.  Farming organisations take different approaches to it.  The Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association will, I suspect, take a very hard line to oppose coupling.  I do not want to cite other organisations but I know the ICMSA's position.  Others will have an internal debate on this issue and will try to find a balance on the coupling option.  I look forward to receiving those submissions.</p></speech>

If we take off the 8% does it tell us what happens if we benefit only the suckler cow sector, or suckler cows and sheep, suckler cows and dairy herds on bad land and so on?  Does it give the actual amounts of money?  It is very easy to figure out how much one is taking from everybody: taking &euro;10,000 results in a loss of &euro;800.  The more data we can get, the more people will be informed as to what their real options are.  The people who are not in the coupled area will be against it and all those within it will do a quick calculation on the basis that if they get &euro;10,000 they will lose &euro;800, and wonder what they will get back.  My calculation is that if it was &euro;1,200, that would be a gain of &euro;300 or &euro;400.  If it is anything less than that they will say it is not worth the hassle of two schemes, even for a few hundred euro.</p></speech>

We need to step back and ask what are the vulnerable sectors in agriculture that need support, as opposed to what is going to win the support of 50% plus one.  We need to look at our Food Harvest 2020 plans and at sectors that are vulnerable, that are not performing or that need some support in order to perform to their full potential.  That is the context we need to consider for coupling.  I will give the Deputy as much information as I have.  I do not have all those figures.  I have a briefing note on coupling, how it is calculated, where it comes from and some of the impacts it may have on other sectors.  We do not have it broken down into the kind of detail the Deputy seeks.  That can be done but the Deputy can easily do it himself.</p></speech>

There is an opportunity in this part of our considerations to make sure that if there is to be a coupling it rewards activity and that if anyone is at a loss it should be the people who are less active.  We are still talking about it.  We still have not figured out the definition of "active".  Going back to coefficients and different categories of land - and, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, people in the same cohort of production - there are ways to tailor a scheme with some decoupling to make sure that the people who get the extra money are those who are more active.  That draws a line in single farm payments between the more and the less active.  It could cover many things.</p><p>  We have spent an hour on the CAP and the Minister has yet to answer some questions, particularly on the consultation process, the inspection regime and the reference year.  Those are the questions that remain unanswered.  When we get those answers we will move on to fisheries and we will work on this at an early stage in our work programme.</p></speech>

What is the Department's view on the timescale involved and the new arrangements under Pillar 2, such as for mountain areas, and the allowance to increase the hectare payment to &euro;450 for farmland above 62&deg;N?  A large chunk of Leader funding is administered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  This funding has not been drawn down and it looks like it will not be drawn down even though eligible projects are waiting for funding.  This is a no-brainer, in my view.  Why should we return money to Europe that could be used under Pillar 2 for agriculture if it cannot be used for Leader funding?  Will this jeopardise the negotiations on the new Pillar 2?</p></speech>

This very interesting proposal was put forward by the Wicklow Uplands Council and, to some degree, it mirrors what was done in the context of a small environmental farming scheme that was put in place in the Burren.  We only have so much money to spend on Pillar 2 schemes.  There have been calls for a retirement scheme and we could put one in place but we would then be prevented from doing other things.  We have considerably less money to spend on Pillar 2 schemes.  The more new schemes we introduce, the more we will be obliged to abolish existing ones in order to provide funding.  There is no magic tree from which we can continually pluck money.</p></speech>

At the end of each year, farmers receive printouts.  They then add everything together and the result represents the figure for their payments.  I am trying to obtain a fix on this matter.  Would it be possible, as a preliminary exercise, to indicate what were the various measures on the previous occasion?  There has been a reduction of 11%.  As the Minister indicated, in the early years we overpaid in the context of co-funding and it was then necessary to engage in a clawback exercise.  I understand that under the new CAP, payments relating to any new agri-environment scheme will be approximately halfway between those which currently obtain in respect of REPS and AEOS.  The amounts which previously applied in respect of the latter were &euro;12,000 and &euro;4,000, respectively, so farmers will be lucky if they obtain in the region of &euro;6,000 in the future.  The orders of magnitude which will apply must be made known to members because otherwise we will not be able to discuss the matter with farmers in any meaningful way.  Would it not be possible for the Minister to indicate what was spent under the previous CAP and the pro-rata position which will apply under the new CAP - in this regard we must ensure that no more and no less co-funding than is required will be provided - and the amounts that will be available under the relevant schemes?  It would be very useful to have the figures in that regard.</p></speech>

I refer to the fact that a balance must be struck between the people who will be in the cohort that will receive an increase in Pillar 1 funding and those who previously received area-based payments under the disadvantaged areas scheme or REPS and who tended to be the greatest beneficiaries of Pillar 2 funding.  We must ensure that the position does not become distorted.</p><p>  I suggest that we move on to discuss the Common Fisheries Policy.  We have spent 80 minutes discussing the CAP.  We will be able to continue the debate on the latter on another occasion.  Will the Minister make his opening remarks on the CFP agreement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.745" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013071800011#K01000"><p>I thank Ms Josephine Kelly, one of my officials, for her patience.  As members are aware, the Common Fisheries Policy has not received the attention it merits.  The agreement relating to it was negotiated at the same time as that pertaining to the CAP.  In many ways the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy is much more radical.  This was necessary because the existing policy was not as effective as it should have been in terms of ensuring that we protect and maintain fish stocks and support fishing communities.  When, 20, 30 or 50 years from now, people look back at European policy from the point of view of fisheries, I hope this will be seen as a very radical point of change in terms of how European waters are fished.  The CAP is also a point of change but it is nothing like as radical from a policy perspective.  The CAP is more about money and how it is distributed.</p><p>  There are a number of key features in respect of the Common Fisheries Policy agreement.  In the first instance, we are committed to fishing to what is termed the maximum sustainable yield.  This will not happen overnight but we have stated that we will fish stocks, where possible, to maximum sustainable yield by 2015.  All fish stocks to which quotas attach will be fished to maximum sustainable yield by 2020.  In other words, the scientific research carried out by the Irish Marine Institute and other bodies will inform us as to the size, state and health of stocks and we will then apply the maximum sustainable yield formula in respect of them.  This formula allows the maximum commercial catch to be taken from such stocks while ensuring that they are maintained.  This is a really positive step forward for those in the fishing industry and for fish stocks.  It will mean that there will still be fish in ten years' time and that we will not fish in an unsustainable way.</p><p>  The second radical change proposed under the agreement is a move away from discarding fish.  We are going to introduce - on a phased, species-by-species basis - an obligation to land fish.  This means that those in the industry will be obliged to change, quite radically, the way they fish.  They will not be able to simply dump over the side of their vessels fish for which they do not have a quota.  It is perfectly legal to discard fish at present but, more than anyone else, fishermen really resent the fact that current policy requires them to dump, in some cases, 50% to 60% of the fish they catch.  Many of the latter are healthy adult fish that are marketable and valuable and they are dumped over the side for seagulls and other species to eat or else to rot at the bottom of the sea.  Apart from anything else, this is immoral and we are going to change the position.</p><p>  A great deal of discussion and negotiation was required with the fishing industry and with politicians in the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council of Ministers in respect of this matter.  My main objective was always to ensure the policy shift to which I refer would be made but in a way to which the fishing industry could adapt and with which it could live.  I am of the opinion that we have achieved that.  There are flexibilities in the system which will allow fishermen to manage this change.  For example, they will have inter-species flexibility in the context of using their quotas.  They will also have inter-annual flexibility in this regard.  If a fisherman is operating in the cod, haddock and whiting fishery in the Celtic Sea, for example, and he has a quota in respect of cod and whiting but not for haddock and he brings on board a large catch of haddock, he can use up to 9% of the quota of his target species to compensate for this.  There will be a cost involved but at least the fisherman in question will be allowed to land the fish and sell it.  If, at the end of the season, a fisherman has caught more fish than he has a quota to land, he can take up to 10% of next year's quota to compensate.  So the figures are 9% for inter-species flexibility and 10% for inter-annual flexibility.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that he and his officials have worked tirelessly on the reform of the CFP, particularly in the past six months during the Irish Presidency.  However, I have met with fishermen around the coast who do not share the optimism that has been expressed by the Minister today.  In fact, many smaller fishermen are somewhat disillusioned, rightly or wrongly, with the sector at the moment and the quota allocation that is available.  While much attention and focus has been placed on discards, regionalisation and the protection of the Hague preferences, the real issue affecting fishermen currently is the lack of quota allocation.  That is an historic problem which has not just developed on the Minister&rsquo;s watch but is a massive issue even in his own part of the country where fishermen fish for cod, haddock and whitefish in Irish waters and are only able to obtain 11% to 12% of the quota while French and Spanish fishermen avail of the rest.</p></speech>

There are certain things I cannot do, even if I want to.  I would love to renegotiate relative stability but to do that I need to get a majority of member states to support me.  There is not a single other member state that would support Ireland in terms of changing relative stability, with the possible exception of Spain, because it wants more from everybody.  For me to start even claiming that I could change Ireland's percentage of quota versus that of other countries is unrealistic.  To be fair, it was the same for previous Ministers.  Ministers get stick on this issue.  This was a deal done years ago.  We can get into the reason that deal happened and the way it happened, or we can concentrate on changing what we can change in terms of getting big allocations of new species such as boarfish.  We can concentrate on building up stocks also.  Even though we have a relatively small percentage, that percentage is increasing year on year.  My focus is on changing the things I can change rather than having this circular debate on trying to take more quota off the Spanish and the French because we gave them too much in the first place, knowing that I cannot do that.  We all have a responsibility to try to explain that to fishermen in terms of what we can and cannot do as a member of the European Union, and be realistic about it.</p><p>  On the Hague preferences, I would like to have done more.  The Senator's colleague, Pat The Cope Gallagher MEP, did a very good job in the European Parliament.  I would not pretend that he was not involved in this debate, because he was.  Unfortunately, I read some coverage that was inaccurate in that it stated the Presidency was very unhelpful in regard to the Hague preferences.  I was surprised to read that.  It did not necessarily come from Pat The Cope Gallagher but from other sources.  That was not the case.  We wanted to do as much as we could for the Hague preferences while at the same time avoiding a broad discussion on it because I was nervous about where that discussion would go.  I believe we got the best possible deal.</p><p>  In terms of discards in the pelagic sector, that date was to be January 2014 but we pushed it back a year because everybody recognised that there is work to do to prepare for that.  The pelagic sector should not have a huge difficulty in dealing with an obligation to land.  It is already illegal for pelagic vessels to grade fish, for example.  They should land everything they catch, more or less.  This is a fairly clean fishery; therefore, it is about catching small fish, which can be dealt with through mesh size and so on.  I accept it is not quite as simple as that, but already we are speaking to the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation, KFO, and to others about the way that will work.  I believe we will make it work.  It is much more complex than the whitefish fishery, particularly when we have mixed fisheries where six or seven species might be caught in the one net, and it is difficult to avoid that.</p><p>  On the lack of consultation, I would like to have travelled around the country more in advance of doing this deal, but to say there was not consultation in advance of the CFP would not be true.  I am not a difficult person to contact.  The heads of the six fishing organisations in Ireland have my mobile telephone number and can call me.  Generally, I meet the fishing organisations before every Council they choose to attend, unless there is some exceptional reason I cannot do that.  There has been consultation.  Obviously, people would have liked more, but there was as much as we could possibly provide.</p></speech>

That percentage does not change.  As the stock increases, we get our percentage increase.  That is the way it works.</p><p>  I omitted to make a point earlier which I should make, and both Deputies present will understand it because they know the fishing industry quite well from a technical point of view.  Currently, we have what are called total allowable catches, TACs, but that is based on what one can land as fish.  In other words, when someone catches haddock and whiting their quota is what they are allowed to legally land on the quayside.</p> <p>We are now changing that to a catch quota.  Currently, if one has a quota for 5,000 tonnes but 6,000 tonnes are caught, it means that 1,000 tonnes are dumped over the side and 5,000 tonnes are landed.  Under the new system, if one catches 6,000 tonnes one must land it all.  Therefore the quota is now based on what is caught rather than on what is landed.  That means that the quota will increase overnight when one changes that system.</p><p> Currently, the science of landing quotas factors in a 30%, 40% or 50% discard rate - that is, fish being killed - in certain fisheries.  If one is going to land everything, the quota has to increase correspondingly, taking account of the extra fish one is going to catch but cannot discard.  That is excluding the juvenile fish, which one should certainly be able to avoid catching.  Switching from a landing quota to a catch-based quota should therefore result in an increase in the quota for fishermen.  It is good news even though it is a bit more complex for them in that they cannot turf over the side what they do not want.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.763" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013071800014#N00500"><p>To answer that point, let us say that one had ten tonnes of cod to catch in the current system, but the ISIS advice is on the basis of a discard rate of 30% for that species.  It is quite a complex calculation, but the recommendation on a new quota will have to be based on what a fisherman can avoid, or not avoid, catching.  If half the extra 3,000 tonnes of discarded fish is juvenile fish, it should not be factored into an increasing quota.  However, if the other half is adult fish that one cannot avoid catching, it will be factored in.  We are trying to maintain the mortality rate of stocks, but instead of throwing them into the sea, fishermen will be able to land them.  The calculation is not the amount currently fished plus the current discard equals the new quota.  Catching some of the discarded fish can be avoided.  It depends on the fishery, but what is currently being discarded and cannot be avoided must be factored into the new quota.  It is quite a complex calculation, depending on the stocks, because with some of the fisheries one can avoid catching fish, while with others one cannot.  In some of the mixed fisheries it is also quite complex.</p><p>  ISIS will have a much more complex job to do in recommending quotas.  It will have to do two things.  First, the quota must be consistent with maximum sustainable yield.  Second, it must be consistent with a catch quota rather than a landing quota, taking into account what would otherwise have been discarded and what can be avoided through the use of technical measures.  It is quite a complex system, but fishermen will know what we are saying because they throw cod over the side in buckets.  They will know what is required for this calculation, even though it is undoubtedly a complex one.</p><p>  The one certain thing is that fish that are currently being sustainably fished will not be subject to a reduction in quota on the basis of moving from landing to catch quota; rather, there will be an increase.  If there is to be a reduction in quota because they are being unsustainably fished at the moment, it will be less of a reduction than it otherwise would have been because it is going to a catch quota rather than a landing quota.</p></speech>

That is just a general point and I am not seeking a debate on it.</p><p>  As regards discards and their removal, one of the factors that will determine whether this is a success will be the attitude adopted by the SFPA and the rules we implement to make this happen in the transition period.  It is also linked to the science involved, although the fishermen suspect the scientific evidence.  Their evidence at sea is different from what the scientists claim.  The complexity of the rules and regulations will be critical if fishermen are to buy into this scheme in its implementation stage.  We do not want fishermen returning to illegal activities simply because everything is stacked against them and they feel they have no choice.  That will be important when it comes to implementing the measures nationally.</p><p>  As regards discarding, I am wondering about the Dutch fleets that are fishing mackerel to order off the west coast.  Will there be any focus on that issue when discards are being policed?  A significant amount of fish are being discarded even though this is already illegal.</p><p>  The Minister said we were out of the individual transferable quota, ITQ, system, but that is implemented as part of the CFP, so is it optional?</p></speech>

If at some stage during the CFP's lifetime a different Minister decided it would be a good thing for Ireland to opt into the ITQs, would that be possible?  Have we opted out of it for the duration of the CFP, or could a decision be made in two years' time to opt into it?</p><p>  Will provision be made in the fisheries and maritime fund for people who have been displaced from the fishing industry, so that they can be retrained for new opportunities in the coastal marine sector?  We did not deal with that in the last CFP, so it should be part of the fund.  There may be some pressures concerning the technical measures we want to support.  It will be important, particularly in the processing sector, where we see ongoing modernisation that is displacing many jobs in Donegal.</p></speech>

Fishermen need to opt into this by taking observers on board and showing them the proof of why they do not believe the science.  We also need to try to maintain and increase resources for the Marine Institute and others who are doing that research.  An Irish person from the Marine Institute is the current head of ISIS.</p><p>  The relationship between scientists and fishermen is better now than it has ever been.  We got a pretty good deal last year and the year before in difficult circumstances for many stocks.  That was on the back of having the Marine Institute with us to make the case to the European Commission on why the cuts should not be as drastic as they could have been and the increases should be greater.  Fishermen now realise the value of having scientists on board, but we can improve the relationship all the time.  There is no question about that. </p><p>  I have heard the accusation from our industry that there are large Dutch pelagic vessels off the west coast, essentially grading a lot of fish and pumping them back into the water through underwater systems which are not visible.  I will inquire into that, but obviously we must impose the rules.  I do not want to target one nation as breaking the rules more than anybody else.  Boat by boat, however, we need to ensure that people are not grading and mulching fish and pumping them back into the water as discards.  That is not acceptable and it has to stop.  If the Deputy has any evidence on that I will certainly follow it up.</p></speech>

What he said is correct.  We have had too many political compromises on the CFP for years and against the background of the work the sub-committee is trying to do on smaller coastal communities and the people who represent the small inshore fishermen, it would be a travesty if we allowed IFCs, or whatever they are called, to become the norm.</p><p>  As this is the last meeting, I wish all members an enjoyable break.

The Deputy could have raised the matter with the committee and the clerk then rather than in public session.  It put us in an invidious position.  The Chair will allow anyone to make a personal statement at the end of the meeting.</p><p>  I invite the Minister to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.806" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013071800003#B03000"><p>To respond immediately to the question about Oberstown, I have received agreement from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for funding for a campus manager.  The position will be advertised this month.  Some legal advice had to be sought on the precise wording of the advertisement, as we will be introducing legislation during the year to provide for one campus.  It is important that a campus manager be in place.  The Commission for Public Service Appointments will be advertising this position shortly and, hopefully, the appointment can be made quickly after that.</p><p>  I will bring members of the joint committee up to date on what progress has been made recently on the substantial responsibilities which fall within the remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I propose to mention the child and family agency, early childhood care and education, Children First, the area-based response to child poverty and the Irish Youth Justice Service, as well as my Department's youth affairs role in the recent Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  I will be glad to discuss other areas of my Department's work in the subsequent discussion.</p><p>  I introduced the Child and Family Agency Bill in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  I acknowledge the assistance provided by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in bringing this particular part of the process to a conclusion.  The establishment of the child and family agency reflects the commitment in the programme for Government to fundamentally reform the delivery of child protection services by removing child welfare and protection from the Health Service Executive, HSE, and creating a dedicated child welfare and protection agency while reforming the model of service delivery and improving accountability to the D&aacute;il.  We are going further, however, than just child welfare and protection.  The new agency will bring together a range of functions relating to children and families which will, in turn, bring a previously unknown level of focus to issues affecting these groups.  The aim is to identify problems and provide supports at the earliest possible stage.  The chief executive officer-designate and most of the agency senior management team are in place.  The Government also approved the appointment of Ms Norah Gibbons as the first chairman of the board of the agency.</p><p>  The work involved in ensuring a seamless transition to a new agency should not be underestimated.</p></speech>

It was not what had been intended in the D&aacute;il schedule.  Other speakers had expected to be able to continue to make Second Stage statements on the resumption.  It is regrettable and most unfortunate that because of the collapse of an earlier piece of legislation, bringing forward the Second Stage of the Child and Family Agency Bill to begin long before its scheduled time, other Deputies were unprepared to take up the opportunities yesterday.  Due to other responsibilities, I was not able to attend to hear the Minister's closing remarks over a very truncated opportunity of approximately three minutes at the conclusion just before 7.30 p.m.  It is an unfortunate start to the process of the legislation.  My remarks stand.  I welcome the Bill and will fully support its safe passage through the Houses.  I hope the Minister would note those comments.  It is not indicative of any lack of interest in the part of Members that it concluded as it did.</p><p>  In a response to a parliamentary question of mine on 4 July, the Minister said, &quot;Only 16 of the certified 24 male bed spaces in Trinity House School are currently available for use due to staffing issues.&quot;  This is a major issue and has been repeatedly highlighted in successive court hearings by well-respected judges.  It is an indictment of the political system that we do not use the full potential of what is already <i>in situ</i>.  Why is one third of the capacity of Trinity House school unused?  I would like to know the exact details of the so-called staffing issues.  Let us understand it, because it is vexatious.</p><p>  The annual report of Ombudsman for Children painted a very negative picture of the situation in Oberstown.  The Minister must be aware that the staff working there also paint a very negative picture.  The situation is far from ideal.  Is there any measure of the impact of all this on the children detained in Oberstown and Trinity House School?  Yesterday the Ombudsman for Children suggested there was a possible need for the upskilling of staff in certain areas.  I was not able to attend, being in the Chamber with the Minister.  That is a very serious reflection on the situation.  If staff at Oberstown are not properly trained for their responsibilities, there is a major problem that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  I do not want to come back in the autumn and have to ask about this.  It must be acted on immediately because of all that is involved.  What are the Minister's plans to ensure upskilling of staff, if it is a requirement as identified?  What is happening regarding that and when will it take place?</p><p>  Will the Minister comment on the level of sick leave?  This is a serious matter and is symptomatic of something not being right in Oberstown.  Are there increasing assaults of staff resulting in sick leave and stress-related leave?  That is what I am being told.  This situation poses a major question.  Have we adequate staffing?  Are the skills bases in place?  Why do we have an inordinate level of sick leave, due in the main to stress and assaults?  It is a very serious problem.  When will the Minister publish the McElfatrick report?  Can the members of this committee, spokespersons on children, have access to it?  Why have we not got it already and will the Minister ensure we do?  It is critically important.  Can the Minister give assurances that the capital project at Oberstown will be delivered on time and in budget?</p><p>  I welcome the fact that I got my question on violence against children in the home to the Minister because every effort was made to prevent its being put to her, as I explained to her some time ago.  I would like the system to be a bit more reflective of the fact that children's needs, which may cross a number of portfolios, are nonetheless of concern to the Minister - I respect her for that - and to me as a spokesperson on health and children.  There is little information on the measures being taken to address the fact that there is a 55% increase in violence against children in homes where there is violence against another adult present.  Women's Aid has highlighted this and it must be properly addressed.  Is there any analysis of the root causes of this?  What is the HSE's assessment of this situation and what measures is it taking to address it?</p><p>  On the comprehensive preschool equality agenda, can the Minister clarify the position on the future need for preschool and cr&egrave;che services to meet the national quality standards as outlined in S&iacute;olta, the National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education?  What are the practical implications for preschools and cr&egrave;ches in that regard?  Will the Minister ensure all preschools are inspected?  Will such facilities have a right of appeal in all circumstances?</p></speech>

I thank her for outlining all that is happening and for her responses to questions.  I am disappointed that the Children First Bill is still delayed.  I realise the legal difficulties.  This committee had very good hearings on the issue over a year ago so all committee members are aware.  In the absence of Children First, I fear people do not realise the responsibility.  Reporting is the right thing to do, and it is unfortunate that we must legislate for people to do the right thing, but we have seen too many cases where people have not reported.  In the absence of that legislation, is there something we can do as an immediate measure?  Perhaps I might give that more consideration.  We must send a clear message to anybody employed by the State or in receipt of funding from the State that it will be unacceptable and there will be sanctions if they do not appropriately report any concerns about a child's welfare or protection.</p><p>  I look forward to welcoming the national child care quality standards, on which the Minister is working.  Will this cover childminders, particularly registered childminders?  I am not talking about an informal arrangement under which I mind my nephews for two hours.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister's comprehensive answers.  It shows her seriousness about these issues.  Another Oireachtas committee produced a report on alcohol that should have been produced by this committee.  Alcohol-related harm is a health issue.  It is also an issue affecting children, as the Minister has shown.  It directly and indirectly affects them.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in raised the issue of domestic violence.  We know there is a relationship between the two issues in certain cases.  We must return to the issue of alcohol-related harm.</p></speech>

This committee should deal with all alcohol-related issues.  It is a health issue, first and foremost.  The Minister's answer clearly highlights how children are affected.</p><p>  I welcome the publication of the Child and Family Agency Bill 2013.  I have not had an opportunity to scrutinise that technical Bill yet.  I still cannot picture the agency and I do not know what disciplines or referral pathways will be in place.  The Minister's reply refers to piloting different systems, but I am not reassured that the new body will not become a crisis agency.  I would appreciate an outline of the agency rather than words like &quot;accountability&quot;.  I just want to understand the model and the structure.  Publishing this information would assure many of us who are trying to find out what the agency will be.</p><p>  I welcome the comprehensive reply that we received concerning Oberstown, but when will a single management structure be <i>in situ</i>?  This is the crux of the issue.  I echo Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's comments.  I will not repeat them, as he made them eloquently.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.818" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1004" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013071800006#E00800"><p>To the Minister, well done for doing so much work in two years.  She has put the child and family agency together.  Setting up a new child welfare structure is difficult.</p><p>  I spoke in the D&aacute;il Chamber yesterday.  I was lucky because it was almost empty.  Deputy Conway was present.  My interest is in the preschool quality agenda.  Television programmes have revealed how some children have been badly treated.  However, there are thousands of good cr&egrave;ches and child care facilities.  I visited a number of them in my former profession.  The children there were engaged, not strapped to chairs.  I want to reassure parents that there is good quality child care.  I welcome the fact that the reports will be published online.  If parents have concerns after checking them, they can approach the facilities' owners.</p><p>  I was interested in the Minister's remarks about an inspectorate of cr&egrave;ches.  Will they be qualified and will they inspect the same elements across facilities?  An inspectorate worked when it was introduced into the primary school system. It made teachers work together on school development plans.  This is probably what is required in the case of cr&egrave;ches.  I will be optimistic and thank the Minister for her work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.819" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1093" speakername="Ciara Conway" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013071800006#E00900"><p>To follow Deputy Mitchell O'Connor's references to early childhood, we were all horrified by the documentary.  I have a concern about how the situation will improve for children.  I have mentioned it to the Minister previously.  People do not realise the tasks facing child care staff everyday.  They have little if any planning time.  All of their time is contact time with the children.  If there is to be quality, there must be space to develop a plan for the centre, its children and its community, as Deputy Mitchell O'Connor mentioned.  Unfortunately, there is no down time for staff at some private centres in particular to plan and to look after records adequately.  Services that receive funding from the State try to provide that space, but more is necessary.  We do not need nice buildings and equipment - people who have experience of young children know that they often find the greatest joy in the empty boxes, not the toys - but a quality relationship between the carer and the child.</p><p>  The new agency's establishment cannot be underestimated.  It is a positive step forward for many families.  It is the type of body that people in the sector have been discussing during their coffee breaks for years but did not believe would come about.  I commend the Minister, her staff and the new officials and management team.  I wish them well.  A time of change is a difficult period for staff and service users, but I am confident there will be a good outcome.</p><p>  How will we focus on ensuring quality?  This relates to the themes raised by various members who have discussed the new agency and early childhood studies.  How do we know there will be quality and depth to the service?  We should not focus on the number of social workers alone, as people often do.  There can be thousands of workers, but poor quality relationships and practices can do damage.  This is our opportunity to ensure good quality.</p></speech>

I welcome the Child and Family Agency Bill.  I am delighted to have had an opportunity to contribute on it on Second Stage yesterday.  I share the concerns of my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, as Second Stage clashed with the committee's meeting with the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan.  I was covering for Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and almost missed my speaking slot.  The change in times made it difficult for people to address the Bill.</p><p>  I submitted a number of questions, including on the Women's Aid annual report.  I note that we do not have adequate hostel spaces.  The Council of Europe recommended at least one refuge place per 10,000 population.  What are we doing to address this issue?</p><p>  The Minister referenced the European protection order.  As of May, the Government had yet to sign the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence.</p></speech>

Like Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in I had intended to speak on the matter on Second Stage.  Unfortunately, I had to leave the meeting to attend another one.  When I returned to my office I discovered that it had finished, which was disappointing.</p><p>  I wish to raise some ongoing problems with the Minister.  No parent sends his or her child to a preschool or childminder without knowing the provider.  When people avail of such care they are genuinely interested in their children's welfare and want to make sure that the children are well minded.  I have a growing concern about the large number of unregulated childminders who have set up a small group and mind three or four children in their homes.  Why are they not properly regulated?  They should be.</p><p>  Parents have told me that they put their child into a small preschool or playschool in a house because cost is a factor.  Such establishments are a lot cheaper than paying for a normal playschool.  Parents must pay between &euro;110 and &euro;120 per week if their child attends a larger playschool five mornings per week up to 12 noon.  If they send their child to a childminder who provides care in their home it will cost substantially less, perhaps &euro;50 or less per week.  I am not talking about the quality of service because people who have a small group of children in their homes are quite capable.  They are well able to wipe snotty noses, look after children and cuddle them when they have an accident, but such childminders are not properly regulated.  The Department should identify them and ensure they are properly regulated.</p></speech>

People who mind children in their homes should be regulated and brought into line with other child care establishments.  Its not about charging more.  I just want them to be properly regulated.</p><p>  Many grandparents are minding children because one or both parents must go out to work.  Grandparents across the State are being put under great pressure to mind their grandchildren.  I have seen grandparents in their late 60s and early 70s pushing buggies.  They do so because they want to alleviate the financial pressure on their children or grandchildren.  Those grandparents have reached a time of life when they should be sitting back and enjoying their golden years.  There is an onus on us and the State to provide child care services at a reasonable cost that are properly regulated.  I hope the Minister has got the message.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.827" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013071800007#F00700"><p>Yes, I understand.  I thank the Deputies and Senator for their comments and questions.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Senator van Turnhout asked about Oberstown.  When I came into office Oberstown was quite under-utilised but had a lot of staff and the beds were not used fully.  As the members will know, many children are now diverted from detention to community placement and supervision.  Crime is also down among that age group, which is welcome.</p><p>  Last year there was no problem getting a bed at Oberstown for a 16 year old.  We took the decision to move 16 year olds and I stand by that decision because it was the right thing to do.  No 16 year old has been in St. Pat's for the past year, which is right, and this is due to the decision taken by me and the Government.  We have the opposite problem now at Oberstown because there has been a dramatic increase in referrals in the past three months.  For a range of reasons the courts have sought more places than at any time in previous years when 16 year olds were in St. Patrick's or when they moved initially to Oberstown.  With regard to staffing, Oberstown has 90 care staff, 35 night care staff, 17 management and 45 other staff, and the total is 187.</p><p>  I will also outline what I, the staff at Oberstown, the IYJS and the extremely good board are doing.  My appointment of the board members was based on their expertise and what they could bring to the management of Oberstown.  The board is chaired by Mr. Joe Horan.  Many of the board members have expertise in youth justice, which is precisely the reason I appointed them.  There has been no shortage of professional input, and great efforts have been made to deal with many issues.  Oberstown is an historic institution which had, surprisingly, three separate units.  I wonder why it was not under a single management.  No other government put single management in place but the Government is doing so now.  No other government established a roster system that meant that staff could move between three units.  They should have had mobility because they had to deal with young people in detention, mostly young boys and occasionally young girls.  Clearly, staff should have been able to move between units, but it took us two years to reach agreement on movement.  We went to the Labour Relations Commission and got changes made, and a roster has been in operation since February.</p><p>  Following an increase in referrals, we have examined ways to create extra beds.  Negotiations took place for a number of weeks on the possibility of changing part of the area designated for young girls to allow boys to use the space.  However, it did not prove practical or desirable in the long run.  Members are right in stating we are still in a situation in which we must make extra beds available.  It appears the only way forward is to hire more staff, in the first place, on an interim basis.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has approved quite a lot of extra staff for next year.  I welcome the agreement to have the extra staff because all of the 16 and 17 year olds will be on-site.  However, we still have not been able to make the extra beds available.  I shall ask my Secretary General to comment on the initiative and efforts that are under way.  We held meetings with the two unions involved, the most recent of which took place last week, to try to ensure that beds would become available.</p></speech>

For example, in our eight-bed unit for girls there are often only two girls, as is the case currently.  Before we had the cross-campus roster, the staff assigned to the girls' unit would stay assigned to it regardless of the number of children in the unit.  Therefore, a unit would be fully staffed even with only one or two girls in residence.  Now we have the ability to deploy staff on a daily basis.  The staffing of individual units is set according to the need and number of children and young people present.  The initiative has opened up operational efficiencies and allowed us to try to be more efficient.</p></speech>

An assumption was made by the board and everybody involved in the management of Oberstown that the new roster would provide the flexibility to open and use all of the beds there.  There is much disappointment that it has not proved possible to do that.  Sometimes there are historic practices in place in units which are very difficult to change.</p><p>  The work in Oberstown is demanding on staff, but staff must also be flexible and, as the Secretary General said, willing to put children at the centre and make whatever efforts they can.  The appointment of a line manager should greatly facilitate this because, effectively, three different organisations are coming together on the one campus which did not work together before.  It might look easy from the outside to make these changes and to get these flexibilities in the system, but it has not proved that easy.  A huge industrial relations effort was made and a considerable amount of time was spent by staff from the Irish Youth Justice Service and on the board, and those working on the campus, to arrive at what I agree with the Deputy is an unsatisfactory situation - that is, that there are beds which are not open.  We have asked the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to recruit extra people.  I regret that I have had to do that.  It should have been possible to open those beds with roster changes, but it was not.  Every effort has been made.</p><p>  Ten staff have been on sick leave for more than a year.  Clearly, there will be assault situations.  When operating a detention system, one is dealing with young people who have very complex issues.  We do everything to give support to the staff.  There is continuous professional training available and there have been staff days.  I have met the staff and I was very impressed with their commitment and the efforts they want to make to do the right thing by the young people there.  I hope this situation can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion as quickly as possible.  It is not for the want of effort by my Department, the IYJS, the board of management and everybody else.  </p><p>  I ask that all involved and all staff show the kind of flexibility we need because we are committing &euro;50 million to that campus.  We want to commit &euro;50 million to a campus that works effectively for children and ensures the beds are available.  I hope that has brought some clarity to the situation for the Deputies and Senator who asked questions in that regard.</p><p>  The Child and Family Agency Bill will be referred to the select committee following Second Stage, which began in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, it started much earlier than we had expected.  I  expected only spokespersons to speak yesterday.</p></speech>

It was not due to start until later, but the other Bill finished two hours earlier.</p><p>  The McElfatrick report is clearly a question of due process.  That has just gone to the board.  It involves staff, so there is a due process issue.  I will take advice from the board on whether it should be made available for publication.  There may be confidential material in it in regard to staffing issues.</p><p>  The board has brought in an outside expert to examine the roster and see what improvements can be made.  </p><p>  In regard to Women's Aid, clearly the statistics are very disturbing.  In reply to Deputies McLellan and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, other Deputies and Senator van Turnhout, who raised this issue, the more organised the service in response to the increasing number of child abuse, child protection and child welfare referrals, the better the service we can give those very vulnerable children whose parents - very often the mother - are in a refuge or working with Women's Aid.  It is important for us, the staff in the new child and family agency and the management team there to be very cognisant of the kind of research coming through in regard to those statistics and to look at what supports are available to the children in the local area where there is a refuge.</p></speech>

This is unlike the primary school sector, in which all teachers have the same training and basic knowledge.  One of the challenges in introducing the S&iacute;olta and Aistear programmes in preschool education is how to implement them.  The Department of Education and Skills has responsibility for developing the S&iacute;olta programme and has run a field test with about 130 services.  What it has identified is that giving staff talks on how to implement the programme is not the way to proceed.  The Department identified S&iacute;olta mentors who worked very closely with the services.  That is a model we have seen in other countries and it has been particularly successful in Northern Ireland.  One of the strategies the Minister has identified to make S&iacute;olta and Aistear part of the way the staff work is to build a support network and work directly with services and specifically service by service.  The Department of Education and Skills is looking at bringing S&iacute;olta and Aistear together because there is an issue in that service providers see them as separate and different programmes from which they can choose one or the other, whereas in fact they need to be brought together.  There is a great deal of work going on in trying to develop it.  The voluntary organisations and the county child care committees work very closely with services, but what we need to do is to provide more specific support, service by service, rather than the general support that has been provided to date.</p></speech>

The regulations apply to registered children and a particular section of the regulations will apply to childminders.  The Senator also raised the issue of au pairs.  I met representatives from the Migrant Rights association and I discussed their issues of concern.  The issues seem to focus on employment and exploitation and as such would come under the remit of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton.  I suggested that they link to the child care committees, as I believe they would offer support for au pairs, and if difficulties arise the child care committees would be in a position to support them or make some recommendations about the support they could get.  They said anecdotally that some parents overuse au pairs in childminding, the very point that Senator van Turnhout made.  They are concerned about that.  It highlights the need for a national campaign for young women from around the world who take up these positions so that they can know precisely what they are getting into, get as much information in advance as possible, deal with registered companies and use whatever safeguards are required.  If they find themselves in an unsatisfactory situation, they need to take action and go back to the agency.  Very often, it is an informal arrangement and the au pair ends up feeling he or she is being exploited.</p><p>  Senator van Turnhout, in raising the issue of alcohol, made her point extremely well.  I have detailed statistics.  We have heard about other committee reports and other aspects of the debate on alcohol and sponsorship.  I have been very keen to put on record the significant issues we have in Ireland with regard to young people and the need for those taking decisions to be very cognisant of that.  A recent study, for example, shows that Irish students in the 15 and 16 age cohort report drinking a third more on their latest day drinking than the European average.  That is the reality.  In addition, there is a trend for Irish girls to drink as much as boys and sometimes more.  Among the Irish students surveyed, in the 30 days prior to the survey, half - 52% - of the boys had drunk alcohol, 40% had had five or more drinks on a single occasion and 23% had had one or more episodes of drunkenness.  If one looks at anti-social and public order offences by children and young people, one will find alcohol is a factor in 28.9% of these.  There are major issues with regard to alcohol, and this needs to be debated on another day. </p><p>  Senator van Turnhout said she could not imagine the agency.  It will take time for people to think about the role of the Child and Family Agency as a separate entity.  If I were to ask who was running child and family services, members might have a problem answering that question.  We want to address that issue by putting a dedicated focus on child and family services.  Gordon Jeyes is working on establishing a national assessment and referral service with referral pathways to child welfare and child protection services.  That will deal with the issues outlined by the Senator.  When the board is in place, the board members will work on a corporate plan that will address the points she makes.</p><p>  I thank Deputy Mitchell O'Connor for her comments.  The Deputy asked about standardisation of inspections, and obviously the HSE has been moving towards a standardised process throughout the country.  Previously, this has been dealt with locally and on a regional basis rather than nationally.  To deal with issues nationally, one needs national standards, national inspections and the same format in all of the reports.  All of these issues are being addressed.  The introduction of the standards and the new national qualifications later in the year will help that as well.  There will be training for inspectors.  At present, it is public health nurses and environmental health officers who conduct inspections.  I would like to see people with child care qualifications being part of the inspectorate.  We have many people doing third level degrees in child care and we have a cadre of people who are very interested in developing their skills in the child care area but do not have much opportunity, a matter that can be looked at later.  The regulations were introduced in 1996, but under section 5, the welfare and care of children clearly must be part of any current inspection.  This does not have to wait until the new standards are implemented.  The plan is that when the new standards are finalised in September they will replace the current guidelines and inspectors will then inspect with regard to the new standards.</p><p>  Deputy Conway raised the issue of planning.  I agree with the Deputy that all providers should allow time for planning.  It is part of the regulations.  The child care committees and voluntary organisations have been supporting services to develop better planning and it is a very important part of their work.</p><p>  It is my intention to introduce a mentoring programme and I am in discussions about the budgetary issues arising from its introduction.  I would like to see a cadre of mentors going to child care services around the country to support the development of the staff and of the services they provide.  I would hope to get support for the programme.</p><p>  Deputy Byrne asked about the regulation of childminders.  A childminder must be registered and subject to the regulations when she or he minds three or more children, or children are minded in a preschool setting.  If people know about such services that are not registered they should be reported to the HSE or to the child care committees.  Whether a childminder who looks after fewer than three children in an informal setting should be subject to the same regulations as childminders in the preschool setting is an open question.  In some countries they are regulated, but in others they are not.  The approach in Ireland is that it is the decision of the parent and he or she checks out the childminder.  I would encourage a procedure whereby people register as childminders.  Childminders can register but there has been extremely poor take-up of that option in spite of the tax provision and the other supports that have been given.  Childminders themselves would have more support and greater access to training and the supports of the child care services.  It has not been the tradition in Ireland to register.  Even when the childminders' association, Childminding Ireland, asked people to register, only 1,250 out of a probable 50,000 childminders did so.  Few of the childminders in Ireland register as such because of the informality of the arrangement between the childminder and parents.</p></speech>

It is predominantly women who do that and it is a voluntary system.  More importantly for women, they can make a PRSI contribution to a pension.

I have been there, done that.  I was so disappointed in the whole process that it took me four years to get a resolution.  Some people say that I have been lucky it only took that long.  I have seven headings in my submission.  I am nervous because this is my first opportunity to address such a gathering.</p><p>  My first point is about the length of time it takes for a hearing to be heard.  It took 16 months to get to an appointment with the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  As a result, I was under severe stress.  It was nearly impossible to apply for a job or to get a job during that period because if I was asked at an interview to talk about my situation I would have to say I was waiting for a hearing with the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  I know how people react when they hear this and that was the reaction I got.  This created further stress.  All efforts should be made to reduce the waiting time for a hearing.</p><p>   My second point is about costs.  The system says that it is an informal, efficient and inexpensive means of getting a resolution to one's situation.  The people I had to fight against were in a position to employ HR people and big legal advisers.  I felt that if I was to go into the ring with these people with my hands hanging I would not have a hope of making my case.  The system says that every effort and assistance will be given by the Employment Appeals Tribunal people to assist a person but, unfortunately, it is very difficult for an ordinary layperson to understand legal jargon and rules and regulations.  As a result, I had to employ legal people to defend me.  The cost in my situation was just short of &euro;2,000, which was just slightly less than half the award I received.  So far as I am concerned, winners in particular are usually awarded costs in all court and tribunal cases.  I think that reasonable costs should be allocated to the claimant in cases before the Employment Appeals Tribunal and in particular to the winner of the claim.</p><p>  My next heading is costs to the State.  If a person loses his or her job, their first action is to go the social welfare office.  If one makes a claim while waiting for an appointment for an Employment Appeals Tribunal - which could be 12 months or 16 months - this will cost the State approximately &euro;18,000 for a married man.  In my view if the claimant wins the case the employer should be responsible for that loss to the State and it should be included in the award against the employer.  </p><p>  My next heading is the standard formula for awards.  It appears there is no set standard formula for making an award as it is at the discretion of the panel to decide the amount of the award.  I suggest that a standard set of calculations for awards should be implemented.  For example, if a claimant is out of work for 12 months and his previous earnings were  &euro;650 per week, the calculation should be 48 weeks at &euro;650, which is just short of &euro;32,000.  Less the social welfare payment of &euro;18,000, the award would be &euro;14,000 or &euro;13,500 to the claimant, plus, at the discretion of the panel, a payment for stress, hardship or other expenses.</p></speech>

I compliment Mr. O'Sullivan on having the tenacity to continue his fight for justice in respect of his award.  We have a number of members who were employed by Connolly Shoes in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, who had over 100 years' collective service between them and who have been on the streets since 2010 trying to obtain justice against all the odds.  We will continue to pursue their case in the strongest possible manner.</p><p>  As members are aware, Mandate is a union which organises workers in the retail and bar sectors.  The type of problem under discussion is not unfamiliar to us, particularly in view of the myriad small businesses and limited companies which operate in both sectors.  Members will also be aware that the Unfair Dismissals Acts offer a system of redress for workers against unfair dismissal, that the Employment Appeals Tribunal - on finding a dismissal unfair - may award reinstatement, re-engagement and/or compensation to the employee, group of employees or a combination of both.  Hearings are quite formal, with all evidence taken under oath, and parties are permitted to cross-examine each other's witnesses.  While the tribunal was originally set up as a quick and informal route for workers to process claims relating to alleged unfair dismissals, it is clear that in recent years it has become increasingly legal in nature, with parties - particularly employers - often represented by senior counsel and solicitors.  This makes hearings of the tribunal altogether more daunting for workers, particularly those without union or legal representation.  We understand that the relevant Minister is in the process of introducing measures to simplify the process and that these will lead to the Labour Court taking over the function of the tribunal.  Nonetheless, serious concerns remain in respect of a number of matters covered by the legislation.</p><p>  Mr. O'Sullivan referred to delays in the processing of claims.  It is not unusual for workers to wait 12 months or more for their claims to be heard.  This results in extended economic hardship on workers and their families, particularly at a time when the level of unemployment is high and when there is little alternative employment is available.  As Mr. O'Sullivan pointed out, these delays also impact on the employability of the claimants in that many employers will not hire a worker who has a claim in progress or in the system.  We hold, therefore, that serious claims such as those relating to unfair dismissals must be heard within a reasonable period in order that claimants will not be penalised twice.  The workers at Connolly Shoes to whom I refer were unfairly dismissed in March 2010.  They receive a favourable award against their employer in December 2011 and they have still not received one cent of this money.  Over &euro;100,000 is due to these four workers who, collectively, gave over 100 years' service to the same employer.  They continue to chase said employer, who has established and closed myriad companies in the interim and changed the names and places of business of these on an almost monthly basis.  He has done all of this in a effort to avoid his responsibilities.  He is protected under the limited liability status relating to directors but our members have been forced onto the dole.</p><p>  The enforeability of awards is a serious issue.  On the making of an award by the tribunal, parties have six weeks to decide whether to appeal the decision to the Circuit Court.  Should either party exercise their right of appeal, the matter will then be referred to the Circuit Court.  Again, this will involve further delays and costs.  In the case of Connolly Shoes, the matter was not appealed and we were obliged, on behalf of our members, to seek an enforcement order in the Circuit Court.  If an employer refuses to pay or ignores an award of the tribunal, the claimant or claimants must go to the Circuit Court to seek such an order and bear the resultant costs that arise.  The order is then given to the sheriff to enforce, either by securing the award or by ceasing goods to the value of the award.  If an award is reinstatement, it is extremely difficult to cease goods to the value thereof.  However, this is what the law dictates at present.  The real problem arises in cases where the employer is a limited company, either in dormant status - that is, it is not filing returns to the Companies Registration Office - or has no assets.  Named directors are protected by limited status and this allows them to place their assets beyond the reach of workers.  This means that the rights of workers whose claims have been adjudicated upon by a tribunal of this State cannot be vindicated.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.863" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rhona Murphy" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2013071800005#E00300"><p>We are grateful to be invited to make submissions to the committee this morning.  We will confine the submission to the matters referred to in the invitation from the committee to IBEC.  They do not relate to all of IBEC's concerns on the operation of the employment rights bodies.  We are feeding into the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation separately on those matters.</p><p>  We have been provided by the committee with a summary of the petitioner's complaints and suggestions on the EAT.  Unfortunately, it appears that the petitioner is under several misapprehensions regarding the EAT and its operation.  Several of his assertions furnished to us appear to be factually incorrect and several of his suggestions for change would lead to what we perceive as a significant injustice for employers who are already struggling in the current climate.  We deal with the complaints in the sequence provided in the letter we received.</p><p>  In response to assertion No. 1, that the cost of bringing a complaint to the tribunal has to be paid by the complainant, that is not correct.  There is no cost to bringing a complaint to the tribunal.  It is free.  It is also free to bring a complaint to a rights commissioner, the Labour Relations Commission, the Labour Court and the Equality Tribunal.  That causes a significant problem for employers and a large waste of money for the State because many employees take frivolous and vexatious claims against their employers and then do not bother to show up to the hearing.  I do not refer to the case presented by Mr. O'Sullivan but it is our general experience.  It happens hundreds of times each year, especially at the rights commissioner hearings, causing enormous waste of taxpayers' money.</p><p>  The jurisdiction of the EAT in unfair dismissal cases is two years' worth of the claimant's salary.  In most cases, that greatly exceeds &euro;38,000, which is the jurisdiction of the High Court.  If a person wants to bring proceedings in the High Court, they must pay a fee of &euro;138.  If they want to bring proceedings in the Circuit Court, they must pay stamp duty of &euro;68.  If they want to bring proceedings to the Small Claims Court, they must pay &euro;25.  In the latter court the cap on awards is in the region of &euro;1,000.</p><p>  IBEC has consistently submitted that it should cost the same, at a minimum, to bring a claim to the EAT that it costs to bring one to the Small Claims Court.  We have made representations to that effect as part of the employment rights bodies' reform consultation process initiated by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The introduction of this measure would raise a small amount of money for the State and would reduce the number of frivolous claims by people who have no intention of attending a hearing.  Ireland is an outlier in this regard compared with other countries.  In the UK there is a proposal to introduce staggering of fees to have a hearing before the employment tribunal.  To have a claim heard before the tribunal will cost &pound;1,200 and there will be an issuing fee of &pound;400.  The fee we propose is modest but it would go some way towards reducing what we have experienced as a number of frivolous and vexatious claims, which cause an inordinate amount of trouble for an employer who still has to prepare the case, bring witnesses out of the workplace and defend the proceedings.</p><p>  Assertion No. 2 is that the employer is under no obligation to pay the award.  That is not the case.  An employer has a legal obligation to pay an award ordered by the EAT.  That obligation can be enforced through the Circuit Court, which can require interest to be paid on the award.  It is similar to any other legal rights that are exercised in the courts.  That is the process that is universally applied.  Only a tiny number of enforcement proceedings are brought each year, because the great majority of employers comply promptly with EAT awards.  The kind of case which we heard about today is very much in the minority.  It is relatively rare that employees are forced to proceed to enforcement proceedings or to recover from the insolvency fund.</p><p>  Assertion No. 3 is that the claimant must then pursue the employer through the courts for payment.  An award by the EAT is the equivalent of a debt which the employer owes to the claimant.  The only appropriate way to pursue unpaid debts is through the courts.  It is the same for a contract debt or any other kind of debt.</p><p>  On assertion No. 4, the need for engagement of a legal team by the claimant, neither claimants nor employers need to engage legal teams in the EAT.  From my experience of it I find that where a party appears unrepresented the tribunal makes every effort to facilitate him or her in the running of the case.  The EAT was designed to be "lawyer free" but many claimants and employers choose to represent themselves in proceedings.  The EAT is very supportive of unrepresented parties.  The procedures of the EAT are flexible, and particular flexibility is shown to unrepresented parties.  From our observations based on looking at the previous annual report of the Employment Appeals Tribunal it would appear to us that legal representation is used in approximately 50% of cases.  The use of legal representation is approximately the same split between employers and employees, or at least the differentiation is negligible.</p><p>  The EAT also facilitates representation of claimants by trade unions, and of employers by employer organisations such as IBEC.  The quality of representation is excellent and such parties do not have to pay for such representation, as it is included as part of their membership subscription.  Some parties choose to retain their own legal representation at the EAT.  That is their absolute right, but if they want such representation, they have to pay for it themselves.</p><p>  On assertion No. 5, that there is a lack of power on the part of the tribunal to enforce its judgments, as I mentioned previously, an award by the EAT is the equivalent of a debt which the employer owes to the claimant and the only way to recover that is through the courts.  In terms of the suggestion that an employer should be required to lodge a bond as security, we would fear that would be a charter for employees to bankrupt employers by lodging unlimited numbers of spurious claims.  It would penalise employers before any award had been made against them.  It would be completely unjust and entirely unconstitutional.  Such an approach would render their work almost impossible, in particular in the difficult trading circumstances in which most employers operate at the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.865" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Vernon Hegarty" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2013071800006#F00200"><p>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, thanks the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions for the opportunity to provide observations on the issue of costs associated with taking a case through the EAT.</p><p>  There has been much discussion about the shortcomings of the tribunal.  However, it is important to remember from where it came.  It was set out to be a relatively informal and inexpensive way for employees to vindicate their employment rights in certain areas of employment law.  With its transformation from the redundancy tribunal to the EAT, it has, as rightly described by the petitioner, become not all together a friendly place.  As a trade union advocate I know many individual workers who are not members of a trade union being dissuaded from taking their cases to the EAT because the other side has access to better legal resources.  This is very far from what the tribunal was intended to be at its inception.  It was to allow ordinary working people access to a forum without the requirement of legal or, indeed, trade union representation.  As an advocate with the Citizens Information Board, I have seen it turn into a forum with senior counsels and solicitors with stacks of files on the other side of the table.  This might be addressed in the legislation.</p><p>  The petitioner has raised his experience of appearing at a tribunal.  There are no costs to workers in accessing the EAT.  Representation costs for trade union members have been paid for through their trade union subscriptions.  The Minister has suggested the possibility of costs attaching to complaints or where referrals or applications are being made to the tribunal into the future, along with the possibility that provision for cost may be included in the workplace reform Bill.  SIPTU, along with other trade union colleagues, is opposed to the introduction of such costs.  We consider such a move anti-worker as it would have the effect of placing unnecessary hardship on workers and act as a deterrent in the vindication of employment rights.  Such a move has been mooted in the UK with fees ranging from &pound;250 to &pound;950 for unfair dismissal cases and &pound;350 for unpaid wages cases.  These are retrograde steps and inconsistent with the tribunal&rsquo;s purpose.</p><p>  The cost of enforcing a decision or determination handed down in favour of a worker by the EAT is also met by his or her trade union.  In this regard, the Minister&rsquo;s proposal that enforcement may be possible through the District Court, as opposed to the Circuit Court, is a welcome move in bringing enforcement costs down.  Any measure the Minister introduces to bring costs down brings us closer to the original purpose of the EAT, namely easy access to the vindication of employment rights.  We would like to see the Labour Court playing a role in this in an effort to drive costs down further.</p><p>  The retrieval of debts owed and the enforcement of determinations in decisions by third parties against employers who are technically but not legally insolvent remains an issue of grave concern to our members.  Ever since the introduction of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984, there is a gap in this regard.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.868" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Vernon Hegarty" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2013071800007#G00300"><p>It flies in the face of those with outstanding debts that cannot be accessed and who have no recourse in law to recover those debts.  That is particularly aggravating and degrading to the employees involved.</p><p>  Understandably, this comes as a great surprise to workers affected.  The cost of pursuing a company which effectively only exists on paper is prohibitive when balanced against the award they will have received from a third party in respect of unpaid wages - minimum notice, unfair dismissal claims, etc., as outlined.  Many members will also be aggrieved that their employer can start up another company somewhere else, very close by or even in the same building, as has been pointed out.  This contrasts sharply with the situation for redundancy payments as well as for insolvency situations provided for in the Act.  On receiving a payment from the State in these situations, the State stands in the shoes of the worker and can pursue the company for monies owed.  The Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984 and the European directive to which the Act give effect both envisage insolvency situations other than those currently provided for under the Act, that is, liquidation, receivership or the death of the employer.  As the Act also provides for the pursuance of employers and companies by the State in an insolvency situation, there does not appear to be an insurmountable barrier in dealing with a company that is insolvent in these situations thereby protecting workers against such behaviour by employers and placing the debt back on the employer where it should properly reside.  We submit that this is the just amendment that needs to be made.  It has been suggested prior to this by ICTU that section 4(2) of the Act empowers the Minister to make just such an amendment by regulation.  That would be the swiftest means by which these workers who have remained without these protections many years could be helped.  If members have any further questions, I would happy to take them.  </p></speech>

In the circumstances, I do not propose to address the issues in such great detail in my opening statement.  However, both I and the other members of the Department's delegation would be happy to address any questions or issues which the committee may wish to raise in respect of the matter.  I will deal with the broader issues raised in this petition which relate to the delays and costs of bringing a complaint before the EAT, the need to employ a legal team, the difficulty of enforcing an award of the tribunal and the qualifications of liquidators. </p><p>  I will firstly provide an update in respect of the ongoing reform of the State's existing employment rights and industrial relations structures and will then briefly address the specific issues raised in the petition.  It is essential that we have efficient and effective mechanisms to develop harmonious and productive workplaces and to assist employers and employees to avoid and resolve disputes.  It is clear that the system which has evolved over the past number of decades did not achieve this.  The system was frustrating for employers, employees and professionals representing them.  Notwithstanding the efforts of the EAT and others to reduce backlogs, the Minister believes the delays that users of the service are experiencing are unacceptable.  </p><p>  It is for these reasons that the Minister is undertaking a root-and-branch reform of all five workplace relations bodies.  The reform programme that has commenced aims to deliver a world-class workplace relations structure.  The Minister proposes to establish a two-tier workplace relations structure which means that upon establishment of the new structures, two statutorily independent bodies will replace the current five.  We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the workplace relations commission, WRC, and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court.  All complaints will be dealt with by a single body of first instance where the aim will be to have a hearing within three months from the time the case is lodged.</p></speech>

I thank everybody for their contributions and submissions to this discussion, particularly John O&rsquo;Sullivan.  When his petition came before us it rang bells for many of us because we had seen similar situations occurring elsewhere.  As John Douglas has said, it rang bells for me in respect of the situation in Connolly Shoes in D&uacute;n Laoghaire where, like Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan, people have been fighting this unacceptable situation in which employers seem to be able, with a large degree of impunity, to ignore the decisions made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal at the expense of workers.  Something has to be done about this.</p><p>  The big question for me is what precisely can we do and I would like the people who have made proposals to flesh out their suggestions.  On the issue of the bond that Mr. O'Sullivan has proposed, how does he respond to the suggestion that this could become an unfair burden on employers as it creates a presumption of guilt on their part, or an unfair burden, because that is what IBEC seems to be saying?  I would like to hear IBEC respond to this point because I do not believe that there are huge numbers of vexatious complaints.  I do not think that people take complaints willy-nilly, for no reason at all.  Mr. O'Sullivan might give us some evidence to back that up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.880" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Vernon Hegarty" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2013071800012#O00200"><p>No.  The Protection of Employees (Employers Insolvency) Act, deals with those specific situations where individual workers - or groups of workers sometimes - fall without the narrow restrictive definitions of what constitutes an insolvency for the purposes of the application of that Act.  There are so many people outside of that.  There was a specific recommendation that had to do with amending and affording those people to come within the ambit of the Act.  The Deputy's question is how does one address access.  SIPTU and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have proposed that anything in the reformed Bill that adds costs associated to access - whether it be an enforcement or in prosecuting those cases through the various fora - is contrary to the entire premise under which these fora were set up.  As Mr. O'Sullivan rightly pointed out, these are to do with accessibility and its association with costs.  We raise costs at our peril.  We differ from IBEC in that regard and, indeed, with respect, from Mr. O'Sullivan.  We argue against any associated costs because they are a dissuasion from accessibility.  The move to hearing at a District Court level has been mooted and is progressive.  The costs associated with attendance at the District Court are less than a hearing at the Circuit Court.  Referring those enforcement procedures to the Labour Court would be a step better again in achieving the most complete accessibility and that is what we have proposed.</p></speech>

Connolly Shoes workers have also raised the point with me.  We change the legislation dealing with the insolvency fund so that means - if I understand Mr. Hegarty correctly - that workers can at least get compensation quickly and it stops that blockage.  However, what about the employers who are getting away with murder?  Should there not be a way to chase them up?  We need to address that point also because it really grates with people.  It is not just a question of money, as Mr. O'Sullivan has said.  I know John Mulpetre from Connolly Shoes would make the same point that it is also about justice and the injustice of the public having to pick up the tab for an employer who just ignores the rules, plays fast and loose with the rules and shows complete contempt for the processes.  We need to look at how to address that and how to deal with companies or directors hiding behind limited liability and using shelf companies.  It is an absolute scandal.  What changes are needed in company law in order to address this situation?  If I remember correctly, the situation is similar to the Vita Cortex case with that boss hiding behind different corporate identities in order to evade his responsibilities.  </p><p>  I have a question for the representative from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Have we a slight reason to be concerned that the Department's reforms are just more cuts dressed up as reforms?  That might be my suspicious mind.  It is proposed to merging various bodies.  Like most people I am in favour of streamlining the process.  However, the proposal is that the waiting time will be three months as against the current 12 month and a move from three-person public hearings to one-person, one-to-one, private hearings.  It is proposed that this will be more efficient and a better system and that it will deal with a lot of these problems.  However, I am not quite sure how it could be.  Will it mean fewer resources will be allocated?  How can we be sure the targets will be achieved?  What is the reason for believing the one-to-one hearing is preferable?  I would like to hear more details about the proposals.</p><p>  How does the Minister's Department propose to deal with companies hiding behind limited liability and shelf companies?  This cannot continue.  It is utterly unacceptable and it is happening all over the country.  In the current climate it will continue and something has to be done about it.</p></speech>

I do not have a difficulty with a streamlining of the employment rights bodies and making them more effective for the employee and for the employer.  The new single body of first instance and the new appeals body can work well if properly structured.</p><p>  When will that Bill be before the Houses of the Oireachtas?  Workers and employers need to have certainty.</p><p>  I wish to make some observations and to ask questions arising from Mr. O'Sullivan's contribution and those of the witnesses.  The first three questions relate to penalties for employers who breach employment law sanctions currently in place or perhaps sanctions which are not in place, and the enforcement of awards.  Mr. Niall McCutcheon painted a picture of a service which is very easy to work with and is very worker-friendly.  That is not everyone's experience.  For example, it is not a level playing field for a young worker or any worker in a vulnerable position who takes a court case and is up against an employer's legal team.</p><p>  I can give a personal example.  When I was 20 years of age I took a case to one of the employment rights bodies.  I won my case and an award was made.  I had to go to the Circuit Court twice to have the award enforced.  I never received one single penny, despite the fact that the sheriff served notice on the employer.  I was not a member of a trade union at the time, which was my mistake.  I was a victim of that system and nothing much has changed in the past 20 years for the many people who find themselves in a similar situation.  I found it difficult to listen to the contribution from IBEC which referred to frivolous claims by workers.  Perhaps the representatives can give the committee a definition of what is a frivolous claim. </p><p>  On the question of costs, there may not be a cost involved in taking a case to an employment body as such, but there is a cost involved in terms of time off work.  Even if the claimant is represented by a trade union this is at a cost to the trade union which is passed on to the members through their subscriptions. People who are not members of trade unions will feel the need to have legal representation.  These are the associated costs.  I hope the new regime will correct some of those points.  The sanctions are certainly not strong enough for some employers who blatantly disregard employment rights law.</p></speech>

This is an acknowledged problem and it is referenced in pretty much all employment legislation dating back to the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977.  More recently, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation referred to it in its Blueprint to Deliver A World-Class Workplace Relations Service.  In this document, the Department acknowledges that there are cases which are brought where, for whatever reason, the claimant chooses not to show up and prosecute the claim.  The employer is generally not on notice of this and shows up ready to defend the claim with witnesses in tow and he or she may also have retained legal representation at some expense.  In most cases there is no redress for them.  There are also instances where proceedings are brought and where the claimant shows up but where the actual claim is frivolous and vexatious.  I refer, for example, to a claim for a written statement of terms and conditions of employment where such a statement has already been provided.  Anecdotally, I can inform the committee that I have had that experience on a number of occasions.  That to which I refer does happen.  However, I would not state that it happens in the majority of cases but it does happen in a significant minority of them.  It happens often enough that it causes a problem for employers and needs to be addressed.  The point we made in our submission is that if employers are going to be forced to pay bonds prior to going before the EAT or some other forum, this could potentially lock them into an unenviable and invidious financial situation in respect of claims which ultimately will not even proceed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.887" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Douglas" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2013071800013#P00300"><p>On vexatious cases, it has been my experience that the vast majority of no-shows are on the employers side.  Any workers who have ever attended the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be aware that it is a very daunting experience.  People do not submit claims lightly.  Rather they do so out of pure desperation in order to try to vindicate their rights, which have been abused.  There are huge human and social costs for people who lose their jobs as a result of unfair dismissal.  In the context of cases brought before the Employment Appeals Tribunal under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, there are very few no-shows from the point of view of employees and, for all sorts of reasons, quite a number on the employers side.</p><p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to the moral hazard of opening the gates to the insolvency fund.  There may very well be a moral hazard in that regard in that bad behaviour on the part of bad employers would be rewarded.  Ultimately, however, both employers and employees contribute to the fund.  If an employer or an employee fails to appeal an award within six weeks - or whatever period is specified - and it the employer fails to honour the award, we are of the view that the employee should not be disadvantaged or penalised any further and that he or she should have direct access to the social fund.  The State should prosecute employers who fail to honour awards.  Limited companies give rise to particular problems.  I refer not only to companies which are dormant and still on the books but also to those which are not dormant but which just refuse to pay.  The State should seek attachment orders in respect of these companies or perhaps it should even consider lifting the veil of limited liability away from their directors and making them personally liable for the payment of awards.  The latter might force directors to wind up their affairs in an orderly way.  In the case of companies which are insolvent, a carrot-and-stick approach must be used to encourage directors to wind them up in this way.</p><p>  The books kept by the Companies Registration Office are littered with companies that are dormant.  When these companies do not make returns, they are eventually struck off.  Essentially, this involves directors failing to wind up their business affairs in an orderly fashion and it can cause ongoing problems for employees in the context of vindicating their rights and obtaining awards.  I suggest that when the six-week appeal period has ended and an appeal has not been lodged by an employer and in the event of the employer or the limited company involved not paying the award which has been adjudicated on by the tribunal, the worker should have access to the insolvency fund.  The State should then step in on behalf of the worker and the taxpayer and pursue the directors personally in respect of the matter.  Such directors should have the veil of limited liability lifted away from them.  In such circumstances, directors would think twice about not paying awards or not winding up their business affairs - in the context of liquidations or receiverships - in an orderly manner.  I am of the view that what I have outlined would lead to a big improvement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.888" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Esther Lynch" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2013071800013#P00400"><p>In the context of the points raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett, I am of the view that there is not one single solution.  This is because the problem has different characteristics at different stages when an employee takes his or her complaint forward.  The petitioner is absolutely correct: there are 101 ways in which an employer can frustrate an employee in the context of his or her seeking justice.  In particular, an employer can make navigating the process such a stressful, expensive and difficult experience that the person involved will give up.  Even worse, the experience of such an individual can act as a warning to all other employees of what they will be obliged to face should they come forward to vindicate their employment rights.</p><p>  In the context of the expense involved, if a person is not a member of a trade union then he or she will be obliged to retain a legal representative.  The petitioner is again correct in this regard.  An ordinary person facing questions from a senior counsel sometimes 18 months to two years after the event can quite easily be tripped up and can lose his or her case on a technicality.  Provision must be made in order that people who are not represented by trade unions can obtain justice.  Where we differ from the petitioner is that the solution is not to offer costs against the losing party.  If the petitioner had lost his case, he would have been obliged to pay not only &euro;2,000 to his solicitor but also all of the costs incurred by the employer.  Imagine the chilling effect this could have on people, particularly if their dispute relates to one day's non-payment of <i>force majeure</i> leave.  While we would differ in terms of the solution, I am of the view that the petitioner is absolutely right in that the worst that will happen to an employer is that he, she or it will be obliged to do what should have been done in the first instance.  He was also right to state that compensation should be paid to the person taking the case in respect of the amount of stress he or she endured in pursing the matter.  The latter should be capable of being taken into account.</p><p>  The petitioner's idea with regard to a bond is a good one.  This goes to the second part of the problem, namely, the ease-of-doing-business regime which obtains in Ireland.  There are many benefits to this because it makes it really easy to establish companies.  However, the drawback is that it makes it very easy to establish companies.  Under the regime to which I refer, I could own a small shop on a street in some small town but I might be operating four different companies out of the premises.  These would be completely invisible to the naked eye.  A worker might be of the view that the person for whom he or she is working is his or her employer but this would not actually be the case because that individual is operating four separate companies.</p></speech>

I submitted the petition and got involved in the Employment Appeals Tribunal due to frustration.  I went into the process with the belief that it was an informal, efficient and inexpensive means of finding a solution to my problem and I ended up with four years of total frustration, not on my behalf but on behalf of the employer.  I felt that there were many deficiencies in the system and so many doors closed against my getting justice at the end of the day.  The person who was responsible walked away and gave me, the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the country, the fingers.  The person more or less said that having brought me through the process they were walking away and having a bloody good laugh at me.  That was my reason for making the petition, to try to highlight some of the inefficiencies and inadequacies in the system.</p><p>  Our friend from IBEC said an award could be made of two years&rsquo; salary.  The wording is that one &ldquo;may be&rdquo; awarded.  I have rarely seen a case of such an award.  The other issue is the time delay involved.  Going through the process has put enormous stress on my life and that of my family.  Only for my own ability and determination I would never have got a resolution.  At the end of the day the Department co-operated with me to find a solution but it was mainly due to the frustration caused by the system and my own ability and belief that I could get a resolution.  I said earlier that it was not about money, it was about justice.  I do not want to see other people going through the same process without having a door open for them.  The system is not in place for them to get a resolution in a quick and efficient way.</p><p>  It was said that I could have gone through the courts.  I did go through the courts but the person involved had moved from one door to another and when the sheriff arrived at his door he was told the man did not live there anymore, that he was no longer involved and he could not be touched.  That resulted in more frustration.  I had gone through the legal system.  I could have gone further but did not due to the stress involved and the cost, which is not within the ability of the ordinary person to pay.  The person who has lost a job having been employed for 20 years or 30 years who is fighting such a battle does not have either the finance or, with respect, the intelligence, to pursue the issue.  For that reason I made this representation in the hope that there could be changes in the law so that the onus would be put back on the person who is responsible at the end of the day - let it be the claimant or the employer.  In most cases if an employee is going to fight a case then he or she believes in all honesty that he or she is right.  There has been an insinuation that people do not turn up for cases but if they have genuine cases and believe they will get a quick and efficient response they will go through the process.  However, I hope they will not have to go through what I experienced, namely, four years, to get a solution and at the end of the day the person responsible took no responsibility and was not punished in any way and it ended up that the Government had to pay me my insolvency.</p></speech>

Deputy Boyd Barrett questioned me on the reason for the exercise and whether it was an exercise in cuts in disguise.  The initiative came very much from those who are involved in dealing with employment rights claims.  Five organisations have overlapping and sometimes completely separate objectives and operations.  Even experienced legal practitioners found the system difficult to comprehend.  Claims were often referred to the wrong forum or under the wrong statute.  Sometimes the claims became statute barred due to the delay.  There is a lack of consistency in some cases between the bodies and sometimes within the bodies regarding the procedures to be followed.</p><p>  The system is overly legalistic.  A set of circumstances may arise in respect of a single relationship between an employer and an employee which could give rise to claims within up to four different fora.  The idea is to try to pool the resources we have and to provide a service in which one hearing can dispose of all the disputes between a single employer and an employee.  That in itself is a good thing.  If one pools resources the situation would be more efficient and cost effective but the focus is not on saving money, as such.  The focus is on providing a better service for people such as the petitioner and employers and employees generally.</p><p>  Senator Cullinane inquired about the legislation.  I am currently in discussion with the parliamentary draftsman on the legislation and we hope to be in a position to publish the Bill in October of this year.  In the meantime, steps are being taken within the existing legal framework to improve efficiency.</p></speech>

The penalties for breaches of these in many cases have increased too.  The ODCE, Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, has also been given additional powers, such as the power to wind up a company with a courts&rsquo; permission.</p><p>  On the point made by ICTU of companies acting as a group and hiving off assets to another to avoid paying creditors and employees, section 600 will cover that.  It is specifically designed to deal with cases where assets are split.  The Bill provides a creditor can petition the courts to take moneys from the other related company to pay the debt of the insolvent one.  The current legislation provides the amount for defining a creditor is one to whom a company is indebted in a sum exceeding &euro;12,600.  This has now been reduced to &euro;10,000, a lower onus on the employee, accordingly.</p><p>  The Companies Bill has been ten years in drafting.  It has been a collaborative work with the Law Society, IBEC and the trade unions, as well as other interested parties.  Considerable attempts have been made to balance the requirements to encourage enterprise with the strengthening of directors&rsquo; duties.  Although the Bill is on Second Stage, the Department is still welcoming suggestions from interested parties.  Since it was published in December, we have had hundreds of suggested amendments.  All suggestions will be considered on Committee Stage in the autumn.</p></speech>

Normally, an individual, a union or ourselves, on behalf of the Minister, can take a case to the Circuit Court.  It is not a successful method.  In 2011, there were over 800,000 in awards referred to us between the EAT and the Labour Court.  We collected 88,000 of these.  In 2012, there 453,000 in awards referred to us, of which we received 105,000.</p><p>  Normally what happens is a complainant asks us to take a case on their behalf.  We generally have a look at the insolvency of the case because in many cases the business has ceased or the employer is on social welfare.  We have problems when it is in the limbo area of being abandoned.  The proposed legislation provides for civil enforcement, which works in some cases, and criminal prosecution.  In certain areas, we are provided with the powers to go after directors.  Section 37(3) of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 is one such provision.</p></speech>

I can only imagine the perseverance and the effort on his part.  I know what it takes to pit oneself against the expertise of everyone else.  Many people who have lost their job have probably never heard of the EAT and the apparatus around it.  Those who face it can lose their confidence in the system when jargon and acronyms are used at a session.  We can all fool ourselves that we are trying to create a system that is easy and accessible when in fact it is a difficult task.  I welcome the proposals on the establishment of a workplace relations commission.</p><p>  It is unfair of IBEC to suggest employees are confident in defending themselves.  It is risible to suggest that someone could become an expert in employment law immediately.  The argument it does not cost anything is also risible.  Of course, it costs the minute someone loses their job and has to take advice on how they might take on the apparatus of the State and their employer.  I am disappointed IBEC claimed frivolous and vexatious claims are made.  Of course, there will always be people who will try it on.  This is not the point of this exercise.  Mr. O&rsquo;Sullivan was saying he did not want what happened to him to happen to others.  We can also get into the frivolous and vexatious behaviour on the part of employers.  I am very disappointed by the tone IBEC took.  This is about progressing and making the system better.</p></speech>

We have seen how SUSI was clearly set up in good faith to make that system better.  I am not saying the Department's system is the same but sometimes when people start bringing things together and amalgamating them with language about making it better or world-class, some things that were there get lost in the rush of enthusiasm that takes over.  I would be very concerned, as the expression goes, that they would have the confidence to represent themselves.  I am not convinced that what we have seen in respect of this legislation will provide that.  The three months' waiting time is, again, a great aspiration.  Given what representatives from the Department have said about the great backlog for the EAT, without a serious effort to put something in place that would really take on that acknowledged backlog, I am not entirely convinced that we will see any improvement.  I suspect that if there are a number of cases arising, it is because people are becoming more educated, interested, able and willing to take people on in a way they perhaps did not do before.  I am not sure whether we are not just moving the chairs and tables around on the deck.</p><p>  The representatives from IBEC say that frivolous and vexatious claims happen hundreds of times, particularly at the rights commissioner hearing.  I do not know the figures but if one was to take the rights commissioner hearings out of it, is IBEC really saying that this is also the case with regard to the EAT?  Sometimes, I find people put in one thing to confound another and to make us feel that there is a lot of waste going on.  </p><p>  In respect of the bond, I take the point made by the Department that it has examined this.  It says there is a difficulty with it.  I wonder about the suggestion made by Mr. O'Sullivan about a guarantee.  Is there a point possibly after the first part at which a bond could be paid?  I feel we could be more creative rather than just ruling it out and saying "No" to a bond.  In its review and drafting of the legislation, could the Department commit to going back to see if there is another version of the bond or bond system?  While IBEC is very keen for employees to pay up-front, it is not so keen for employers to do anything in that regard.  It is encouraging a system whereby employees have to pay for the service.  I am happy that Ireland is an outlier in that matter and believe it should remain so and not charge people to take a case given all the problems that already exist for employees.  </p><p>  I am very welcoming of the procedure.  It is a very complex case and perhaps the lesson for us is that we need a full day for everyone to have their say.  I genuinely welcome the exchange here.  It is extremely useful in respect of Mr. O'Sullivan's case and drills down in a way we do not often get the chance to do because he has been brave enough to let us do so.</p></speech>

At all times, we have been respectful to Mr. O'Sullivan.  At no time did I suggest that his claim was frivolous or vexatious.  This is not my language.  It is language that is reflected in the legislation.  It is acknowledged as a problem by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and has happened to me as a representative in attending cases.</p><p>  In terms of people representing themselves, unfortunately, the only thing that will create an atmosphere where that can be done is by simplifying the legislation.  That is something that IBEC would very much welcome because employers suffer from the complexity of the law just as much as employees.  This suggestion that employers are rolling in money with endless resources to pay for legal representation is a fallacy, particularly at the moment.  What we require here is a little balance.  The ongoing work in the Department is very welcome to that extent.  It is trying to simplify what has become a very unwieldy and complex system.</p></speech>

This sets out the playing pitch atmosphere of much of what happens at employment appeal tribunals and elsewhere.</p><p>  Since our second last break, I have been present with a different status - I have been ejected from formal membership of the committee.  I am here under sufferance of the Oireachtas as a Member who can float around, but I have no committee membership responsibilities.  Perhaps there should be an Oireachtas committee membership appeals tribunal, but there is none currently.</p><p>  I thank and salute Mr. O'Sullivan.  A four-year odyssey is a long time.</p></speech>

It is a long dent in the family, given one's preoccupation with an effort to achieve justice rather than law.</p><p>  I do not buy the claim about frivolous or nuisance appeals.  For example, companies often boast about getting 1,000 applications for one job, none of which are frivolous or nuisances.  People do not always follow up but unless they have submitted their applications, there is no chance of reaching the next step of a just and fair consideration.  I have first-hand experience, as do other members in their wider families, not just of employment appeal tribunals, but of annual assessments of jobs, particularly among trainees in professional services who may spend three or four years on trainee contracts.  Dysfunctional human behaviour in large organisations can be taken out on trainees.  In theory, there is an opportunity to get human relations managers to listen to reports of whatever has transpired.  In reality, the HR departments of large organisations are sanitising divisions for coercive-type behaviour.  I am telling the raw, truthful facts.  I have no ideological position on this matter.</p><p>  As organisations grow bigger, the chasm between justice and law grows wider.  We all know in our hearts and souls where justice lies, that being, in principles, not in law.  If principles are clearly set out, as in a family, we know that there is a better chance of having fairness in behaviour.  If there is a plethora of complex, preconditional and post-conditional rules, one will not get much fairness.  It is an illusion that the more complex the rules become by way of legislation, the greater the need for qualified experts to advocate various potential or theoretical positions.  We have seen this in the D&aacute;il in the past few weeks and now in the Seanad in the context of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill.  We all know the principles involved, but they are getting lost in the maze of legislation.  If I was on a surgical table for a brain transplant - which my enemies would say I needed anyway - a heart operation or neurosurgery, the last aspect that I would want to insist on would be clarity by way of legislation for the surgeons involved.  Provided the surgeon is well trained, well principled and has the patient's best interests at heart, I am happy.  That is life.</p><p>  Similar to law and employment, most of the medicine practised is iatrogenic medicine.  Most people wonder what that is.  It is the medicine that clears up the misdiagnoses and earlier medical procedures of a doctor who dealt with the same patient.  The figure in America is 25%.</p></speech>

We have a world class workplace relations service.  We would all vote for that, just as everyone is in favour of Santa Claus at Christmas.  However, employers are usually better resourced unless they have entered into difficulty.  Fairness and principles can still be achieved through just people listening to the facts of cases and eliminating delays.</p><p>  I commend Mr. O'Sullivan on his clear, concrete, seven-section document.  It addresses the realities.  With institutions and establishments, the danger is that people get lost in theories and hypothetical, abstract language.  I have nothing against certain personalities.  It is the way that language works.  This is like Leaders' Questions, as the Chairman knows.  Questions are asked in obtuse, obfuscated language in the third person and using the passive tense.  The answers are the same.  There is no engagement on ideas or communication.  Imagine if we used this language across the dinner table at home.  We would get nowhere and there would be rows, resentments, etc.</p><p>  The objective is to declutter.  If there are five establishments or institutions, we should knock heads and bring them together.  The people involved are well trained and well qualified.  Some of them have masters, PhDs or professional qualifications.  We should simplify.  For example, there are seven headings in this document.  What are the practical experiences under these?</p><p>  My experience was with the insurance ombudsman years ago.  It related to an endowment policy that had substantially been missold.</p></speech>

We must move on with questions.  They have been disrupted a number of times.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.917" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1183" speakername="Peter Mathews" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2013071800019#V00100"><p>I am not just referring to cases of employment.  I mean job loss, employment appeal or tribunal situations and other areas of annual appraisals.  For instance, the young doctors whom we saw on television.  It is absurd that they must work 24-hour non-stop stints.  I would be worried entering an accident and emergency unit if the doctor treating me had worked 24 hours.  Doctors are also under pressure to supply the middle management of the HSE with head count budgets of this and that procedure.  That is wrong, plain and simple.</p><p>  With regard to the establishment, I salute Mr. John O'Sullivan who has done his bit.  We must take a leaf from his doggedness, determination, honesty and fairness in what he did.  I know what it is like because I have fought those battles.  It is only when people realise that one is not going to give up and will continue to talk in true and fair terms that eventually turns the heavy iron door of the establishment and one is allowed enter.  Determination, etc., does not always work though in situations that can be replicated in large numbers, for example, making a claim with 25,000 people in similar circumstances.  In that instance the wagons form a circle and the establishment rejects the case until it becomes a major bomb or keg of dynamite with an ever shortening fuse.</p><p>  With regard to the defined benefit pension funds, we must be brave and courageous.  We must step up to the plate and describe the material in easily measured categories that are simple to understand.  Every picture of the people can be divided into 12 sections like a jigsaw which is put together to make a picture.  We can do the same for employment, training, appraisals and all of that.  There are everyday ways of making it sensible to measure, describe, discuss and reach agreements.  We should slim down the lever arch files to just six page documents with charts, pictures and bars in order to get a handle on what must be agreed, in principle, and then send the instructions and directions around to put the measures into effect. </p><p>  We must remember that the single person represents justice.  The establishment has multiple layers of professional qualifications and multi-head-counts so there will be huge case law.  That means that people will go around and build up costs.  The single individual can, in principle, just show the facts.  They are obvious to people who want to see them but that does not always happen.  There are always obstacles along the way.  The first could be a cost of entry.  There should not be a cost of entry.  One could think that a case did not become a formal complaint and, therefore, the first stage was nuisance, vexatious or frivolous but that would not be the case.  I would expect that way of thinking because people will learn that a claim is a bigger mountain to climb and he or she may have other things to do.  He or she might have had a new baby and will not want to waste four years of their lives banging their heads against the establishment.  </p><p>  Also, when people exist in this limbo of uncertainty, with questions all over the place, their peers begin to doubt them, and think they are odd and have a problem.  That is not fair either.  Sometimes there are twisted malevolent people in powerful middle management positions in the public service, private industry or whatever.  Those people are not nice and they are very hard to deal with.  They are malevolent and destructive.  I have outlined the things to watch out for and that is my full contribution with my new status.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.919" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1183" speakername="Peter Mathews" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2013071800019#V00300"><p>The vote I left the meeting to attend was turfing me out of the committee.  It was like turkeys voting for Christmas.<br /><b>Deputy Charles Flanagan:</b> I, too, commend the courage and tenacity of Mr. O'Sullivan.  We will only do him a service if we conclude the hearing, if not today, or on a future occasion by seeing what progress we can make within the frame of the seven points as raised by Mr. O'Sullivan.</p><p>  I wish to bring the debate back to discussing remedies that the committee might pursue or provide for him.  I missed the start of Deputy Boyd Barrett's contribution and he may have raised the following matter.  It is essential that we examine statistics.</p><p>  I listened to the exchange between Ms Murphy and Mr. Douglas on frivolous claims, no-shows and non-compliance.  Surely the Department has a list of all of the cases and is in a position to say how many of them have been frivolous.  I do not mean those that are lodged with a frivolous objective.  I mean cases that have been ruled frivolous by a commissioner or a hearing conducted by the employment appeals tribunal.  We should also know the percentage of no-shows.  Are there no-shows on the part of the employer?  Are there no-shows on the part of the employee?  I am surprised that people have speculated about them and adopted positions.  We should know whether it was the employer or the employee.  These are matters of fact so lets have the details.  </p><p>  I wish to comment briefly on the difficult matter of costs.  I am anxious to see how the Department handles costs under the new regime.  It seems to me, in spite of what Ms Murphy has said, an employee may go to a hearing and be met by a senior counsel with tomes of law books and case law so he or she just does not stand a chance.  In the district court one does not have a senior counsel so it seems bizarre for senior counsel to appear at an employment appeals tribunal.  Does it happen?  I would say not.  However, the delegation is engaged in such appeals and has told me that it does happen.  It is a pretty poor show, in terms of justice, that somebody with no representation is pitted again senior counsel.  That is so unfair.  It would get an appeal off to a bad start and deters people lodging an appeal in the first instance.  </p><p>  I wish to make a brief point on bonds.  I have not been convinced by the argument made by the Minister that a bond is either ridiculous or introduces a lack of parity to the system.  I am not so sure that there is parity in the system <i>ab initio</i>.  What about a motor care situation?  The driver of the motor car is obliged to have insurance, the vehicle is obliged under law to be covered but that does not mean that the passenger needs insurance.  I remain unconvinced by the Minister's argument for the bond and Mr. O'Sullivan has made a good case.  The committee should follow up the matter.  The arguments put forward by the Minister are not watertight.  </p><p>  With regard to lifting the veil on incorporation and limited liability, Mr. Padraig Dooley mentioned an exemption.  Has the Department plans to expand and develop it further in the context of the company law review group?  I am sure the matter was referred to in terms of corporate responsibility as distinct from individual responsibility.  This is a huge issue because it strikes at the heart of the corporate entity.  If there is a way in which the Department feels it might be reasonable, in the circumstances, to expand and develop it regarding employee's rights and entitlement then we should examine the matter.</p><p>  It is good to see that a number of Mr. O'Sullivan's grievances have been dealt with under the new legislation.  For example, the appointment of the liquidators, the timing of the hearing in terms of the delay and the standard formula of awards.  It would be difficult to put the latter in standard form but I am sure that reference will be made, in the context of the legislation, to how the awards are formed in terms of the hearing. </p><p>  I wish to make a final point.  The issue here is not justice but the evasion of justice.  The law and the new legislation is based on justice.  It goes without saying that the law should be just, fair and reasonable.  What happens when one of the parties decides to opt out?  What sanctions will be applied?  How can we, as legislators, be assured that parties will play within the system at all times?</p></speech>

This is a very interesting exposition not just of employment law but of company law, how it operates and how Mr. O'Sullivan and others like him have been affected.  Some of what he said will resonate with many people who find themselves in his situation.  They may not have looked into it as much as he has but none the less, he raises very interesting points.  I also welcome the other witnesses.</p><p>  Employment law is relatively recent compared to other areas of law, such as property law.  For the most part, employment law is about the rights of employees and creating those rights.  We have been brought up to speed since 1972 and our involvement in Europe, especially in the areas of equality between the sexes, pay and so on, and it has developed from there.</p><p>  A frustration has been expressed here in regard to the very technical nature of employment law.  There are reasons for that and there are broad principles underlining the whole employment law area based fundamentally, I suppose, in contract and then modified after that to avoid these broad principles constantly having to be interpreted in courts.  We have quasi-judicial bodies, such as the Employment Appeals Tribunal and rights commissioners, to examine a codified piece of legislation to establish rights.  That gets down to the nuts and bolts of things.  The demand is there for this level of detail in that these laws did not come about by accident.  We are not all suddenly here wondering why we have such a technical area of law.  It is there because of pressure to make the rights of employees clearer.</p><p>  Ms Murphy is here representing IBEC.  However, the vast majority of businesses in this country are SMEs and from my experience, many of them are as overwhelmed as Mr. O'Sullivan in dealing with the whole area of employment law.  These people may employ one person or two people.  Whether employers or employees, one can have rotten apples in both camps and I certainly have encountered that.  I practise as a solicitor and, to some extent, have seen it from both sides.  Many of these small businesses feel very oppressed by the obligations on them.  Even if one has an employee who is useless - excuse the word - at his or her job, it is very hard to get rid of him or her.  Obviously, that is not from where Mr. O'Sullivan is coming but it is the truth.  It takes up so much time and in the meantime one is trying to run one's business.  This is not an easy area.</p><p>  In partial defence of Ms Murphy, in terms of her language, we are always being reprimanded here for language and how politically correct-----</p></speech>

It does no harm.</p><p>  We also see frivolous cases being taken under the planning code, which can hold up projects.  That goes with the territory.  I would have to agree with Senator O'Keeffe in that regard.  It is daunting for employers.</p><p>  We are getting into all sorts of conundrums trying to protect against this situation.  Let us face it, we are not just talking about employees here.  We are talking about people who hide behind the corporate veil and do all sorts of things, which they seem to get away with.  People set up limited companies for no other reason than the fact they could trade in whatever way they liked.  There are laws that require them to conduct themselves in a certain way but we know that does not happen.</p><p>  Yesterday, we dealt with the Construction Contracts Bill and it is the same story.  People traded recklessly, to say the least, and left disaster in their wake.  I understand the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> for company law.  All capitalist societies need to have it and we want to encourage people to speculate and be risk takers but there comes a point when we must acknowledge that the cost of that is externalised.  It is externalised for  Mr. O'Sullivan, for subcontractors who do not get paid and for the State which must trump up money from an insolvency fund but people get away with it.  It is not that many of these people who abuse the corporate veil are left destitute.  They are not left destitute because they are clever enough to have their assets transferred to a spouse or otherwise.  We see that happening.  </p><p>  As we evolve as a society, it is a challenge for us to lay down the gauntlet.  Our company law, in particular, has been responsible for cultivating a mind-set of recklessness, no more than the financial recklessness which went on in this country.  The larger the profile of the person, the harder it is to get him or her.  I welcome the comments that some of these things will be tackled, which is definitely overdue.  </p><p>  We are all very familiar with the painful stories of people who are in debt and who made the wrong decision about buying.  Many people bought their houses at wrong time and now face personal insolvency but they are taking responsibility for their actions.  It is not right for employers to act recklessly and think somebody else will pay the price for their adventures in business.  If we can curb that sort of thing, we are doing society a justice.  It costs time, money and effort when it is entertained.  We need to rethink this.</p><p>  Companies have been protected for too long by the corporate veil, which not pierced enough.  The Statute Book covers fraud, etc., and there is a fine line there but in terms of calibrating the rights and learning from the mess of the Celtic tiger, I hope this will be addressed in the company law legislation.  Dialogue is needed about responsibility in the broader sense.  </p><p>  I refer to some of the points raised by Mr. O'Sullivan, including damages and the concern that people are simply doing what they should have been doing in the first place.  I wonder about punitive or aggravated damages in this context.  The complaint was that there is not a standard formula which, I presume, leaves some discretion towards punitive-type damages.  There is only so far one can go with de-formalising these things because one is talking about somebody asserting a legal right.  There must, therefore, be a forensic examination of evidence to arrive at a well-grounded decision that somebody's rights have been breached.</p></speech>

The Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions is innovative and allows a petitioner or citizen to bring their concerns to the Oireachtas.  If we as parliamentarians see a wider policy area, we want to bring all the parties together to see if we can assist in change.  Although we have been sitting for a long time today it has been a constructive and valuable contribution to the process of change.</p></speech>

I echo his thanks to the witnesses for their patience.  Somebody else raised the matter of the numbers that ought to be available and I had in fact asked whether IBEC had the numbers.  I do not think Mr. O'Sullivan came back to me with any figures.  I was arguing with Mr. O'Sullivan about the Rights Commission hearing.  Does Mr. O'Sullivan have the figures for the Employment Appeals Tribunal as to the number of failings on either side?  I do not know whether IBEC has these figures.</p><p>  I had asked the officials from the Department if a commitment would be given - I ask then to forgive me if they have done so in my absence - to review the bond issue in light of the conversation today to see if there is a creative way in which Mr. O'Sullivan and others might benefit from that, in terms of the employer having to make that commitment,.</p><p>  Will the officials also make a comment on the waiting period of three months?  That seems a very fine ambition, but I do not know how it will be achieved and, in particular, the way the structure will be together.  I would appreciate an observation on this.</p></speech>

I think companies have limited liability in place to deal with transactions and trading, so that if they go bad it does not expose the owners of the business to personal liability.  Employment has a personal relationship dimension to it.  It has responsibilities, it is not just rights.  There are responsibilities, when one is employed by somebody.  One is acting as an agent for that person or company.  It is a more complex relationship.  That must be mirrored in any thinking around fairness in this area.  When a person takes a case it brings major challenges to him or her because he or she is open to exposure at multiple levels, not just in the person's employment record but his or her personal situation comes under scrutiny as does everything about him or her.  It takes a great act of bravery and courage to go into this arena.  That must be expressly recognised.  Who wants to go before an Employment Appeals Tribunal?  I have had a great deal of life and professional experience, but I would find it daunting.  It is awesome.  That needs to be taken into account.  May I make one suggestion to all the people who are involved in delivering this world class workplace relations service - that Mr. O'Sullivan would be co-opted on to the project team.  He has shown his abilities, his undoubted experience.  He has an excellent temperament and I would be the first to propose that he be a member of such a project team-----</p></speech>

The joint committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions is novel and provides a welcome process whereby petitioners can petition on areas of concern to ordinary citizens.  I thank the Deputies for taking time from their busy schedule to come in to listen to our stories.</p><p>  I hope the committee will indulge me for about two minutes to refer to Deputy Mulherin's comment on special damages.  We have had a very good discussion about the problems and I hope the officials will bring back to the relevant Ministers the very serious problems that are being caused to ordinary citizens as workers in pursuing their rights, particularly when those rights have been adjudicated to be abused.  There is a man in the Visitors Gallery who is a member of Mandate trade union and he is lucky that we have the resources to prosecute his claim as far as necessary.  Mr. John Mulpeter went to work in Connolly Shoes in D&uacute;n Laoghaire 38 years ago.  He is not unusual in that three other members of staff had 38 years service.  His employer sacked all four staff on the one day back in 2010, without any reason whatsoever.  John has an excellent employee record.  He had never been on strike and had never had any disciplinary decisions against him but found himself unemployed.  Eventually in 2011 John Mulpeter ended up before the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  He and the other three staff were represented by the Mandate trade union.  Mr. Mulpeter was awarded &euro;1,600.  His colleague with the same amount of service was awarded &euro;53,295 for unfair dismissals.  Both were sacked and had the same length of service, so one would ask why was there such a discrepancy?  The reason was this was a question of special damages. Mr. John Mulpeter suffered a heart attack due to the stress of being sacked and being on the picket line.  John was not therefore adjudicated by the trade union to be available for work, so therefore he suffered no loss.  Not only was he penalised by losing his job but because he suffered a heart attack due to the stress of losing his job, his award was more or less wiped out.</p><p>  Mr. Mulpeter is still picketing that store one day a week.  We can get neither his &euro;1,600 award nor the &euro;53,295 for the other three members of staff, Mr. Pat Byrne, Damian Keegan and Susan Tighe.  As far as Mr. Mulpeter and his fellow workers were concerned, they worked for Connolly Shoes but when we lifted the veil of corporate secrecy behind those companies, we discovered there were five companies.  John Mulpeter and his colleagues worked for a company with no assets, which still makes an annual return every year to the Company Registration Office, with a return of zero in trading and the same list of directors.  It is not insolvent, it has not been placed in insolvency, so therefore Mr. Mulpeter has no access to his rights.  We have an enforcement order on behalf of Mr. Mulpeter and his colleagues.  The Sheriff has been down to the shop.  The employer picks out a receipt and shows that the stock on the shelves is owned by the company named on the receipt, the premises is owned by a different company and the order the sheriff has is against a company which has not assets.  The only thing that remains for the trade union to do on Mr. Mulpeter's behalf is to go to the High Court, at great expense, but we will do it, to wind that company up to give Mr. Mulpeter and his colleagues access to the insolvency fund.</p><p>  Why should bad behaviour be rewarded?  Why should the State not put a charge on that company and its directors?  Why should those directors not be banned from ever serving as a company director again?  There are associated companies all over the place linked to that company to which the assets have been moved.</p></speech>

The Rights Commissioner hearings at the moment are all in private.  There is a good reason for that.  In many of these cases we want to maintain the relationship between the employer and employee which is an ongoing relationship.  The type of approach there should involve mediation and getting to an agreed solution, exactly the type of thing about which we have been talking.  There is a strong argument that this happens better in a private rather than a public, adversarial arrangement.  All appeals should be in public.</p><p>  The big change we have seen in recent years is Google.  It used to be that if one took a case against one&rsquo;s employer that information would not go very far and would not appear on every search that every employer in the future did on one.  No matter whether the person wins or loses a case an employer will say the person is trouble and will not want to employ him or her.  There are new developments and existing practices, both of which happen in private.  It is essential that the first instance body remains private rather than public as many are suggesting. </p></speech>

Unfortunately, we do not have those figures.  We looked for them but they do not seem to be captured by any of the annual reports that we searched.  We did find insight into the level of legal representation that occurs in the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  As I mentioned briefly earlier, that is approximately 50% and interestingly, the split is relatively even between employers and employees choosing to have legal representation.</p><p>  I would also like to thank the committee for the opportunity to be here and to present IBEC&rsquo;s views on the issues raised.  We have heard some difficult individual stories and cases but in the vast majority of cases employers attend these fora.  In the event that an award is made against them most of the time it is paid.  I do not accept the suggestion that HR departments are sanitising divisions for coercive behaviour.  Most of the time they are just paying people&rsquo;s wages, advising them of their maternity protection rights, looking out for their health and safety, paying their pensions.  The notion that this is a routine thing is absolutely wrong.  I ask that this be borne in mind before we rush to action on issues such as piercing the corporate veil and the chilling effect that would have on employment.  The presentation of bonds would be an issue too, as would punitive damages.  All of these things have an impact on other people within their place of employment.  I urge caution and balance before any decisions like that are made.</p></speech>

My colleagues and I have found it very useful and we will take back to the Minister what we have heard today.  Two Bills are under discussion here, the Workplace Relations Bill, which we hope to publish in October, and the Companies Bill, which is before the D&aacute;il.  We would welcome any suggested amendments to be considered in the context of those Bills.</p><p>  In response to the specific questions about the time it takes to process cases and the target in the Minister&rsquo;s plan of three months between receipt of a complaint and the scheduling of a hearing, it is a challenging target but it has already been achieved in the Rights Commissioner hearings.  There has been huge progress there.  At one stage not that long ago it took eight months to get an acknowledgement of a complaint being lodged to the Rights Commissioner service.  At the beginning of this year this was down as low as five days.  Significant productivity gains have been made and will continue to be made.  It will be a challenging target but it is necessary for people to know in order to have confidence in the system that they will get an early hearing of their complaint.</p><p>  I would also like to emphasise the option of alternative dispute resolution and mediation which will be open to all complaints under this system.  At the moment this provides a very quick process in the Equality Tribunal which has had mediation for ten years.  Mediations are scheduled within three months.  It provides a completely confidential process in which all the issues can be put on the table.  The outcome is a confidential agreement which is legally binding and enforceable.  It provides, from the points of view of both the reasonable employer and the employee, an opportunity to resolve their differences and to repair the relationship without going into a more legal forum.  We find in the Equality Tribunal that 50% of cases that go to mediation end there. They are resolved at mediation or the party taking the complaint realises that they do not have a strong case and withdraws.  Sometimes the parties meet outside the mediation room and resolve the matter between themselves directly.  I strongly recommend that all parties seriously consider the option of mediation or alternative dispute resolution which will be available under all headings of employment law under the new structure. </p><p>  On the bond issue we will take all the points that have been raised here back to the Minister for consideration, including the proposals that the petitioner made.</p></speech>

It is a legal term not a pejorative one and has a very narrow meaning.  As director of the Equality Tribunal I am empowered to dismiss a claim which I consider to be frivolous or vexatious or misconceived.  Frivolous means that it has absolutely no chance of success.  Vexatious means that it is a claim of little merit but which has been taken solely to put the respondent at the cost of defending the claim.  In my experience there would be very few cases coming before the Equality Tribunal which meet that test.</p><p>  The other part is where people do not show.  If a complainant does not show the case is dismissed there and then, unless one has a good reason, for example, if the respondent does not turn up and the complainant has a <i>prima facie</i> case the respondent is not in a position to rebut that case and the complaint will succeed.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome our guests.  I draw their attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>), witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and continue to so do, they will be entitled thereafter to only qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I wish to advise the witnesses that any submissions they have forwarded to the committee and any opening statements they may make will be published on the committee's website following the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  Before I call Ms Jupp, I must apologise for the fact that I will be obliged to vacate the Chair for a short period in order that I might make a contribution in the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

In early 2012 the cumulative effect of five years of reducing demand for public transport, reductions in public service obligation payments, the increased cost of fuel, significant losses from operations and other economic factors led to a serious cash shortage in the group.  As a result, CIE, working closely with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and building on existing cost reduction programmes, implemented a range of actions during the period to address this situation.  These included: obtaining an advance on public service obligation payments and the acceleration of Exchequer grants claims process; strengthening the board's oversight of cash management; and the establishment of a centralised disbursement policy.  We particularly strengthened the cash management processes and procedures.  These actions, together with the sale of our interest in Spencer Dock and the provision by Government of an additional &euro;36 million in funding in 2012, stabilised the cash position.  At the same time, we engaged in discussions on securing renewed banking facilities.  I am pleased to inform the committee that those discussions have concluded and that renewed and extended banking facilities are now in place.  However, these facilities do not solve the totality of our financial difficulties - far from it.</p><p>  The availability of the funding is dependent on our fulfilling financial covenants in respect of the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation, EBITDA.  The latter is a normal process in the context of the banks.  The four financial institutions with which we have arranged banking facilities require us to meet key performance benchmarks in respect of growing revenue and reducing costs, particularly those relating to payroll, and returning a projected EBITDA from our operations.  To put it simply, if we fail to meet the targets contained in the covenants, there will be less funding available to us and we will return to the crisis we faced last year.  Obviously, this is something we wish to avoid at all costs.</p><p>  The company has incurred ongoing financial losses in recent years, including a &euro;31 million operating loss in 2012.  While the cost base has been reduced by &euro;133 million since 2008, this has been insufficient in the context of offsetting the cumulative effect of reductions in subvention and revenue.  The CIE Group must continue to implement a range of corrective actions to reduce its costs and increase revenue.  To this end, the current pay and productivity proposals being progressed within the three operating companies are essential to our ongoing financial sustainability.  Given that these proposals are currently being negotiated or balloted upon, I hope the committee will understand that it would be inappropriate to comment on them at this time.  We are also in the process of reviewing the strategies for all three companies and the group to meet the challenges ahead and to increase our revenues.</p><p>  There are some grounds for cautious optimism.  Revenue and passenger numbers, which had been falling since the onset of the economic crisis, stabilised in 2012.  Modest growth in revenue has been recorded, as well as stability in passenger numbers, since the latter half of last year.  As with all enterprises operating in the Irish economy, a return to growth and stability would have a direct beneficial impact on revenues.</p><p>  From a service delivery perspective, I am pleased to advise the committee that we continue to maintain a comprehensive network of services to communities and that significant improvements have been made across all of the companies.</p></speech>

Our losses compared to 2011 reduced from &euro;18 million to &euro;9 million and after the additional subvention that was further reduced to &euro;3.8 million.  There was also good progress in terms of passenger numbers, which stabilised and started to grow towards the latter end of the year.  I will outline some of the major contributors to that. The completion of Network Direct was a huge project and we finished it during 2012.  It has radically transformed the bus network in Dublin.  Some of the attributes of the new network are outlined in the written submission.  I will not go through them but the new network is a significant contributor to the changed trends in passenger numbers.</p><p>  In terms of the contract with the National Transport Authority, NTA, we met all the customer service targets set in the NTA contract throughout the year.  They are independently audited and verified.  We got 80 new buses last year and many of their new features are outlined in the written submission.  We also achieved what was a major milestone for the company in reaching 100% accessibility.  We have probably one of the best equipped fleets in Europe in terms of accessibility for people with disabilities.</p><p>  Real time information was also a big boon which was introduced at the start of the year.  It is now available on apps and on the web at approximately 500 stops around the city.  Anyone who uses buses will agree that it has transformed the entire experience of using them.  The system is progressing this year.</p><p>  The Leap card was introduced last year.  It is part of a major development programme which will come together towards the end of this year.  Towards the end of the year we were getting 200,000 journeys per week on Leap.  We promoted all of that and it has contributed to a stabilisation of our numbers and growth into 2013.</p><p>  Moving into 2013, as I said, passenger numbers have stabilised.  The last few periods are showing good growth and there is strong positive evidence.  Revenues are strong.  We are behind on expenditure at the moment because, as the chairman outlined, we are finalising a cost reduction programme.  That will contribute to an outturn this year of a &euro;2.8 million operating loss.  We have had a very steady year-on-year financial programme.</p><p>  In terms of customer service for 2013, we are continuing with many of the positive initiatives I have mentioned and we are meeting our targets.  We will get a further 80 buses this year.  A total of 400,000 real time passenger information, RTPI, apps have now been downloaded.  The NTA has introduced a journey planner which makes it easier to figure out the new network.  Leap cards continue to expand.  We intend to have Wi-Fi on all of our buses by the end of the year which, again, is a big plus for the customer.  We are also developing interior announcements, both audio and video.  The NTA is keen on traffic signal priority for buses, as are we, which again will provide a time benefit for passengers.  It will be a big challenge for us to work with the NTA and Dublin City Council on the Luas cross-city project and make sure that all of the benefits are maintained through the programme.</p><p>  Looking forward into 2014, it is our target to break even and to make a small profit.  We will do that through the continuation of the programmes I have outlined.  Our objective is the retention of the NTA contract and the retention of our role as a pivotal part of Dublin city.  We must work through the Luas cross-city development and make sure we achieve all our objectives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-18a.981" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Nolan" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013071800004#C00700"><p>I will summarise my contribution.  I was here in October when I gave a comprehensive briefing of the company&rsquo;s financial position and an overview of the national coach and bus market.</p><p>  I am happy to update the committee on those matters.  Everyone will know that Bus &Eacute;ireann not only provides a public service in provincial cities but also provides the school transport system and the inter-city commercial services.  Last year we had more than 77 million passenger journeys across 6,300 routes in the State.  In recent years, due to the efforts of all of our employees, we have improved our services, which has resulted in a high level of customer satisfaction and a return to growth in customer numbers.  Our financial situation reflects the reduction in State funding, continued economic stagnation, increased fuel costs and growing inter-city competition.  We recorded a loss of &euro;6.2 million in 2012.</p><p>  It is important to note that in 2009 the Government&rsquo;s value for money report said that we were as efficient as our European counterparts.  Since then our subvention has been reduced by 30%, passenger numbers have dropped by more than 20% and fuel costs have increased by &euro;14 million.  We have reacted to the situation by reducing our cost base by more than &euro;35 million while managing to largely protect service levels.  We are implementing a plan to save a further approximately &euro;20 million, including our recent agreement with the trade unions.  That will bring ongoing efficiencies which will result in us breaking even by the end of the year.  Separately, we have also delivered more than &euro;25 million in savings to the Department of Education and Skills on the school transport scheme.  That has been reinvested largely in services, particularly for special needs.</p><p>  We have seen improvements in Wi-Fi, and new vehicles on city, commuter and inter-city services.  We have rolled out networks in the provincial cities, resulting in greater passenger usage, and introduced the RTPI in provincial cities.  We started our Leap card journey in the greater Dublin area and we will roll it out to Cork.  Our apps and social media are up and running and we also have a large loyalty scheme that offers regular discounts to encourage travel.</p><p>  I will quickly go through the inter-city market.  It is important to note there is no State funding in the inter-city market, which is subject to significant competition.  The competitors operate a limited-stop service that bypasses locations served by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  In response, the company has had to continue to make changes on those routes to meet the demand from the majority of our inter-city customers for shorter journey times and a limited number of stops.  We have kept commercial services going in many locations for many years despite the low levels of use, but given the economic situation in the country, the new motorway network and cherry-picking of the profitable element of routes by competitors, unfortunately, that is no longer possible in some cases.  We are working with the NTA to offer alternatives but there is limited State funding available for such services.</p><p>  As a result of the work outlined above, we are starting to see more and more people using our services.  In 2012, overall passenger numbers were up.  City usage was up 2% and inter-city customer numbers increased by 4%.  So far this year the growth in customer numbers has continued.  We will meet all performance targets for the NTA and we will also deliver on all of the value for money review findings for the school transport scheme.</p><p>  There is no doubt the past few years have been challenging for the company, with reduced State funding, increased costs and greater competition.  However, despite that, we have maintained as many services as possible, particularly in areas where there is no alternative for people.  While we are still facing significant challenges, with our cost agreement now in place, a continued strong focus on reducing costs and increasing passenger numbers and greater commercial freedom to make the necessary changes on our inter-city services, the company is now in a much stronger position and its target is to come close to breaking even by the end of the year and returning to profitability in 2014.</p></speech>

In the past five years, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has had its subvention levels reduced by one third, &euro;64 million.  At the same time, during the very difficult economic situation in Ireland, we have seen passenger revenues drop by almost &euro;35 million, a fall of 16%.  To address this combined income shortfall of almost &euro;100 million, we have been working with our staff to reduce costs.  We have successfully reduced these by almost &euro;67 million.  This has more than compensated for the fall in the passenger revenues but it has not been nearly enough to deal with the large reduction in subvention.  Despite this very difficult financial position, we have maintained the majority of services.  Examples of the measures we have taken include a voluntary severance programme, which has reduced the workforce by almost 25% since 2008.  We now employ just fewer than 3,800 people, compared with 6,000 ten years ago.  We have agreed efficiency measures with our staff and negotiated reductions in overtime levels, allowances and leave benefits.  We have also taken action to reduce one of our other big cost areas, fuel consumption, which of course yields environmental benefits.  We have re-tendered major contracts to achieve cost reductions from suppliers.</p><p>  The committee will be aware that proposals are being balloted among our staff, which will deliver further efficiency measures, including reductions in basic pay, with the underlying principle that those who earn the most will contribute more.  A successful outcome is critical to achieving our financial goals and the requirements of our banks, not only in 2013 but up to 2017, when our projections will show we aim to break even.</p><p>  We have seen fare increases.  These have been balanced by promotional activity, including advance-purchase discounts and special offers for students and families.  The introduction of the Leap card and Taxsaver products has also resulted in large discounts for customers.  It is good to note that according to our most recent customer satisfaction survey, these offers have helped to drive a significant improvement in the value for money score, which is up ten percentage points.</p><p>  Despite the current funding environment, we remain ambitious about the future of the rail network and the role it can play in meeting the economic and mobility needs of the country.  To that end, further significant intercity journey time improvements are a key priority for us.  The economic benefits of these have been clearly identified by the AECOM study carried out on behalf of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in 2011.  Other priorities for us include the DART expansion projects, including the DART underground line, the electrification of the Maynooth, Hazelhatch and northern lines and the opening of a DART airport link.  We would welcome the committee's support for each of these projects as the Government prepares to assess its investment priorities in 2015.</p><p>  In summary, we have been through an era of significant change.  We have an upgraded network, one of the youngest fleets in Europe and new customer facilities.  We are running more trains with a reduced workforce while at the same time delivering record punctuality.  However, our financial position remains extremely challenging and must be addressed.  We must continue to improve our services if we are to compete effectively with the improved motorway network.  The cost-reduction measures are crucial to ensuring that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann plays the strongest possible role in delivering a high-quality public transport network for Ireland and most of all for our customers.</p></speech>

There was much concern last year when CIE came back to the Government looking for an additional &euro;35 million outside the profile that existed and that had been presented by way of a budget for the year.  The Department was able to find it within its overall budget but it was an unsavoury situation.</p><p>  The reason we issued this invitation several weeks ago was to ensure the same was not on the horizon again.  I am deeply disappointed it took so long for the witnesses to attend the committee.  There has been a very good working relationship between this committee and the three companies within CIE and the overall board of CIE.  I have sat on this committee since 2002 and this is the first time we have had any difficulty with CIE in terms of coming before the committee.  We often had issues before but they were dealt with to the best of everybody's ability.</p><p>  Will Ms Jupp indicate the projected deficit for CIE in 2013?  What will the reduction in the subvention do to the overall integrated network situation?  Has CIE devised a plan to present to the Government to show how it intends to protect the entire network as it exists, recognising the reduction in subvention?  Has it made any appeals to the Government with regard to the necessity of increasing subventions in line with the reduction in its fare-box and commercial activity, notwithstanding Mr. Doherty&rsquo;s indication that there seems to be an upward trajectory in that regard?</p><p>  In terms of the company's negotiation with the unions, which is clearly an exceptionally important element in recalibrating the cost base, has Ms Jupp met any of the trade union leaders?  Have any of the chairmen of the three companies met the trade unions in an effort to build a consensus around cost reduction while at the same time protecting the integrated network that exists between the three companies?</p><p>  It is clear that the future viability of CIE as a public transport company hangs in the balance.  There is nothing particularly new about that statement.  What actions has the company taken to try to ensure its viability?  There has been some talk in the media about the potential sale of the Expressway service.  Can Ms Jupp indicate what discussions it has had with Government about that?  There is talk about part-privatisation of 10% to 15% of Dublin Bus routes.  Will Ms Jupp indicate how she thinks that will improve the viability of the company?  There is also talk about Bus &Eacute;ireann, in an open tendering environment, having to tender for some of the public service obligation, PSO, routes.  Will Ms Jupp indicate how that might improve the financial viability of the Bus &Eacute;ireann wing of the company?  It is clear that the missing piece of the jigsaw is the subvention.  We have various reports from the companies over several years of a progressive approach to cost reduction, which is welcome.  However, I am not so sure that CIE is fighting the battle to the extent it should with the Government around demanding an increased subvention to meet the needs of retaining an integrated public transport system.</p></speech>

On the various dates that were proposed, at least one of this group was unavailable.  I also had concerns about the discussions that were ongoing with our unions at this particular time.  I spoke to the Acting Chairman and he understood those concerns and we were able to attend today.  I asked the CEO of Dublin Bus to rearrange some leave so he could be here today.  I will put that on the record by way of background.</p><p>  In respect of the financial position of CIE, many things have contributed to where we are today and there are many things we are doing to extricate ourselves from that.  The overall economic situation has a major impact on us and our business generally tracks consumer spending.  As it goes down, spending on public transport also goes down.  We then had the reduction in the PSO, and one can see around the garages at the moment that fuel prices have gone up again.  These are all very difficult things for us to negotiate our way through but we have done a significant amount in taking costs out of the business.  As everybody said, they have been able to match broadly the reduction in revenue, but on top of that we have had the PSO reduction and the fuel price increases.  Obviously, we understand the overall situation the Government is in and so we have been making our point about the impact of the reduction in subvention in the context of the broader picture.  We must understand where we sit versus everything else and the decisions made at that level.  </p><p>  In terms of the actions we are taking, our goal is to continue to provide a comprehensive service to our customers and communities around the country.  We continue to work on that.  Given the capacity we have, our focus is to try to drive extra passengers onto all of our service offerings.  Many measures have been put in place which we are highlighting to our customers to encourage them to come back to public transport.  There are apps on all mobile phones that can tell one when a bus or train is due, which is a great advantage to people.  Wi-Fi internet connections are broadly available, which means that when one is sitting on a train or bus, one can do some work.  We are making our customers aware of that and in the past six to nine months we have seen an improvement in the passenger numbers and, therefore, in revenue.  </p><p>  In respect of union negotiations, it would probably be fair to ask the individual companies that take prime responsibility for negotiating with our unions to outline their comments.</p></speech>

Somebody might be able to give it to me before we finish.  Other than meeting the worker-directors on our boards, I have not met with any of the unions.  I am afraid I cannot answer for any of the other CEOs of the individual companies.  I know that the individual companies are taking the lead on it so that we continue to have a public transport system available to our customers.</p></speech>

Deputy Dooley said there was discussion in the newspapers about Expressway being sold.  Expressway is a challenging environment for us because of the level of competition on those services.  We have no plans to sell Expressway.  It is currently challenged, so trying to sell a company that is challenged would be extremely difficult.  In respect of the privatisation of bus routes, we must again leave that discussion to the individual companies that will be affected by it.  Did I miss a question?</p></speech>

Under the contract, a new arrangement is being put in place this year, which is a very welcome and positive development.  From June 2013, we will look at the service profile, demand, anticipated revenue, fares and expenditure.  We look at the situation in the round as regards the operation of the service next year and what the requirements for everyone will be to ensure that people in Dublin get a service which matches the demand and developments taking place.  The subvention debate, the level of service and the growth in the market will be addressed in that context.  That is a positive development in so far it brings all the issues together in the round for us to deal with together.  As the months pass, we will get clarity about our plans for next year and subsequent years.  That is a positive development.</p><p>  Privatising routes is a decision for Government and the NTA.  It is not a decision for us.  We have made submissions and there was one consultation by the NTA last year.  Another formal consultation will begin some time towards the end of this year.  In both of those cases, we will be making submissions.  I have no doubt the NTA in its consideration of it will take account of what is happening in Europe, where there has not been a great expansion of tendering since the new EU regulation was introduced in 2007.  I have no doubt it will also take account of the comparison with the finances in London and the rest of the UK, which do not show any great pot of gold in this area.  I am sure it will consider all of that but we will be making submissions to it at the end of the year.  We have done so already.  Ultimately, it will be a matter for Government to decide where this goes.</p></speech>

Can Ms Jupp elaborate on how much was realised?  Witnesses must excuse my ignorance, as I am from the country.  Was that a historic CIE site or was it bought recently?  If it was bought recently, when was it bought and how much was paid for it?</p><p>  In respect of the &euro;36 million, could Ms Jupp give us a breakdown as to where that went in terms of the three companies and CIE itself?  All four witnesses mentioned the reduction in the cost base that was required and I think one contributor said that those that earned the most must contribute the most.  Excluding the people who are currently being balloted, could Ms Jupp give me an indication of how the company's management contributed to the recovery of the company?  Could she give me figures on the extent to which management costs have been reduced in each of the four companies in the past two years?</p></speech>

We have done a number of things to try to encourage people to use the route.  From next week passengers will be able to book fares on the route online, which they cannot do now, and we will examine the train service options in our next timetable review, for which we are starting to plan.</p><p>  The &euro;50,000 spent on rebranding was part of the marketing spend and customer research identified that there was confusion around the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann brands.

We have no intention of spending any money on rebranding other than as and when we do routine maintenance or repainting vehicles, for example.</p></speech>

We have heard how each company is hoping to break even by 2014 or 2015.  A return to profitability was mentioned.  Was the PSO part of that profitability?  The PSO was higher in the past.  In Bus &Eacute;ireann it has been cut by 30%.  It is not a level playing field in the sense that there was a different PSO.  Will the witnesses comment on that?</p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, recently said 10% of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann routes would be put out to private tender.  We have already had cherry picking of some of the very viable routes.  With Dublin Bus we have also seen many areas without a bus service, including in my area, where we have no buses going from Finglas village to the north of Finglas.  That probably means we will see more of the same and many places will have services cut.  I am very concerned about that.  Is it realistic to say we will break even without a proper PSO on an ongoing basis?  Will we eventually get rid of the PSO or are we stuck with it?  Most countries operate that way.</p><p>  The school transport system was cut by &euro;25 million.  Now we are told rural transport is to be reviewed.  A value-for-money review of school transport proved that it was highly efficient.  If there are any further cuts in that area, it will have a massive impact across the country.  I do not know whether there has been any input from the witnesses in regard to the Minister's comments about re-examining rural transport.</p><p>  There have been massive strides in the area of wheelchair accessibility in Dublin, particularly in Dublin Bus.  Does that reflect the rest of the country, such as Cork and Limerick?  I would like to get an overall picture of how they are faring compared to Dublin.  Dublin has almost 100% accessibility with Dublin Bus.  Do Bus &Eacute;ireann and other companies pay tolls?  If so, how much do they cost?  I assume reimbursement of fuel is on the agenda because it is a significant issue.  I hope the Minister would allow a cut, as has been done for the road haulage industry, on the cost of fuel.  Perhaps the witnesses could comment on that.  Will Dublin Bus incur losses as a result of the construction of the cross-city Luas, which is coming up?  How do we plan to address that?  Is it factored into our thoughts?</p><p>  There have been many short-term sell-offs, which the witnesses mentioned.  Are they camouflaging the figures?  We will not be able to make up that ground elsewhere, or maybe we will and the group will look for other places to sell off.  Are further reductions in staff numbers planned?</p></speech>

That is the case in all other countries and I expect it to continue to be a requirement here.</p></speech>

We run commercial services.  As we must reinvest in buses, we must create a profit.  The public service obligation, PSO, is a net cost contract and we are exposed to revenue fluctuations.  We must ensure we make enough to buffer us and repay our loans.  The plan to break even at the end of this year and to make a profit next year is realistic.</p><p>  We are involved in many groups under the rural transport scheme announced by the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly.  Between school transport and our own rural transport schemes, we are the largest supplier of rural transport in the country.  My understanding of the plan is to reduce the cost of administration and get more rubber on road, which would be beneficial to everyone.</p><p>  All of our vehicles in provincial cities are wheelchair-accessible.  Outside those cities, most buses are wheelchair-accessible.  However, the infrastructure for accessing high-line vehicles is not present in many places.</p><p>  We pay &euro;1.5 million per year on tolls and airport parking charges.  We are grateful to have the rebate back, albeit at a lower rate than seven or eight years ago.</p></speech>

Our priorities are to anticipate next winter, when we might have capacity issues, and to determine where to make further enhancements of the network.  We are moving on from the old phase.</p><p>  There are two dimensions to the Luas issue, the first of which is planning for when the work starts.  Some small-scale works are under way on Dawson Street, Marlborough Street and Dominick Street, but the real action will not kick in until the first quarter of 2014, when there will be some movement in our routes.  We are working closely with the NTA and Dublin City Council on devising plans to maintain access to stops as far as possible and to maintain the movement of vehicles on alternative routes so that we do not lose time on our schedules.  This work has not been concluded.  When the works commence, we have an agreement to monitor the outcomes jointly with the NTA.  If there are consequences we must face up to them and work through them.  The essential work being undertaken now is the preparation, in which regard we are active.  The NTA and Dublin City Council are supportive in devising plans.</p></speech>

We have reorganised our finance and treasury function to ensure we have the right skill sets to deal with the challenges we are facing.  A number of factors came to a head - we had been making losses, the subvention and revenue decreased and fuel prices increased.  It was a perfect storm that led to cash difficulties.  I am delighted we were able to put in place new processes and procedures and am grateful for the extra subvention from the Government, which tided us over until we were able to renegotiate our banking facilities.</p><p>  Sections of former railway lines have been developed as walkways.  CIE has no objection to people walking along them.  We are generally supportive of the development of greenways on former railways, but each of the lines must be considered separately in the context of potential railway development.  We also liaise with local groups and local authorities on the development of each section.  Progress has been made on certain sections by walking groups.  We are considering north Kerry, Mullingar, Athlone, Navan, Kingscourt and New Ross.  The difficulties experienced in some areas were not caused by us.</p></speech>

In order to succeed we must drive more passengers onto the public transport system.  All of our activities are focused on that, in addition to finalising the union negotiations that are currently in play.  I hope we will succeed.  As I said at the very beginning, we are examining the strategy of each of the individual companies and that of the group.  We are re-examining everything that we are doing in order to ensure we do the things that will help us drive extra business and reduce our costs.  As Deputy Tom Fleming has said, some of those objectives require radical measures.  He also mentioned that a single rail fare costs &euro;70, but I do not believe such a fare exists.  Mr. Franks will confirm the cost of a single ticket to Cork.</p></speech>

At present a single fare ticket from Cork to Dublin costs &euro;9.99 if one books it online in advance, which is a very good offer.  Prices vary and depend on whether one turns up on the day of travel at a ticket office or books a ticket in advance.  The day return fare can be the same price as a single ticket but only on limited trains.  That fare may have caused some confusion.  One can avail of very good deals if one books online.</p></speech>

This is my first day at this committee, so I will not give the delegation too much of a grilling.</p><p>  My first question is for the CEO of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Mr. Nolan said that Dublin Bus had received &euro;6 million and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann had received &euro;30 million.  Why was none of the funding put into Bus &Eacute;ireann when &euro;35 million was saved and a further &euro;20 million would have been saved?  Where did the saving come from?  He said that its services were largely protected, so what other areas did the saving come from?  </p><p>  Mr. Nolan expressed the sentiment that he wanted to keep the buses full and to expand the routes, but it is important for the company to keep its current number of passengers.  I represent and am from a constituency in Meath which has a very good bus service.  However, the main street of Ashbourne will be dug up in September and a bus route will be affected.  I have spoken with the local chamber of commerce and many community groups.  They have informed me that they have tried to get in touch with the organisation seeking to change the route and make it more accessible so that the company and the people of Meath East will not suffer.  Perhaps Mr. Nolan could examine the matter and expand on it a bit. </p><p>  What was the cost of the real time information signs?  The CEO said he had noticed a substantial increase in the number of people availing of the bus routes.  How did he link the increase to the new signs?    </p><p>  My last question is for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  Does it plan to extend the rail link from Dunboyne to Navan?  The initiative has been talked about for a long time.</p></speech>

However, I have seen evidence that the companies have turned a corner.  It is difficult to reduce costs by &euro;26 million per annum while continuing to provide a service, but the adjustment is being made.  Payroll is 55% of the cost base.  How does that compare with similar operations in other jurisdictions?  Fuel costs have increased by &euro;14 million.  I read in one of the reports that there are revenue protection officers.  It would make more sense to negotiate as a group rather than as individual companies when purchasing in high volumes, particularly with regard to fuel, because there would be efficiencies of scale.</p><p>  I do not understand one paragraph of one of Mr. Nolan's presentation, which was not a lovely piece of English.  I understand it from Bus &Eacute;ireann's point of view but not from the Government's or the taxpayer's point of view.  It states:<blockquote>When making these changes, we are conscious of the impact they might have on some customers.  As such, we have been working with the National Transport Authority to see if Public Service Obligation (PSO) services could be operated to by-passed locations within the limited State funding available for such services. </blockquote>  I think that means towns and villages which are bypassed by motorways.  Is it being suggested that there should be an alternative means of servicing those transport needs?</p></speech>

I will have to come back to him on that.</p><p>  The individual companies do not buy the fuel.  We buy it centrally and we hedge in advance so that we are not caught by fuel cost changes.  We know at the beginning of the year what our fuel will cost us.  It only has an impact overall when fuel prices go up because we pay extra for it.</p><p>  In regard to the pension fund, like any other pension system, CIE's two defined benefit pension schemes are in deficit to the tune of &euro;481 million.  That differs between the two schemes.  The executive 1951 scheme, of which there are 2,153 members, has the greatest deficit, which is &euro;384 million.  The deficit in what is called the regular wages scheme, which has 6,674 members, is &euro;97 million.  The deficits in both of these schemes increased hugely during 2012 as the discount rate used to value future the pension liabilities of these schemes fell in line with bond yields in the market.  This decrease in bond yields increased the future costs of these liabilities.  We have submitted our funding proposal to meet the minimum funding standard and that has gone to the Pensions Board.  We await a response from the Pensions Board to the proposals we have put forward.</p><p>  In regard to the other questions the Deputy asked, I will ask Mr. Franks to talk about revenue protection officers and their role.</p></speech>

We are currently recruiting an additional 20 revenue protection officers to support that activity.  We are also doing a lot of things in the back office to try to simplify our revenue protection plans and increase our ability to collect money from people who have been issued with penalty fares.  In the round, we are trying to raise an additional &euro;1.5 million in this financial year from that activity.</p></speech>

We brought in an international study group and it found we were as efficient as any of our peers.  Since then, our subvention has gone down by 30%.  The private operators are more commercial and more business-oriented.  The inter-city business shows that up.  We still go into the towns and villages at no additional cost to the State and we try to do that as much as we can.  Some of the rot is caused by our acting in the national interest.  The private operators are serving the larger population centres so we need to do that as well, and that will cause us to bypass locations.  We need that commercial freedom because we cannot run a loss-making service against other providers that do not get funds from the State.</p><p>  Private bus operators have various groupings.  I am aware they are in discussions but I do not know where they are in that regard.  We co-operate with them because they are the biggest provider of services to us.  We pay &euro;114 million to private bus operators each year to provide services, mainly for the school transport scheme.</p></speech>

One of the prime objectives of the Network Direct project was to simplify the network by making it more understandable for customers.  We started off with approximately 170 individual route numbers and we have reduced it to something of the order of 115.  It does not mean we have taken out routes or services.  As the Deputy will know, we had duplicated areas and we amended and redesigned so that, by and large, we cover the same catchment and population.  We provide a service across the whole community but it is a lot more simple now.  While we have 19 or 20 core big routes, we still have 95 relatively small routes which are providing local community services.  That was the nature of the project and it has been successful in so far as it is now delivering in terms of usage.</p></speech>

If I look at this not from Bus &Eacute;ireann's point of view but from that of a representative of the taxpayer, it will cost the taxpayer an awful lot more if another vehicle must go into those towns and villages.  I do not know how it can be resolved.</p></speech>

The contract has been given to a company that has been fined &pound;2.25 million by the SFO.  There was no competitor, as the other company withdrew, and the supplier was also fined &pound;10 million for its responsibility in a crash.  This is worrying.</p></speech>

It has gone through due process in Ireland.  We have examined all of its safety credentials.  Before it can go live in Ireland, it must achieve the same safety certification from the Railway Safety Commission.  It will not be able to start its contract otherwise.</p></speech>

It has only considered one.</p></speech>

I will repeat the position.  We ensured that we could work out the price of undertaking the work ourselves.  The price from Balfour Beatty is an improvement on that.</p></speech>

How does the company get out of a situation like that?  Surely it will have major repercussions on the company.  It seems like a massive problem to me.</p></speech>

It can be difficult to communicate this to staff, public representatives and the public when we are in competition with other companies on these routes.  We make sure that the staff, public representatives and then the public are informed in turn, so that we can keep everything on board.  However, we will have to make changes.</p></speech>
