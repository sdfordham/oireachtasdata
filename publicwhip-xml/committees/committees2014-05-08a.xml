Agreed.</p><p>  Next is matters arising from the minutes.  The committee has been circulated with a draft of the application of the committee for compelability in the context of our ongoing examination of the spend of public funds of Rehab.  The application will now be submitted to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  No. 3 is correspondence received since our meeting on Thursday, 1 May 2014.  No. 3A is correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers.  No. 3A.1 is correspondence received from Patrick Neary, David Doyle, Mr. Hurley and Mr.Cardiff regarding bank stabilisation measures.  These are to be noted and published.  The invitation offered to these four senior officials arose from the interim Committee of Public Accounts report on bank stabilisation published last year.  The outstanding issues will now fall to be dealt with by the upcoming banking inquiry.  No. 3A.2 is correspondence dated 30 April 2014 from the Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p></speech>

We produced a bank stabilisation report.  Then we wrote to the individuals concerned and they wrote back.  They did not appear on the correspondence list until now, inadvertently.  No. 3A.2 is correspondence regarding the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy.  This is to be noted and published.  No. 3A.3 is correspondence dated 2 May 2014 from the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the sale of Bord G&aacute;is.  This is to be noted and published.</p><p>  No. 3B is individual correspondence.

This is to be noted and a copy sent to Deirdre Murphy.  No. 3B.2 is correspondence dated 1 May 2014 from Mr. Graham Love, chief executive, Health Research Board, in reply to the note in the Comptroller and Auditor General audit re rent and associated costs.  This is to be noted.  No. 3B.3 is correspondence dated 1 May 2014 from Deputy Michael McGrath.  It relates to correspondence from Gary Delaney re Irish national postcodes.  This is to be noted and a copy is to be forwarded to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources for a note on the matter.</p><p>  Next is correspondence relevant to today's meeting.  We have received correspondence dated 2 May 2014 from the Department of Finance with briefing material for today's meeting.  This is to be noted and published.  No. 3C.2 is correspondence received on 8 May 2014 from the Department of Finance regarding opening statement for today.</p><p>  No. 4 is reports.  There is a list reports from Nos. 4.1 to 4.4.  No. 4.4 relates to the accounts of the Central Bank of Ireland and the credit institutions resolution fund.  Details have been laid before the Houses and I understand there is a copy in the Library.  This might relate to what you were referring to some time ago, Deputy Ross.  The matter can be raised again.  The accounts are to be noted.  The position is that the committee cannot examine the accounts of the Central Bank since it is a body included in the Second Schedule to the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993.  In accordance with Standing Order 163 the committee cannot examine that account.</p><p>  Next is the work programme.</p></speech>

I have a draft report which is with County Cork VEC in respect of various matters that have been the subject of correspondence with my office and the Committee of Public Accounts.

I will ask the clerk to draft a note on it so that we might have the specific questions that are required to be answered for that individual.  Likewise, Mr. John Shine made a submission to the committee.  I am sure it is going through the process.  We need a note on it to inform members of the extent of his query and which questions are outstanding for the Department.  We will do that for next week's meeting.</p><p>  Do members wish to raise other matters?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-08a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014050800004#C01000"><p>I wish to discuss the clerk's note on the committee's remit.  In his own words, will he go through it?  I am slightly confused about the conclusion.  Are we to determine what our remit will be based on our application to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-08a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Clerk to the Committee" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014050800004#C01100"><p>I was drawing attention to something.  The note is broken into three areas.  First, what is the narrow interpretation of Standing Order 163 on appropriation accounts, the accounts of bodies audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and value for money reports?  Second, we examined our remit to reach down into bodies that we have invited to attend meetings on public expenditure grounds, for example, the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, which has attended, and other sections 38 and 39 bodies.  We have done that in the content of an examination of the funds provided to them by the HSE.  We have now sought to compel certain evidence.  This will go through a process and will form one of the CPP's considerations.</p><p>  The note continued.  Obviously, some bodies fall outside the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts, those being, Schedule 2 bodies.  We have discussed one, namely, the Central Bank of Ireland.  The D&aacute;il has stated that, as these are Schedule 2 bodies, they are outside the committee's remit.</p><p>  I wanted to tease out a number of issues.  The Chairman in particular has raised with me issues like school transport.  We will consider that matter next week with the Department of Education and Skills.  The Accounting Officer is accountable for the &euro;152 million provided to Bus &Eacute;ireann, which subcontracts.  It is possible to invite Bus &Eacute;ireann officials to the committee as part of that examination.  It makes no sense to stop at the Department if one wants a thorough examination of the matter.</p><p>  Deputy Collins raised the issue of Leader companies.  If one is examining an Accounting Officer and there is an issue with a funded body, one may want to invite the company to appear before the committee.  It is in this context that we are trying to determine the committee's remit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-08a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014050800004#C01200"><p>The CPP's examination of the application for compellability will bring all of that into play.  Last week, Deputy Fleming raised the issue of the number of organisations in receipt of substantial public funds that, by way of legislation, were not mentioned in this committee's review of how those funds were spent.  The application before the CPP will start to clarify all of that matter in a definite way.  If, arising from the CPP's decision, there are shortcomings in Standing Order 163 or in terms of the list of agencies, Departments and external bodies that appear before us, we can make an application to have the Standing Order amended to include the various bodies that we believe should be included.  For example, Deputy Murphy has raised the issue of Poolbeg.  Now that a decision has been made, a question arises about how the &euro;108 million was spent.  We asked for the reports arising from the commentary on the matter to be laid before us.  The application for compellability will set out the CPP's position.</p></speech>

In essence, we are also applying for an extension of our remit.  It is part and parcel of the application.</p></speech>

Once we have that definition, as it were, we can decide to amend it to include such and such and make an application to the D&aacute;il in order to cover those agencies that will be able to answer more directly than an Accounting Officer in respect of, for example, school transport.</p></speech>

It would require separate legislation, as they are set up on the basis that they cannot be made accountable to our committee.  This is an issue, given the amount of public money they receive directly from the Government, and they may be addressed in that context.  They should be accountable to us.  The rest should be accountable to audits.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General wish to comment?</p></speech>

There is possibly a grey area in that regard as to whether it counts for 50% calculation or it does not count for 50% calculation.  I have not looked into it formally or looked for a legal definition of it.  There is a distinction between the section 38 and the section 39 organisations.  My understanding is that the section 39 concept moves the payment one step further from the HSE than payments to a section 38 organisation.</p></speech>

I see the differential between a company that tenders for work and is paid directly by the Department and one that gets a large allocation of funding from the Department that has discretion in the way it spends that to deliver the service.  I understand the section 38 organisations were historic.  They were funded directly from the Department of Health whereas the section 39 organisations were funded by way of the health boards.  Under the current legislation, if there is an allocation of funding from a Department to a large organisation such as the Central Remedial Clinic or Rehab, what are the Standing Orders or the structure for the Committee of Public Accounts in terms of those people coming before the committee, apart from having to go down the Committee on Procedure and Privileges route?</p></speech>

The financial statements of the national debt, which are prepared by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, are presented in full as Part 2 of the finance accounts.  The chapters that are the subject of today's meeting were compiled to highlight key aggregates and trends in Central Fund transactions and in broader State liabilities.<br />Chapter 1 summarises the Exchequer's financial outturn for 2012 when Central Fund issues exceeded receipts by almost &euro;15 billion.  Receipts into the Central Fund in 2012 totalled &euro;41.1 billion, representing an increase of 6% year on year.  Issues from the Central Fund amounted to &euro;56 billion in 2012, a decrease of 13% year on year.  General Government debt is the standard and most complete measure used to report Government debt under Maastricht treaty provisions.  At the end of 2012, Ireland's general Government debt stood at around &euro;192 billion.  The debt represented 117% of Ireland's gross domestic product at the end of 2012 compared with 104% a year earlier.<br />The principal components of the general Government debt at the end of 2012 were borrowing by the NTMA on behalf of the State, which is referred to as gross national debt and which is accounted for in the national debt account, and promissory notes issued in 2010 by the Minister for Finance to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation and the EBS Building Society, which were not included in the NTMA's national debt accounting.<br />The nominal value of the promissory notes at the end of 2012 was just over &euro;25 billion.  In the context of the liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation in February 2013, the related promissory notes were cancelled and replaced with floating-rate Government bonds issued by the NTMA.  The bonds now form part of the gross national debt.  Almost 90% of the June 2013 gross national debt was in the form of medium to long-term debt instruments.  Funding received under the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland accounted for almost one third of that debt.  Figure 2.6 presents a maturity profile of the debt and indicates that, at that date, over &euro;100 billion would fall due for repayment for re-financing by 2020.  Exchequer payments in 2012 related to servicing of the national debt totalled over &euro;5.8 billion.  This was up 23% when compared to the debt-servicing costs in 2011.  It should be noted that this excluded the interest that accrued in the promissory notes.<br />The NTMA estimates that the weighted average cost of servicing the gross national debt was 3.8% at the end of June 2013.  Around 80% of the debt was at fixed rates.<br />Cash and other financial assets held by the Exchequer totalled &euro;23.8 billion at the end of 2012, rising to &euro;30.6 billion at the end of June 2013.  This reflects an increase of over 28% in that six-month period.  Almost 46% of the end-of-June total is held as cash on deposit in the Central Bank.  The average interest rate earned on such deposits was 0.09%.  A significant portion of the available cash balances was held in short-term bank deposits and non-Irish treasury bills.  Those investments earn a higher rate of return than the interest on Central Bank deposits but they also carry a higher risk.<br />The build-up of cash and other financial assets reflects the State's intention to have sufficient advance funding in place by the end of 2013 to cover 12 to 15 months of Exchequer financing needs after the EU-IMF programme came to an end.  However, there is a cost to the Exchequer associated with maintaining high levels of cash balances because the return on those assets is lower than the State&rsquo;s average cost of borrowing.<br />Accrued pension entitlements of public servants are a significant liability of the State but these are not reflected in the finance accounts.  At the end of December 2009, an estimated &euro;116 billion had accrued in respect of such pensions.  The 2012 finance accounts continued to note the estimated end-2009 liability.  Later assessments of the liability had not been made despite the very significant changes in public sector employment and remuneration in the intervening years.  As discussed when the Accounting Officer of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform appeared before the committee recently, a more up-to-date estimate has now been prepared and actuarial reviews and projections of public service pension costs will, in future, be carried out regularly.  This should help to ensure decision-makers are aware of the long-term cost impact of public sector pensions and of changes in pension terms, and that the timing of pension outflows.<br />In the 2011 report on the accounts of the public services, I recommended that the Department of Finance should review the level and quality of disclosure in the finance accounts so as to increase the transparency of information about the public finances.  The Accounting Officer agreed with the recommendation.  In March 2013, a team from the International Monetary Fund, IMF, visited Ireland to evaluate Ireland's fiscal management and reporting arrangements based on the IMF's fiscal transparency code standards.  The report of the review team, published in July 2013, contains detailed recommendations on the reform of a number of areas, including the nature, content and timing of fiscal reporting, and a proposed action plan for implementing the recommendations over the period 2013 to 2017.  The report's recommendations are set out in Annex 1 to Chapter 1.<br />The Government has asked a steering group under the joint leadership of the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to implement the proposed action plan, as appropriate.  My office is represented on that steering group.  The Accounting Officer will be able to brief the committee on progress to date in that regard.<br />Finally, the 2012 appropriation account for the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Finance records expenditure totalling &euro;26.2 million on four programme areas.  These relate to the costs incurred in respect of budget and economic policy, financial services and taxation policy, banking sector policy and the provision of shared services.  The expenditure on banking sector policy recorded in the appropriation account is &euro;6.8 million.  However, members should note that this does not include costs associated with staff seconded to the Department from the NTMA to deal with banking sector issues and certain related consultancy costs.  Those costs are borne by the NTMA and are not recouped from the Department.  The level of costs incurred is not disclosed in either the appropriation account or the NTMA's financial statements.<br />At the end of 2012, the Department had underspent by &euro;7.5 million relative to its budget.  That amount was accordingly liable for surrender back to the Exchequer.  Note 3 indicates that much of the shortfall related to delays in the filling of vacancies and the use of <i>pro bono</i>staff in a number of key senior posts and lower-than-expected legal advisory fees arising from the postponement of certain bank and debt restructuring projects.</p></speech>

I thank also the Comptroller and Auditor General and his team for their help in producing the accounts.  As ever, they have worked satisfactorily with our team.  I have already distributed a statement that contains a number of observations for the committee.  I thought it would be useful given that this is the last time I will be appearing before it.  I do not plan to read all of the statement but I would like to identify some of the important issues in it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-08a.85" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Moran" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014050800007#F00800"><p>Yes.  We distributed the statement earlier.  If members have questions on it, they may ask them if there is time.</p><p>  Essentially, we are here to examine the accounts of 2012.  However, the environment is fast moving and an awful lot has changed so, with the permission of the Chairman, I will probably touch on much of what has changed since the production of that set of accounts.</p> <p>Everybody recalls that, in 2012, given the number of changes, we decided to revise our statement of strategy to refocus the Department across five goals which were not necessarily related only to a particular division.  These were, essentially, the economy and jobs, the public finances, living standards of citizens, the exit from the troika programme and the banking sector.  As these were the objectives when I took up my role, I felt I owed the committee the courtesy of announcing my resignation, which I announced to the Minister yesterday, so that it would be aware of that before this hearing, rather than doing it afterwards.</p><p> Because of the announcement yesterday, I have given a lot of thought to what I might actually highlight to the committee today among the many things that have happened in the Department.  Of course, I could have spoken first about the performance in the accounts and the savings that we actually produced in delivering our outcomes.  I could also have spoken about the stabilisation of the economy and the work we have done in the fiscal and banking sector.  We made a somewhat brave statement in terms of resetting our objectives, which were agreed by the management team, and actually putting as our first objective the economy and jobs.  We did that despite the fact that it was a task not just for our own Department, because a lot of actors have a role in this, and in view of the fact that at the time the Irish economy was losing 350 jobs a week.  It was a particularly unusual task.  The management team felt that what we had to do was to actually put that as the core of everything we did and, in effect, embark on a programme to see what we as a Department could contribute to what is one of the most troublesome issues in our economy at the moment.  We tried to do so by, in some respects, enlarging the scope of what we had anticipated we would be doing in 2012 and to run that through into 2013 by conducting with the new economics team a micro-analysis of the economy.  We did this by looking at different sectors and seeing what barriers existed, which, of course, informed our decisions around our budget, as well as through a relentless pursuit of solutions for banking and the financing of the economy, which I am sure we will talk about, and also a very public engagement with foreign and domestic investors and business communities around Ireland to try to rebuild confidence, which was essential to getting investment into the economy.</p><p> It is only appropriate that we should take some satisfaction from the fact that, in a relatively short period since the statement of strategy, we have moved from a situation of considerable job losses to one in which unemployment continues to drop every month, and has come from a peak of 15.1% down to 11.7%.  Alongside that, the rate of interest paid by the NTMA to finance any of the activities of Government has dropped from a high of 14% to below 2.75% today.  These are two key measures in terms of where we were going.</p><p> We distributed an annual review earlier, so rather than actually go through all of our specific performance against our goals, of which there are many, I thought it was more appropriate to simply distribute the document to members.  I am happy to answer any questions on that.  The review speaks for itself in terms of delivery over the course of the last year.  However, I will take this opportunity to thank the staff in the Department and, equally, their families for their personal contributions and the single-minded dedication to these tasks that I saw over the last two years.</p><p> Something I have often heard is that people do not appreciate the size of the Department and the feat of delivery in view of this.  There are just over 300 people in the Department, of whom 60 or 70 are engaged in very significant transaction-based material and work in Tullamore.  That means we have produced these annual reviews using less than 1% of the Civil Service.  In a sense, we have done that by dividing people into overlapping teams which have concentrated in the last year on different types of project.  There are the business-as-usual projects that people more typically associate with the Department, and we have also had a separate group of people working towards a reform agenda to achieve a higher-performing Department.  We have people looking at legacy issues from the crisis and we have had a team looking in particular at the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, which was, of course, a major priority for us during the course of last year.</p><p> Given that this is going to be my last appearance before the committee in my current role-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-08a.88" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Moran" time="11:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014050800008#G00300"><p>I hope it is-----I thought it appropriate to share with the committee some more detailed observations about changes and improvements we have been making in the Department and, therefore, engage in a conversation about why we felt they were necessary.  There will be no specific issues raised on the accounts by the Comptroller and Auditor General, so perhaps this is an area where a discussion today might help people to understand some of what we have been doing.  For me, it is a question not so much of looking at individual policy issues and the result of our handling of them, but of using those policy issues as a way to test whether we have in fact managed to change the Department so that it can identify issues into the future, perhaps come up with strategies to avoid risks and, if things do occur, as they often do, actually have a strategy and a way of dealing with them.</p><p>  Many have questioned in the last two or three years the failings that occurred in our system.  I think it would be useful for me to explain what we have been trying to do over the course of the last number of years to fix those problems.  We believe that new processes which embed better governance, more effective communication and a culture of open challenge and encouraging questioning among staff in the Department will go a long way towards addressing the problems we have seen in the Department in the past.  Therefore, I am grateful for the time to explain some of the things we have been doing in respect of that.</p><p>  First, I would like to talk about this issue that keeps coming up with regard to management teams and managing change.  I believe the right combination of management change in an environment such as we have had draws on the skills and knowledge of the past and supplements them with new skills and new perspectives, while coaching the entire team as a unit and training the whole team.  In that way, we can build a new cohesive unit to actually tackle the problems.  It is probably appropriate for me to say, as I have said in the statement, that it would be foolhardy to believe that somebody can land into a complex situation and not draw on the best experience of the people found in that Department.  With that combination of experience, which is what we had, we have now got a new set of views in the Department about the problems we have had to address.  Inevitably, there are changes of personnel as people move on to new challenges.  Like myself, two other senior managers will be leaving the Department, one for a shorter period of time and another in retirement.  I would like to thank both of these in particular - Jim O'Brien and Michael McGrath - for their efforts, particularly on the international framework in Europe in the last couple of years.</p><p>  We have seen the physical reforms in terms of the economy and the banking sector, but what has perhaps not been so obvious to the public is what we have been doing to live up to our statement of strategy and try to build a more modern, professional and forward-looking Department, and to introduce new principles and values into that, which are the principles of equity, partnership, leadership, challenge and integrity, and, of course, openness and transparency.  In many ways, when people reflect on what is described in the statement, they will understand that the challenge we have set ourselves in terms of change has actually gone beyond the recommendations of the Wright report in respect of the Department.  At the time, in 2012, we had a Department with three policy areas but, quite frankly, less attention had been directed towards the support and control function, and many of the changes are actually reflected in what we have done there.  We continue to work away quietly on this.  The job is now well mapped out among the team in the Department and we are well under way, but we are not finished everything that needs to come into place.</p><p>  We have, as we set out in 2012, taken the decision to reunite the budget and tax policy areas so that they work together, and we have also reunited the banking and financial services areas, for reasons that will become obvious if we get into the issue of funding the economy, where we see those two as being much more interconnected.  Our newly created international division has actually opened up the Department to the world a lot more than before, and I will come back to that later.  Our last important policy area is the building of our new economics division, which was possible since John McCarthy's appointment as chief economist.</p> <p>We have tried to move the focus of the Department away from just short-term forecasting to a much more robust discussion of broader economic areas and an engagement with the external world in respect of developing our thoughts.  In the next few years, we would like to move towards a system under which we can have additional economic modelling capacity over and above what we have had in the Department in the past and, more importantly, to integrate what is being done in the economics area with the important work that has been developing in the risk and financial stability capabilities.  </p><p> Most importantly, what we think has been the change in the Department is a completely different focus on what support, risk functions and control functions mean.  We have changed our internal structures to better facilitate a culture of greater challenge.  We have new risk, legal and compliance functions and a completely different way of carrying out peer review of policy directions and advice to the Minister, which are now central pillars of the way we work.  The State's accounts are now produced by a team led by Greg Dempsey, who is on my right and who is an accountant with 20 years' experience.  We have a team of risk officers led by Neil Ryan, who has over 20 years of legal and banking experience.  We now have a new policy committee under the direction of Ann Nolan, who is one of our most experienced civil servants and who has an unparalleled knowledge of each area of practice within the Department, in order to encourage cross-discipline and cross-unit debate.  We have established a legal and compliance unit under Antoine Mac Donncha with a newly recruited experienced compliance officer added to that team, along with other recruited lawyers, to facilitate the legislative process.  Our management advisory committee is operating in a way that looks more like an executive-style management board.  Under Mr. Dempsey's direction, we have also added a new corporate office to support the function in the first instance of the management committee and the new sub-committees - the risk committee and the policy committee.  More importantly, it houses a project management office which now runs quarterly business planning processes and has weekly updates to the management as well as training for all staff in project management techniques.  We have also set out to reinvent how we communicate with the outside world in terms of sharing information both within and outside Ireland.  I think people will have seen the first half of this.  We are also continuing to change the way we communicate internally in the Department.  </p><p> Under the leadership of Niall O'Ceallaigh, who joined the Department shortly before my appointment, we have outsourced operational HR to the shared services function established by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This has freed up our HR function to become what one would expect to see in a professional HR function - focusing on issues such as how we recruit people, how we carry out learning and development, how we carry out flexible resource management, with a biannual exercise that involves looking at our resources and priorities and, more importantly, how we carry out performance management integrated fully with our business planning process.  It is worth saying that we believe we are now managing both the good and bad performance of our teams.  We started this process with a 32% compliance record on performance management systems but we completed that exercise in 2013 with 100% compliance.  Therefore, every staff member in the Department had a full process of evaluation of their performance and the objectives set for them into the future.  </p><p> We have begun what will, unfortunately, be a very long process of enhancing the IT systems in the Department, starting with a new external website for clearer communication but, equally, using that and other methodologies for better internal communication, document sharing and working while we are on the road and out of the office.  As I mentioned to the committee last year, during the course of last year we redirected our internal review and audit committee to look not just at specific issues but much more at the vulnerabilities in the way we tackle strategic areas and help us to scope what the remedial action should be.  This year, we have also begun the process of taking the best of what we have learned from the troika management team and integrating that with our medium-term economic strategy team into a unit to focus on driving economic development and growth.</p><p> The reputation of the Department, like that of Ireland, took a very significant beating.  I believe things are now quite different on both levels.  People recognise the changes that we are trying to make in the Department.  Back in 2012, statements made abroad about being Irish were treated in the same way as working at the Department of Finance was treated.  It was something people avoided volunteering to others.  I can say that this is not a comfortable place from which to drive policy, innovation and implementation.  It was not a comfortable place for our management team to begin the important task of rebuilding morale, our reputation and the belief in delivery that our team need in order to be able to achieve its objectives.  Many members of the team in the past were just diligently doing what they had been asked to do.  Many of them then jumped in with extraordinary efforts once the crisis hit to try to solve the problems facing the country.  It was not a comfortable place for me when I joined the Department in terms of the task and reputational risks that were being put in place.  More importantly, given that the Committee of Public Accounts is a committee that looks across the entire system, it is not a comfortable place in respect of discussions around hiring people whom we are trying to persuade to come into the public sector.  They all have the same worries about reputational risk.  The Department and, in some respects, the broader public sector had gone from being a place where one would want to work to being a place that people preferred to avoid.  That is a task that I would ask the committee, along with other colleagues that remain in the system, to continue to think very seriously about.  We also ask the committee to do what it can to support ways in which we can continue to improve the system, to be innovative, to be brave in setting our targets and to attract the best talent to the public sector.  </p><p> On the plus side, as with the economy of Ireland, we found that the fundamental foundations of the Department were the right ones for a rebuilding exercise.  The staff had a deep commitment to the job at hand and a willingness to go beyond the call of duty to devote time and energy to their task.  There was, however, an acknowledgement that it was necessary to deploy more investment.  There was an equal acknowledgement that there was a need for additional skills.  Over the course of the past few years, we have now recruited more than 100 new people into a Department of 300, a statistic that may surprise some people who believe that things have not changed.  Many of our team members have refocused, are being trained, are coaching and are being mentored so that they can compete for new positions and prove that sometimes people who are already in the Department are the best people for the job.  To prove that point and to reinforce it, we have also been operating in the past year or two a rule that is unique to the Department.  We will only fill positions at the levels of assistant principal and above through a competition that is open to the public, including internal staff.</p><p> We have been changing the way we do business to put stakeholders first.  I have identified a number of issues in the statement that go towards the various stakeholders.  I will not necessarily go through them in great detail other than to point out that we believe that for the Government and Oireachtas, we have changed very significantly the way we interact to allow ourselves to be open to fair challenge of our own thoughts and, more importantly, not be afraid to change our own advice if new perspectives or arguments are brought to our attention.  However, we needed to change quite dramatically the way in which information is handled and stored in the Department.  This job will be costly and it will take a lot of time to achieve best practice.  While there has been much improvement in recent years in the quality of information on which we must base our daily decisions, it is still very much below what I would consider to be the optimal level for policy decisions to be made on a national basis.  It will require considerable further investment of technology and time.  We are not yet where we need to be to data-mine the wealth of information that must be present across all Government organs of State so as to make the best decisions.  This should be a priority across the entire system.  We need to continue to break down silos and improve communication flows, to be more efficient and to use technology to do that.  One of the small successes that is of particular importance as a starting point for us is that after processing 5,866 parliamentary questions using a paper-based system in 2013, we now have an electronic system, so moving physical files around the Department will no longer be a feature of our work in 2014.</p> <p>Equally, we are aware of the leadership role that we need to play.  In dealing with stakeholders we have been trying to engage somewhat differently with the wider public service by showing greater leadership and leading from the front.  Mr. John Hogan has chaired two very important committees on mortgage arrears and SME credit to drive a cross-departmental piece of work.  I commend, in particular, the way he has embraced the new management techniques we have been using in the Department and has allowed them to be used across a much broader system.  We have also been responsible, under the direction of Mr. Paul Ryan, for a number of shared services projects which are key to making the public service more efficient.  We have been involved in the Clearing House strategic group and have led the performance of the medium-term economic strategy, as well as supporting Action Plan for Jobs.  We have also stepped up to the mark in Europe.  My colleague, Mr. Aidan Carrigan, has been appointed vice chairman of the financial services committee in Europe, which has significantly increased Ireland's influence in respect of policy decisions coming out of Europe.</p><p> I have heard it said over the course of the past two years that the Department is closed to the views of industry and the social pillar, but this is not the case.  For many years, under Mr. Derek Moran's direction, the tax policy unit in particular has been leading the way in terms of the way it consults outside stakeholders.  However, we recognised that more could be done and that we could be more transparent.  As a result, we have published diaries on our website to ensure people know who we are meeting and that we are available for meetings.  We have also taken a break from tradition by identifying on our website - by name and photo - our management team in order that people understand who is responsible for what within the Department and to promote accountability for our actions.</p><p> The example that sticks out the most for me in terms of changes to the way the Department operates is the way in which we handled the preparation of the medium-term economic strategy.  We consulted not just with people in the system, that is, the economists with whom we discussed the type of areas we should be examining as we developed a plan for the next seven years, but also with external stakeholders of an official type.  More important, as we worked our way through the system, we realised that this is a country that has changed dramatically, and so we set up a young entrepreneurs event where we brought people of diversity into the environment.  We invited young entrepreneurs under the age of 35, female entrepreneurs and people who did not grow up in Ireland to give their views, which assisted us in developing a path for the next seven years.  The way in which we deal with academia has also changed significantly.  We now think we are moving into an environment where the Department is able to produce papers and information which will help others to analyse the same policy issues with which we are struggling as we go through the various actions we have to do.</p><p> I have mentioned the way in which we have changed our engagement with the international world.  Ireland does not live in a vacuum and we have commented on the need for a new engagement with respect to Europe and the outer world.  By having a new international division, we have done that, not only by having our people visiting other areas but also by engaging in very significant bilateral secondments to other treasuries and to the European Commission as we build our team and have new people come to work with us.</p><p> The public, however, remains our most important stakeholder.  Our Department is less public facing than others in terms of the delivery of our services.  We are conscious, however, that every decision we make has a direct or indirect impact on all public shareholders.  This means we are fully aware at all times of our responsibility not only to work to increase living standards but also to ensure we do the maximum to ensure sustainable growth for the future and avoid pitfalls that are inevitably lurking ahead.  We have invested a lot of time in improving the communication channels we use for the public.  I can also say that in the Department there is a greater recognition that we owe a particular duty to the public to ensure we do whatever we can to avoid falling into another failing in the management of the economy.  For that job, the embedding of a new culture of openness, of internal and external challenge, peer review, risk management and robust and innovative policy formulation is key.  This is not easy stuff, in case anyone thinks it is.  It requires ensuring adequate investment to have access to the best talent and the best information.  It also means learning to listen and embracing an environment - often lacking in organisations - of open, free and honest debate and mutual trust, where everyone's views are well received and cheap shots avoided.  It means nurturing talent to create the leaders of tomorrow who need to be instilled with a sense of creativity to help to develop policies for a changing world and also a sense of conviction and of courage to be able to identify the next problem and shout "stop" when it is needed.</p><p> As I said earlier, I am proud of the team with whom I have worked.  I hope this committee and our other stakeholders are happier with what we have been doing in recent years.  Along the way I have had occasion to mention many of the senior managers of our team, but it is the other unsung members of the staff to whom real credit must go.  They are the people who have made our results a reality.  I thank the committee members for their attention and hope I have stirred some thoughts and ideas about what we might talk about.  I welcome the opportunity to address the committee and look forward to questions from members.</p></speech>

I echo what the Chairman said in his opening remarks as I have always enjoyed our exchanges with Mr. Moran at this committee.  He has been a transformative Secretary General at the Department of Finance.  As he said in his opening statement, today is a good opportunity to look back at the past two years and how the Department has been managed.  If we have time, I would also like to look at the medium-term strategy because it is probably the most important document the Department has produced during Mr. Moran's tenure and it merits detailed examination.  As this may be Mr. Moran's last appearance before the committee, I invite him to be as open and forthcoming as he would like to be in discussing issues relating to the Department.</p><p>  Mr. Moran mentioned the Wright report in his opening statement.  Was that the first document Mr. Moran picked up when he went into the Department two years ago?  Is that where he started?</p></speech>

I had to deal with the banking stuff first, but in the course of the first year I had the luxury of working in the banking unit before becoming Secretary General, and that allowed me to observe the way the Department worked.  Clearly, I had my own observations in terms of governance and various issues.  At the time, the Department was being split in two, which meant there was an opportunity to revisit governance structures in a way that might not have been possible if everything had been as before.  The Wright report had identified issues within the Department, and Mr. Kevin Cardiff quite correctly suggested that before I embarked on developing my own ideas about where we might go, I should pick it up.  In fact, we compiled a report on all the recommendations in the Wright report against what we could do.  As I mentioned and as is obvious from the list I have just given, there were other things that were obvious in terms of what was needed in the Department, some of which were caused by the split.  Inevitably when one splits a whole into two, some pieces move to either side of the line and that left some gaps we needed to fill.</p></speech>

What has changed is that in the past two years we have tried to split up peoples' responsibilities more.  Setting up a corporate office to drive issues like the introduction of business planning meant that there were people for whom that was their day job.  They were then insulated somewhat from some of the day-to-day problems that were hitting us from all sides at that stage.</p></speech>

The Department has been totally restructured in the past two years.  There has been a total change in the landscape in terms of how the Department of Finance works.  Is that fair to say?</p></speech>

What became obvious to me - risk is a good example - is that many people in the Department were focused on what one would describe as risk.  Risk was being managed by people who were thinking about the risks if tax receipts did not come in at the right level or the risks in terms of banking issues.</p> <p>What is different in the way we have approached it is that while people are still focused on those, spend their time identifying risks they deal with and come up with plans as to how to deal with them, there are now separate groups of people who manage the risk register. They sit in a room with other people across the Department thinking about risks that occur across the whole area in order to do a peer review.  Some of that structure was missing.  We have been involved in the recently published national risk assessment whereby some of those techniques will spread all the way across Government.</p></speech>

It is very difficult with hindsight to try to decide what one would or would not have done.  One observation I had during the time I was there was that compared with other environments in which I had worked, we were looking at a series of challenges that were being managed by people that were critical point issues to be dealt with across the system.  Even at that stage, there was some limited information in terms of being able to deal with them.  It is easy to say that in other environments we would have seen more people dealing with those issues.  However, people took the decisions, which were perhaps understandable at the time in terms of budgetary restrictions, not to resource the problems as much as they might have.  One of the lessons is that we have to find a just medium, both at this committee and elsewhere, to avoid creating an environment where people are afraid to spend money and invest in dealing with problems.</p></speech>

Are there any recommendations Mr. Moran did not agree with in that report?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-08a.101" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Moran" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014050800011#K00500"><p>Off the top of my head, I do not recall exactly what it was.  I know we spent a lot of time going through them.  In fact, we have even sent a document to this committee.  Some of the recommendations were no longer relevant, quite frankly, because the Wright report was about a Department with a lot of other issues, including spending.  Our approach differs from the Wright report.  In fact, it was more necessary due to the way we had restructured the Department shortly after my arrival in 2011.  When we brought in the team from the NTMA, which was managing shareholdings in the banks, we integrated everything into one unit rather than having two separate ones.  It became easier to see that, in some respects, we were also not just the Department looking after the State's finances but also the Department looking after shareholdings in six large institutions, some of which were being wound down, and NAMA on top of that.  Moving towards an environment that would replicate a large holding company structure and having a legal department and a risk committee was a much more obvious step at that stage because the Department had a policy function and a shareholding function.</p><p>  In discussing it with colleagues, we understood that the type of techniques used in the management of shareholdings and entities were quite applicable to a lot of the decisions we were taking and the way in which we were dealing with issues and policies.</p></speech>

The recommendations in the Wright report talked about substantially increasing analytical capacity in the tax policy area.  We spoke previously about getting the right staff in the Department and Mr. Moran mentioned that today in terms of reputational risk.  It has also been raised in terms of salaries.  I think Mr. Moran said that 100 new staff have come in.  Is he happy with the Department's capacity to meet things like tax forecasting or risk analysis in various areas?</p></speech>

There is a certain duplication of effort when things are too manual.  When one is moving from one spreadsheet to another, one must double-check stuff.  If one had a single, integrated system, we could have a lot more information.  We could optimally have a better sense of where forecasting needs to go by drawing on information sources from other areas.  That technology does not exist in the system at the moment.<br />As for the more intellectual challenge of doing this, I think we are in very good shape.  When I took over as Secretary General, we were fortunate that a large number of institutions volunteered staff to us.  It was simply not possible to hire staff at the necessary speed so that we could work <i>pro bono</i>in the Department and train up people internally.  It takes some time to do that.<br />During Ireland's EU Presidency we had a similar interchange of people who came in from the private sector and worked with the Department.  We still have some work to do in encouraging and allowing more people - who have grown up in the Department and have it as a future career - to spend some time externally in other environments and <i>vice versa</i>with other people.  That mix of skill sets will improve the overall position.</p></speech>

We can use some of the work that has been done by the Central Statistics Office and others, and have a greater investment in using this type of stuff, because we are in a world of open data.  However, we are not necessarily in a position yet where those techniques are finding their way into the cohesive whole of government approach.</p></speech>

Maybe I can say this today, but I could not have said it two days ago.  I do not think we should be ignorant of the fact that this is a very large multi-year project.  Some of the work that Mr. Dempsey is trying to do on financial accounts concerns a series of improvements over many years which will involve quite a lot of effort by people.  As we move out of a period of crisis management across the entire system into a period of stability and building for the future, I think there is an opportunity to focus on this kind of stuff as well.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is looking at techniques to allow a whole of government approach to reform.</p></speech>

In effect, that allows people to continue working together very well.  We are both participating in economic management councils and we share the preparation of papers.  There is a quarterly exercise of looking at Exchequer returns, which involves both the expenditure side and the revenue side.  By definition, that means that people are constantly stitched together during the year, which is incredibly important in preparing the budget at the other end.</p><p>  We both have a shared purpose and shared views on infrastructure and development in the State.  They help to identify the projects that need to be done.  Our Department can bring to that some of the other elements of what we do in terms of financing techniques to bring new financing to those type of objectives.</p></speech>

We took the view that should be done for a number of reasons.  One of the things that has occurred is that it has also helped to set the benchmark for people and an understanding for those inside.  We have had a number of people who have been successful in competitions at a particular level.  After a year of performance management and further training, realising they have additional skills, some have found they can go for competition at a level above that and move with extra speed through the system to find their appropriate level.  It has been very successful as an exercise and well received by staff.</p></speech>

We had a difficulty the first year it started.  Due to the lack of completion at the beginning, the objectives had not necessarily been set for people.  Now we are in the second cycle of where we are going.  What should happen is that objectives should be set on an individual basis for all staff and checked by the corporate office and human resources people to ensure they map up with the business planning process and align with the Department's objectives, individual units' deliverables and how individuals contribute to those over the course of the year.  To the extent that we identify at the beginning of the year that additional training or help might be useful to complete those objectives or for other reasons of progression, it is noted on the form.  The form then crosses to the HR team which builds that into the learning and development plan for the person.  There is a mid-year review and at the end of the year there is a genuine series of conversations with people.</p><p>  What was interesting as a departure in the last series and what worked very well was that there had been some discussion about whether and how one sets the exam equally for people across the entire Department.  Inevitably, people are achieving or exceeding objectives.  For the system to work well, it is important they feel the same exam standard is set for everyone.  To encourage that, we introduced in this round - beginning at senior management level - a Department-wide discussion on all principal officers, cascading down, whereby views were exchanged as to what the relative performances of those people were.  We asked those people in turn, who were initially dubious about how the process worked, to do the same thing for the assistant principal officers who were working to them.  This year, we have got to a point where people feel a lot more comfortable that this represents a fair assessment.  We have had situations where we have identified people as performing less well than their peers and worked with them to improve by obtaining the right skill sets and training.</p><p>  As I have said, there was a six year period where very little training was done in the Department.  Working with that, members will see in our accounts the extra budget funding for training and development now.</p></speech>

There is a path to go through.  We now have a risk committee that meets monthly.  The committee will have to continue to meet and talk about risks.  With each subsequent discussion, the discussion gets better.  The process works better and the crossover between that and the policy committee and all the various communications that have to happen improves.</p><p>  The parliamentary question submission system means that process is now paperless.  We are moving that technology to cover all submissions that go through on policy matters.  This will help to create a much improved record of the process of deliberation.  The system will be automated to allow it be searched more easily.  It is a continuous process of improvement and it does not just stop.</p></speech>

I was interested in the documentation Mr. Moran provided to us on the cost of the banking crisis, which is a heading on a chart on page 27 of the document from a speech Mr. Moran delivered last week.  He had various charts with him which I wish to summarise.  I quote his figures as we all get lost on these issues.</p><p>  The first chart I found interesting was on page 7 of his document and it illustrated the dependency on banking in Europe.  Essentially, the point the Department or Mr. Moran was making was that the banking crisis had a far greater impact in Europe than in the USA.  He set out figures showing that the aggregate balance sheets of the EU banks were four times higher for the EU GDP whereas in the US, they represent only 0.8% of GDP.  It probably explains how they were able to take a hit like the collapse of Lehman Brothers when the banking sector was not even 1% of GDP.  In Europe, the European Central Bank had to be far more defensive of the banking system and maintaining banks which represented 4% of GDP.  Whether it was right or wrong is another day's work entirely.  Has the percentage changed much?  Does that suggest that Europe continues to be at greater risk if there is something wrong with European banks versus banks in the United States where the banking sector is a much smaller proportion of the economy?</p><p>  Comparing Europe and the USA, what is the position in the OECD or among other major partners?  Are they closer to the high level of European dependence on the banking sector as part of its GDP?  Is the OECD average closer to the USA?  Is there a fundamental strategic weakness in being so dependent on the banking sector in Europe?</p></speech>

In the speech associated with this, I make reference to how we have been approaching the problem over the past couple of years.  Europe and Ireland had a particular vulnerability at the time of the impact of the crisis because so much of the economy was funded on bank balance sheets.  The impact of regulatory change designed to make banks safer, which has been coming through the system thereafter, had a disproportionate impact on the European economy as a result.  To answer the question on the OECD, looking at Canada and Australia and what has been happening in other countries, we find that infrastructural funding continues to be significantly funded through capital markets instruments outside the pure banking system.  A bit like the US, although that is more to the other extreme, they have embraced non-bank techniques for funding growth in the various economies.  We took advantage of this and were able to benefit from it in 2011 when we took the decision to accelerate the sale of the Anglo Irish Bank portfolio in the United States.  It was obvious to us early in 2011 that the US had recovered to have more liquidity than Europe.  That liquidity allowed us to derive a pricing benefit in respect of the sale that was not obvious here.  In some respects, from that point onwards, as we think about what we have been trying to do in the banking policy area, which is one of the reasons pulling together the financial services team and the banking policy team makes more sense from our perspective, we have been trying to fix the banking system and trying to encourage funding sources that are not within the banks.  A measure of success of that in Ireland, which has put us ahead of the European system, is that following the liquidation of IBRC, which was a large part of our domestic banking system, very little of the credit supplied by that bank moved to the domestic banking sector.  That has allowed us, particularly in the funding of real estate projects, to move to an environment where significant funds come into our system other than through the banking system.  The obligations of Basel III and other regulatory changes is that credit will be more expensive if provided by banks.</p></speech>

It was roughly &euro;100 million each, amounting to &euro;300 million and 2% of GDP in the domestic banking system.  In some respects, the failure was that by operating the system we did not have many deposits.  The structural difficulties in existence were that there were two types of economy - domestic and international - funded through the same banking system so a stable domestic deposit base, around &euro;150 billion, was funding a much larger banking system.  We also moved over the NAMA assets, which had come out of the banking system and a lot of other deleveraging had taken place.</p></speech>

This submission states that Ireland invested &euro;64 billion in our banking sector, which was 40% of GDP at that time and Mr. Moran is saying that, since then, we have generated income of &euro;5.2 billion from the bank guarantee, &euro;4.7 billion from the sale of Bank of Ireland contingent convertible capital notes, CoCos, Irish Life and the redemption of preference shares by Bank of Ireland, bringing the net figure to &euro;54 billion.  Mr. Moran is saying that the State investment in Bank of Ireland is &euro;1.5 billion, &euro;11.6 billion in AIB and &euro;400 million in Permanent TSB, amounting to a total value of &euro;13.5 billion.  Some &euro;40.7 billion is the net cost to the Irish taxpayer to date, with &euro;64 billion being the top line figure, &euro;1 billion generated from the matters mentioned and assets, based on the valuations on page 27, of &euro;13.5 billion.

In the context of the IBRC liquidation, it is important to make points about the process.  I mentioned the experience over the course of the past year compared to what we had anticipated.  The positive momentum behind the sovereign debt issues and the stability in the economy has moved the horizon of investments for investors, particularly non-Irish investors but increasingly Irish investors, from a position of not wanting to invest in Irish assets to being very happy to invest in those assets.  It has allowed us to take advantage of the opportunity to sell up to 90% of the assets of the bank rather than have them transferred to NAMA.  This has put us into a virtuous circle because by not having to do so, it got people comfortable with the idea that there was not a residual liability in some respects in NAMA.  Even more satisfactorily from our perspective, the risk we faced at the beginning of the process - of potentially discovering that the valuation of the assets when put into the process may lead to a residual risk for the State - has been overcome.</p> <p>The exercise of doing that, however, is complicated.  Our team in the Department has been doing that internally.  We have some inevitable costs that were associated with the liquidation originally and the legal transactions associated with that.  I will leave Mr. Carville to deal with the costs to the liquidator, because he has been involved in trying to push those downwards.</p></speech>

They are legally obliged to produce a statement of affairs two years post liquidation, which will be February 2015.  At that point, they will detail the total cost of the exercise.  There is quite a bit of uncertainty around the ultimate outcome of the exercise and around some outstanding litigation.  Therefore, it is not possible to predict what the final cost will be, but they should be in a position to produce that statement in February 2015.</p></speech>

It was a very closed circle of knowledge and it is a credit to the people involved that confidentiality was maintained right until the ultimate announcement.</p><p>  In regard to the costs, they are based on NAMA agreed rates with liquidators for services of this nature.  In addition, we managed to negotiate an additional discount, based on the volume of work, both on the legal side and on the side of the special liquidators.  However, I am not in a position today to give an actual quantum figure.</p></speech>

Therefore, whether it goes on for six months or three years, the longer the process takes, the more hours are involved.  The early successful conclusion of the project, meaning a lesser transfer to NAMA, was probably a bonus.  It sounds like a tribunal, with a daily or hourly rate agreed, but with no limit on the number of hours, perhaps millions, that can be included in the process.  This is what it seems like to me.  It seems it was set up in a similar way to tribunals.</p></speech>

One of the difficulties here is that when one asks the liquidator to undertake the job of effectively managing the bank down to zero, one must do an analysis - I am reluctant to give any sense of the position, although I am happy to send the Deputy the analysis - and compare the total cost of effort required to do the job being done against what the bank would have done.  The bank would have had a certain number of staff at the outset and nobody would have considered this expense to be external fees as these staff were the employees in the bank.</p><p>  We must trust the liquidator to make these decisions, to the extent that the liquidator, in managing the process, might decide to reduce the number of staff and supplement that by people of his own team.  The Deputy should recall that at the outset of this exercise, it was unclear what level of co-operation one would get from the existing teams in banks.  Therefore, we had to have a certain element of external and double cover in the earlier weeks.  As things stabilised, the liquidator was able to conduct the exercise of winding down the banks, using both his own team and the people in the bank.  Therefore, the appropriate measure of analysis would be to compare the expected cost of running the bank during this period of time against the cost now of running the bank plus the cost of the liquidators' fees.  In a sense, whether one pays for somebody who is an employee of the liquidator or of the bank to do treasury activity, it is appropriate to look at both.  One analysis we were doing was to continue to monitor the expenditure of the liquidator, in the context of adding that to the cost of running the banks, to ensure we did not get into a situation of excessive expenditure, given the job in hand.  At the same time, we recognised a considerably different job needed to be done.</p><p>  Mr. Carville referred to the fact that as we went into the process, we realised significant volumes of work were involved and that the process would take longer because of the level of due diligence that needed to be done and because of the repair job that needed to be done on the assets to allow them to be sold, in the context of legal and other work.  Therefore, we re-engaged with the liquidators and the legal firms and despite the lack of a legal right to do so or to require them to exercise a reconsideration of their fees, they have reduced them.  We will get the figures on that for the Deputy, but we need to do the analysis to get the total picture on that.</p></speech>

I agree the committee should have the information, but it is important we maintain an analysis around the cost of exercises that is in some perspective to the job that is required to be done.  This exercise was one which done badly could have resulted in significant costs of billions of euro for the taxpayer.  Done well, it has resulted in no additional exposure for the taxpayer and will likely pay out to some of the extra creditors who expected nothing.</p><p>  I will send the committee more work on the specific analysis, but were not prepared for that coming here today. </p></speech>

It is very difficult to find effective benchmarks, but the other one I would suggest is a consideration of how the cost of winding down the &euro;20 billion in Anglo Irish Bank compares with the costs incurred by NAMA for a proportionate wind-down of some of its assets.  Might we find, for example, that the special liquidator process was actually a more efficient way of disposing of &euro;20 billion than setting up a State agency in the form of NAMA?  Alternatively, will we conclude that NAMA, with its complement of staff and so on, would have been a more efficient way to deal with IBRC?  I am trying to find a benchmark by which to assess what is being done.  It is fine to be given a figure, but what we really want to know is whether that figure represents value for money.  We can only come to a conclusion in that regard by comparing what NAMA has done with what others in the same line of business are doing.  I agree it is right not to have two State organisations essentially doing the same business, namely, winding down bad bank loans.  I see the sense in that, but has the Department compared one with the other?  I realise there are different scales involved here.</p></speech>

The liquidator's job, on the other hand, had two components, one of which was an exercise of stabilisation of a situation with a lot of uncertainty around it in terms of the level of co-operation that might be achieved.  To the credit of the team in the bank, its members have co-operated very significantly with the liquidator, which has in itself helped to reduce the external costs.  In many ways, that reflects the good result we have achieved in terms of where we have ended up.</p><p>  The NAMA situation is different.  There is a review that is constantly taking place that is apart from the statutory reviews.  One sees that the business objectives of NAMA have evolved over time with the new market we are in.  As Irish assets have become more attractive and, by definition, more expensive for buyers and better for the taxpayer, NAMA has engaged in an acceleration of the wind-down over and above what was expected at the beginning.  It also has mapped some of what it has been doing in terms of the disposal strategies - something it was not doing two or three years ago - to reflect the fact that we now have real estate investment trusts which are additional acquirers of assets.  By increasing the number of acquirers, the value of the assets has gone up.</p></speech>

Even though it was done by statute, in reality, it involves the same process.  The first and primary creditor was effectively the Central Bank of Ireland, which represented the residual emergency liquidity assistance, ELA, funding arising from the State guarantee.  That is why we speak about the importance of selling the assets over and above a threshold.  Once we get over that threshold, the State's contingent liability becomes nil.  If any remaining assets arise after that which can be disposed of and create cash, then the unsecured creditors will participate in that.  It is important to recall, however, that the State is part of the liquidation and had a responsibility for the guarantee of the large payout of deposits that happened at the time.  Therefore, when we sum up all of the unsecured creditors of IBRC, the State is one of those unsecured creditors in that respect, and quite an important one as a percentage matter.</p></speech>

Is it a good thing if we can at least recover par or does he believe we should hold out longer and perhaps make a profit, thereby bringing down the net cost of the banking investment to well below the &euro;40 billion we have been discussing?</p></speech>

It is a little early to make predictions and we are awaiting a report from the board, but we are doing our own review.  The stabilisation of the market that we have seen in the past year or so has happened much faster than was foreseen and is at the high end of any expectation we had.  That has opened up different opportunities in respect of how we look at NAMA.  However, I would like to have the views of the board before saying anything definitive in that regard.</p></speech>

ACC Bank, Danske Bank and Bank of Scotland have either moved out of the Irish market or are winding down their operations here.  We are facing a situation, in other words, where we will have very few banks and very little competition.  I do not see that issue being fully addressed in the documents to which Mr. Moran referred.  It seems clear to me that the greatest problem in the banking sector in Ireland in the years to come will be the fact there are so few banks in the market.</p><p>  In regard to the European stress tests that will take place later in the year, we have spoken about the high dependency of EU economies on the banking sector when considered relative to GDP.  We are now hearing that some of the larger banks are working to exclude some of their assets from these stress tests.  In such a scenario, how valid will the tests really be?  Is there a situation where the EU does not want full stress tests because if the result of those tests are poor, that could have another negative impact on the EU economy?</p></speech>

The point I was trying to make is that we are of the view that people should look first at the size of funding that is going into the economy.  I do not know what the exact percentage will end up being but, for example, if we move to a scenario in which 50% of the funding of the economy comes from banks and 50% comes from non-banks, then, by definition, even if we only have three or four banks, they are only comprising half of the funding source.  We need to take account in doing the calculation of how many participants are funding the economy of those parties who are playing on the other side.  We plan to use the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and the strategic investment bank to allow more funders to come into the market, not necessarily as banks but as participants who can facilitate an increase in competition.  We are concerned about ensuring there are enough providers of funding in the system, but the analysis of the issue is a little more complex than it might appear.</p><p>  The other important aspect to consider in regard to competition is that we are moving into a world of banking union, where a European regulator will, in effect, be regulating all of the banks across Europe.  The Deputy is correct in observing that at the beginning of the crisis what we saw was a nationalisation of banking systems, where national regulators were reluctant to allow their banks to participate in lending activities in other jurisdictions, especially where domestic deposits were concerned.  A well-functioning banking union should allow us to reverse the worst impacts of those developments and get back to a situation in which European banks are participating in activities across the Union, and the eurozone in particular.  We see a perfectly plausible scenario developing where we stop talking about banks as French, Italian or whatever, because they have become European banks in the same way that we think of United States banks.  It is a lot easier to imagine in such a scenario that we would see a return of European banks into the Irish economy, particularly if our economy is growing.</p></speech>

How do issues such as Setanta Insurance going into liquidation impact on that fund?  Do Setanta Insurance and Quinn Insurance, for instance, have a call on the fund?</p></speech>

The problem was that Setanta was an insurance company that was regulated in another European country.  In other words, it was engaging in "passporting" in order to write insurance in Ireland.  The important issue in this regard is that there are a number of limits on the way the insurance compensation fund actually operates and the pay-out it will make.  If, for example, it is a 65% pay-out, there is an overall cap of &euro;850,000 in terms of the amount that will ultimately be paid out.  That is why, in the management of this exercise, the Central Bank and others have been encouraging people who are policyholders with the company to take out new policies.  There are groups in my Department and the Central Bank which are working through the various issues involved.  These issues remain complex in the context of whether the funds are available or whether they can cover corporate purchasers of insurance versus individual purchasers.  There is also the question of what happens if there are two insurance policies in place.  It is important that the first policy is terminated and that the new one then comes into play.  I do not believe we have an expectation of what the actual pay-out might be, but the fund will need to cover it because, in effect, it operates a little like the uninsured-----</p></speech>

Effectively, the State had no control over that company's behaviour because it was not regulated here and, as a result, Irish people have lost out.  Mr. Moran appears to be saying we should take steps in this regard in respect of our financial institutions and that there should be pan-European rather than national banks.  If that were to happen, customers of banks based in other jurisdictions could suffer the same fate as those who took out policies with Setanta.  The more one denationalises the banks, etc., the more one opens Irish citizens up to encountering problems in other jurisdictions.  Mr. Moran has stated this is how the banking sector should evolve in the future.  Are we not just asking for a bigger problem down the line?</p></speech>

What we have learned in the banking system, for example, is that the infrastructure previously in place within it was not suited to the environment to which I refer.  It did not mirror the underlying framework of the economy or the fiscal position.  That is why we are standardising deposit protection and the regulation of banks across Europe.  It is all coming from the same place; therefore, there is less likelihood of there being a divergence or a failure in an individual national system.  This is the opposite; it is a national-----</p></speech>

I take the opportunity to commend him for the work he has done to date, but I must admit that I am somewhat intrigued as to why he is leaving the Department of Finance.  I suspect many others feel the same way.  I was trying to think of an analogy for what is happening and the one I have come up with is that it is similar to going to the cinema to see a film and walking out halfway through.  That said, it is incumbent on me to note that a great deal of work has been done and the fact that the public finances have stabilised, that there is growth in the economy and that the national debt is decreasing, albeit it very slowly.  When one considers the work already done and what has been put in train, it is difficult to understand why Mr. Moran is leaving.</p><p>  Will Mr. Moran outline the current position of AIB, Permanent TSB and Bank of Ireland in terms of the State's investment in them and their being fully privatised again at some point in the future?  In the context of the 2013 statement by the European Union to the effect that it would consider the recapitalisation of the Irish banks, will he comment on the sheer cost of the financial crisis to Ireland?  I would like our debt levels to be reduced even further and the issue of bank debt is a central element in that regard.  Will Mr. Moran outline his general views on where our dealings with the European Union on the retrospective recapitalisation of Irish banks come into play in this matter?</p><p>  On SME and mortgage lending, representatives of the banks appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform in recent weeks.  Will Mr. Moran comment on the fact that almost 50% of the so-called sustainable solutions relating to mortgage debt take the form of legal letters, rather than anything more concrete or long-term in nature?  There are only approximately 38 mortgage-to-rent schemes, of which AIB and Bank of Ireland have each only approved one.  During a recent lecture - I do not know whether it was intended to be the case, but this ended up in the public domain - Professor Morgan Kelly commented on the possible impact SME lending could have on economic recovery.  Has the Department had interaction with Professor Kelly?</p><p>  I acknowledge the great work already done, but a number of issues remain outstanding.  Perhaps Mr. Moran might comment on some of them.  Will he also indicate why he does not intend to continue the work he has started?</p></speech>

I am certainly flattered by all of the comments to the effect that I should remain in the Department, particularly as they appear to indicate I could contribute something more.  The Department is now much more transparent in its operations and to continue the Deputy's analogy, we are actually watching the sequel to the movie via the Internet and reading about it on the website.</p><p>  It is important that people understand there is nothing sinister about my decision to depart.  I returned to the system in 2010.  It has certainly been an intense and fun four year period in terms of what has happened.  It is important to understand what is involved when one is obliged to deal with what, in effect, is crisis-management.  Everyone can remember what the system was like previously.  We have circulated a number of papers which detail what has been achieved in recent years.  There are benchmarks one could try to identify in the context of when one should leave.  I do not think it is necessarily a good idea for people to always assume that they are going to remain in the same place forever.</p> <p>I have been saying to many of the people involved, not only this crew around me who are now well capable of continuing with the job, but those we could not find space for because there are only a certain limited number of seats in the committee room, that it has always been a management principle of mine that I should always find a way to make myself redundant.  If a person becomes indispensable in any way in his job he may miss an even bigger challenge or opportunity ahead to which he could contribute.</p></speech>

There was one main objective in respect of the job in hand, although back in 2010 that was not necessarily the way of measuring it, because it did not materialise until later in that year when I was asked to become involved in thinking about the banking system while I was at the Central Bank.  In some respects the question was about when we would be able to say that the country was back in the markets again and that we had exited the troika programme.  Perhaps it would have been a difficult and a different decision had we gone for a precautionary credit line at the end of last year.  I suppose I am pleased to say that we did not and it has worked out and therefore now I can make this decision with a free scope.</p><p>  Perhaps other things had to be done but the other job that I had to do during that period was, having accepted the role of Secretary General, to identify based on my experience and the discussions I was having with others - there are references to this in the report - what I thought could get fixed on a parallel programme, and to put in place a programme to allow that to happen.</p><p>  No one has the single truth in respect of what needs to get done.  The best way to do this is to hand it over to someone else who can improve further what needs to happen next.  Let us consider where we have come from, even in the past four years, compared to the type of thing that we discussed the first time I appeared before this committee.  We have liquidated IBRC and the State is back in the markets.  I could not say it in my earlier statement to the staff yesterday morning because it was too sensitive, but the restructuring plan of AIB has been agreed and the restructuring plan of Bank of Ireland has been agreed.  We are significantly down in State ownership.  A series of other things have happened in that respect.  As I mentioned already, it was important for me during the course of last year to try to identify what needed to happen for the future and, in effect, lay out an analysis of where we, as a team, thought things should go.  This was in effect set out in the medium-term economic strategy at the end of the year.  That now gives to my successor and others in the system a direction of travel that comes after the troika programme.  It clearly sets out where we should be going and how we should be working to the next phase of the recovery of the economy.</p></speech>

The last time I left for six months, I stayed away for six years.  This was an important issue for me and perhaps this is why it is a little unusual as an approach.  I took the view, given the role I had and the number of conflicts that would have existed in respect of any discussions about what the future held, that it was critical for me and the system that I would not engage in an exercise of negotiating a contract or taking part in any other discussions about what I might do next.  From this perspective, whether it is a public sector or a private sector role and whether it is in Ireland or elsewhere, I can genuinely tell the committee that I have no specific plans or no definite preferences at this stage.  It will take a given time to put in place a successor and it was equally important for me that there was not a vacuum in the Department at such a critical time.  Anyway, it seemed that this was an opportune time to leave because it will allow the successor time to get his or her feet under the desk in advance of the budget coming at the end of the year, which is in fact the next critical issue.</p></speech>

Let us develop that.  Obviously, many good things have happened.  Let us focus on the banking system.  Will Mr. Moran offer his thoughts on where he sees the future for AIB, Permanent TSB and Bank of Ireland?  Can he link that to the mortgage restructuring arrangements that are taking place and the fact that 50% of these appear to be in legal letter form?  There is an issue in terms of remuneration.  I am asking the questions that the person looking in wants asked.  There is an issue with the large salaries of some of the chief executives of the banks.  What is Mr. Moran's view on how to deal with that?</p><p>  A commitment was given at the European Council meeting in July 2013 to the effect that the Council would consider the retrospective recapitalisation of the banks.  Will Mr. Moran offer the committee his perspective on that?  A significant amount of our national debt is tied into that area.  Obviously, it could make a significant difference in terms of the burden.  Will Mr. Moran outline his interaction with Morgan Kelly on the SMEs?</p></speech>

The particular banks that we chose to keep in the system in 2011 have been on a journey.  In the beginning we thought about this in terms of five steps and we are now very much in the last step.  Stability is restored, there is liquidity, they have been capitalised and so on.  We are now at the point where we must ensure those banks actually function to service the economy.</p></speech>

Mr. Carville and his team have been engaging with the Central Bank and the banks and we are starting to crunch the numbers.  We believe that our banks are well positioned going in to these stress tests compared to some of the other banking systems in Europe.  We have already done an asset quality review.  They are redoing the exercise albeit with a different pinch point in time.  However, broadly speaking we do not expect to see surprises in that element.  When we analyse the stress test parameters and where they are relative to the economy and property prices, which, of course, are a significant driver, and so on we maintain that they are where the banks already are in terms of some of the capitalisation we carried out in 2011.</p></speech>

It was certainly a far greater uncertainty for us earlier in the year because until such time as we know the parameters it is very difficult to know what the stress tests will be.  In some respects the parameters of the stress tests, which involve looking forwards as opposed to looking at the current books of the banks, were going to be a decision of those in the European regulator about whether they believed the banks should operate with a particular level of capital or more, all of which represents an investment in the banks.  However, it is a different leverage for the balance sheet.  The point where they put that level would have been a result of where they set the parameters of the stress tests.  We believe that with the current levels of capitalisation in the banks and where they have put it, at least in the first instance, it seems as if we are in a good position with respect to going into those tests.</p> <p> Banks are slightly different.  They have different parameters, so we will need to examine each individually, but we do not expect to see a significant shock of the magnitude experienced previously.</p></speech>

With Bank of Ireland, we have become something of a passive shareholder of 14%.  We do not control the bank.  Therefore, our decisions in that regard must relate to pricing and when it will be appropriate to sell the remaining shares.  The slide shows a gap that we have identified between the amount of money we invested in the banks and how much we have in them currently in the form of share value, which has already recovered.  The Government will need to exercise judgment about when to divest itself of an asset that could produce more income and help to close the value gap, but that is an investment decision.  We continue to monitor the situation.</p></speech>

It is travelling on a path a little bit behind Bank of Ireland, as everyone in the investor community would acknowledge.  It has taken time to get a management team in place to deal with the issues.  The bank will reach profitability a little later than Bank of Ireland, but it has already identified a clear path in that regard.  At that stage, Parliament should probably start considering whether it would be appropriate to sell and, if so, how much of the bank to sell.</p></speech>

It was very much embroiled in a bank assurance entity.  Of particular satisfaction to us, it has moved from developing an asset management centre in order to deal with legacy problems to participating in new lending in the markets.  Recently, it appointed a head of small to medium-sized enterprise, SME, lending so as to expand further.</p><p>  From the outset, we have viewed Permanent TSB as a bank that, depending on how the banking sector shapes up across the world, presents even more of an opportunity for a strategic player who wants to participate in Ireland, given its scale and various other factors.  The dynamics of how the State might divest from that bank are different, but the important fact is that it is getting back to doing real banking.

When we asked what they would be doing in six months&rsquo; time, a couple of brave souls started raising their hands.</p><p>  I am positive about where we are heading.

Had the Deputy asked me this question last October or November while we were going through the risk analysis ahead of our departure from the troika programme, the main systemic risk that we would have identified related to events in north Africa.  We did not envisage the threat to Europe coming from farther east.  The risks will change.  Therefore, we need to be robust and agile.</p><p>  One of the most important issues is our ability to create growth in the economy.  It goes to everything that drives results.  It goes to creating jobs and creating and maintaining a situation in which the debt is sustainable.  Unfortunately, in an open economy like ours, this will significantly be a function of what is happening in our main trading partners.  We can help by diversifying.  The third main activity in the medium-term economic strategy is growing in new markets, but that will not happen overnight.  Potential growth levels in Europe, the UK and the US will dictate much of where we go.</p></speech>

The State is borrowing at its lowest ever rates.  Banks are able to borrow.  We need to remember where we were and where we are.  At the time when I might have imagined what that statement would look like, the Irish banking system had taken approximately &euro;150 billion of support from the European system.</p> <p>It is now below &euro;30 billion.  The guarantee system that we had to put in place started at &euro;375 billion and is now below &euro;20 billion.  We are in a situation in which the banks are secure and deposits are back up.  There are still jobs at hand.  We have new management teams in the banks.  They are driving forward on mortgage arrears.

We probably need to see the broader statement.  From my perspective - that is the vantage point we are at - we do not see a systemic risk issue in terms of the stability of our banks.  I do not know if Mario is talking about something that is broader in Europe from his perspective.  I think there are threats to the system in Europe; they are well documented.  Clearly, if there are major shocks in Europe they will have an impact on us.</p></speech>

Mr. Draghi states that the ECB decided not to release this letter for the time being, as "the protection of the public interest as regards monetary policy in the European Union and financial stability in Ireland continued to justify the confidentiality of the letter".  He further states that even though several years have passed and the prospects of the Irish economy have improved considerably, risks, especially financial stability risks, are still present.  It seems to me that he is at odds with what Mr. Moran is saying.  He goes on to say that the situation continues to require close monitoring and notes that Ireland is under twice yearly post-programme monitoring by the troika.  I am not questioning what Mr. Moran has done so far - that is another day's work - but it seems to me that after two years Mr. Moran is making a judgment of his own work and achievements, which may or may not be right, which is not necessarily shared by Mr. Draghi or others overseas.  In other words, there is not necessarily financial stability and banking stability.  Does Mr. Moran accept that?</p></speech>

To me, financial stability is not just about the banks.  Financial stability is about many issues, and I have already referred to growth, the dependence of our State on growth externally and what that feedback loop would be in respect of the sovereign debt.  That is the reason we have recommended in the medium-term economic strategy continued fiscal diligence so as to reduce our vulnerabilities.  We are a State that is still spending more money than it is earning.  We have high debt levels and therefore we are vulnerable to external shocks.  Part of the process that has been set out is reducing those vulnerabilities.  I am sure the ECB has an interest in that as much as anyone else.  We have learnt the impact it can have in other countries in Europe across the whole system.  The Deputy would be correct to say that if we look across the European platform there are many countries in which one would say there are risks, and the development of those risks in an adverse way could give rise to financial stability issues.  That does not mean we have a banking system that is unstable.</p></speech>

It is in reply to a question from Martina Anderson, the Sinn F&eacute;in MEP.  It is a fairly strong statement to the effect that the dangers that existed in 2010, which were obviously referred to by Jean-Claude Trichet in a letter to Brian Lenihan, remain. Otherwise, he would release the letter.  If it were all over it would be historic.</p></speech>

When that letter was written we were talking about a banking system - I do not have the exact dates because I do not have the catalogue of years exactly right in respect of that - which had &euro;150 billion of funding from the ECB because it could not raise its own funding.  There was nobody willing to lend money to the Irish banks and depositors were not willing to put their money in the Irish banks.  Not even Irish people were confident about the Irish banks.  We are now looking through a lens in which the banks have grown their deposit base from that period by over &euro;15 billion.  That is almost 10% of the deposits.  We are looking at a system in which they are borrowing money on an unsecured basis using their mortgages as collateral for the first time since the crisis occurred.  I do not think of those two situations as the same, but I would not want to question Mario Draghi's views on it.</p></speech>

We look at many different risks.  These situations could develop.  We are comforted somewhat by the issues we saw when a banking crisis developed in Cyprus.

I have already stated that we have many risks.  One way to describe it is that we have dark shadows in every area.  We are not in a particularly vibrant world at the moment.  We have gone through a system over a number of years of low economic growth which has, by definition, depleted many of the balance sheets of various enterprises, including but not limited to the banks.  We can see a number of downside risks but we can see considerable upside risks on the environment as well.  The problem is to monitor them and share the information and the lessons we have as much as possible so we can get other people's views on them.</p></speech>

The job I came back to do in 2010 was to deal with banking systems.  I had already been dealing with the banking system for four years.  In terms of a list of things that have improved significantly since then - I will not bother to go through them, as they are in the report - a significant number of things have been achieved.  If I had tried to guess where we would have been on those I would not have expected us to be as far down the road as we are, even now.  That is because things have improved across the world in a positive way in the past year or two, and particularly in the euro area, in ways that I would not necessarily have expected.</p></speech>

Over time, we have moved to a scenario where there is considerable stability in the system.  I have a management team in which I have full faith.  Issues such as mortgage debt and household debt are still very important and we need to continue to work through them in our system.  We will not find a magic wand, wave it over these problems and make them disappear.  Household debt in this country has decreased by &euro;30 billion in the past four to five years.  If it decreases by another &euro;25 billion or &euro;30 billion, we will start to get into territory that one would regard as much safer by international norms and where one would not necessarily see the same drag on domestic recovery.  However, as with every household dealing with these issues, a path is found, but it takes some time to get to the destination.  We are seeing all the various important indices moving in the right direction.  As part of the job in hand, we have now got to a point at which we are actually looking at these issues, sharing the information with people, helping others to analyse the issues and continuing to work through them.</p><p> The mortgage arrears situation is another issue.  I have been well reported - correctly in this case - as actually having identified what was a real problem back in 2011 and 2012.  I referred in particular to the risks to the economy of excessive debt in households and SMEs, and the need for the banking system and others to move forward and drive towards a real resolution of the issues across the system.  However, there were not systems in the banks to deal with these problems.  There are now such systems in the banks.  Some of them are moving faster than others but at least they are all moving in the right direction.  It is now for the regulator, Mr. McCarthy and others to continue to monitor the trends and keep the pressure on.  One hopes the banks' management teams and boards have also realised the importance of their keeping the pressure on so as to ultimately resolve this issue and ease some of the pressures pertaining to the domestic economy.</p></speech>

That order of magnitude is a very significant risk to the State and an enormous drain on it.  We are looking at a stress test that looks like a normal stress test for banks that are operational.  The weakness of our banks in respect of the stress test is that they are not all generating capital in terms of profitability, which, in normal banks, we would like to see.  As banks grow, they need more capital to be able to fund a growing balance sheet.  The mere fact that in a stress test one says a bank needs more capital is not necessarily negative in itself.  However, what we think is that the magnitude of capital, were it to be required - I am not saying it will be - would not be such as to create one of these financial stability shocks to the system.  That is the information we are getting from the banks' management and the Central Bank.</p></speech>

However, I did not say we would get through them with absolutely no capital required.  Each of the banks will have to be examined.  On the question of whether we will get through the tests without creating a major shock to the system, I believe we will.  However, there are a number of issues that arise.  If one looks specifically at bank stress, one realises there are a number of elements that are common throughout Europe that have a particular impact on our banks.  I do not have the information to know whether this will actually lead to what is suspected.  For example, there is an assumption that any asset in the bank gets replaced with an asset generating the same return.  That means that every tracker mortgage book that is repaid or portion of a tracker mortgage book that is repaid in the Irish banks is assumed to have an equally low-margin asset replacing it.  Of course, that is not the reality.  We know the reality is that the banks are actually rewriting mortgages with much higher levels of income than in the back book they have as they work through that system.  These are complex issues.  Making statements on and estimating at this stage of the year what is going to happen when the banks do what will be a very significant exercise of calculation under the stress tests is not an easy task, and it is not necessarily a fair task to ask me to do.  As we look through our lens and pick up all the information we can pick up on the basis of the parameters, we do not regard the stress test at the end of the year as one whose magnitude will be such as to create a significant shock to the system.  It may create no shock at all.</p></speech>

The analysis will be effectively the same as that determining whether we should sell portions of AIB.  If we were allowing AIB to raise capital in the private markets, that would have the effect of diluting our share in the bank.  However, there would be more money in AIB because there would be more capital.  Therefore, the bank would essentially have grown larger.  We would just not own all of it.</p></speech>

I have indicated that we see these banks as effectively following each other through a path.  If I were being asked this question about Bank of Ireland, nobody would doubt its position on raising capital at the moment.  AIB is a little behind.  I think AIB could raise capital at the moment if it wanted to; it is a question of price.  Our management of the AIB shareholding for the State does not involve our asking whether we need to sell the shares but asking whether we have prepared the asset that we ultimately want to sell in the best way so as to maximise the shareholding value of the State.  If, after the stress test, the bank requires capital - I do not know whether that will be the case - and it is to be raised from the outside markets, we will have to ascertain whether the investors would put a value on the asset that we are essentially selling by allowing ourselves to be diluted because we are not chasing 99.99% of the offering.  We would have to ask whether we believed we had the asset at a point that resulted in the maximum value for the State or whether we believed it was better for us to be the investor in terms of the bank - in other words, to continue to hold the dominant share because the asset would look better in the future.</p></speech>

We are going back into the same environment as earlier.  At the point at which we examine these various options as the shareholder, we could decide to put in more money.  We could recycle money that we have taken out of other banks and say it is a good idea to put it in.  I do not know whether the Deputy considers that to be going back to the taxpayer, in respect of the assets, but there has to be analysis at the time of what we believe the asset value to be and the best way to handle it.</p></speech>

It was badly reported on the radio yesterday apparently.  The reality is that 14% of the bank shares are held by the State.  We were not the only shareholder to vote for that remuneration.  If one looks at the performance of that bank over the past number of years, and if we talk about maximising shareholder value, at a certain point, I believe it is appropriate to recognise the performance of a management team and to find some parameters in which one recognises that performance.  There are lots of different ways to do that but, certainly, one important issue would have to be the valuation of our interest in the bank and what had happened to that in terms of how the bank had performed and the value created for the taxpayer in respect of the shareholding over the period of time.  In that respect, Mr. Carville might have the exact numbers of how many voted in favour.</p></speech>

As to what way the Government wants to vote on this, we make recommendations as things come through, and we give suggestions in the context of what I said at the beginning and in the context of risks and various other things we might have in the system.  I can say this as somebody who is not going to be involved in these decisions next year.  However, I do think it is important for us to reflect a little, particularly in the political process, about these types of issues, which are very sensitive issues, and how we want to handle an environment in which we can find a way to reward people for the work they are doing.</p><p>  With regard to the issue of an executive or non-executive chairman, as both of us know, having both sat on boards, what may be described somewhat easily as "only working a certain number of hours a week" does not and should not reflect the reality of the responsibilities of officeholders.  I believe Deputy Ross and I would both agree and like to see that people who sit on boards take the responsibilities very seriously and engage with the institution in terms of the amount of time that is required to do what is required to be done.  While I do not want to personalise this with respect to any one individual, a search was conducted for that position and relative skill-sets were put in place, the board of the bank recommended this as the option to us and to the Minister, and we agreed to do it.  However, we did it on the basis that this is an individual who is not necessarily just counting the number of hours he is doing.  He is undertaking very serious responsibilities as a chairman would have in respect of the control of the board and, indeed, of the CEO and the management team.  It is important that, as we think about our system and about reasons why people leave or do not leave the system, we try to find a balance that actually gets us into the right space for the future in respect of growing the economy.</p></speech>

However, that is a reform which, I suspect, Mr. Moran is also going to leave to his successor.</p></speech>

However, we have moved into a scenario where we are not flooded with all of these people who Deputy Ross seems to believe are out there, who have these very competent CVs and who are willing to work in various institutions across Ireland.  There are some but I think the Deputy would perhaps like to create an impression that we are operating in a very small pool in some way on purpose.  That is not the case.  We have again gone through a very exhaustive search in respect of AIB, where we need to find a chairman for that institution, and that is coming to a conclusion.  The Deputy will probably like to describe the situation somewhat similarly again into the future.</p></speech>

If he can help us in finding those, we would be more than happy, even before I leave, to try to bring them into the system.</p> <p>It is easy to say that there are many people who want to do these jobs but these are positions that increasingly carry an awful lot of responsibility.

The Department reacts to the names submitted to it by the boards of the banks.  This is not a case of the Department shutting people off from engaging in the process.  My understanding of the last process that AIB ran is that it tried to use professional firms to source people for this role with a competency that is suitable for the amount of money the State has invested in that bank in terms of running and moving the bank to the next level.  I do not believe, and I hope Deputy Ross is not suggesting, that the agencies used by AIB or indeed the board of AIB have been shutting people off from participating in those competitions.  We are reacting to the people and the lists of names given to us as to whether we can trust the management we have chosen to run the bank and trust the various people they engage to try to source people across the rest of the world.  We have not confined this to Irish people but have encouraged them to look elsewhere so as to have a larger pool of potential candidates.  If one has people, there are channels by which these people can do it.  We certainly have not been exercising any veto at the Department over people who have been coming through to us that way.</p></speech>

However, we are in a different place with a set of new challenges.  The new challenges relating to mortgages and the SME sector have, by and large, not been dealt with.  There is a significant debt in the bank relative to mortgages and SMEs.  They have not been addressed with any great speed to release these families and individuals back into the real economy to allow them to perform fully again.  When I look at the amount of money being paid to the senior executives in the bank on both sides, it raises the question of why more is not being done for the SME sector and mortgages.</p><p>  Some of the young people with mortgages within those banks are being dealt with in a deplorable fashion.  All of us here, and I am sure I am no exception, have seen people come into our clinics whose health is now becoming an issue because of the actions of the banks, some of whom are outside the arrangement in terms of how many times they phone the person and so on.  It is appalling.  As it is, the lives of these people have been devastated, they see no way out and they are being offered no way out.  The mortgage-to-rent scheme has just not been successful.  They see no way out and the banks pursue them daily.  I want to hear Mr. Moran tell me what the Department can do to make the banks respond in a real way to settle these bad debts and to deal with people realistically.  The real message here is that they cannot pay.  They will never pay their debts back.  They are simply unable to do so and the banks do not seem to recognise that.</p><p>  Quite a number of SMEs cannot pay their debts back either.  We risk losing them as performers within the economy if we do not address in real terms the debts they have.  Has the Department quantified within the banks or have the banks told it exactly how much money within their system is at risk because people will not be able to pay?  Has the Department taken into account the fact that when people lose their homes, they qualify for rent allowance, local authority housing and all of that and that there is an associated cost to the State?  We have gone way past moral hazard and I do not see the banks doing anything real in terms of mortgages for individuals and families and the SME sector in comparison with some of the write-offs the corporate world has achieved.  Has the Department assessed-----</p></speech>

Taking it in inverse order and dealing with the SME sector, I referred earlier to the fact that in the earlier part of the crisis, much of our focus, appropriately so, was on trying to get lending to SMEs.  The target for that lending obviously included viable businesses that should have been able to draw down money to grow.  Otherwise the economy simply would not be able to conduct itself.</p> <p>The analysis or policy tools used to try to drive lending in the banks included the lending targets and the Credit Review Office to adjudicate as a third-party on what was deemed a fair or unfair decision by the banks in respect of lending.  Certainly, it has taken longer than we might have wished for the population of small and medium-sized enterprises to become more comfortable using the Credit Review Office as an arbitrator in that respect but there has been some success where that has happened.</p><p> Bearing in mind that much of this effort started in 2011, one thing we observed along the way was that several SMEs which up to that point had been grouped as one category were in reality in a very different category, in that they were SMEs with unsustainable debt or with significant debt that may have had nothing to do with the underlying business.  The two categories had to be disaggregated.  In many cases the balance sheets of either the SME or the owners of the SME had been destroyed by property businesses attached to them which had failed.</p><p> The speech to which I referred earlier made at the Irish Banking Federation in 2012 was an exhortation by us to the banks to get moving on the resolution of SME lending and to deal with the problems we have referred to, in particular the need for those SMEs with too much debt to have a resolution.  At the time, more of the focus was on the mortgage arrears issue, which in many ways reflects the same thing but the situation was capable of being addressed.</p><p> My understanding of the latest statistics is that Bank of Ireland claims to have resolved over 90% of what it considers to be the troubled loans in terms of offering SMEs real solutions.  I gather Allied Irish Banks is probably at 65% or 68% at the moment and working towards the completion of that by the end of this year.  For Permanent TSB this is not necessarily an issue.</p><p> Like with the mortgage arrears, the difficulty experienced in resolving the problem, particularly in 2011 and early 2012, was that the banks were simply unable to deal with these issues.  They were not ready, they did not have operational systems and they did not necessarily have the right mindset to work through the resolution of the mortgages.  However, since then and under pressure from the regulator, they have in fact been moving considerably on the SME side.</p><p> There is another point on the SME side.  To the extent that we went through this process, there was initially a focus on the banking sector and what we would do to get more lending out of the banks.  Then we evolved with the policy decisions to an understanding that there was a need for other sources of financing for businesses in Ireland, in particular for rebuilding balance sheets, because many companies had gone through years when they had depleted the reserves that one might typically see associated with a firm seeking a bank loan.  We needed to be able to find mechanisms to put equity into those balance sheets before they could get borrowing from other banks.  That has been the focus and there is almost &euro;1 billion of State money put aside in the National Pensions Reserve Fund for a turnaround, growth and credit fund for businesses.  We are trying to deal with the bank situation and the Credit Review Office for the smaller companies but we have the Microfinance Ireland fund and credit guarantee fund and so on as well.</p></speech>

Their savings are gone.  Some of them are staying open out of pride.  They would have a good business if only the overall debt was dealt with.  It might have been debt created by the purchase of property, as Mr. Moran said.  The banks are not responding to them in any real or meaningful terms.  I am shocked by the numbers in my constituency and I imagine it is reflected throughout the country.  These people are being left to hang out to dry.  They are now being pushed to the point where they will not recover.  The banks will break them.  We did not allow the banks to go; we saved them.  I consider the retail sector and the high streets of this country to be an important part of our economy, but we are allowing them to go broke.  Let us consider the number of properties that are boarded up in every village, town and city throughout the country.  One cannot but be shocked.  The names over the doors indicate that families have been in business for generations but they simply cannot continue.  It will take a vast amount of money to rebuild that part of Ireland but the banks are not playing a role.  I think they are disgraceful in the way they are behaving.</p><p>  Deputy O'Donnell pointed out that on the mortgage side they have said that they have taken action but 50% of the action they have taken has involved sending letters.  I have seen letters to individuals in which they have been declared unco-operative.  One individual came to me and explained that he was setting aside a &euro;50 repayment each week into an account but his lender was not taking the money.  Then he got a letter suggesting that he was not co-operating.</p><p>  A considerable number of people will find themselves without a home and on the streets after this because they simply cannot get the bank to understand that they do not have the money to pay.  The local authorities do not have the houses to give them.  The rent allowance system and the rental accommodation scheme are at breaking point in terms of the money the Government is putting in but that is their only escape.  I am afraid the banks have failed to respond at that level.  I agree with Mr. Moran that there is change at the higher level.  I suppose I am referring to the smaller end of the SME sector, including the retail sector.  All these businesses represent indigenous jobs created in towns and villages but the banks are letting them die.  I appreciate the job Mr. Moran did and I understand that he is finishing up, but I believe his team should be focused on those community businesses that would be feasible if they got half a chance.</p></speech>

Let us consider the mortgage situation and the SME sector.  There has been considerable discussion about how the banks have not been playing ball and that we should have someone come in to help to find a resolution - the Insolvency Service of Ireland has been put into place and so on - ultimately to bring people together to reach agreement.  That requires a recognition of the reality of the situation on the bank side and on the borrower side.</p><p>  Since there are fewer SMEs than there are mortgages and the population is smaller, it should be easier to deal with them.  Through the regulatory system we have tried to put pressure on the banks to resolve the loans rather than simply ignore the problem.  Sadly, that was what was happening during the earlier phases of this crisis.  There is a third party which I believe can play a valuable role in resolving the type of situations to which the Chairman referred.  It could bring assistance to the family that has run a business for many generations but who may not be used to dealing with the banks in this kind of a discussion.  I am referring to the Credit Review Office.  The office has a team of people and they have been successful.  Some people have raised problems individually with us but it is not appropriate for us to engage with the banks in respect of an individual borrower.  However, we have asked the Credit Review Office to engage and to try to mediate a resolution of the situation.  In some cases the office has successfully done so and in some cases we have seen the introduction of third parties to do so.  If there is a problem with the operation of the Credit Review Office in this respect, we would like to understand what that is.</p></speech>

This is my final question for Mr. Moran.  Will he please acknowledge that and have it as part of the conversation with the banks on a regular basis?  Have the banks given him a figure relating to those mortgages and SMEs that are in difficulty with their loans?</p> <p>Have the banks provided a breakdown of the figure for the number of mortgages and loans to small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, those being, employers of one to ten employees, that are in difficulty?  Have they indicated to the Department whether more money may be necessary to deal with this situation, given the fact that a substantial amount of money might not be repaid?</p></speech>

There must be a figure for such cases.  What provision has been made in respect of the SME sector?  How much money will the banks need to deal with all of that?  This is the type of information that is required.</p><p>  The Secretary General can respond shortly as I wish to ask a further question on a matter that has been mentioned.  This crisis has lasted since late 2007, yet we are still dealing with SME and mortgage issues.  In 2012, there was a discussion on banking versus sovereign debt and so on.  The EU took a particular stance on what we should and should not do with bondholders in banks.  In the past two days, a senior adviser or official stated that it should be recognised that we were badly treated at the time.  The country and the individuals who comprise the debt, be they SMEs, mortgage holders, household debtors or so on, will not be able to repay it in their lifetimes.  Is there any indication that Europe will change its stance on our role in saving the euro system?  It has been recognised, although I cannot cite the name of the European official who made the comment.</p></speech>

President Barroso&rsquo;s former adviser made the statement and it has been recognised, but there is no tangible result that would allow us to deal more sympathetically with the businesses and individuals who, having had their lives ruined, now want to move on and do something different.  Has Mr. Moran any opinion in this regard?</p></speech>

It has been recognised by Europe that the way in which the balance of responsibility lay early on &ndash; let us pick the beginning of the bailout &ndash; in terms of the sovereign and Europe&rsquo;s participation in providing assistance was not the right one.  It has been moved significantly in a number of ways since.  There has been considerable assistance at the level of the sovereign.  Ultimately, the capital invested in the banks was funded by sovereign debt on our side.  This has been recognised through the reduction in interest rates and the extension of the maturity dates under the programme.  Knock-on impacts are more difficult to quantify, but this has been incredibly important in reducing our cost of borrowing.  As late as a year ago, we assumed that the State&rsquo;s cost of borrowing would be 4.5%, but we are nearing 2.5%.  One reason for this among others is the fact that almost 50% of the State's debt falls due beyond 2020.  There is little pressure on the State to refinance that debt in the early years.  A significant role was played by the extension in the maturity dates agreed by Europe in respect of the original bailout.  Since the date of the bailout in 2010, there has been considerable movement.</p><p>  The committee will remember our chart describing the amount of money that had been invested in the banks.  We calculated the capital that had been invested in Anglo Irish Bank versus the other banks.  The burden of what was invested in the former, which was essentially a decision to shore up that bank and may have formed a part of the discussion referred to by the official in question, fell entirely on the State with a significant repayment obligation.  This was reflected in the promissory note transactions, under which it was a requirement to buy &euro;3 billion of funds per year over a ten-year period.  This burden was not removed, but it was pushed 25 and 35 years further down the road to relieve pressure on the State in the short term.  As the committee knows, this was done with Europe&rsquo;s co-operation.</p><p>  The third element has been discussed, that being, the direct recapitalisation.  I cannot tell the committee what will happen in that regard.  An acknowledgement by the partners in Europe was reflected in the June statement and has been reflected in the documentation that has passed through various legislative processes concerning direct recapitalisation.  There will be an opportunity for a discussion to examine situations on a case-by-case basis.  Everyone around the table at least knows that the Irish expect to be discussed in this regard and to have Ireland's contribution to the euro&rsquo;s stability recognised.  However, we also need to remember-----</p></speech>

How much of that will remain is unclear.  Were an increase in AIB and Bank of Ireland shares to bridge the gap of &euro;6 billion, we could find that the bailout of the three pillar banks &ndash; Permanent TSB, AIB and Bank of Ireland &ndash; had not cost the State anything.  As such, the only issue to be discussed would be Anglo Irish Bank.</p><p>  Given policy decisions around Europe, it is clear that Europe has moved into a space that is consistent with the way we started the debate in 2011, in that senior creditors of banks should in certain situations play a part in the rescue of the banks, which was not an available policy option even at the beginning of 2011.  There has been an understanding and recognition across Europe that the resolution of banks requires an element of contribution from creditors and that this option was not available at the time.</p></speech>

The Greek cost of borrowing today is not the same as the Irish cost because we had a different resolution at an earlier stage.  We also received a benefit, not just in the cost of the Irish sovereign&rsquo;s borrowing, but in the cost of borrowing for semi-States and banks, which is passed on to SMEs.</p><p>  I might ask Mr. Hogan to mention some of the-----</p></speech>

What is important with respect to the Irish banks, and this is what I referred to earlier, is how we can break through the numbers to understand where the reality sits.  The asset quality review that was conducted by the Central Bank before Christmas, which is being repeated by it, involved bringing in external parties to assess the loans and the loan books and look at samples of those to decide whether the level of provisions the banks were holding against those was adequate for the risks.  I cannot say exactly where it is because there is an element of judgment involved but what we see from the numbers is that with this third party validation, both of the auditors and the Central Bank, we do not have a one-for-one parallel between impairment and the provisions, which suggests that the banks are correct in the view that not all impaired loans will lead to 100% losses, but there is a percentage in that regard.</p></speech>

There are significantly more of those people, and SMEs, than is being discussed in their conversation with Mr. Moran and the Department.  I say that because I have seen the letters that have been issued to individuals who have no hope of paying back the mortgage.  They are unemployed.  They have gone from a marriage to a separation where two of them were working.  They are now separated, the house is in negative equity, the amounts due on it have not a hope of being repaid yet the banks continue to write to these people as if there was some hope in that regard. </p><p>  There is a significant number of such people turning up at local authorities who also have a debt in this regard.  They have another system of loans that is in arrears.  In the context of the stress test for the banks, I ask them to please give us the figure for the exact amount of money owed to them that obviously will not be repaid.  Even if the house was sold it is a cost to the Exchequer because the people must get housing from the local authority, rent allowance or go on the rental accommodation scheme.  I would like to see that analysis.</p><p>  Separate to that I would like to see the figure for SMEs that have a viable business but a bad property debt somewhere.  I believe it is greater than the figures I have seen.  Economists who have looked at this and other people who have carried out an analysis of it will tell Mr. Moran that the debt is greater than the banks are telling us.  That is one issue.  The other side of both of those issues is that they are not giving individuals a chance when the banks got a chance, supported by the Irish taxpayers.  That is the point I am making.  I would like to see that conversation take place.</p><p>  Mr. Moran has been here since 12 o'clock answering questions and before I call Deputy Collins and Deputy Murphy, would he like to take a break for ten minutes?</p></speech>

I will comment briefly on some of the discussions the Chairman had on mortgage and legacy issues with the SME sector, divided into core and non-core business.  In terms of some of the problems, particularly with private mortgages, it is a clear there is a communication problem between the bank and the mortgage holder.  Usually, there are health, stress or other issues involved.  People can go to an insolvency agent but there is a cost to that.  On the social protection side we need to consider providing somebody with assistance.  People are going to the Money Advice and Budgeting Service but it is swamped with these cases.  There is a need for somebody to be brought in to help both individuals.  With all due respect to the banks, we cannot expect them to make a decision without information.  They are dealing with people who are extremely stressed for one reason or another and they do not understand the need to get that information to the bank.  There is a void in that regard.  A fund was set up in the Department of Social Protection to help such people but it does not appear to have been activated.  Mr. Moran might examine that to see if we can help people who are in that bind.</p><p>  Listening to what is happening on the ground, and I am quite close to the business sector, it is clear the banks are helping where viable plans have been put before them.  The situation has improved in that regard.  I am not saying it is perfect but it seems to be moving in the right direction.  In terms of issues that arise with small businesses and so on, the local enterprise offices have been set up and it is hoped mentors can be put in place.  </p><p>  It is very easy to talk about retailers on the high street but retailers in rural Ireland are facing major issues with online businesses.  We must understand that it is not just a banking problem.  We may need to examine a different way of keeping rural Ireland open such as a co-operative model or social enterprise, which is the buzz word now in Europe.  If we are to have the services they will have to be provided in a different format in terms of a business that is all about profit.  We need to examine a number of issues as opposed to simply saying that everything is to do with the banking scenario.</p><p>  My only question for Mr. Moran is on SME lending, the growth of the SME sector and, in particular, start-up businesses and the appetite for risks.  It is not fair for us to ask the banks to regard this as being their problem.  We are putting in place all the regulation on banks which means they cannot lend money unless they have a certain percentage set aside to reduce risk.  We want to be serious about driving the economy and creating more jobs.  We talk about supporting start-ups and entrepreneurs but they do not have access to real capital unless they apply for high potential start-up, HPSU, funding from Enterprise Ireland but they must have a potential start-up.  Only a small number of people get through that process.  Various operations are going on throughout the country but there is very little finance for them unless they get angel investors or find a different source of finance.  That is a real problem in the economy.</p> <p>I would welcome Mr. Moran's opinion on that and on what we can do going forward.  I am aware of the microfinance fund but the targets in that regard are not being reached.  Again, there is an issue with it in terms of appetite for risk.</p><p> I have many concerns in regard to the bureaucracy around the fund.  As I said, in terms of targets, it is way behind.  On the credit guarantee fund, I regularly come across businesses that want to expand but cannot access the funds to do so.  I am not suggesting that the banks are the appropriate lenders in this regard.  Many of the new investment funds mentioned are not in this space either.  I am speaking in this regard not of SMEs but micro-businesses which employ 70% of all people employed in this country and are located in every small and large urban town in Ireland.  This is a real problem.  I would welcome Mr. Moran's views on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-08a.420" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Moran" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014050800026#Z00200"><p>During my presentation last week on future banking, I tried to explain our thought process around funding enterprise.  It is not of any comfort to us but worth noting that this is not only an Irish problem.  The point being made over and again by us in respect of the process is that Ireland's economic difficulties and the creation of jobs will only be solved through a vibrant SME sector.  This will not happen without funding being available to companies.  The slide which Deputies can now see is taken from the presentation I gave in Europe.  It shows the significant differences in funding rates available in Germany and France versus Italy and Spain.  Europe is struggling with the same issues across the whole system.</p><p>  The way in which we have been trying to handle this is well set out in broader terms in the medium term strategy, MTS, and in a more specific way in the Action Plan for Jobs in the context of the sector on funding for growth.  One of the particular difficulties being experienced in Ireland, which may explain some of the issues raised by Deputy Collins, is that in the past in Ireland when a person was setting up a business it was often capitalised by positive equity from the business owner's home.  This served as a personal guarantee in respect of the business.  In other words, the positive equity from the business owner's house, or, perhaps, that of his or her parents, served as a security for the banks in lending money to the start-up business.  We believe this led to the belief at that time that the banks were funding businesses when in fact they were funding the credit side of the balance sheet and the equity and mezzanine risk of the balance sheet.  </p><p>  As a result of the crisis, a huge amount of available capital in Ireland that might be used, in particular in the smaller business sector and also the larger business sector in terms of growth, no longer exists because many of the houses that might be used for this capital are in negative equity.  This is the reason for the market failure of start-ups.  It is also the reason getting the microfinance and credit guarantee funds, and angel investors and others, to work more effectively in Ireland is a key part of the solution.  This is a more critical issue than it would have been in a different environment where there was a lot of positive equity in the system because positive equity would allow the banks to extend loans which are in many ways from a risk perspective at the enterprise level equivalent to an equity risk.  As a result of this, we will have to move to an enterprise environment that is more open to sharing ownership of companies, perhaps at an earlier phase than has been historically the case.</p><p>  In Germany, one sees the opposite to this.  For example, many of these businesses there are family business because an equity pool has been built up that allows families to create a balance sheet that can take credit from the banks.  We do not have the capacity to do that.  We are also in a much more dynamic situation in terms of start-ups and, therefore, the model will probably be somewhat similar to the model seen in more dynamic start-up environments such as the United States.  As such there will be a greater requirement for angel capital and growth.  The part of the trough in which perhaps there is a shortage in this regard is the growth capital area.  </p><p>  Colleagues on the group chaired by Mr. Hogan are reviewing the efficiency or otherwise of the microfinance and credit guarantee funds.  These are important parts of the system.  As stated, small SMEs essentially need to be backed by way of resolution of the negative equity problem and the putting in place of alternative mechanisms through which start-up capital can be provided to companies, with the banks playing a particular role after that.  When business grows through the system the banks can then have a role to play.  However, venture capital is needed first.  There are other charts I could show to the committee which show that there are considerable differences between the amount of venture capital available in Europe as compared with the amount of venture capital available in the United States.  If we want to move towards an environment of entrepreneurship and start-up, particularly in the technology space, it being a key part of our economy, these are the issues we need to resolve.  It is at the equity start-up phase that Enterprise Ireland will have to be key and have a broader range.  </p><p>  Deputy Collins referred earlier to the local enterprise offices, LEOs.  The LEOs on the ground will need to play a key role in joining the dots for enterprise in terms of working out where they are going.  We have discovered along the way that many companies did not have all the right training.  The issue of finding more mentoring for companies and better education has been mentioned before.  The Department of Education and Skills is now participating in the SME credit committee in the context of the provision of education.  Another key part of technology currently in development and close to launch, which we have put together with other colleagues across the system, is a website which allows a small business trying to find a solution to a particular problem, be it in regard to funding and so on, to log on, indicate its location, size and problem and be directed to the various supports that are available.  We have learned through the process that there are many supports available but is hard to know which ones work or are relevant.  By way of testing, the new website has been trialed with approximately 700 SMEs with a view to seeing if it can be improved in terms of the solutions loaded onto it.  I will now ask Mr. Hogan to respond to the issues on the equity side. </p></speech>

It is an issue of which we are very mindful.  Next week, we will be putting together a group involving representatives from the Departments of Finance, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, ISME, SFA and other relevant actors in the State agencies to consider the constraints and solutions around equity.  We have also opened up a consultation process on our own website, through which submissions can be made to the Department for consideration by the group.  The closing date of that process is some time during the course of this month.  This is an important part of the work which we will be doing over the coming months to try to address that particular gap.  Mr. Moran mentioned the online tool which is close to being launched and will be very important.  The feedback from businesses that have seen it already has been very positive in terms of it actually giving them a real sense of how to access the vast array of State supports available.</p><p>  Deputy Collins also raised the issue of mortgages, mortgage arrears, the advice function and the Department of Social Protection fund.  This involved payment by the banks of a fee in respect of advice to be given to individuals coming to them seeking an assessment of their situations, having been presented with a long-term solution by their financial institution.  One of the things we are looking at in terms of that review is does that advice come at the proper time or is it too early or too late.  One of the recommendations which we are currently putting in place is that there would be a two-stage payment, with the first payment being made available at an early stage when the individual is completing the SFS form and engaging in the first instance with the financial institution.  I believe that is very important in terms of addressing the gap mentioned by the Deputy.</p> <p>It is important at a later stage for that assessment to be made by the adviser in terms of the actual sustainable solutions being placed in front of him.</p></speech>

Perhaps the BES could be re-examined and made more simple.  There is an old relief, the seed capital relief, which has been in place for 20 years but which has never really featured to the extent it should have.  It involves investing money and getting tax back on it.  Equity is very hard to have at an early stage of investment because one has to prove oneself.  There are different rounds and phases.  There is the real start-up stage where one needs to have some money.  Usually, when one gets State funding, one needs to have matching funding.  There is a lot of bureaucracy in that regard.  While it is great to have websites, trying to get ten applications in is a job in itself on top of trying to start and develop the business.  There needs to be more awareness of what one person is capable of doing.  We need to make the system easier.</p><p>  I thank Mr. Moran for his contribution as Secretary General in the Department of Finance and for the work he has done in helping us through the banking crisis.  I wish him well in his new career, wherever that will be.</p></speech>

I wanted to wait until the end of the meeting because I wanted to examine the strategy for growth, or the medium-term economic review, which was released when we exited the bailout programme last December.  My first question concerns the status of the document.  Is it a recommendation to the Government?  Does it outline our obligations regarding our commitments to our European partners?  Was it approved or seen by the troika before it was published?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-08a.425" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Moran" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014050800027#AA00400"><p>First, this is a Government-approved document.  Its genesis was in an earlier period when we indicated it was important, as we got closer to the end of the troika programme, to have a plan or strategy for the direction of travel thereafter.  Last year in particular, it would have been part of our own allocation or Estimates.  With a group of people, some of whom were in my colleague's area, we embarked on consultation both across the system and with various other stakeholders on what we believed was important for the Irish economy as it entered the next phase of growth.  All the economists in the public sector met in one forum in Dublin Castle.  We identified quite early on a number of horizontal themes we believed were important as we went through the process of considering the levers we could pull.  Not surprisingly, those were the issues of innovation and how we could upskill the economy.  Also to be borne in mind were entrepreneurship and how we could take advantage of our significant FDI-type environment and the domestic entrepreneurial environment in terms of start-ups, the butcher and farmer, all of whom are entrepreneurs in their own way.  We sometimes forget about them and think only about the technology sector.  It was also a question of trying to broaden the thinking so people would actually want to set up their own business as opposed to working for somebody else.</p><p>  The third element we thought merited particular attention was that we felt we were at the beginning of a new era of interaction between Ireland, the rest of Europe and the outside world as Europe was developing and as the Irish domestic population was developing in terms of an open labour force and various other phenomena.  We referred to the upside risks in this regard.  There are constraints we do not have in Ireland in terms of the growth potential of the economy because, in fact, labour mobility in a single market, such as the one we have, is much different than it might otherwise be.  We wanted to analyse the opportunities for Ireland to start thinking about itself less as a national economy but more as a regional economy in a European environment developing a banking union.</p><p>  Having done that work, we decided it was best presented with three pillars, the first being the requirement to actually maintain a responsible public finance position.  We can go through the details of that.  It was basically a matter of returning to circumstance involving the State paying its own way and in which we would start to reduce the debt.</p><p>  The second area involved looking at the fact that we do not believe an economy can function and grow without credit.  Finding a way in which to fund the economy was required.  In any case, these are issues that we had been addressing, but our work created a framework for them.  The third area was to analyse, with considerable assistance from colleagues across the entire system, the Irish economy sector by sector, to some extent as we had been doing anyway.  We drew up a series of sectors, not necessarily aligned to Departments.  They were sectors that we identified with the CSO and we asked how we could move those different sectors forward.  Then we had a stakeholder programme in which we considered the horizontal issues employing tables and groups of people that represented each of the sectors, and we tried to collect through this exercise the themes and various issues that were reflected.</p><p>  The third section of the document identifies some of the issues that had cropped up, giving a sense of where we believed we should go.  This was agreed because there was a steering group involving the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and others.</p><p>  When the document went through to the Government, it referred to the fact that all the Departments that are now considering their own strategies must do so by reference to this.  The important point is that we move along an holistic path forward, as happened under the troika programme to a certain extent.</p></speech>

The only legal obligations within the MTES are set out in the fiscal chapter, where we identify the various numerical fiscal rules we will be subjected to, both externally via the Stability and Growth Pact and domestically via the fiscal compact, the subset of the fiscal stability treaty that relates to numerical fiscal rules.  Essentially, we set out how we will comply with those, namely, to correct the excessive deficit as part of the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact in a timely manner, that is, by next year.  In determining what is required after that, we move into the preventive arm of the pact, which requires our need to make rapid progress towards a balanced budget in structural terms, in other words, when one accounts for the impact of the economic cycle.  Those are the rules on the deficit side.  There is also a rule on the debt side.</p></speech>

The troika did not have a problem with it being in the document.</p><p>  Let me turn to page 12 and to the issues Mr. McCarthy was addressing.  There is a note under the table on page 12 that refers to the general Government balance after 2016 as being a technical assumption that indicates what is required to support the achievement of the medium-term objective of a structural balance by 2019 and its maintenance thereafter.  When we examine that table and the figures for after 2016, we note a technical assumption will be based on a future policy decision.  Is it a necessary policy decision to keep us in line with our commitments?</p></speech>

The reforms of the Stability and Growth Pact were necessitated by the crisis.  The reforms in 2011, particularly in the preventive arm of the pact, introduced what is known as an expenditure rule.</p> <p>This is sometimes called the expenditure benchmark.  To assess compliance with progress towards one's medium-term objective, one looks at the improvement in the structural budget balance but one also complements that analysis with how one is performing <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the expenditure rule.  What the expenditure rule essentially says is that one will have nominal growth in revenue in line with the potential growth rate in the economy.  If, for example, GDP is growing by 3% in nominal terms, revenue will grow in line with that figure in the long run.  The figure varies from year to year because the elasticity can vary depending on, for instance, the composition of aggregate demand.  However, on balance and over time, revenue growth tends to move in tandem with GDP growth.<br />If one maintains expenditure, net of discretionary measures on the revenue side, below the potential growth rate of revenue, one automatically gets an improvement in one's structural position.  The technical assumption is that expenditure, net of discretionary measures on the revenue side, is kept sufficient to achieve the required improvement towards the medium-term objective.  It is quite technical.</p></speech>

Is that correct?</p></speech>

For Ireland, as for most other countries, achieving the medium-term objective should be sufficient to more than comply with the debt correction rule.  I believe the Deputy is asking about that rule, the one twentieth rule which features on the last line.</p></speech>

To comply with that rule and achieve a balanced budget in 2018, we must continue to reduce the deficit beyond the 3% that is obligatory.  The Government has made a policy commitment to achieve a balanced budget.  Is that an obligation?</p></speech>

However, there are two items of legislation, the preventive arm and corrective arm.  Once one moves out of the excessive deficit procedure, one is legally bound to move towards a balanced budget in structural terms.  One moves from a headline deficit to the underlying or structural deficit.  There is a legal requirement that member states make sufficiently rapid progress towards their medium-term budgetary objective.  It is country specific.  For us, the objective is a balanced budget in structural terms, while for some countries with higher levels of debt or problems with demographics - the ageing of the population - it is more onerous and for others, it is less onerous.  However, achieving this path, given that our potential growth rate is still reasonable, should be more than sufficient to comply with the one twentieth rule or debt correction rule.</p></speech>

The former is very positive.  Did we challenge this projection?  It is all moving in one direction, which is also very positive.  If one considers previous forecasts, however, including those produced by the International Monetary Fund and others, the projections for 2013 were very positive but as we moved towards the end of 2013, that was no longer the case.</p></speech>

The figures provided are our forecasts.  However, the GDP forecasts contained in the document are very similar to those contained in the stability programme published at the end of April.  Our projection for GDP growth in 2014 is 2.1%.  The change is very modest.  However, the stability programme update numbers go all the way out to 2018 and have been endorsed by the Fiscal Advisory Council.  The numbers in the document are, therefore, very similar, with differences of 0.1% here and there, and they have been endorsed independently.  They are also quite similar over the medium term to the European Commission numbers because it is done on a supply side basis.  There is not, therefore, a dramatic difference in terms of the GDP numbers.  The ESRI would have a stronger set of medium-term forecasts.</p><p>  The one area where there is probably an upside is unemployment, figures for which are provided on the second line.  The figures we have had subsequent to the medium-term economic strategy have been much more positive than had been assumed.  In other words, instead of an unemployment rate of 12.5% for this year, as embedded on the second line, the rate already stands at 11.7%.  There is, therefore, probably some upside on that figure and we are probably in line to achieve the employment targets embedded in this as well. </p></speech>

As members will be aware the national action plan on the Council resolution on women, peace and security was launched in November 2011 by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the former President, Mary Robinson.  The plan sets out how Ireland will, across Departments and agencies, promote and implement the objectives of the resolution in the prevention of conflict, including gender-based violence, the participation of women in decision making, protections from gender-based violence, the relief, recovery and rehabilitation of women affected by conflict, as well as the promotion by the Irish Government of the resolution at national and international fora.</p> <p>The national action plan also established a monitoring and evaluation group to track its implementation, comprising representatives from the relevant Departments, agencies and civil society organisations.  I hope my preamble is not stealing anything from the scripts of the representatives.  On behalf of the committee I welcome representatives of the monitoring and evaluation group, which includes Ms Liz McManus, its independent chair; Ms Helena Keleher, deputy director of the conflict resolution unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Ms Orlaith Fitzmaurice, director of the reconciliation fund in the Anglo-Irish division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; and Dr. Melanie Hoewer, school of politics and international relations, University College Dublin.  We look forward to exploring how we as a committee can assist in the implementation of the resolution.<br />Before commencing I advise that the witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only comments and evidence connected with the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses, or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  While Ms Liz McManus knows the drill it is no harm to refresh her on these matters.<br />Before calling on Ms Liz McManus to make her opening statement, my colleagues will join me in thinking<b></b>of all the good work being done at community level, within our respective constituencies by many women in dealing with post-conflict issues, not necessarily only in Northern Ireland but in the Border areas.  They have been at the vanguard at a community level.  Today I would like to see how we can work as a committee to achieve the objectives and aims of the monitoring group, towards which it is working, but also to develop the capacity of the human infrastructure.  Many women's groups involved in cross-Border activity have lost out in terms of funding, perhaps because of a two year or three year funding stream.  They have built up the capacity and the relationships and are ready to move on to the next stage in dealing with many legacy issues and post-conflict challenges.  Today's meeting is an opportunity to explore a few of those issues.  It is great to have representation from the reconciliation unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It is good to see Ms Liz McManus again.  I invite her to make her presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-08a.492" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Liz McManus" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014050800004#D00200"><p>I thank Chair.  That the Chair and the committee have agreed to receive us to make a presentation is much appreciated.  I wish to set out the international context to the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, the Good Friday Agreement and its relevance in respect of what has happened to women and what is not happening to women in Northern Ireland and in Border areas.</p><p>  UNSCR 1325 is all about the unique and disproportionate impact of conflict on women.  We have a stark reminder of that impact given that hundreds of Nigerian schoolgirls have been abducted by armed terrorists.  This is not unique to Nigeria.  It has also happened in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  It was noteworthy that Malala Yousafzai, who was shot in the face by the Taliban for going to school, referred to these young girls as her sisters.  It is a global issue of which we are all cognisant.  That is the reason the UN agreed on a resolution and the reason Ireland, in response, has a national action plan to implement the principles of that resolution. </p><p>  As a monitoring group we must ensure the NAP is functioning.  We have a clear balance between civil society organisations, the Departments, agencies and academia represented on the monitoring group.  Within the group we have concerns about Northern Ireland because it is in rather an anomalous situation in that the Republic of Ireland has a national action plan which is published and up and running and has been reviewed while the UK has a national action plan which is outward looking but does not refer to Northern Ireland because the British Government considers that the Troubles in Northern Ireland were not of an armed conflict nature.  There is a lacuna there, and it is matter of great concern to women in Northern Ireland who are dealing with the issues of post-conflict situations, whether domestic violence or lack of women's participation.  These are important central issues and yet they are not being addressed within the context of the 1325 principles.  That is central to the reason we are appearing before the committee.</p><p>  Within the NAP, commitments have been made by the Irish State in two areas which are particularly important.  One is in respect of funding and support for women's organisations to encourage participation, representation and decision-making.  During the question and answer session I will invite Ms Orlaith Fitzmaurice to outline that commitment because a considerable amount of financial and technical support has been provided in accordance with that specified in the NAP.  The second commitment in Ireland's national action plan is to promote the principles of UNSCR 1325.  There are issues in that principle on which we seek support and action by the committee.</p><p>  The national action plan was launched in 2011.  While I had nothing to do with the plan, it is a very good one with very specific and very clear targets, some of which are achievable and some not.  We have been able to review the plan to see how we have succeeded in meeting those targets.  The review was carried out by Karen McMinn and Bronagh Hinds who produced the mid-term progress report.  Therefore, we have much information about the need for data collection and about where the achievements and failures have been.  There are two achievements I wish to highlight - Irish Aid overseas and Anglo-Irish funding which has been provided.  There is also a very interesting development of which many people are not aware in relation to the Defence Forces.  We have very active participation in UN missions.  Within the Irish Defence Forces, a progressive approach has been taken on the promotion of women and the encouragement and participation of women in peace building.  That is something of which we can be proud.</p><p>  One of the difficulties highlighted in the review is the challenges in respect of Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland is not covered in either NAP.  We have a difficulty in relation to the British Government which considers that this was not an armed conflict and, therefore, the aftermath of armed conflict is not included in any specific way in the British NAP.  Obviously, we have our limitations.</p> <p>The Good Friday Agreement addresses this issue in certain ways.  It commits the UK and Irish Governments to provide for "the right of women to full and equal political participation" and achieve "the advancement of women in public life".  While these might be considered to be very general points, they specifically place an onus on those who signed up to the Agreement to promote the role of women in peacebuilding and ensure their role in public life is advanced .  The report the United Kingdom submitted to the United Nations in 2009, on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the Beijing Platform for Action, acknowledged that "within Northern Ireland, UNSCR 1325 is widely acknowledged as an important international commitment to women&rsquo;s equality and empowerment, particularly as regards women's access to politics, public life and decision-making".  They are saying it is important, but they are not following through on it in the way that is needed.  </p><p> One of the advances was the establishment within the Northern Ireland Assembly of an all-party committee to advance the principles of UN Resolution 1325.  The committee which is chaired by Paula Bradley, MLA, who represents the DUP held hearings at Stormont before Christmas through the Associate Parliamentary Group on Women, Peace and Security at Westminster.  I was asked to sit in on these meetings as an observer.  I am very pleased that the Northern Ireland Women's European Platform which was involved in this received financial support from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The all-party committee heard wide-ranging evidence from groups such as the Northern Ireland Equality Commission, the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, women's groups and political parties.  The whole gamut was represented at the hearings.  I would like to refer to some of the key issues raised.  The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission stated in its submission that it believed UN Resolution 1325 was central to women's representation and participation and could play a key role in addressing the legacy of the past and promoting good community relations.  The legacy of the years of violence, in its various manifestations, was largely dealt with in private session, which in itself is an indication of its sensitivity.  This legacy can manifest in domestic violence or the control of local communities by paramilitaries.  Many woman said they did not feel able to speak out because of the historical control that still pertained.</p><p> It might not be a surprise that women have a low participation rate in Northern Ireland politics, given that the rate is low here, too.  However, the quota changes being introduced here indicate that we are making progress.  Serious issues must be confronted in a society that is, in a sense, reconstructing itself if women are to have their place in the sun.  Just 23% of local councillors and 19% of MLAs in Northern Ireland are women.  In fact, just one quarter of the candidates standing in the local elections are women.  That is a source of dissatisfaction and concern for women who are organising at community level and in non-governmental organisations, etc.  I think there was just one woman at the Haass talks, for example.  When we are planning for the future, we should consider the women who were promised opportunities through the Good Friday Agreement but have not actually been able to achieve them.  That is an important central plank of what we are saying.</p><p> In 2013 the committee on the Convention for the Elimination of Discrimination of Women concluded that the UK Government should "ensure the participation of women in the post-conflict process in Northern Ireland in line with Security Council Resolution 1325".  On a recent visit to Northern Ireland the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, Rashida Manjoo, called for the development of initiatives in Northern Ireland "to ensure the increased participation of women at all levels of decision making and in mechanisms for the prevention, management and resolution of conflict."  While these are important principles, we have to be realistic.  It does not seem likely that the British Government will change one of its basic policies on Northern Ireland by drawing up a national action plan for Northern Ireland, or by including Northern Ireland in the UK national action plan.  It is a tribute to the resourcefulness of the women in Northern Ireland who are engaging with this issue that they are working on the basis of establishing the principles of UN Resolution 1325.  That is what matters.  It does not matter what it is called - the principle of enabling women to participate in power-sharing and peace-building is what is important.  A great deal is being done, particularly at civil society level, to bring this to a greater level.</p><p> We are asking members of the joint committee which has obviously been charged with examining the Good Friday Agreement and considerable influence in that regard to promote the cause of UN Resolution 1325 with their counterparts in the United Kingdom and civil society organisations and encourage implementation of the principles of the resolution.  We are also seeking the help of the committee in the consultation process being engaged in by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the next national action plan.  We have all felt a greater assessment of the situation in Northern Ireland should be made.  More thought should be given to how we can make progress as regards women.  We cannot have a lasting peace without their being involved.  We cannot ignore the fact that they suffered hugely during the Troubles.  I appreciate that men suffered aoso  but women suffered in particular ways.</p><p> I was very struck by two points that came up at the hearings and a subsequent conference.  First, a woman who was speaking about domestic violence, which tends to be a real issue in post-conflict situations, made the point that women were often trammelled in speaking out against perpetrators.  This might be because the perpetrator is a prisoner who has been let out on licence, for example.  A woman might be concerned that reporting this crime might affect the peace process.  Regardless of the reasons for this silencing, there is a need for what has been expressed in the safety of these discussions to be heard.  The second point that struck me was made by a woman from a loyalist community who said she felt the continuing control of paramilitaries in her community meant that women had no means of expressing their needs or participating in decision-making in the community.  As long as that historical control still pertains, we have to be conscious that we do not have true peace in its full meaning.</p><p> UN Resolution 1325 certainly gives us possibilities and opportunities to do good.  The Republic of Ireland has played a leading role, with other countries, in making sure we live up to our obligations.  This is part of our obligations.  I am very grateful to the joint committee for giving us an opportunity to speak.  I will ask Ms Keleher to say a little from the Department's point of view.</p></speech>

I will speak about UN Resolution 1325 in an international context.  I will also go through the process for developing the next national action plan.  </p><p>  The first thing to note about the national action plan is that it was informed by an extensive and inclusive period of consultation with civil society organisations, academics like Dr. Hoewer and other experts in the field of women, peace and security.  It was also informed by an innovative and unique cross-learning initiative which brought together women who had been affected by conflict in Liberia, Timor-Leste and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>We had a series of workshops and discussions.  A report was prepared and presented to the head of UN Women, which had just been founded by Michelle Bachelet.  Even before we had a national action plan, NAP, the report was a good example of how Ireland had been leading the way in this field.  The report contained recommendations for UN Women and the UN system on how to further engage with women affected by conflict.  This consultation and consultative process also informed the NAP which describes itself as a living document.  It is supposed to be iteratively improved and that is why it is being reviewed.  It is a living document that will address the challenges and incorporate new lessons through regular monitoring and evaluation processes.  The monitoring group, uniquely, is established by the NAP itself.  Most other countries do not have this process.</p><p> The monitoring group is chaired independently by Liz McManus.  The group also oversaw the production of a mid-term progress report, again, commissioned and carried out by independent consultants, Karen McMinn and Bronagh Hinds, who have extensive expertise in this area.  The mid-term progress report was presented to the T&aacute;naiste and President Higgins last summer.  The consultants also met with the chair, colleagues within the Department, other relevant Departments and agencies to further examine the steps in implementing United Nations Security Council Resolution, UNSCR ,1325 and also met with civil society members of the monitoring group.</p><p> The conflict resolution unit where I work has two functions in regard to UNSCR 1325.  First, we are the policy desk that has responsibility for driving the process forward but also we act as the secretariat to the independent monitoring group.  There are two hats involved.  The report, which was completely independent, identified challenges and examples of good practice and made recommendations for the second half of the NAP.  Liz McManus has already spoken about the specific actions under Pillar 2 participation and Pillar 5, the promotion of UNSCR 1325, so I will not speak on them.  What I would emphasise about Ireland&rsquo;s NAP in comparison to other countries is that being a western country that is often a donor and has quite a high profile in overseas development aid, ODA, it is completely unique for us to have a national action plan on women, peace and security that also includes a domestic focus.  The NAPs of most of the other countries that are major ODA donors focus on what they will do overseas, on peacekeeping and in funding aid programmes.  The idea that we have a recent experience of conflict is pretty unique and is something that has been picked out by various multilateral organisations, including the EU, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, and even our colleagues in the UN as a unique and positive thing and an example of good practice.</p><p> Liz McManus already mentioned the fact that we are in the process of developing the successor to the current NAP and setting up a consultative group which will be about 50% comprised of State actors who have a role in UNSCR 1325 and about 50% civil society and academic members.  During the summer we hope to do a public consultation process.  Rather than necessarily inviting particular organisations to make an input, anyone can make an input.  That will be really valuable and hopefully will open up the level of inputs we receive, make them broader and have a wider perspective.</p><p> The last point I wish to flag about UNSCR 1325 is the international context.  Liz McManus spoke about the importance of women&rsquo;s voices being heard in peace building.  We know that the majority of conflicts that exist in the world today are relapses of previous conflicts.  Areas where peace has lasted are where women&rsquo;s voices have been included in the peace-building process.  There has been a shift in UNSCR 1325 at the UN level in recent years.  The resolution was originally agreed in the year 2000.  Our national action plan was a result of the ten-year anniversary of that.  Since 2000 there have been seven resolutions on women, peace and security.  Next year in 2015 it will be the 15th anniversary and there will be a high level review of what the UN is doing on women, peace and security.  There is a very clear transformative shift towards the key participation and empowerment of women.  It is not necessarily that women are simply victims of conflict or negatively suffer the impact of conflict, but also that they have a role in preventing and building peace, which is hugely important.</p><p> In terms of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, we are firmly committed to the issue both internationally and to the Ireland-Northern Ireland aspect.  My colleague, Orlaith Fitzmaurice, from the Anglo-Irish division is present and she can talk specifically about the Ireland-Northern Ireland elements.</p><p> I thank the members of the monitoring group, in particular the civil society and academic members represented by Melanie Hoewer who have given freely of their time in calling the officials to task and making sure that the plan is being implemented and revised as it should be.  Part of our appearance today is to ask for the committee&rsquo;s help and for the meeting to provide an additional level of oversight and monitoring.  We look forward to hearing what members think and to answer any questions members might have.</p></speech>

They are vibrant in terms of what they want to know about the political scene.  They are very conscious of what is going on compared to some of the boys in the class.  That is especially evident in a co-educational school.  The big question is what happens after that.  I am often amazed that we find it so difficult to get women to participate in politics.  The local elections are a prime example of the difficulty in getting women to participate.  Recently in Tallaght, our candidate was blackguarded by people who should know better.

We have had many conversations with our party leader, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, on the matter.  Many of the groups we met were dominated by men.  It was always a breath of fresh air when women spoke to us or made presentations.  They showed knowledge and understanding of their communities.  In spite of that we do not see women coming forward in numbers to become involved in politics.  I do not have the answer but we must work from the ground up, starting with schools, colleges and universities to give a positivity to participation by women in politics.  Any of the women with whom I have been involved have a willingness to participate and in many cases a better ability than men.</p> <p>However, it seems they still are not being given that additional space or perhaps protection.  I use the word "protection" in the loosest sense, as women do not or should not need protection.  However, when one then sees this aggravation and everything else that goes on, one asks why would they participate.  I believe one must continue and I welcome the groups that are being set up.  As has been requested, this committee will keep a monitoring role in respect of Northern Ireland and through its Chairman, Deputy McHugh, the door is always open to the witnesses to return before the joint committee to talk about it again.  During one of the joint committee's visits to Northern Ireland, I see no reason to prevent the witnesses, as a group, from meeting members there to have a conversation with the people in Northern Ireland and to try to encompass as many people as possible in developing what we really seek, namely, equal status for women in both politics and general life.</p><p> If one looks at many of the groups that form our communities, men dominate them.  I have been involved in sport for all my life and men dominate in that sphere.  However, in recent years, women have come to the fore in many male-orientated organisations and have been a revelation in terms of their organisational ability, the proposals they have put forward and in everything they do.  While it certainly is not happening as quickly as one would wish, it is happening in many areas.  Nevertheless one must try to drive it forward and I suggest to the Chairman that the joint committee should link up with Ms Liz McManus and her committee.  If it is possible, during some of our future visits to Northern Ireland, we should invite them along with members as participants.  In that way, the joint committee should try to create and generate a common denominator for everyone.  I see many different groups and what make the difference are co-ordination and linkage.  We simply do not appear to have that, which in a way is a crying shame because it would make much more sense and above all, provide far more direction of purpose in what we are trying to achieve.</p><p> I wish the witnesses well and certainly will bring their thoughts to the Parliamentary Labour Party, of which I am chairman.  If they wish to appear before that group, they certainly are welcome at any stage to address the Parliamentary Labour Party.  As for this joint committee, I pray that members will be able to facilitate them on some of their visits to Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-08a.505" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Melanie Hoewer" time="11:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014050800007#G00400"><p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to speak and I thank Deputy Wall for sharing with us his experiences and for the important comments he made on women's leadership.  Women's leadership in politics is indeed one of the crucial challenges we face not just in the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security, but more generally.  Academic research has shown over decades that the national sphere of politics is mainly informed by male hopes, male aspirations and male experiences.  This does not mean that men, such as those who are represented here today, are worse than women but it means they are different.  They have different experiences, hopes and aspirations and they do not cover the hopes, aspirations and experiences of more than 50% of the population in many countries.  Consequently, I greatly welcome those comments.  The Deputy posed an important question as to what is happening, why women are not participating, why access points are not opening or why spaces are not being given for women's participation.</p><p>  I share the Deputy's experience.  I teach in a third level university in an academic college from which the majority of graduates are women at present.  Consequently, the question is, where do they end up and why do they not go into politics?  There is a fear that politics, as we see in national parliaments in Ireland, in Northern Ireland, are still very male-dominated.  While changes are happening, there is still male dominance.  This is one factor, namely, men speaking to one another.  I do not wish to generalise by saying all men are the same and all women are the same; there are different experiences among both men and women.  However, because we generally look at how we perceive normality, the perceived normality is that men are just in parliament and women predominantly are in the home.  While changes are happening, how can one speed up these changes to happen more quickly?  I believe the quota is very important.  I do not advocate for long-term quotas but for a quota that ensures that access points are given.  Access points, which Deputy Wall clearly has already identified, are not there yet.  We have amazing women in politics and I am sure Liz McManus can also share some of her experiences from that angle as to how they got in.  More structural, institutional access points, as I would like to call them, such as quotas are needed.  In addition, we need champions.  We need male and female gender champions who help and support women - in particular young women - to build up their leadership roles.</p><p>  I wish to make a point on Northern Ireland before I hand over to Ms Orlaith Fitzmaurice.  It is interesting that during the conflict in Northern Ireland, there were many women in leadership functions in certain communities.  We have much evidence that women can lead, can lead communities and can be very effective in politics.  Despite the fact that the equality argument should not require that women must prove themselves to be equal to men to have access to local parliaments, during the conflict, there was a lot of female leadership within Northern Ireland.  Since 1998, however, this female leadership has reduced in the communities.  While I do not wish to repeat what Liz McManus and Helena Keleher have just outlined, I refer to the increasing fear, increasing control, increasing domestic violence and decreasing female community leadership in communities in Northern Ireland.  Talking about fear, control, violence, etc., shows something has gone wrong in the time after 1998, with the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Women have played an instrumental role, albeit very minimal as regards numbers, in getting the Good Friday Agreement negotiated.  I refer here to the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition.  However, where they have made incredible changes, which is so important for the peace process in Northern Ireland, on human rights and equality institutions, what is happening on human rights and equality in Northern Ireland at present is a crucial question.  This is yet another access point to get women into politics because it is a human rights and equality issue.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-08a.506" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orlaith Fitzmaurice" time="11:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014050800007#G00500"><p>To add to the presentation that Dr. Melanie Hoewer has given, specifically our work in Northern Ireland is very much informed by and aware of the need for the participation and representation of women in politics and in decision-making at all levels.  Obviously, however, decision-making at political level is one of the most significant and one of the most transformative.  On a pragmatic basis, we fund a number of projects in this area.  For instance, we work with the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation, which has a long-standing women's leadership programme in which the centre identifies women with strong leadership potential in the political and community sphere to whom it provides mentoring training.  A particularly hopeful feature at present is the fact the centre is building a strong alumni network from past participants in the programme who can use their experience and, as they move along, can mentor some of the newer members in it.  We also support a number of groups, some of which are fairly self-evident.  There is a group called Women into Politics, which is the only non-governmental organisation, NGO, in Northern Ireland active in that space and we have been able to support it in previous years for the project work it is carrying out.</p><p>  I just might say a word more broadly on the support the reconciliation fund can give.  Our fund has the objectives of promoting reconciliation and reducing sectarianism in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>It operates in Northern Ireland and the Border counties and on an east-west basis.</p><p> We are very much aware of the importance of women in both the political sphere and civic society.  My experience, in meeting dozens of groups every month, reflects that expressed by Deputy Wall Wall that many women in community groups are inspiring, impressive leaders and formidable, but they sometimes find themselves hampered by circumstances.  Sometimes they believe their actions are more effective in the community sphere and feel, perhaps, a level of political disengagement where they consider entering into politics is not the way they can best make the changes that they believe they need to see in their communities.</p><p> We are open to applications from women's groups and try to support them as best we can.  We are drawing up a new strategy for the reconciliation funds and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, has stated he looks forward to consulting the committee on it.  It is intended that within the strategy we will expressly identify UN resolution 1325 and its applicability in Northern Ireland.  As part of this, women will constitute one of a small number of priority target areas.  We hope to be able to expand our support for these groups in that way.</p></speech>

I was struck by what Ms McManus stated about the disproportionate effect of violence on women in all world conflicts.  Of course, that is true.  I listened closely to what she said about how Ireland was implementing the action plan and how it had been positive in the Republic.  Clearly, from what she stated, there are deficiencies in how the United Kingdom has dealt with the issue and the resolution.  When anybody comes before the joint committee, I ask what can we do to advance what he or she is seeking.  We need to write and make representations, through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to the British Government on a specific action plan for Northern Ireland.</p><p>  There are a number of issues that have not been dealt with after the conflict.  Mental health services are particularly important.  The delegates highlighted the issue of domestic violence.  The reason women are affected disproportionately is that nearly all conflicts throughout world history have been started by men.  If one looks at communities in Northern Ireland in which drug dealing is rife, control through fear by paramilitaries is the major issue.  Unfortunately, that is still the case in some communities.  We, therefore, need a specific action plan, in which there should be greater emphasis on mental health services.  For those affected by the Troubles, these issues are ongoing and can affect their relationships with family members and everybody with whom they interact daily.</p><p>  In terms of women's participation in politics, it was stated 23% of local councillors in the North and one quarter of candidates were female.  When women have an opportunity to run in elections, they enjoy great success.  The problem is getting on the ticket.</p><p>  Gender quotas were mentioned.  This is something towards which we are moving in the Republic.  Many women, however, are opposed to quotas, as they do not want to be token participants in the political process.  Obviously, others believe it is the only way they will gain access through the political parties to face the electorate.  As I stated, the evidence is that once women get on the ballot paper, they have every opportunity of being elected and succeed in doing so on a proportionate basis.  We need to advance the cause in that respect because we would have had a different Northern Ireland if the voices of more women had been heard from the early 1970s onwards.  Unfortunately, young men get together in groups and decide how they will advance their political objectives and it generally takes a violent turn.  If women were to the forefront in the political process, I do not think that would have happened.  The problem is not unique to Northern Ireland; it is worldwide.</p><p>  I do not know what specifically we can do as a group, but we need to challenge the attitude of the United Kingdom that there was no armed conflict in Northern Ireland, as, clearly, there was.  For domestic political reasons, it chose not to see it in that fashion.  What we can do is try to advance the idea that there is a deficiency in how the action plan is being advanced in Northern Ireland.  Ms McManus has outlined what has been done in the Republic and we need to do something similar to advance the process in Northern Ireland.</p><p>  On conflict resolution, I point to the role of women, for example, that played by Ms Margaret Urwin in Justice for the Forgotten.  Generally, women are left to pick up the pieces and if there is constructive movement many years down the line, one finds that it is women who are trying to advance causes long forgotten by many.  It is both welcome and important that the Government provided additional funding for Justice for the Forgotten through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore.</p></speech>

It is only right to acknowledge the funding allocated to Justice for the Forgotten which formally thanked the joint committee for its intervention.</p><p>  There is something we can do on the British-Irish aspect of the issue.  There are a number of advocates present.  Deputy Frank Feighan is Chairman of the sovereign matters committee of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Conlan is a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly also, as is Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe.  Deputy Jack Wall is Chairman of the social affairs committee.  It is a social affairs issue, but there is also a sovereign matter element in lack of recognition of Norther Ireland as a conflict zone by the British.  There are options, in respect of which there are plenty of advocates present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-08a.511" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014050800008#H00500"><p>I will begin by welcoming the delegates.  I apologise for the small attendance, but we have been overtaken by events.  Usually the turnout is better.  It is welcome that Senator Mary Moran has arrived to remove some of the pressure.  The committee has representatives of both genders.  Ms Michelle Gildernew, MP, was supposed to be present.  I do not know what happened, but she was definitely on her way and may still arrive.  She was going to take the lead on this issue for my party.</p><p>  I am also conscious that we are meeting against the backdrop of what is happening in Nigeria.  We are discussing the UN Security Council resolution on the safety of women, particularly young women.  For many, it is a shock that louder voices were not being raised about what was happening in Nigeria.  I am glad that saner persons are coming forward and starting to speak up.  I hope there will be a stronger response to what are appaling events.</p><p>  There was reference to the Women's Coalition and the positive role it had played in the process, particularly in the discussions leading up to the Good Friday Agreement.  To some extent, parties have woken up to the fact that there is a need for more women to be involved.  I do not know whether that is a positive for them, but what has happened is that the Women's Coalition has been squeezed out by parties which are moving into that space, with the result that there are now more women involved across the political parties, particularly in the North.  I suppose the fact that they are there means they are expressing a view.  However, one aspect that shocked many, particularly in the South, was the attitude of some, probably not in Unionism but others in society, towards women, particularly in the discussions leading up to the Agreement.</p> <p>I recall that people were shocked by the response to Liz O'Donnell, when she was involved in those negotiations as Minister of State.  It was a wake-up call to middle aged men taking a middle aged attitude towards women.  That was reflected in much of the discussion.  Mo Mowlam encountered similar difficulties when dealing with these parties, which had problems not only with her politics but also the fact that she was a strong woman.  It was a shock for some of the males involved in those discussions.  The cornerstone of the Good Friday Agreement was supposed to be equality and parity of esteem but much of this has not yet been rolled out.  I acknowledge that we have the civic forum and the Bill of Rights but many of the reforms have been delayed because certain parties do not agree with, for example, LGBT rights.  Supposedly, that is a big difficulty for some of the Unionist parties and is one of the reasons they are giving for holding back.</p><p> In regard to victims, I agree about the nonsense of there not being an armed conflict in the North and the British failing to do that.  If we can push that forward, it would make sense.  Republicans also made many mistakes, particularly in our attitudes towards prisoners coming out of jail.  In many cases the supports that were available at the time were not taken up.  We had the attitude that they were part of the community and that their issues could be resolved there.  However, men and women who came out of jail after lengthy sentences did not get the supports they needed in many cases.  That was reflected in the difficulties that arose in their home and family lives.  The world had changed for these people by the time they left jail.  I recall speaking to one individual for whom the thought of going into a bank or dealing with officialdom was a source of concern.  ATMs and traffic lights were new to some of these people.  That was part of getting back into society and there could have been more support for them.  The committee met women prisoners to discuss the difficulties they faced in regard to adoption and fertility issues.  Everyone sympathises with these people but it is the same situation.  They have not seen the new beginning and reintegration into society that was promised for prisoners.</p><p> Prisoners need to be given supports in the North and the South.  It is not solely a Northern problem.  There are victims in the North and the South.  The question arises of how we provide such support.  Justice for the Forgotten was one of the groups which were unable to access funding.  I welcome that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has agreed to fund it because it was unable to get PEACE money from the EU.  We know from experience that people from throughout Ireland have been affected by the conflict.  We must do more to support victims in the Twenty-six Counties in the context of the UN resolution on rehabilitation and recovery.  I would support an all-Ireland approach to the resolution on that basis.  I do not think we should put people in boxes.  There were also victims in Britain.  Perhaps we should also consider east-west structures.</p><p> I welcome this discussion.  It is one of the big gaps in terms of progressing the situation.  The civic forum can help in this regard.  I could speak about what Sinn F&eacute;in is doing, but the question arising is not so much the number of women candidates as whether they are contesting winnable seats.  It is not enough to pursue the tokenism of reaching quotas.  We have tried to meet these goals.  Women from Sinn F&eacute;in were involved in the Haass talks, for example.  They were not involved as token women.  They are strong women who reflect their society and they had a lot to say.  They are not quiet women in the background supporting their men.  I agree we need more women in politics but we also need to change the way politics is organised in this country, North and South.  Politics must be made more family friendly and inclusive.  What happened to that young woman in Tallaght was disgraceful.  Other candidates were quick to support her, however, and we would like to see similar support in other areas.</p><p> We need to be conscious of what is happening in terms of domestic violence but we also need to develop support structures for women.  A crisis exists in this city of domestic violence against women.  Paramilitaries or micro-groupings - call them what you want - are also operating in this city.  These difficulties are not confined to the North.</p></speech>

I was on a health committee with Ms McManus in 2002 and she was very insightful with regard to the issues.  It is great to see her here today.</p><p>  Many issues arise with regard to UN Security Council Resolution 1325.  As we have seen with the Good Friday Agreement, a reporting mechanism is required.  Sometimes we launch reports and forget, so we need timescales and timelines.  As with the Good Friday Agreement and other issues, the committees must be part of the plan.  The witnesses want to make a contribution and the committee will certainly support their inclusion in the deliberations.</p><p>  Women are very much involved in peace building and mediation activities, and Deputy Jack Wall alluded to the huge clamour to get more women involved in local and national politics.  I approached at least five or six women, who would have got a seat, to run in the local elections in my area but they asked me why.  Women are much smarter than men.  In the current climate politics is going to the lowest common denominator.  We have Facebook, Twitter and local media.  Politicians do not want preferential treatment, but the profession is being dragged down.  Why would anybody with ability who wants to offer something get involved when one's character is immediately taken away from one?  Someone stated 90% of murders are committed by males and all wars are started by males.  If such a climate exists in politics only alpha males will get involved.  A very good friend of mine who was a Deputy took his own life a year ago under horrific circumstances.  Everyone is clamouring to get more women involved, which is absolutely fantastic and I support it.  Fine Gael and all of the other parties could do more but we have done a lot.  However, we may be missing the boat because if politics is so debased that one's character will be taken away from one, as women are much smarter than men, why would they get involved?  We need to address this issue.</p><p>  With Facebook and Twitter, politicians have 20,000 supporters and it is like having a private army.  If I use Twitter to make a statement on behalf of the Government, I will be attacked.  This means one does not participate.  It is the same with reporters.  Reporters state something about a certain politician and they are attacked.  The only people who will stand up and be counted in such a herd mentality are the alpha males with the X factor.  Those working behind the scenes will decide they do not need it.  Unless this is debated we will not have more women in politics because why would they get involved?  I approached at least ten women in my county of Roscommon about going on the ticket and they refused, including one woman who had been involved for ten years.  We need to address these issues.</p><p>  Deputy Crowe alluded to the 284 young schoolgirls kidnapped in the north east of Nigeria, and I would like to hear the witnesses' comments on this.  This horrific issue is ongoing.  What can we do about it?  Perhaps this committee does not have a role in it.  How do the witnesses think we can mobilise to stop this?  Many such incidences happen throughout the world, of which we are not aware but of which the witnesses are.  How can these be highlighted?  We need to do more as legislators, as politicians and as members of the international community to address this.</p><p>  I am delighted the witnesses have come before the committee.  United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 is not something with which we are as familiar as we should be, but the witnesses coming before the committee will change this.  We can work together on this.  We have gone to Northern Ireland and throughout the country and we try to engage.  We need the witnesses' views in this engagement.  I look forward to their participation in Northern Ireland, throughout the island of Ireland and wherever.</p></speech>

If one considers the conflict resolution aspect, it is quite surprising the role of women has reduced since the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998.  I take it this is primarily with regard to the Six Counties, and there are a number of reasons for it.  During the conflict, more than 30,000 people on the republican side, predominantly men, were imprisoned.  Women assumed a role and responsibility in the community and politically through political activism on the ground, raising awareness and bringing the issue to an international audience.  When their husbands and sons returned to the community, and with the Good Friday Agreement and the end of the actual conflict, they willingly or otherwise went back to the so-called cultural role of what a mother and wife is supposed to be.  This is one of the reasons for the reduction.</p><p>  Women becoming involved in electoral politics and becoming elected representatives is mitigated against because there is a culture of unshared parental responsibility.  The responsibility for children rests solely with the mother.  We must change this culture, and to bring this about will be very thought-provoking for males.  The essence of this is equality.  If we have equality of parental responsibility and equality within the political and social systems, we will achieve 50:50 representation.</p><p>  My daughter, who is a member of the party, is very critical of our policy.</p> <p>She is also involved with politics.  I disagree with her argument that when there is positive discrimination within a party in getting women involved, with a mandatory 30% or 35% figure, it is insulting to women.  She believes that women should aspire to this in their own right rather than having a position manufactured.  I disagree.  If the playing field was level there would be no problem, but it is not.  We must get to the bottom of the issue.</p><p> The kidnapping of the girls in Nigeria is terrible.  The most grotesque performance I have ever seen on video was the leader of Boko Haram taunting the world about what he would do with these children.  He stated he would sell them as slaves for predators, etc.  The issue has struck a chord right across the developed world, but similar things happen in post-colonial areas which experience massive poverty and inequality, with absolute political corruption.  This is in the parts of the world which are not fully developed.  This matter must be resolved by all of us, as we have a role to play.</p><p> There is the matter of our responsibility regarding the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and there are aspects that have equality and parity of esteem at their core, as Deputy Crowe mentioned.  We meet here every couple of weeks and we go to the Six Counties, etc., but some parties have never looked to participate in this committee.  The two main Unionist parties have never taken part.  In itself, that mitigates against the full implementation of the agreement from an all-party perspective.  The Chairman has played an important role in facilitating us in going to communities that are not represented here in the likes of east and north Belfast.  That involves meeting ordinary people and giving them a voice here.  Political parties are failing in their responsibility to live up to the commitments made in an international agreement, which is disgraceful.  It makes a mockery of the agreement to which they subscribed.  We could invite parties to make a presentation on an individual basis, but I do not know if such an invitation would be accepted.  There could be consideration of the role of women within the existing political frameworks.</p><p> Not just in the Six Counties but right across this island there is a prevailing culture mitigating against equal opportunities and rights for women in the political system as well as outside it.  For example, 99% of the time a single parent is a woman, although two people are involved in the birth of a child.  The woman usually has the responsibility of caring for the child.  This debate is ongoing but we have not yet got where we want to go.  As legislators and people involved in the political arena, we must be seen to lead this process and push it forward.  My party is no different from others, and some people do not live up to what is expected of them within the party.  Nevertheless, at a leadership level we are driving this forward to the best of our ability.  Even as far back as the 1970s, the issue of women's rights in the party was driven by Deputy Gerry Adams.  Anybody who has read his books will know his record on the role of women in society.  The culture must be changed to afford women equality.</p></speech>

I welcome the delegation, although I have met some of them and had discussions before.  I thank the delegation for the presentations and apologise for my late arrival, as I had a previous engagement.</p><p>  I welcome the comments made by my colleagues on women and the role they can play not only in conflict resolution but also in public life and politics.  We have spoken about gender quotas and I still have not fully made up my mind on the issue.  Given the right opportunities and circumstances, women are well capable of being elected on their own merit, but one can see both sides of this major issue.  As somebody who has only entered politics in the past three years, I find the biggest obstacle to be the co-operation required both within parties and - particularly for women - by others who help with the caring role at home.  Traditionally, with no disrespect to men in politics, Members who live down the country may leave home on a Tuesday and not return until Thursday, and there must be people in place to look after children in the meantime.  No matter what job we do, women will always have that caring role.  That is not to say they have more right to it than fathers, but women have traditionally had the bonding role.  Before women can take a position in public life, we must have structures in place in both society and the home to ensure there are supports to enable women work in that sphere.</p><p>  There is a cr&egrave;che for young children in Leinster House but there is no facility for people with children who have special needs.  Once a child is a certain age, the care provider will not take him or her.  Nevertheless, some people here need extra support, particularly if there is an emergency, for example.  It is important that all frameworks and possibilities are taken into account to ensure the correct supports exist for people who want to participate in public life or politics.</p><p>  Others have referred to the Justice for the Forgotten group and its excellent work.  It has events scheduled this weekend to remember the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  I welcome the setting up of a new committee which is representative of all parties to support that work.  I commend the T&aacute;naiste on ensuring additional funding is available for the group in Glencree.</p> <p>Coming from the Border area myself, I have had dealings with one of the groups funded under this programme which was involved in peace and reconciliation and conflict resolution in the Dundalk area.  I attended a conference it organised just over a year ago.  The group came to Leinster House and I hosted a meeting with it and various Oireachtas Members.  The feedback from the group on the work it was engaged in was great.  I note that 19 different courses have been undertaken, but what happens when they are finished?  Some of the women I spoke to told me they had really enjoyed the courses and the cross-Border, cross-party, cross-religion experience.  However, they expressed a concern that when the courses finished there would be nothing else to follow.  Is there any follow-up for people to ensure that the good work that is done continues?</p></speech>

We are all prisoners of history and of the current political realities across the globe.  Politics here and internationally is confrontational and adversarial in nature.  Moderate voices, of both men and women, tend to get drowned out when political conflict arises.  The current situation in Ukraine is a case in point.  The moderate voices of the civil rights movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the North were drowned out as the conflict developed there.  Many people often feel that political movements are not for them because they have their own personal safety and integrity to preserve while people of a more violent disposition tend to take front-line positions.</p><p>  The Good Friday Agreement highlights the fact that we have to find a new way of doing politics.  By bringing these issues to the fore in forums like this we remind everybody of where we need to go in terms of the political structures in Ireland and also internationally.  I do not want to be negative here.  While highlighting the positives of the UN resolution and the stated aims of the Good Friday Agreement, we must also be conscious of the fact that almost all of the political parties in this nation who have been in power - including Cumann na nGaedheal, Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in - are based on violence.  The leaders of those parties and the way they assumed power originally was through muscle.  That sends out a very bad message to people who have moderate political views, who are pragmatic and who want to advance causes through rational thought and argument.  Our own history suggests that if one wants to assume power and take control of this nation, one must do it through muscle and violence.  That sends out a terribly bad signal to everybody in this country.  All political parties must find a new way to develop politics and encourage moderate people with pragmatic views across society to become active in the political sphere and in their communities.  That is the challenge for all of us.  That is also why I welcome the discussion this morning, because this is what we need to do over the next ten to 30 years.  We must show that there is a better way.  Unfortunately, if one looks at conflicts in places such as Nigeria or Ukraine, the same sort of political realities always present themselves.  If one has muscle and acts violently, one is listened to, but if one is moderate, one tends to be drowned out, unfortunately.</p></speech>

It is obvious that there is an appetite among committee members to further deliberate on these issues after today's meeting.  I now call on the panel to make their concluding remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-08a.529" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Liz McManus" time="12:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014050800013#O00400"><p>I will ask my two colleagues to give brief interventions at the end of my contribution.  First, I thank the members for their questions and comments.  It has been an extremely useful engagement and we have covered an awful lot of ground.  We do not have time to respond to all of the points that were made, but the general points about the lack of female participation in politics, the issues of child care and the historical issues are very clear in terms of challenges we face as a society in the Republic.  However, there are specific issues relating to Northern Ireland which are not simply issues for one community or the other but affect people across the board and which are the result of a conflict that went on for an extended period.  I am speaking here of issues such as domestic violence, fear of reporting, paramilitary control of communities and poverty, which affect women's lives.  These are issues that we need to develop mechanisms to overcome.</p><p>  It is important to stress that women do have a role and a say, however limited.  We must acknowledge that, because otherwise people will think that women are never able to say anything.  One of the champions of Resolution 1325 in the Northern Ireland Assembly is a woman and an MLA.  She also happens to be a member of the DUP.  She came to Dublin, spoke at a conference in the Department and was extremely helpful in setting up the Westminster hearings.  That is a form of influence that we have to acknowledge.  At the major Women and Peace Building conference held in Belfast, keynote speakers included Dianne Dodds, MEP, and Baroness May Blood, who has been a champion for women over many years.  She speaks very plainly and bluntly in a way that I find refreshing.  There are voices out there but there is just not enough capacity built yet within society in Northern Ireland.  We must encourage that.</p><p>  I came into this hoping that we would get an action plan within Northern Ireland.  That seems to me to be the optimal outcome, but we are not going to get it, in my estimation, although I do not think we should stop looking for it.  What we can get and what we should be very forceful in ensuring is that the principles of the prevention of violence, participation by women, protection of women and promoting equality are progressed to a considerable extent.  There is much goodwill among the parties towards this approach.  I am very encouraged by today.  If one looks at what is happening in Nigeria now it is obvious that had capacity been built there so that women had more of a say and some kind of control over their lives, it is less likely that such terrible actions could have taken place.  </p><p>  This committee is dealing with Northern Ireland and its relationship with the Republic, and in this regard there are issues relating to women upon which we can make considerable progress if we support those people in Northern Ireland who are already doing good work.  I have named some of them already, particularly in the Anglo-Irish division.  The money keeps coming and people keep applying for it.  One of the surprises was that we could have done with more applications in the last round.  The next round is in the autumn and I look forward to that kind of initiative being taken into the future.</p><p>  I thank the committee members very much.  They have been extremely supportive and obliging with their time. Finally, I would like to thank Ms Ciara Gilvarry, Ms Helena Keleher, Ms Orlaith Fitzmaurice and Dr. Melanie Hoewer, who have played a huge part in this project.</p></speech>

Domestic violence is obviously a universal issue, but there is a particular aspect to domestic violence in Northern Ireland as a post-conflict society.</p> <p>We have been able to fund projects, such as the cross-Border project with the Fermanagh Women's Aid Group, exploring domestic violence as a legacy of paramilitarism.  </p><p> A number of members mentioned LGBT rights and mental health, issues of which we are very aware from the context of the North of Ireland and that we support more broadly through other reconciliation fund programmes.  We do not count them in our UNSCR 1325 funding, but we would be happy to follow up with individual members if they would like to explore any of those areas.</p><p> I thank the Chairman for his proposal with regard to engagement on UNSCR 1325 through the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  We are very much aware that the ideal would be to have a national action plan for Northern Ireland, but we are conscious that we do not want the best to be the enemy of the good.  We work by applying the spirit and principles and taking a pragmatic approach.  An initiative does not have to be labelled UNSCR 1325 for us to support it.</p><p> Our next funding round for reconciliation work more generally is in the autumn.  As Ms McManus has mentioned, the applications that we get from women's groups for funding under UNSCR 1325 tend to be of very high quality and we tend to say yes to a great many of them.  We would certainly welcome more.  There is certainly more scope for us to support them as there is a great deal of work that still needs to be done.</p><p> I will now address the question of what happens when the funding period finishes for groups.  One of the key criteria against which we assess applications is their long-term sustainability and impact.  Projects with a built-in long-term impact are more likely to be supported by us.  Of course, groups can always reapply as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-08a.532" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Melanie Hoewer" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014050800014#P00200"><p>Let me add to what Ms Fitzmaurice outlined so precisely.  I thank the Chairman for this inspiring and very engaged discussion on these important issues.  As an academic I am glad to be here.</p><p>  I appreciate the remarks of Ms McManus and Ms Fitzmaurice on the national action plan, but let me clarify.  The British Government has repeatedly stated that the conflicts to be dealt with under UNSCR 1325 have to meet the threshold of being identified as a conflict in the Geneva Convention.  This is not accurate.  The Secretary General has issued a statement that UNSCR 1325 does not seek to make any legal determination as to whether situations referred to in the Secretary General's report are or are not conflicts within the context of the Geneva Convention.  We know there has been some contention in the Northern Ireland Executive about that issue.  I very much welcome that we focus on the principles of UNSCR 1325.</p><p>  Some of the Deputies have asked what can they do to support the implementation of those principles in Northern Ireland.  The All-Party Group on UNSCR 1325: Women, Peace and Security, which is currently led by Paula Bradley, has been mentioned repeatedly.  This all-party group has an idea of what they are supposed to do but not a real role.  I would encourage taking good practice examples such as we have seen in Colombia, where they have no national action plan either but they have implemented or are in the process of implementing the principles from the bottom up.  They have local plans.  I agree with Deputy Feighan that one needs a reporting or monitoring mechanism; otherwise, one does not know what is happening.  Everybody can talk about principles, but one does not know what is actually happening.  The members might talk to their colleagues about giving a leadership role to the all-party group and engaging them more.  The members of the all-party group do not have much motivation to engage with the group because they do not have that many tasks, except to organise very important hearings.  Giving them a greater role would bring the process forward from a local level.  That is a very important point.</p><p>  There has been engagement in community at the local level but we need to take a multilevel approach to how we look at conflict resolution in Northern Ireland.  The emphasis is on power sharing at the national and regional levels in the Parliament, but there is also a community dimension, which is mentioned in the Good Friday Agreement, and an individual dimension, which is also mentioned in the Good Friday Agreement but is not being taken into account in the same way.  I think the all-party group could do a good job of taking on leadership and looking at those different dimensions and the different issues within the five pillars.</p><p>  I thank members for their attention.  Their interest is very encouraging and I hope we can move the process forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-08a.533" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/997" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014050800014#P00300"><p>We have been given a great deal of information.  I think members will agree that we will reach out to Paula Bradley and her group, and we will work with the delegates on that.  We can still pursue the promotion of principles, but we appreciate the realism of the delegates.  Ms Fitzmaurice mentioned the funding call for this October, and I am sure members are thinking of the different women's groups in their own areas that are doing great work.  I am aware of the Inishowen women's outreach group, which has been involved in supporting women who experience domestic violence in the Inishowen Peninsula.  If, following this meeting, we can get the word out and call for groups to submit applications, that would reverse the previous deficit.</p><p>  I note that the delegates did not take the bait from Deputy Frank Feighan when he said that women are smarter than men.  I think it is understandable.  While it is good that the Government has set a quota of 30% female candidates, the debate has moved on.  The cultural and traditional patterns of child rearing have changed.  Men are engaged equally in rearing their children.</p><p>The location of one's constituency is an issue.  Deputy Martin Ferris is from County Kerry and I am from County Donegal.  Young men from those areas must consider whether to enter politics knowing they will not see their family for three days every week, whereas if one represents a constituency in Dublin one will see the children every day.  There is an issue around geography that needs to be thrown into the mix.  Male politicians have a responsibility to be more proactive in the debate.  As things are changing the situation is becoming more complex.  It is not all about children, because there are many who do not have families but are willing to work with organisations with a specific focus on the objectives of UNSCR 1325.</p><p>  We look forward to our continued relationship and to working with the delegation, and if we are here to help if we can.</p></speech>

On behalf of the joint committee, I congratulate our new Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and wish him every success.  We look forward to working with him.  I pay tribute to the former Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, who was the first person to occupy the full Cabinet position as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and wish her well in her new post as Minister for Justice and Equality.  She made a very positive contribution to the area of children and youth affairs and in her engagement with this committee over the past three years.  I hope members will join me in offering them our congratulations.  The Secretary General of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, Mr. Jim Breslin, will be busy.<br />Today's meeting will deal with EU scrutiny and events taking place across the Oireachtas to mark Europe week.  Under the terms of the European Union (Scrutiny) Act 2002, Ministers submit reports to the Oireachtas every six months on developments at European Union level in their areas of responsibility.  We will be examining the departmental six monthly EU scrutiny reports for January to June 2013 and July to December 2013 with the Secretaries General of the Departments of Health and Children and Youth Affairs.  The reports summarise the key legislative and policy developments that took place during the periods in question.  I thank our EU policy clerk, Ms Fiona Cashin, for her assistance in organising today's meeting.<br />I welcome Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin, Secretary General of the Department of Health; Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs; and Ms Audrey Hagerty, Mr. Eugene Lennon, Ms Doreen Burke and Mr. Alan Savage from the Departments of Health and Children and Youth Affairs.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with today's proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br />I invite Dr. McLoughlin to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

I am happy to be here to discuss the two reports submitted to the Oireachtas by the Department of Health on EU developments in 2013.  I am joined by Mr. Eugene Lennon, who was the chief attach&eacute; prior to and during Ireland's Presidency, and Ms Audrey Hagerty, who is head of the Department's European Unit.</p><p>  In 2013 the Department&rsquo;s work at EU level was dominated by the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  In this regard I acknowledge the Department&rsquo;s significant contribution to the success of the Irish Presidency with many notable achievements in health, which I will mention later.  I acknowledge the hard work and commitment of the staff in the Department of Health and its agencies in making the Presidency the success it was.  This was evident at home and in Brussels, Strasbourg, Luxembourg and Geneva.  The commitment of the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and that of the Ministers of State, Deputies White and Lynch, was essential to progressing the health agenda.</p><p>  In 2013, our work was focussed on our Presidency of the Council of the EU.  We decided to focus on progressing the legislative agenda and within this we prioritised legislation to promote public health, innovation and research.  We reached a first reading agreement with the European Parliament on the regulation to protect citizens against serious cross-border health threats.  This will help member states prepare and protect citizens against possible future pandemics and environmental disaster, strengthen risk preparedness and response planning, improve access to vaccines for member states and have clearer risk and crisis communication to the public and health care professionals.</p><p>  We reached a general approach to the directive on tobacco products at Council in June 2013.  This would not have been possible without the Minister&rsquo;s strong belief in and commitment to the importance of the dossier and his personal support in working to progress it.  The support of Commissioner Borg and his team was also critical to the success of the work on the directive which has been formally adopted and comes into force in two weeks time.  This directive is a key tool in preventing our young people from starting to smoke.  It aims to make tobacco products and smoking less attractive and thus discourage initiation among young people.</p><p>  We achieved a first read-through on a proposal for a regulation on clinical trials on medicinal products.  Clinical trials on medicines promote pharmaceutical innovation in the EU and innovation in clinical practice.  Clinical trials are essential for the development of new medicines and to improve and refine treatments with existing medicines.  Clinical trials are also a key contributor to growth and jobs.  A regulatory environment which supports and nurtures clinical research will benefit patients and is also essential for the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in Ireland and the EU.  An objective of the regulation is to address the decline in the numbers of clinical trials carried out in the EU.  Agreement was reached on the new regulation last January.</p><p>  The proposal for a regulation on general and in-vitro medical devices &ndash; in effect two complex proposals - was significantly progressed with a progress report produced at the end of the Irish Presidency.  We want patients to have access to new, innovative and lifesaving medical devices but they need to be assured of their safety.  We also want the EU to be a global leader in medical devices innovation.</p><p>  In addition to the legislative programme, the Irish Presidency also hosted a number of health policy events, including an informal meeting of Health Ministers in March 2013 which was attended by 22 Ministers who discussed childhood obesity, the impact of the economic crisis on health systems, children with complex developmental needs, including autism, and smoke free environments.    A touchstone issue is the impact of the economic crisis on health systems and two messages are clear.  These are the challenge of cutting the cost of services and not the services themselves, and of articulating the dual benefit of investing in health, which are beneficial to the health and well-being of our citizens, but also the economic benefits that accrue from a healthy society.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, co-chaired the session on childhood obesity and at the informal meeting the European Commission agreed to mandate the EU high-level group on nutrition and physical activity to develop an action plan on childhood obesity.  Ireland presented the EU action plan at a Greek Presidency conference earlier this year and its implementation will be included in the Council conclusions under preparation.  The plan will play a central role in the development of national plans to tackle childhood obesity.</p><p>  In May 2013, we hosted eHealth Week, which attracted more than 2,500 international delegates and 100 exhibitors.  We achieved agreement on a declaration to prioritise the use of ICT in health among member states to contribute to a better, safer, sustainable and innovative health care system for all European citizens.    In May 2013, we also marked the EU month of the brain with the "Healthy Brain: Healthy Europe - a new Horizon for brain research and healthcare" conference.  This was a high-level expert conference, co-hosted with DG Research and Innovation, on the future of brain research.  Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn&rsquo;s support and that of her officers was critical to the conference&rsquo;s success.</p><p>  I acknowledge the significant engagement by the Minister of Health, Social Services, and Public Safety, Edwin Poots MLA, and his officials, at key events during the course of the Presidency, including the informal meeting of Health Ministers, the joint meeting of chief medical and chief nursing officers, and the ehealth conference.</p><p>  In the second half of 2013, we had significant liaison with the health ministry of Lithuania, which assumed the EU Presidency for the first time.  Its priority was modern, responsive and sustainable health systems and it developed Council conclusions on this topic which were adopted on 10 December in Brussels.  These conclusions stressed the necessity to enhance the abilities of EU member states to practically apply the principle of health in all policies, encouraged confidence in best practice, and gave guidance for further development of health policy in European Union member states as well as at European Level.  Agreement between Council, the Commission and the European Parliament on the tobacco products directive was finalised and agreement on the regulation on clinical trials of medicinal products was also reached.  These agreements built on the significant progress made by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, on these issues during our Presidency.  The Lithuanian Presidency progressed further the legislative proposals in the field of medical devices and agreement was reached on a proposal for a regulation on fees payable to the European Medicines Agency for the conduct of pharmocovigilance activities.</p><p>  Four Commission proposals in the area of health were notified to the committee in the course of the six month period from July to December 2013.  The transposition of three proposals was notified in the same period.  I am happy to deal with any questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-08a.543" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Breslin" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014050800004#H00300"><p>I circulated the opening statement in advance and I will not cover all of the ground.  I welcome this opportunity to update the committee on the Department's EU-related activities.  In particular I thank the committee for inviting me to discuss the two reports the Department submitted on its 2013 EU activities.</p><p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has an important mandate for policy and service provision for children and young people.  It comprises a number of interrelated strands including the direct provision of universal and targeted services and working to achieve the harmonisation of relevant policy and provision throughout Government so as to improve outcomes for children, young people and families.</p><p>  Many aspects of the Department&rsquo;s activities reflect purely national competencies and it is only in specific areas that there is more extensive and on-going EU involvement.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs had no EU legislative developments during 2013.  The Department&rsquo;s most significant engagement with the EU over the course of 2013 was in the area of youth affairs and I will give particular attention to this area in my remarks.</p><p>  With regard to EU youth policy developments, the overall aim of the Irish EU Presidency from January to June 2013 was to build on what has been achieved for and with young people under recent Presidencies and result in a sustainable legacy for youth policy and youth work.  To achieve these priorities, Ireland&rsquo;s ambitious programme focussed on the social inclusion of young people, which was the theme of the trio Presidency with Lithuania and Greece from January 2013 to June 2014.  Ireland&rsquo;s particular priorities related to the contribution of quality youth work to young people&rsquo;s development, well-being and social inclusion and the potential contribution of youth work to youth employment.</p><p>  At the meeting chaired by the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, as part of the Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council on 16 May 2013, Ministers were asked in the policy debate to address questions on Europe&rsquo;s young people and what quality youth work can contribute to addressing current challenges.  Furthermore the conclusions adopted by the May Council proposed actions which will maximise the potential of youth policy in addressing the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy.  A second set of conclusions, also adopted, highlight the importance of quality youth work as a tool for engagement with, and development of, young people and as a means to their social inclusion.</p><p>  These conclusions include a concrete set of measures aimed at raising the profile of youth work at EU level and mainstreaming youth work into broader EU policy responses to youth employment and social inclusion.</p> <p>These include establishing a new EU expert group on quality youth work; recognition of the centrality of youth work in contributing to the Europe 2020 growth and jobs agenda and in the implementation of the youth guarantee; strengthening the working relationship between the Council of Ministers and other Council of Minister configurations to ensure a youth policy perspective informs the formulation of policies that are relevant to young people; and working towards greater co-ordination between EU youth policy and education, training and employment policies.</p><p> As a follow-up to these conclusions, in June 2013, a two day informal expert round table considered the contribution of youth work to youth employment.  The then Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, chose that theme as being highly relevant to Europe and to Ireland.  The outcome of the meeting, the Dublin Declaration, recognises the challenges facing young people in Europe as a result of the lack of jobs and work experience, as well as the challenges posed by the widening gap between skills being sought by certain employers and those held by young prospective employees.  It recognises that youth work can play a highly relevant role in developing young people's skill sets, in particular with respect to so-called soft skills such as learning to learn, social and civic competence, leadership, communication, teamwork and entrepreneurship, all of which are highly valued and sought after by employers.  The declaration in particular notes the importance of the role of quality youth work in the implementation of the youth guarantee by member states.</p><p> The EU Youth Conference hosted in Dublin on 11 and 12 March 2013 was a flagship event of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency programme.  Almost 200 people from across the EU attended the conference, including 109 young people and youth representatives and 65 Ministry officials participating in workshops.  The conference was organised by the Department in partnership with the National Youth Council of Ireland.  It was a major opportunity to showcase the talent and innovation of Ireland&rsquo;s young people and the youth sector.  Almost 100 young people were involved in supporting the conference.  They acted as volunteers and took on roles as guest MCs and speakers, and provided inputs through arts and drama presentations.  Over the three days, some 25 information stands showcased to European colleagues the work under way in youth programmes in communities throughout the country.</p><p> The Department has a very strong record in promoting children and young people&rsquo;s participation, including through Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g and more recently through the structured dialogue process.  The prominence and quality of young people&rsquo;s involvement in the conference was the subject of much favourable comment and I have no doubt will influence the approach taken under subsequent EU youth presidencies.</p><p> As an associated Presidency event, the Department supported a conference on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, youth and social inclusion which was held in Croke Park on 17 June 2013.  This event, which was organised by BeLonG To Youth Service, brought together the main EU institutions and LGBT groups from Europe to discuss LGBT youth and education, employment, participation and rights, and youth services.  The conference was developed following findings from a Europe-wide consultation under the Irish Presidency which identified LGBT youth as one of the most socially excluded groups in Europe. </p><p> Building on the outcomes of the Irish EU Presidency, in particular the outcomes of the expert round table on youth work&rsquo;s contribution to youth employment, the Department, with the support of the Centre for Effective Services, instituted a mapping exercise to categorise and comment on the Irish youth work response to youth employment.  The report, which is being finalised, shows that some 62,300 young people were engaged in youth employment or employability type initiatives in 2013 ranging from prevention and early intervention, mainstream youth work, targeted interventions to work related programmes.</p><p> The Department is following up with the youth sector to explore additional means of supporting proven youth work initiatives that increase the employability of marginalised young people in the 15 to 24 age group.  The potential to access European Social Fund, ESF, funding to support such initiatives is being pursued by the Department in conjunction with other relevant Departments.  That forms one component of the ongoing work of the Department with other key Departments in respect of the youth guarantee and tackling youth unemployment.</p><p> A new group was established by the European Commission in 2013 entitled the Informal Expert Group on the Rights of the Child.  It held its first meeting in April 2013, its second in July and its third in October.  The Department represents Ireland on the group.  The group provides an opportunity to share good practice among member states.  The group is chaired by Ms Margaret Tuite, the European Commission&rsquo;s co-ordinator on children&rsquo;s rights both within the Commission and in its dealings with external bodies and member states.  The main purpose of the group is to enable the Commission to assist member states in addressing the EU agenda for the rights of the child which was approved by the European Parliament and European Council in 2013.</p><p> I reiterate my thanks to the committee for its invitation.  Work is continuing on the Department&rsquo;s EU related activities and I will be happy to provide further information to the committee on any of these areas.</p></speech>

I hope Mr. Breslin will convey my good wishes to Deputy Fitzgerald on her appointment as Minister for Justice and Equality.  While that is a very exciting challenge for her, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will greatly miss her stewardship and her natural understanding of and passion for the issues involved, which she has demonstrated over the past three years.  She has been an excellent first holder of that portfolio in Cabinet.  I wish her well in her new responsibilities.  I wish the new Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Charles Flanagan, well in his new position.</p><p>  I do not intend to go into this review in any significant detail.  I thank Dr. McLoughlin for his presentation.  What is the status of the first reading agreement on protecting citizens from serious cross-border health threats, such as pandemics and other serious risks?  I want to know because I live in a border area.  First reading implies commencement of a process.  If the information is not immediately available I will fully understand, but if possible can Dr. McLoughlin indicate where it is now?  What will the timeframe be for the full implementation of the intended regulation?  Perhaps it is in place but the presentation we heard does not suggest that.</p><p>  Dr. McLoughlin recognised the Minister's personal commitment to the development of the general approach to the directive on tobacco products in the Council in June 2013.  It is also fair to acknowledge that significant work was done by the Department's efforts and those of the Secretary General.  Political voices require the shared commitment at least of officers of the respective Departments.  This is an area of shared concern and intent so I say well done across the board.  I would be interested to hear any further comment on this directive.</p> <p>We are still addressing issues here regarding plain packaging, which is an outworking of that commitment.  I would welcome further elaboration on this.</p><p> Did the March 2013 meeting of the 22 Ministers who discussed, among a number of other issues, children with complex developmental needs, including autism, produce a report, paper or conclusions?  Many members of this committee are very interested in the area of developmental need in children and are anxious to have access to information that might be shared from the engagement.  Is it possible to indicate if there is even an executive summary of the key areas of consideration?  My colleague members of the committee and I would very much welcome it.</p><p> In May 2013, the European Commission director general for research and innovation hosted a high level expert conference on brain research and health care which marked EU month of the brain.  I am particularly interested in deep brain stimulation, DBS.  Was it part of the focus and address of the conference?  DBS procedures are not available on the island of Ireland and we should not be surprised that several dozen people, North and South, have to leave this island annually for access to a developed DBS procedure.  Has it been addressed?  Is there anything the witnesses could add to it?  This committee hopes to explore the prospects of opening up opportunities to access DBS on this island.</p><p> In the conclusions from the meeting chaired by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, on 16 May 2013, the second bullet point refers to the implementation of the youth guarantee.  Mr. Breslin referred to it again in his address.  Could he give us an update on where we are in the full implementation of the youth guarantee, a very important measure which I would like to be fully implemented?</p></speech>

At the launch of the strategy, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, I realised all that has been accomplished in the past three years.  It is a testament to the Minister and all the individuals in the Department.  I have no doubt that Deputy Charles Flanagan will continue this work.  I had the pleasure of lobbying him several times when I was working for the Children's Rights Alliance.  I also lobbied Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.

I echo what Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said about the youth guarantee and would like to know more about what are proven youth work initiatives, because this is a new area.  I am concerned about children's rights that cross into the area of justice.  Although we are supposed to receive these reports six weeks after the date, we receive them significantly later and I wonder about their usefulness.  While they are interesting, they update us and we can further issues, we should consider having pre-Council scrutiny.  It would make much more sense for all our time and would be much more effective.  If we are serious about EU scrutiny, we should consider pre-Council scrutiny meetings.</p></speech>

The purpose of the meeting is to engage in a discussion on EU energy policy with Mr. Eric Mamer, deputy head of cabinet in the office of Mr. G&uuml;nther Oettinger, the EU Commissioner for Energy.  The meeting has been arranged as part of Europe Week in the Oireachtas as a means of greater promotion of and engagement with European affairs.  A meeting on the topic of European energy policy is particularly pertinent given the committee's proposal to undertake a series of meetings on the possibilities for renewable energy in Ireland.  It would be very helpful to place that discussion in an EU context.<br />On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Eric Mamer.  I draw the attention of those attending to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, they are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on our website after the meeting.<br />Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I ask Mr. Mamer to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

I am delighted to be invited here to present to the committee on European energy policy and, in particular, discuss the links between European energy policy and the Irish context.  In view of the time available, I will keep my statement short to leave as much room as possible for debate with the honourable members.</p><p>  In the invitation the committee sent me, the central issue referred to was the 2030 framework for energy and climate policies.  It is indeed topical since the Commission adopted a very important communication on the issue on 22 January 2014, which was only a short time ago.  The objective of the Commission's communication was to set out for discussion by heads of state and government, the European Parliament, national authorities and parliaments what we consider to be the proper strategy to adopt beyond 2020 looking forward to 2030 in terms of climate and energy policy.  Members will remember that in 2008, heads of state and government set a framework for 2020.</p> <p>It set out three targets, one for a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of 20% compared with 1990, one for the share of renewable energy in European consumption also of 20%; and one for energy efficiency gains compared with a baseline also of 20%.  We have now started to gather experience on how policies put in place to reach these targets are functioning and to draw the lessons from that so as to be able to set out the proper framework for 2030.</p><p> Hence, following intense discussions in the Commission, the proposal is instead of three targets which are more or less at the same level to have one overriding central target which is greenhouse emission reductions.  There the Commission believes that the most efficient scenario in line with reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% in 2050 is to set the target for 2030 at a 40% reduction compared with 1990 levels.</p><p> From that central objectives derive the objectives or targets for the other two areas, or derives an objective for renewable energy.  There the Commission proposed to have a target at the level of the European Union of a 27% share of renewable energy in energy consumption.  On energy efficiency, for the moment we have not yet set a policy as to whether we should have a target or measures, or a combination of both.  However, the communication clearly states that on a path to a 40% emissions reduction we would need to have gains of 20% when it comes to energy efficiency.</p><p> These are the kinds of headline figures that are now at the centre of the debate.  The member states' parliaments now need to discuss whether this is the appropriate level of ambition and whether this is the appropriate way of going about it because there are significant differences compared with the existing framework to 2020.  The central one is that whereas for greenhouse gas emissions we will propose to have binding targets at national level, for renewable energy we will no longer propose to set national targets.  We want to see what targets, plans and objectives member states are setting for themselves and adding all those up we wish to reach the 27% renewable energy directive target.</p><p> This means that if some member states are very ambitious, others may need to make less of an effort.  This recognises that there have been certain difficulties with the current framework.  This is because setting a fixed objective by member states for the development of renewable energy has in some instances led to support schemes that are seen as more costly than what could have been achieved based only on strategies that aim at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  This is because we have the ETS market that actually trades these carbon certificates which obviously act as an incentive to produce less CO2 and therefore produce greener electricity, greener heating, etc., which is seen as a natural driver for the increase in renewable energy.</p><p> The idea is to focus our attention on greenhouse gas emissions and the rest will be organised in such a way as to reach that central objective.  However, why have we said that we need to have at least an EU-level objective for renewable energy?  It is because, as the members are very well placed to know, energy is an infrastructure-led business that needs to be organised and planned in particular when it comes to investment.  Therefore we cannot leave market actors completely in the dark when it comes to investments that need to be made now for infrastructure that will still be operating in 2030 and beyond.  They need to have a clear view of where the European Union is going when it comes to the type of energy that is produced in Europe and hence the 27% renewable energy objective.  Why is this set at 27%?  It is because in our scenarios 27% is regarded as optimal level of renewable energy required in order to reach the 40% reduction.</p><p> Let me add a few words on the other two objectives that are at the forefront of our thinking when it comes to defining the framework for 2030.  The first is competitiveness.  There have been many complaints from industry and certain quarters of society as to the cost incurred in moving towards this decarbonisation of the European economy and society.  Developments outside Europe show that whatever we do there can be developments that lead to an increase in the competitiveness gap between Europe and the rest of the world.  This is the whole issue of US shale gas and the effects it is having on US competitiveness and therefore also on investment decisions that are made in favour of sites located in the US to the detriment of European industry.</p><p> The second consideration at the forefront of our minds, in particular given the crisis in Ukraine, is security of supply.  This is also particularly relevant for Ireland, which is at the top of the league table when it comes to external energy dependency.  Having a framework in place that promotes the development of indigenous energy resources can help reduce energy dependency.  This is at a time when Europe's own oil and gas resources are progressively declining leaving us increasingly dependent on external energy sources of oil and gas, as we see at the moment in Ukraine, for example, where we can become hostage to geopolitical developments that are largely outside of our control.  Developing a policy that allows us at the same time to reduce the energy intensity of our economy and our society and develop our own indigenous energy resources is very positive and needs to be supported.</p><p> Another advantage is that it can lead to a shift in expenditure from imports - we spend &euro;1 billion every day on energy imports - to investments.  While these investments are often frontloaded and seem expensive at the beginning, in the long run they can lead to significant savings.  This is the sort of general philosophy of the framework we have set out.  In March the European Council welcomed the Commission's proposal and has set October as a deadline to come to an agreement on the main characteristics of the framework.</p><p> I will stop there and I would be very happy to answer members' questions.</p></speech>

Could the target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 and the required contribution of the various sectors to do that cause a conflict?  Solving one problem may cause another.  For instance, it would have an impact on agriculture in Ireland where there is a need for food security and increasing food production.</p> <p>Could this have a negative effect on development or on maximising the potential for agriculture in Ireland?  The need to protect the environment must also be considered, as must the cost of renewable energy to replace the reduction in carbon use.  I am sure Mr. Mamer is aware of the significant controversy here currently about wind farms, the height of pylons and whether to put cables under or over ground and the effect the proposed development would have on the environment if it goes ahead as proposed.</p><p> Mr. Mamer mentioned the current situation in Ukraine and the Russian supply of gas, and spoke about the need for a long-term structure to avoid the dangers in that regard.  Will he outline the danger that exists if the gas is switched off in the morning?  What would the implications be for Europe and for Ireland?  </p><p> Mr. Mamer also gave the figures for the targets.  How does Ireland rate compared to other European countries in regard to meeting its targets for the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-05-08a.570" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eric Mamer" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014050800005#D00200"><p>Let me start with the last question first.  I understand that Ireland is doing very well when it comes to the target on renewable energy and has overshot the first intermediary target which was set at 5.6% of renewable energy.  Ireland has a very ambitious target for renewable energy by 2020, of 16% of consumption, starting from quite a low base.  The road ahead poses significant challenges and will require significant investment, but for the moment the path seems to be positive.</p><p>  It is slightly less so when it comes to meeting the target on greenhouse gas emission reductions, particularly in areas outside of the emissions trading system, ETS sector, namely, in all areas not linked to energy production and industry.  Projections up to 2020 show that Ireland will have a slight reduction compared to the base line, but not as much of a reduction as required to meet the target.  Ireland is not alone in this predicament.  Approximately half of the member states are in this situation, based on the latest data available.  This shows the difficulty in terms of organising the whole system in such a way that it produces the required results</p><p>  In regard to the role of agriculture, it is clear this is a sensitive issue, particularly for Ireland.  Agriculture is probably the most difficult area across the board when it comes to determining the requirements needed in the agriculture area and what agriculture can bring to the overall reduction in emissions.  According to the data I have, the agricultural sector would have to reduce its emissions by approximately 25% by 2030 in order to contribute its share to the overall reduction in emissions.  This is a significant contribution, approximately the same reduction as required from the industry sector.  It will take quite an effort to achieve this.</p><p>  I believe the debate will continue over the coming months as to what is required in order for this to happen and how we can take into account the special circumstances of specific countries with a large agricultural sector in the context of this policy and the impact it has on the overall target.  I have not come here with a solution, but have come to make a clear statement that we are fully aware of the centrality of this theme when it comes to the discussion with Ireland.  I am sure that in the coming weeks - as there will now be a series of meetings with Irish representatives and the European institutions - the subject will be thoroughly debated.</p><p>  On the pros and cons of renewable energy, let me make it clear that the debate on pylons is not limited to Ireland.  The country my Commissioner knows best, Germany, is also in the middle of a lively debate regarding the transmission lines that will be required from the North Sea, where there is the best potential for offshore winds, to the main consumption centres in the south of Germany where the big industrial companies operate.  There is heated debate there on the requirement to build these transmission lines, with some constituencies, such as Bavaria, saying they do not want wind energy from the north, but want to produce their own energy.</p><p>  My Commissioner's view on this is very clear.  We need to have both decentralised and centralised energy production and the relevant grids that go with them, in particular in countries that have a significant share of industry.  However, if we do not have transmission lines, every region must be autocratic when it comes to energy production, but that will not work on the European scale.  This does not mean there is no space for local energy production.  This is something we promote, particularly when it comes to heating or photovoltaic panels on roofs in regions with a favourable environment.  There must be a rational effort to ensure we produce renewable energy where it is available and competitive in the medium term and then bring it to the consumption centres.</p><p>  That said, we also recognise that the voice of local communities must be heard.  This is foreseen in Ireland's national legislation and in the European legislation.  We believe debate must take place in a national context in order to determine the best choice for the country, because there is no one size fits all solution for this.  In certain cases, it is a question of money, particularly in the context of deciding whether a country is willing to invest the extra funds required in order to bury the lines.  In some instances this is not a technical possibility and in some there may be different ways of organising energy production so as to avoid it.</p><p>  We do not have a standard answer.  We recognise the difficulty of the issue, but we also say that if we are serious about large scale production at European level, it is clear we are going to have to use the renewable energy potential where it is.  When we look at the map of Europe, we see this is in part on the outer rim or offshore, off the shores of Ireland, Germany, the UK, France, Spain, etc., while consumption is very much inland.  Therefore, we have to organise the flow, particularly when it comes to energy.</p><p>  In regard to the crisis in Ukraine and the implications for the European Union and Ireland, even in the coldest moments of the Cold War, Russian gas continued to flow to Europe.  Therefore, we are working on the basis that the Russian Federation will do everything it can to remain the reliable partner it has been when it comes to delivery of energy to Europe.  For the moment, despite all the difficulties in Ukraine, there has been no interruption of gas flow to Europe.  However, we believe we need to be prepared.  Since the last crisis in 2009, when there was some impact on some member states, we have been doing considerable work to reinforce interconnection in Europe so as to allow gas to flow, not just from the east to the west, but from the west to the east.</p> <p>Six of our most vulnerable member states depend 100% on Russian gas.  As a result, they require access to new sources of gas.  This can only happen if the pipelines we have in place allow for the transfer of gas - be it liquified natural gas, LNG, or Russian gas that has been sold to Germany or Poland and then transferred on to the south east of Europe or the Baltics - from west to east.</p><p> I am less knowledgeable with regard to from where Ireland gets its gas.  I believe, however, that it may come in part from Norway and that some of it takes the form of LNG.</p></speech>

I am Deputy Michael Colreavy and I am a member of Sinn F&eacute;in, which is one of the Opposition parties.  I represent a small constituency, Sligo-Leitrim, in the north west.  The constituency will soon comprise Sligo, Leitrim and parts of Donegal and Cavan, all of which are under the most immediate threat from fracking.  If they have time at some point, I would love our guests to visit the region to witness its beauty.  When they see it, they might well ask why it is being considered as suitable for fracking.  I hope Mr. Mamer and Mr Claridge will take up my invitation because they would be most welcome.</p><p>  It sometimes seems that there is a disconnect between the EU's stated strategy and the decisions and actions taken by the Commission and individual member states.  In that context, let us consider the position with regard to climate change targets.  If only 25% of the oil and gas resources that have been identified were to be extracted and used, we would breach the targets we have set in respect of climate change.  Despite this, exploration companies are being paid to seek out new sources of gas and oil.  Climate change is not just a European problem, it is a global one.  As a result, worldwide action is required.  I am of the view that the EU could be a leader in the context of ensuring that such action is taken.  If we are seriously concerned about the welfare of future generations, there must be a more logical link between the targets set by the EU and individual member states and the actions and choices we make.  The nub of the problem is not potential sources of supply, rather it relates to distribution and control of costs.  I do not believe we are making sufficient efforts at present, particularly in the context of non-renewable sources.  I would appreciate our guests' opinions on that matter.  The EU has a responsibility to the citizens of its member states to control the costs they must bear in the context of energy prices.</p><p>  The second question I wish to ask is similar, but not identical, to that posed by the Chairman.  Ireland is considered critical, from a clean, green perspective, in terms of its contribution - both within the EU and on a worldwide basis - to food security.  We are extremely proud of that fact.  Is it wise for the authorities here to even consider allowing hydraulic fracturing to proceed, particularly if there is a chance that it might threaten the reputation of our agrifood business?  We spent years building up that reputation and, as already stated, our agrifood sector is critical to food security throughout Europe and across the globe.  No one would seriously consider allowing fracking on the Amalfi Coast, particularly as fracking would lead to it becoming an industrial wasteland.  The area in which I reside is Ireland's Amalfi Coast but, unfortunately, without the sunshine and with a bit more rain.  However, we have nice green grass there.</p><p>  I understand the EU Commission recently signed a comprehensive trade agreement.  It may be an unintended consequence but that agreement appears to make it easier for energy companies to take legal action against countries which seek to protect their citizens and environmental rights from potentially damaging oil and gas extraction.  One company has already taken action against a state in Canada which was seeking to protect citizens' rights.  Was the EU Commission aware of that risk when the trade agreement was signed?  If, as appears to be the case, that risk is real, is there any scope for the EU to close the loophole in the agreement even though it may have already been signed?</p><p>  On greenhouse gas emissions, one of the reasons Ireland has a good reputation for food is because cattle here are fed on grass.  We should not be penalised for doing what we do well.  We should be penalised if we make bad choices and decisions but we should not be penalised for rearing grass-fed cattle which are much sought after throughout the EU and the rest of the world.</p></speech>

On fracking, the exploitation of shale gas, shale oil, etc., I wish to make it crystal clear that the treaty foresees that it is a prerogative of member states to decide what sources of energy they wish to exploit or not exploit.  It is, therefore, absolutely not in the power of the Commission to inform a member state that it either must or must not exploit shale gas.  There are two European countries - France and Bulgaria - which have permanent bans in place in respect of any sort of fracking.  The Commission is not really in a position to answer questions on this matter.  In view of the fact that different member states have different attitudes to the opportunities presented by the exploitation of shale gas, the Commission made a recommendation to member states - on the same day on which it adopted the 2030 communication - on what it believes to be best practice when it comes to the overall environmental assessment of possible shale gas and oil exploration and exploitation.  I should actually refer to the possible use of fracking technology because it is that on which the recommendation focuses in addition to what should be done when specific projects are considered in terms of environmental impact assessment, the provision of information to the public on the sorts of chemicals that might be used, risk assessment, etc.</p><p>  It is clear that this is a matter for national debate.  We are not at all saying that shale gas is the solution to Europe's problems.  The Commissioner for Energy has stated that in view of declining North Sea reserves and the EU's increasing dependency on energy - particularly gas - from external sources, there is scope for well-managed demonstration projects in areas where there is acceptance for such projects among the locals in order to determine the both the potential of shale gas and the conditions under which it might be exploited at a later stage.</p> <p>We are not in the business of telling member states whether they should go for nuclear energy, shale gas, etc., and this should be an entirely Irish discussion.</p><p> There is an issue of EU responsibility for control and distribution of costs.  On the same day we adopted the framework, we also adopted the first ever report on the price or cost of energy in Europe, based on the best available data at our disposal, both for households and for industry.  We considered the energy component, transmission and distribution costs and taxes.  I invite committee members to read the report as it demonstrates clearly that apart from gas for industry, where there is a link between declining consumption and declining costs, for electricity in households and industry, as well as gas for households, consumption has stayed relatively flat but costs have been increasing.  That is not because the energy component is more costly but a result of transmission and distribution costs, as well as related investments.  In certain instances, taxes have increased.  We have put these findings squarely in front of national governments at the Council-----</p></speech>

In the long run that will lead to better controlled costs for industry and citizens.</p><p>  Another question concerned the comprehensive trade agreement with Canada but I admit I am not a specialist in trade questions.

In reviewing the current targets to 2020, how much of an improvement has come about as a result of the slower economic activity throughout the European Union, as well as technological advances?  I refer particularly to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, more renewable energy use and energy efficiency.  How is better technology helping this issue?  Do the witnesses have an opinion on the cost of investments?  Is there a good return on investments in those areas?</p><p>  With regard to the strategy to 2030, binding targets have been set to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and non-binding objectives have been set for renewable energy.  That places Ireland at somewhat of a disadvantage, particularly when considering the effect of binding targets for greenhouse gas emissions in the agricultural sector.  That sector will have the greatest difficulty in trying to achieve targets of reductions of up to 20%.  In other countries in the European Union, a greater proportion of greenhouse gas emissions may emanate from energy and transport, and they can be dealt with more easily through greater use of technology and investment from Horizon 2020 European funding, for example.  In agriculture it would not be that easy to achieve that target.  Is there any conflict between the EU Commissioner for Energy and the Commissioner responsible for agriculture in this respect?</p><p>  The figure of &euro;1 billion per day has been mentioned for the importing of energy to the European Union, and Ireland would be at the top of the list of importing countries because it is vulnerable to shocks.  We require greater investment in renewables, energy efficiency and a reduction in emissions.  Ireland will be one of the more difficult countries in which to achieve those goals.</p></speech>

It is logical to set targets.  Renewable energy is self-explanatory and although fossil fuels will not disappear in this or the next generation, I would like to think we can plan for the future.  It was indicated that it is no longer proposed to set member state targets but if something is not mandatory, people may not put in the same effort.  Are there any provisions in place if member states do not commit fully to this process?  What if everybody decides not to bother?</p><p>  The Chairman mentioned wind turbines and pylons.  Unlike Deputy Colreavy, there are no proposals for fracking in my area but there is a proposal for 400 kV lines and wind turbines two to three times as high as any we have yet seen in the country.  Many members of the public are against this but what is the European opinion on this?  The figure was mentioned of &euro;1 billion per day spent on energy imports.  Does that relate mainly to renewable or non-renewable energy?  If Ireland is to reach the 2020 targets, will we see much of a saving in that cost?  Will the money to be spent on infrastructure cancel out such savings in the long run?</p></speech>

There is no doubt that the energy area is complex, stretching across other sectors that not only make up our economy, but even our society.  I will touch on points raised by other Deputies by referring to the setting of targets, and particularly non-binding targets on member states.  Rather than having non-binding targets, it may be better to set realistic targets which could be really achieved, rather than setting them so high as to cause much debate or deliberation, meaning the issue must be constantly revisited.  Perhaps we could lower the targets slightly to achieve a realistic aim.  With regard to pylons, there is a significant-----</p></speech>

They think this is the preserve of big energy companies and big developers who are coming in and cannibalising their environment for big profits.  That is where the argument about the infrastructure is being lost.  Individuals in their own homes do not make the connection between turning on the light switch and where the energy comes from.  They think there is somebody off in the distance making a big profit from this at their expense.  I am not sure how we get that across the line.  </p><p> I also ask the witnesses to give their opinion on the nuclear industry in the context of climate change.  Apparently nuclear power is now being viewed as one of the quickest, most efficient ways of reducing our emissions.</p></speech>

In terms of new technologies, these will be required if we are to reach our objectives, particularly in the area of energy storage.  There cannot be vast amounts of renewable electricity if there is no storage system to balance out the intermittency.  We have research programmes that are looking into this area as well as into new generation technologies.  Marine power in particular is an area where Ireland will certainly have a role to play.</p><p>  The setting of realistic targets for member states is a central issue.  We are not in the business, I hope, of setting unrealistic targets.  We believe that a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a 20% increase in renewable energy can be achieved if we make the proper investments.  There is a clear link between the level of ambition one sets and the level of investment.  Had we not set such targets, it would be a free for all.  If what member states propose does not add up to the ambition level then the Commission will reserve the right to step in and negotiate with the member states in order to have them set targets which are compatible with the EU-level objectives.  </p><p>  On nuclear energy, as with fracking, the Commission does not decide; member states make those decisions for themselves.  About half the European Union is in the business of nuclear energy with the other half not involved.  It is clear that in certain countries like the UK and France it is seen as a major source of low carbon energy and those countries are pushing forward with that.  We just want to make sure that it takes place in the best possible conditions.</p><p>  Deputy McEntee asked about the &euro;1 billion spent per day and that is mainly for oil, gas, coal and so forth.  Renewable energy up until now has mainly been produced and consumed locally.  This issue is very well known in Ireland in the context of the midlands project, for example.  On the EU's role in terms of public acceptance, it is a very difficult debate.  Some citizens are really starting to feel the pinch, as we saw in the UK over last winter and as we see in southern parts of Europe which are experiencing more and more droughts.  It is a question of how we collectively, that is member states and the Commission, can make the clearest possible argument on the long term consequences.  I agree that it is a very difficult debate to conduct in the midst of a deep economic crisis when peoples' attention is focused on other matters. </p></speech>

If Mr. Mamer wishes to send on further details to the committee, he is welcome to do so.  This committee will be preparing further reports on the issue of energy and will probably have further contacts with the Commission in the future.  I thank Mr. Mamer and his officials for being with us today.  We have had a very engaging and informative debate.</p></speech>
