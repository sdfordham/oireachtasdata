I thank them for coming to brief the joint committee on farm management information technology systems and hope we did not delay them for too long.  As this is our first meeting since the summer break, we had to get some private business out of the way.</p><p>  Before we begin, I have to notify our guests of the fact that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Mr. Lynch to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-18a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Lynch" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012091800003#F00300"><p>We thank the joint committee for giving of its time.  We hope to be able to give it a good idea of the issues arising in this area.  We submitted some of our documentation in advance of the meeting.  </p><p>  I will give some background information on the two companies.  Kingswood Computing, which was founded by Mr. Gerry Lynskey in 1987, was the first company to sell farm management software to Irish farmers.  Our company - Irish Farm Computers, which trades as AgriNet - was founded in 1994.  The two companies have sold their products to between 70,000 and 80,000 farms in that period.  Many of the larger commercial farms in Ireland use farm management software from one of the two companies.  We are involved in every aspect of farm management data and record-keeping, including financial, animal, grassland, tillage and sheep records.  We do everything one can think of in relation to what a farmer does on a personal computer when he or she is recording and managing data.  Both companies have started to export in recent years and have good client bases in the United Kingdom and further afield.  We are confident that there will be further expansion in that direction.</p><p>  I would like to speak about the biggest challenge we face.  This is a significant meeting for us because it allows us to highlight the problems caused by the efforts of the State to supply all information technology systems to farms and into agriculture.  In the past five or ten years the number of services provided by the State has increased significantly.   Everything we have been doing is now being done or will be done by the State.  That is why we are here.  As the title of our presentation suggests, we need to ensure the balance between the public and private sectors in the farm information technology sector is right.  We do not think it is balanced.  We are keen to explain that we are working in a toxic environment and want to know whether the committee is interested in redressing the balance.  That is the objective of our attendance at this meeting.</p><p>  I will refer briefly to the two slides being displayed.  The first sets out the reasons we think this is a problem.  If a solution can be brought to bear in this case, it will save money for the public.  Given that our companies have been doing a fine job for many years - thousands of farmers have availed of our services - why does the State think it needs to get involved in this area now?  Obviously, it costs the State money to provide the service we have been providing.  Therefore, there will be a saving to the State if it no longer provides the service.  The smaller the number of services provided by the State, the fewer expenses it will incur.  We can do it.  We have proved in the past that we can do it and we will do it into the future.</p><p>  We need to protect sustainable jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises.  We estimate that between 22 and 25 jobs have been lost across the two companies in the past ten years.  This is a small area.  One might ask what the big deal is when one is talking about two small companies and not that many jobs.  We provide services for the top commercial farms in the country.  The question of how the State is working in this area is hugely significant.  Information technology and data play a major role in the Food Harvest 2020 vision of how agriculture can push ahead with increased production.  The database system - how data are stored, managed and used - represents a massive part of the industry.  Even though both companies are small, we are working in a significant area of the agricultural world.  Farmers are trying to push ahead to have a 50% production figure here, there and everywhere in the next eight or nine years.  Information technology and data management will play a huge part in that regard.</p><p>  The next aspect of this issue I would like to mention is the need to support export-based jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises.  We are confident that the two companies can build on the nice base we have developed abroad in the last couple of years.  However, we cannot continue in the absence of a home market.  The export aspect is very exciting for us because there is great potential in other countries.  As we have developed overseas, we have realised that more can be achieved.  We would like to make it clear that there was no market failure in terms of farmers using software.  We can produce figures that support the logic we are using when we say this.  There is no reason for the State to do something we have been doing and we have been providing a significant solution.</p><p>  The taking of risks by the private sector is a big issue for us.  We use the word "innovation" regularly in this context.  Our business is all about innovation.  If we invest money in the creation of innovative products, it does not make sense for the taxpayer to fund the provision of the same innovative products by the State sector.  It is neither sustainable nor practical.  </p><p>  Intellectual property is another interesting aspect of this matter.  All of our property is intellectual property.  We do not have land or cows.  We have nothing that can be touched, but we do have connections with our clients and intellectual property.  It is an interesting point from the perspective of the smart economy and the knowledge economy.  We think the intellectual property of our software is of value, but it does not seem to be of any value in the eyes of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>  Competition is the bedrock of what we do.  The two companies have been competing vigorously against each other since AgriNet entered the marketplace in 1995.  Kingswood Computing had been the only company in the market before then.  Both companies have now entered the UK market in which they are competing against each other.</p></speech>

A lot of things just do not make sense.  Mr. Lynch says the two companies have 9,000 customers between them.  I am somewhat familiar with software houses and know it is not just a question of giving a package to somebody to plug into a machine and away they go.  There are maintenance and support calls after that.  Who is doing that for the customers of the product not produced by the companies?</p><p>  I have major question marks over intellectual property, which Mr. Lynch addressed in some way.  Did the companies go through a process of safeguarding the product before they got involved in working with the Department?  I would like to know a little bit more about the level of integration between the companies' products and the national database because I am struggling to see benefits to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine beyond the creation of a national database or using data to check on which payments are going to the companies' customers.  Perhaps we will start with those three questions because they are the areas that are most puzzling to me.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-18a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1125" speakername="Pat O'Neill" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012091800004#G00700"><p>If one goes to page six of the other document supplied by the delegation on getting the public-private balance right, it is interesting to see what services were provided in 2000 and that in 2009, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Teagasc provided some of these services.</p><p>  In respect of innovation, we all know computers and software are evolving, especially with things like smartphones. Skimming through the document, I see here that the companies are developing an app that would be of benefit to agribusiness. If a farmer goes out, takes a cow in heat or a cow is calved, if one is able to register it on a smartphone immediately, it will be done.  So the companies are evolving, moving on and progressing.  </p><p>  Representatives from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are not here to answer our questions.  Is the Department just copying and piggybacking on the companies?  Surely if the companies develop an app or other product, they would have had a patent on it so that the Department could not use the companies' software?  If the Department is covering some of the same things as the companies, is it the same system or has it developed it itself?  Are people in the Department developing new software for<i> agfood.ie</i>?  </p></speech>

I am not a member of the committee but I was watching the proceedings in my room and I wanted to come down because I have met Mr. Lynch and Mr. Lynskey before in connection with this issue.  I must confess that I have a small company that develops small pieces of bespoke software on occasions so I completely understand the difficulties that the delegation currently face.  It is a cost-driven business.  It means taking risks and innovation and I am a bit perplexed to see a Government agency enter when there is no evidence of market failure and when it seems to fly in the face of European Union competition rules.  Like Senator O'Neill, I think it would help if we heard something from the Department or Teagasc as to why they feel there is a need to enter the market.  I will leave it at that.  I have another meeting but I did want to attend and, as I have said, I have met the gentlemen before and I think this is worthy of further consideration.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-18a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/949" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012091800004#G01000"><p>In respect of data sharing, can the delegation confirm that the Department will not come back to us with the line that it has concerns over the information being held?  Could the delegation provide us with confirmation of that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-18a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Lynskey" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012091800004#G01100"><p>Two of the questions pertain to the issue of patents and intellectual property.  It is notoriously difficult to get formal patents in the software world, particularly if one is in the area of business management, which is essentially what we are in.  We are effectively being used as marketing guinea pigs by the State bodies.  We try out literally hundreds of things between the two companies, ranging from tweaks to existing programmes to major innovations.  Some of them run and some of them do not.  In any business, one has to keep trying.  What happens is that the things that do run and that would in the normal course of business events make money for us are seized on by the State bodies and it is a case of "This is a good one - we'll take it".  If we were not around, they would have to do expensive market research in order to do that.  </p><p>  On the question of data sharing, we have a track record going back the best part of two decades of taking data from official bodies and sending data back to them.  We have worked closely with the Department, Teagasc and the ICBF in terms of exchanging data, ironically enough, even though we are, in effect, complaining about them in another role.  Our track record on that has been one of responsible companies that tried to provide an optimum service for our customers at minimum price and, at the same time, work closely with external bodies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-18a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1083" speakername="Michael Colreavy" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012091800005#H00200"><p>I can understand why the Department would need a national database because of its role of oversight and can understand why it would need to take data from the farm assist programme in order to help it process payments or whatever else it has to do.  However, I do not see how it could be to the Department's benefit to develop its own software to do all this work, licensing the software to farmers and entering into a commitment to support them in this regard.  That is what puzzles me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-18a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Lynskey" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012091800005#H00300"><p>The Department has done a certain amount in that area.  It has offered, free of charge, to do a certain minimal basic analysis for farmers.  However, the main culprits here, if I may use that word, are Teagasc and ICBF.  They have addressed the issues of herd management, grass management and financial management by means of software solutions that are almost identical to those that we supply.  Our core argument is not with the Department as a software supplier but as the agency that licensed these other bodies to supply software.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-18a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1083" speakername="Michael Colreavy" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012091800005#H00400"><p>My next question may be unfair and Mr. Lynskey may not know the answer to it.  Is he aware of any State agencies that have paid for computer specialists to replicate software that is already on the market?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-18a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Lynch" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012091800005#H00500"><p>This is a variation of the question regarding intellectual property.  It is very hard to protect IP in software.  I do not believe anybody in the State has had to reproduce anything.  I would bring this back to functions.  Software has functions and provides answers.  In the section on page 6 we state the functions we used to provide for farmers some ten or 12 years ago when there was no State software of any kind.  That worked extremely well on many commercial farms and we provided a good service.  Fast forward to 2009 and these functions are now being provided by the State.  It need not necessarily look at our screens and copy them; we would never suggest that anything of that kind is happening.  However, the fact is that the State has decided to provide the same function and do the same job.  That is the issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-18a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1083" speakername="Michael Colreavy" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012091800005#H00600"><p>I accept the point in regard to functionality, which is the key.  To Mr. Lynch's knowledge, has the Department brought in paid IT personnel to provide functionality that was already available on the market?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-18a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Lynch" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012091800005#H00700"><p>We are talking about three entities here, namely, the Department, Teagasc and ICBF.  We look at everything that is being done by the Department.  What it does is part of e-government so we do not say that its provision of software is something it should not be doing.  That is what e-government is all about; it is a requirement and is driven by legislation.  A farmer must keep a bovine herd register, register the birth of a calf and note the movements of animals.  That is required under law and if the State decides it will do this through software, that makes sense.  It is logical and is what e-government is all about.  There is no reason that everything the State requires its citizens to do under legislation cannot be done through software systems rather than paperwork.</p><p> The issue becomes difficult for us when one looks at the non-legislative requirements of farmers in managing herds or their business, whether this concerns stock, financial management or grass management.  There is no legislation requiring anybody to do any of this and no legislation requiring any departmental or State funding to be provided in this regard.  It is only at that level that competition exists, in the commercial sphere.  I do not know if that specifically addresses the Deputy's question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-18a.27" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Lynskey" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012091800005#H00800"><p>I will add to that point, if I may.  Ten years ago there was a change in attitude by the Department.  For four years or so prior to that it had co-operated very closely with a number of IT companies, including our two.  There were at least four others around at the time.  At that point the on-farm PC was the main technology in terms of IT.  In 2002 the Department made a decision that with the onset of web-based technology and websites it could go it alone and it did so.  There are arguments regarding technology that would favour that approach but I would argue that ten years ago the state of Irish broadband was such that it did not facilitate this approach and it was premature to spend a lot of money, as the Department did at that time.  We looked at that area and at the idea of supplying a web-based solution, and decided it was not commercially feasible at the time because of the low level of broadband penetration.  The Department went ahead and, over the following four or five years, developed a very sophisticated website which replaced, or perhaps added to, the existing technology, which was based on e-mail links between on-farm PCs and the Department's database.  In a sense, by using different technology it substituted for the type of developments that had been prevalent at the turn of the millennium.</p></speech>

In other words, if the farmer had broadband he or she could log on to the Department website and do business there.  In a sense, the Department forgot about the IT companies.

The more information on agriculture we can gather, the better in respect of progression and statistics, of which I have seen printouts.  Can the witnesses explain the link to the departmental site <i>agfood.ie</i>?  If I register a calf in the morning, whether by sending a postcard or registering online, it is in the system.  If I register it through the witnesses' systems, they must link it to <i>agfood.ie</i>.  Is that correct?  Is all information fed into the system from the farmer automatically linked to <i>agfood.ie</i> or is it only the registration of movement?  What other links exist to <i>agfood.ie</i>?</p></speech>

Since we started in 1994, that was one of our fundamental jobs.  We collected data on farms and considered who consumed the data.  For the first ten years the company was in business, the question for farmers using our software was whether we could link to Teagasc, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the ICBF.  It was a major element of the work we had to do.  We had to collect data on the farms, analyse the data on the farms and help the farmers to manage their business based on the data in our database.  It was essential to send the data down the line to the State.  Data was required by the State, such as animal events for the ICBF records, financial records for Teagasc or legislation, or animal traceability records from the Department.  We implemented it all and did it to a high standard.  It worked quite well for many years.</p></speech>

Historically, the State did the national, central databases and we did the farm front end.  We provided what the farmer needed.  Our software was used on the large commercial farms and medium-sized farms.  We provided software solutions on the farm.  One of our most important jobs on the farm was to feed data into State systems.  Traditionally, the State handled the national database.  It has all gone wrong in recent years when the State decided to handle the national database but also the farm software.  That is where the clash is happening and there is a breakdown.</p><p>  For many years, there was a nice partnership between the State and private sector.  The State dealt with the back-end national databases and the private sector did the hard work on the ground.  For many years in the 1990s and the 2000s, we had to drive to farms with the computer and set it up on the farm.  In those times, no one had computers.  We set it up, checked the Internet connection and made sure the programme worked.  We installed the data, showed the farmers how to use it and explained that they had to feed the data to the Department, Teagasc and the ICBF.  Kingswood Computing Limited has trained people in this technology since 1987, when there were not too many computers in Ireland.  We established information technology on farms and there was a nice balance between public and private, which is reflected in the title of our submission.  We do not think the public sector should be excluded from doing X, Y and Z but we must do A, B and C and we must know where the balance lies.  For many years, there was a good balance.  We got the job done at the farm level and got data in.  It worked well but now it has changed and the State is capable of doing the job and does not have to work with the private sector.  The challenge is how to get the balance back because the current situation is not practical.  Perhaps that addresses the questions members posed.</p></speech>

Our job was to collect data on the farm and send it to the State.  The State can get the other data available and send them back to us.  We work with data on the farm level and we provide management solutions.  We see a clear division between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which is driven by legislation and e-Government, and the commercial side of it, which involves commercial farmers using commercial software.  That is more to do with the ICBF and Teagasc.  There is a clear divide between the two.</p><p>  In terms of exporting software, it is very difficult for us to figure out what to do when there is such focus on State services in the Republic of Ireland moving into this area.  Moving onto page 7 of our document, we have been talking to the people in Teagasc, the ICBF and the Department for years.  Two or three years ago, we asked them what they wanted us to do.  We could see the pressure coming from the State for years and we wanted to know where they saw us fitting into this scenario.  One of the paragraphs I wonder about is the second last paragraph on page 7.  The Department represented Teagasc and the ICBF.  We asked about the limitations and the Department's reply was that, in respect of imposing limitations on the services provided by the Department, Teagasc and the ICBF, the Department did not believe it would be in the best interests of Irish farmers and the agriculture sector to enter into any agreement that would limit innovations by the three organisations.</p><p>  We must consider where we work in an environment such as that.  Does everything connected with ICT, software and farming belong to the State?  Does this mean that we should not do it anymore, even though we used to do it?  Both companies are investing at the moment as we are reluctant to give up.  The statement suggests we should give up but we are reluctant to do so because we have two loyal client bases.  They pay us an annual maintenance fee to provide ongoing services.</p><p>  We are investing because we know we can export our service.  Much of the work done on the grassland management software on the web, which is the same model the Government wants, including central databases and web browser access, is what we are selling abroad.  We are only exporting for the past year or two but 50% of our new clients come from abroad.  We are getting to the stage where 50% of our clients could be from outside the Republic of Ireland.  We cannot understand how, as a nation, we want little companies to export, but all of the innovations in agriculture belong to the State.  This must be thought through a little better.  Are there situations where this is not the correct approach?  If one agrees with that statement, one is happy with the current situation.</p></speech>

In case anybody is not familiar with it, the ICBF is the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, which was established by the Department in 1997 with a view to creating a new genetic database for animal evaluations.  AgriNet has always worked closely with the ICBF.  We ensure we provide it with all data from farms and we also use all the data available to it.  The ICBF and Teagasc are the two entities that are doing a great deal of work in this regard.</p><p>  I will give one example which encapsulates the current dilemma for the industry, because it is easy to view this issue as two small companies experiencing a problem.  The issue for the industry as a whole is how we can have a sustainable and logical system.  Private sector involvement is needed in all industries and anyone who disagrees with that premise is basically arguing that the private sector is not of any benefit.  A major problem arises if private companies cannot innovate without the State innovating in the same area.  This problem will come back to haunt the system sooner or later.  A prime example is in the area of grassland management software, which is the product we export.  AgriNet has a good few clients in the United Kingdom, the United States and New Zealand.  Given that this type of software was invented in New Zealand, we are doing well to be able to sell into that market.  </p><p>  I do not wish to pick on the ICBF and Teagasc, both of which are involved in this area, but we offered to give Teagasc free access to a new central database for grass that we would design.  Deputy Heydon referred to data flowing in.  We informed Teagasc that it could write its own terms and conditions to guarantee the security of the data from our new database.  It chose not do so and we understand it will launch a new central database in the next month or two.  This does not make sense given that we offered to provide this service to the State at no cost.  We would have done a good job.  Kingswood has been in business for 25 years while AgriNet has been in business for 18 years.  We do not have a bad reputation by any means and we are willing to carry some of the load in terms of providing IT for farmers at no cost to the State.  Having done this work to a high standard, we offered to do it for the State.</p><p>  Farmers in the United Kingdom think our work is great and we have received compliments from farmers in New Zealand.  What is wrong with working with private software for a while, given that it works?  Both of our companies are well able to design very good software in web technology.  We can provide a solution and save the State from having to provide it.  Is that not what people are seeking these days?</p><p>  AgriNet is a small company but we are able to export and we have discovered we can get better.  I am confident that if I come before the joint committee in five years, at least half of our revenue and markets will be outside the Republic of Ireland.  When we are fighting for clients abroad we will come up against Kingswood.  We are a good resource and we have done a good job.  We have made the market for information technology as we have trained the top 5,000 or 10,000 farmers.  We have established a need for farmers to use computers and software.  When we offer to provide this service free it does not make sense for a State entity to provide the same service.  That is not a good balance.  I return again to the theme of this meeting, namely, the need to achieve a good balance.  Given the major deficit, a little support for the private sector would not go amiss.  We do not need financial support, but there is a need to strike a balance between the State and the private sector.  If we achieve this, we will be able to operate, export, grow and provide good services to Irish farmers that the State sector will not have to provide.  The State would not have to establish infrastructure or support services because we would provide them.  The mentality in the system on the State side is that it has a vision on which it will act.  We need to change this.  The State sector should make the cutbacks needed and allow others to carry the load a little better.  The question is how we will get to the stage at which the Department changes its vision.</p></speech>

Could the State agencies argue that scale is an issue?  While it may be commercially sensitive information, perhaps our visitors will indicate how many customers they have.  Could State agencies argue that all farmers are in the computer systems of the Department and State agencies for legislative reasons and this will ensure a greater uptake among farmers?  After all, the ultimate aim must be to get as many farmers as possible online.  I am playing devil's advocate because this is the line the State agencies may take when they appear before the joint committee.</p></speech>

Competition is needed.  Where economies of scale come into play is in the creation of national databases.  There is no point in having a half dozen so-called national agencies developing redundant databases.  Of the 100,000 farmers in Ireland, let us say 20,000 need software packages with varying requirements.  No State body, whether Teagasc, the ICBF or the Department, will be able to cater for these farmers by providing specific packages.  As with everyone else, farmers deserve choice.  We are trying to make a sharp distinction between the creation of national databases, which we accept is a State function and one that is best done by the State, and the provision of farm software packages, which is best left to the private sector.</p><p>  To return to the history of this issue, our main focus is not on what the Department is doing.  Ten years ago, the Department made a mistake when it prematurely established a website that was not used effectively until perhaps five years ago.  In doing so, it left a half dozen companies high and dry, of which four have since gone out of business.  The current problem is that Teagasc and the ICBF, which are subsidiary bodies of the Department, are repeating the mistake the Department made by ignoring the private sector and essentially telling their client base and masters in the Department that they can do what needs to be done and private sector involvement is not necessary.  They are using the argument about economies of scale.  One could ask why we do not all go back to the Soviet Union. </p></speech>

However, that is not the case, given that the database would be a national one and the companies before us provided guarantees on data sharing.  The Department has stated it is not in the best interests of the agricultural sector to enter into any form of agreement.  It is not in our interest when private companies are not leading innovation.  If they are discouraged from doing so, no one will drive on information technology among farmers.  How do other countries compare in terms of the level of State involvement over and beyond the national database?  Mr. Lynch referred to the United Kingdom and New Zealand.</p></speech>

It is quite high.  The Department will provide the figures, but the <i>agfood.ie</i> initiative is making great progress in this area and we have no issue with this whatsoever.  </p><p>  I refer back to Deputy Heydon's question about commercial software and the need for the State to carry out work in the commercial area.  Reference was made to the numbers involved.  The Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, carries out stock records, while Teagasc maintains financial and grassland records.  The ICBF system is very good and has a great reputation.  They are a good team, as are those in Teagasc.  There are no issues with the quality of software anywhere.  Before Christmas HerdPlus, the commercial end of the ICBF software, sold to a little under 8,000 clients.  The two of us have sold to approximately 8,000 clients during the years also.  We take the view that that company only achieved what we had achieved and that there was no need for it to do it in the first place.</p><p>  The ICBF has doubled its client base in the past year or less because the State has taken certain measures.  I am unsure whether the committee is familiar with two schemes in farming.  One is the dairy efficiency programme, DEP, and the other is the beef technology adoption programme, BTAP.  In the case of the BTAP, the Department has stipulated that one must use the ICBF HerdPlus software and pay the ICBF for it.  The ICBF database has increased from 8,000 to approximately 15,000.  Effectively, the State is paying farmers and cajoling them to buy this software and use it.  That is not a sustainable way to increase the usage of software.  If a farmer has no wish to get involved in using software, paying him or her to use it is not necessarily the right thing to do.  This shows the focus of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on using software funded and created by itself, which brings us back to the balance between public and private.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v made some comments about getting more people to use information technology.  For years I was the secretary of the Irish Society for Information Technology in Agriculture.  We used to meet once each year and discuss how to get more farmers to use information technology.  We have gone through all the arguments, including everything we have seen in our business during the years.  The first 10,000 farmers will use information technology.  They are data, information technology and business-focused.  They are go-ahead farmers and the backbone of the 2020 vision.  They are driving on and using data and information.</p><p>  The ICBF found certain problems, even with all of the State support that it had received.  Another problem is that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Teagasc and the ICBF have a total focus on promoting the three State systems above everything else, but they could not get beyond where we had got to.  There is a barrier of 10,000 commercial farmers who want our services.  We might believe there is a given market.  If there are 140,000 herds in the country, there should be 140,000 people using the <i>agfood.ie</i> website.  We have no issue with this whatsoever and it would be great, but the market for commercial services is closer to 10,000 than 100,000.  That is simply the way it is.  The numbers using HerdPlus are significant because without State prompting to buy it, the company got to where we were.  We reckon that we could have done the job and that the State need not have invested money in it.  It is a question of whether the committee wants to keep putting State money on the line or whether it wants us to do it.</p></speech>

I know that statement is something of a clich&eacute;.  It is a disgrace that only 30,000 of more than 100,000 farmers are using information technology.  If the Department utilised and encouraged the private farm IT sector instead of ignoring it and casting it aside, we would be much further down the road.  As Mr. Lynch stated, we do not have ambitions to computerise 100,000 farmers and, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v stated, it would not be commercially justified to do so.  However, if the Department were to utilise the expertise and experience we have acquired over the past two or three decades, it could focus more on the 90,000 farmers who have not yet computerised.  Instead, however, it has been developing facilities, even on its website, that are not necessary for legislative purposes.  Even more to the point, it has encouraged and funded its subsidiaries to become involved in replicating commercial farm software - not software required for legislative purposes - that our companies have been providing for the past 20 years.</p></speech>

Over the past year, we have communicated with a number of Deputies and Members of the European Parliament who have written to the directorate general.

We have touched on all the issues in the past hour.  Our basic message is that national databases should be retained in the public domain while farm software is best handled in the private sector.</p><p>  On Senator O'Neill's point on the need for balance, Mr. Lynch and I were promoting our software at a national livestock event at the NEC in Birmingham a couple of weeks ago.  There were two Irish companies and at least a half dozen English and Scottish companies promoting farm software - there may also have been a Welsh company - at the event.  The Irish dairy sector is roughly the same size as the English dairy sector, while the Welsh and Scottish dairy sectors are insignificant.  Why are six companies in Britain and only two companies in Ireland pursuing markets of roughly the same size?  Put another way, there were six companies operating in the Irish farm software sector ten years ago when farmers were much less computer-literate than they are now.  Why has the private sector been squeezed out of the market here and not in Britain?  I am not arguing that Britain must serve as the model for Ireland.  However, the UK market happens to be the market I know best.  Britain also has a number of national bodies and while some people will argue they are not as effective as our national bodies, they seem to have struck a better balance between public and private than we have.</p></speech>

We never received complaints about the standards applied.  To be fair, the other companies seemed to be doing a good job also.  Eventually, however, they gave up in the past ten years.  One by one, they dropped out.  We took a commercial view that it would be worth our while making this investment in software development to link with the Department because it would increase our attractiveness to farmers.  As Mr. Lynch mentioned, we traipsed up and down roads and boreens in rural Ireland, often with a PC in the back of a car, to train farmers in the use of the software, at no cost to the State.  Many of those who are now using the systems of the Department, the ICBF and Teagasc are doing so successfully because of the IT training they received from private sector companies in the 1990s.</p></speech>

As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v stated, there are 100,000 farmers in the country.  What about the rest?  There is a limit to the uptake because of the age structure of farmers and the small scale of many farms, and farmers generally prefer not to sit in front of a computer.  A farmer must have a compelling reason to sit in front of one.  His or her farm must be of a scale and he or she must be of a mentality to use a computer.  What we have proved is that the size of the market is not 100,000; rather, it is somewhere between 10,000 and 20,000.  That is why we say there was no market failure, although it seems the Department thought there was.  This is one of the justifications it is giving to the European Union, but events have proved us right in that regard.</p></speech>

That is the right thing to do to find out what is going on.  The general gist of what it will state is that it is worth it and that it has achieved so much because it decided to do it itself.  Obviously, we would not agree with it.</p><p>  Getting back to the European Union probe, the answers the Department has documented for the European Union in terms of what the problem is indicate that the Department does not do software.  It has a bizarre view.  There are farmers who will ring me to say they do not need to pay their annual subscription to me because they are no longer going to use my software.  When I ask why, they say they can use <i>agfood.ie</i>, ICBF HerdPlus and Teagasc for their accounts, that they have a solution offered by the State.  However, the State is saying to the European Union that it does not do software.  We find this strange.  While all of our functions are being duplicated by the State on the commercial side - Teagasc and the ICBF - the Department states it does not do software.  It almost thinks it cannot admit that it is doing it because immediately it would have a problem.  When the committee is talking to it, it should ask the question: is it doing software for farmers?  It will be interesting to hear the answer.  It is the core part of its attitude.  As it does not do farm software, it asks, &quot;What is the problem?&quot;</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Lynch and Mr. Lynskey.  We will not decide today what we should do, as we need to digest a certain amount.  Certainly, we need to hear what others have to say and try to balance the two.</p><p>  I should have made the point at the start that I have been a Kingswood package owner for 15 years.  As my son registered with BTAP, we had to complete the registration with the ICBF.  I am aware of the consequences.  From the farm software companies' point of view, they all initially started off by offering accounts packages.  As online registration and data collection became the norm for the State agencies, they facilitated the process.  At the outset, that was the avenue that was follwed and it proved successful.  I am not quite sure why the waters changed in between, but no doubt we can ask these questions.  If there are updates from the European Competition Commission, I ask someone to let us know.  We will probably come back to this issue in a couple of weeks.  Our next meeting is in two weeks because there is a ploughing match next week.  We already have a series of meetings planned until 23 October.  I suspect, however, that we will deal with the issue in private session to invite other agencies, but I cannot say for definite until the committee considers the matter.  </p><p>  I thank Mr. Lynch and Mr. Lynskey for their time and forbearance at the beginning when we had to deal with some private business.</p></speech>

I feel privileged to be able to share a few thoughts on youth unemployment in Ireland from a European perspective and I shall concentrate on youth unemployment.</p><p>  I have a PowerPoint presentation.  It may be a bit difficult for members to see the map of Europe on the screen, but the darker the shade of blue a country is shown in, the worse youth unemployment is in that country.  The very dark blue countries have a youth unemployment rate of over 40%; in the mid-blue countries it is over 30%; and for the others it is 20%, 10% or even less than 10%.  The graph makes it quite clear where Ireland is.  Ireland is in a bad way but not as bad as Greece and Spain.  Clearly it shares a grave youth unemployment situation with a number of member states.</p><p>  The youth unemployment ratio is worth mentioning because everybody bandies figures around.  It has been stated that in Spain and Greece one in two young people are unemployed, but that is just not true.  The unemployment rate is the percentage of people who are looking for work or are ready to work but cannot find it.  That makes a big difference to the figures for young people, although not to those for the adult population.  Most young people aged 15 to 24 are at school.  An unemployment ratio, in some sense, gives you a better feeling for what is happening.  In a country like Spain it is still a serious figure, at 20%, but it means that one in five - not one in two - young Spaniards are out of work.  If we look at the EU 27 as a whole we can see that the ratio is one in ten and not one in five.  In Ireland, just over 10% of young people are unemployed.  We must bear those figures in mind.  A 30% unemployment rate is very serious but it does not mean that 30% of young people in Ireland are unemployed.</p><p>  Long-term youth unemployment is a serious issue.  Unemployment is serious enough, but if one has been unemployed for more than a year one is defined as being long-term unemployed.  Ireland is at the extreme right-hand side of my graph and is grouped together with Slovakia, which is perhaps a strange bedfellow in some ways and not one of the classic peripheral countries.  Ireland has a long-term youth unemployment share of more than 50% now, a huge increase on the 2008 figure.  Unemployment has soared in Ireland and many of those people have been unemployed for more than a year.  It is not only a short-term problem but a long-term problem.</p></speech>

We have circulated a short document.  Although it is well known, it is important to say that the challenge faced by the Government and by society is on a scale which has not been experienced before.  In the four years between 2008 and 2011 Ireland recorded the largest number of job losses, relatively speaking, in any economy across the industrialised world since the Great Depression.  It is important to say that is the scale of it.</p><p>  I will restrict myself to saying three things today because we are in the process of preparing pre-budget submissions and we are awaiting appropriate approval for what we might say.  The first point - no disrespect is intended -  is that there is something perverse about all of us discussing how to get young people into jobs that do not exist.  It is important that we all recognise the elephant in the room, which is that the one-sided austerity approach which has been imposed upon us is not working.  We will not succeed in addressing the problem by tricking about with schemes, monitoring them and so on.  In order to get people into employment we have to create jobs and in order to do that we have to address the issue of domestic demand and consumption.  It is one thing to find ourselves in the situation, as we all do, that we must go along with a recipe that has been imposed.  It is another thing to delude ourselves that it is working because that leads to all sorts of other wrong conclusions.</p><p>  As one who quotes Karl Marx from time to time, I never thought I would see the day when I would be before the committee espousing the virtues of Ben Bernanke, a Republican, who last Thursday evening or Friday morning showed the way forward.  The way is the common sense way.  I mean no personal offence to Mr. Robert Strauss when I say that he might tell someone over there that countries need space to generate jobs and growth.  I imagine he is saying it but they are probably not listening to him either.  It is a serious point.  If one does not recognise it then one goes down all sorts of culs-de-sac trying to engage in alchemy.</p><p>  The first point is that we are stuck with the troika programme.  We should say we are stuck with it.  We should not try to delude ourselves that it is working.  We must find a way to gradually step away from it and generate domestic demand in the economy.  In the period between 1992 and 1997 when we had enormous and unprecedented success, something of the order of 600,000 jobs were generated within the economy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-18a.98" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Uacute;na Halligan" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012091800006#E00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for this opportunity to speak on behalf of the expert group on future skills needs.  I am &Uacute;na Halligan and I am chair of the group.  With me is Ms Marie Bourke from Forf&aacute;s, who is head of the secretariat to the expert group.  Forf&aacute;s manages the group's work, keeps its members in line and has responsibility for research analysis and secretarial support.  The expert group was established in 1997 and it reports to the Ministers for Education and Skills and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Its role is to advise Government on current and future skills needs within the economy and on the possible impact of labour market issues on enterprise and employment growth in Ireland.</p><p>  Mr. O'Connor referred to 1997, the year in which our group was founded, being right in the middle of the boom time.  The reason the group was established was because there was a genuine skills shortage in Ireland at that stage and this was having an effect on a number of multinational companies.  I was employed by Hewlett-Packard in 1997 and I am aware that the companies to which I refer were all fighting for the same people and seeking individuals with the same skills.  We were caught on the back foot at that point and what is now IDA Ireland informed us that there was a need to create and retain certain types of jobs here.  It was necessary to adopt something of a create-and-build-and-they-will-come approach and this is what happened.</p><p>  Members might ask why the expert group remains in existence in 2012.  When I became chair of the group a couple of years ago, we engaged in a careful consideration of the position and identified the fact that we still have a skills shortage.  We have very many well-educated people in this country but the question arises as to whether their qualifications and experience actually meet the needs which currently exist in the area of enterprise.  That is what our work is about.  I will now give the committee a flavour of what we do and I will be happy to take any questions members may wish pose.</p><p>  A well-educated workforce remains one of Ireland's fundamental strengths.  Our economic recovery is highly dependent on a skilled labour force.  Educational attainment is highly linked to current prospects in the labour market and has a significant impact in the context of the likelihood of people becoming either employed or unemployed.  The need to upskill and engage in conversion programmes for reskilling is vital because almost all occupations are becoming more knowledge-based.  This is resulting in a need for an increasing breadth of knowledge, rising technical and regulatory requirements and continual learning.</p><p>  The Government's Action Plan for Jobs 2012 targets the creation of 100,000 jobs during the period to 2016.  In that context, IDA Ireland has programmes in place to help realise job growth in financial services, life sciences, information and communications technology or ICT, content and business services and the emerging clean tech area.  Enterprise Ireland is targeting opportunities in areas such as agrifood, life sciences, software, financial-business services, telecommunications, Internet, media and entertainment, clean tech and engineering.  The expert group works closely with IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and others in order to address the skills requirements of these sectors of future employment growth potential and ensure we will have the skills necessary to take advantage of any opportunities that arise.</p><p>  The area in respect of which the expert group can add a great deal of value to the committee's deliberations on unemployment and youth unemployment is through the research and analysis it has carried out in conjunction with those involved in enterprise in sectors and occupations where future job opportunities are expected to arise through replacement - which is an interesting concept - and expansion demand.   The group has identified the skills that will be required to fill some of these jobs and has advised the education and training system with regard to aligning its programmes to ensure that graduates, trainees and those engaged in conversion and upskilling programmes will be best equipped to fill these jobs.  In conjunction with IDA Ireland in particular we have identified growth areas and sectors in which opportunities exist.  We are not saying that young people should not study the classics or whatever at college.  We are merely informing them that if they want jobs, they may not necessarily be able to obtain them via their studies in such areas.  We are trying to impart that information as we complete various aspects of our research.</p><p>  There is no easy solution to our problems and a multifaceted approach will be required.  In that regard, we are of the view that a cross-departmental approach will be of major assistance.  It is our view, therefore, that the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation should ensure that the environment is supportive for job creation; that the Department of Education and Skills should ensure that individuals are appropriately educated and trained to be able to avail of those job opportunities; and that the Department of Social Protection should ensure that the unemployed are supported appropriately while out of work and kept close to the labour market through targeted activation designed to meet individual needs.  We are hoping that by means of the Pathways to Work scheme people will be informed of both the programmes they should take and where job opportunities exist.  This will ensure that they will not become totally misaligned with the world of work.</p><p>  In our submission we have elaborated on measures that should be taken by Government in order to tackle unemployment and youth unemployment, including measuring performance through outcomes and value for money in addition to outputs and that said outcomes should focus on progression to employment-self-employment and progression to further or higher education or training; ensuring relevance to labour market and skills needs - this is the fundamental to what we are doing; ensuring that new and revised education and training courses continue to take on board the work of the expert group; and, maintaining emphasis on science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, skills in light of the continuing strong demand for graduates who possess ICT, engineering, math, science and financial skills.  In addition, the strong dependence on exports for economic recovery calls for an increased emphasis on multilingual and international sales skills.  Our recent report on international trade shows that Ireland has a major issue in respect of the latter.</p><p>  In our submission we also highlight the fact that the quality and level of mathematical knowledge outcomes for all ranks of national mathematical proficiency must improve; and that structured internships which provide work experience opportunities within enterprise are hugely valuable in improving the employability of students and jobseekers and that these need to be continually increased.  Another aspect we highlight is the need to ensure the relevance of intervention to the individual.  In that regard, all courses should demonstrate the progression pathway for the learner and underline how the skills and competencies relating to a programme enhance either specific occupational employment potential or employability skills - generic and soft - that are important for enhancing the mobility of the learner within and across sectors.  Programmes should be suitable for the aptitudes of the learner and his or her level of educational attainment.  The recognition of prior learning also has a role to play in determining appropriate learning requirements for those who are unemployed.</p></speech>

I welcome the delegates and thank them for their presentations.  My first question is to Mr. Strauss.  I attended the conference on employment organised by the European Commission.  In fact, I was sitting across from Mr. Strauss when Professor Bill Mitchell, director of the Centre of Full Employment and Equity and professor of economics at the University of Newcastle in Australia, spoke about the concept of a job guarantee.  He pointed out that the model of modern society created unemployment because there were many jobs which, although beneficial to communities, offered no financial dividend to potential employers.  Some of Mr. Mitchell's ideas have been adopted in the creation of a job guarantee scheme in rural India with some success, the objective being to prevent further migration to the overswell of cities in that country.  Mr. Mitchell likened the unemployment situation to a train departing the station every day with 20% of passengers left behind on the platform.  Such a situation cannot continue indefinitely.</p><p>  As a fairly new Deputy, I get the impression, unfortunately, that there is no move to abandon the existing model.  The tendency is to adopt an attitude of business as usual.  The reality, however, is that this is no longer sufficient.  Mr. O'Connor has argued that the stimulus plan the Government introduced goes only one third of the way towards what is required.  When I do the sums, it seems clear that even if we go the further two thirds of the way, we will still have a level of unemployment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-18a.103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1080" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012091800008#G00200"><p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh go l&eacute;ir.  I disagree with some of the points outlined by Mr. Jack O'Connor.  During the so-called boom the unemployment rate stood at approximately 4%; this was made up of frictional, chronic and other types of unemployment.  The current 15% unemployment rate comprises individuals who want to work but cannot because there are no jobs.</p><p>  I agree with the comments on the need for a stimulus package.  A stimulus is a type of investment that changes the direction of the economy and creates a multiplier effect.  I have a difficulty with the Government's stimulus package in that it is &euro;2.2 billion over six years.  If one takes away the capital reduction of &euro;750 million, it actually only adds up to &euro;800 million over six years.  That is not the type of investment that will change the direction of an economy.  Sinn F&eacute;in has produced a similar stimulus package to that of SIPTU, which adds up to &euro;13 billion over four years.  Our package identifies the European Investment Bank, private pensions and the National Pensions Reserve Fund as sources for funding.  Consumer demand is the key to getting people back to work but it has fallen off a cliff.</p><p>  With regard to issues of activation, Ms Halligan gave a figure for the number of people going through employment and skills conversion courses.  Unemployment is rising by 1,200 a week, while 76,000 emigrated last year.  These figures are phenomenal.  The 5,000 places for Springboard courses cover only a small group.  Conversion courses need to be ramped up to include larger numbers to deal with the unemployment problem.  How much funding goes into conversion courses?  How many go through all the various conversion courses every year?  The Minister for Social Protection has indicated she would like to see various training programmes to tackle youth unemployment, as used in other states.  Will Mr. Strauss give his views on such programmes?</p><p>  I do not believe we do enough with regard to job retention.  Germany is very good at identifying particular businesses that need support at specific times to maintain staff levels and get back to profitable operations.  What is the comparative European experience in this regard?  What lessons can we learn?</p><p>  Any policy that makes it more difficult for a struggling small business or employer to function is negative.  There is a discussion at government level about PRSI contributions for small businesses.  It is necessary for employers to contribute to the social insurance contract.  However, we also need to ensure that we do not push small businesses over the edge, leading to larger falls in PRSI contributions in the long term.</p><p>  Are the European Structural Funds proportionate to the needs of the State?  Do Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal get more <i>per capita</i> than countries with low unemployment?</p></speech>

The balance are minor or special purpose awards which are shorter term.  JobBridge has an allocation of 6,000 places and 8,000 have gone through it to date.  The ICT conversion programme that started in March this year has 500 people on it, with another 300 to start this month.  It is planned that over 6,000 will go through one and two-year programmes from September this year under the Springboard programme, which has been advertised over the past several months.  There are 6,000 going through the 2011 programme, with 3,500 graduating in June this year and the balance coming through in two- and three-year courses, graduating this year and the following year.</p><p>  In December last year the Government announced a labour market activation fund for further education levels, which will be launched in the coming months.  It will have about 6,500 places on it for people up to levels five and six.  That is aside from the normal higher education mainstream.</p></speech>

Deputy Lyons asked what I thought of Professor Mitchell's ideas.  My Commissioner is certainly interested in them.  Deputy Lyons probably saw him in the room, and he was responsible for Professor Mitchell attending.</p><p>  The idea of offering everybody who wants it a job provided by the state is essentially what Professor Mitchell is saying.  He states people should not be unemployed and if they cannot find a job in the normal sector, the state should provide it.  He gave many examples of work that needs to be done in communities, local authorities, etc.</p><p>  These are interesting ideas.  The ideas that people should not be distanced from the labour market, and that it would be much more useful if they are productive rather than unproductive, are very interesting.  However, there are some provisos.  It has been tried in India and, perhaps, South Africa.  Their labour markets and economic situations are very different from Europe.  In saying it has worked in practice, it has worked in India where there is massive underemployment in rural areas and it is a different sort of problem from what Europe faces.</p><p>  The idea of youth guarantees was mentioned by the Chairman and Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  The Commissioner has long advocated a youth guarantee so that all young people within, let us say, four months of leaving education would either be in employment or offered training or education.  The Finns have recently instigated such a guarantee.  It seems to be working in Finland but, of course, the Finnish economy was not hit so hard by the crisis.  In a country such as Spain, for example, it may be a real challenge to get all the young people who are not working into another programme.  Frankly, one sees every reason for training, conversion or something, but there is no point in doing training only for the sake of it.  It must be useful, proper training.  It is a real challenge for public employment services or others to make the youth guarantee useable, but we certainly favour it.  The Commissioner has long said so.  In some countries, such as Finland, it works.</p><p>  Another term for job retention is short-time working.  I agree that Germany, and also the Netherlands and Belgium, used it in the first phase of the crisis.  The Commission and the OECD do not always agree but we did on this.  The Commission stated this was an important element in allowing these countries to weather the crisis to keep a workforce well in touch with jobs.  When recovery happened in those countries, companies had the workforce readily available.  The problem is if the scheme is extended for many years.  Then it becomes an expensive scheme, both for the companies and for the state.  A little like my answer as to whether Professor Mitchell's idea is a good one, it has elements that can work but one of the dangers of short-time working schemes or job retention schemes that go on too long is that one can stop the economy adjusting.  Economies need to adjust.  Some companies cannot go on for ever.  The car sector was one of the major users of short-time working schemes.  That is fine if the car sector picks up again, but various persons suggest that overcapacity in the automotive sector in Europe is quite high.  Does one really want to pour money into preserving jobs in a sector that has overcapacity?  It is tricky to know which jobs one needs to support.  If one could guarantee that in 12 or 18 months demand would pick up again, then it is excellent but it is not always easy to get it right.</p><p>  There was a question about whether money from Structural Funds goes to those countries where unemployment is high.</p></speech>

I have found the discussion very interesting.  All three speakers who have given us an insight are a reminder to me that there is no magic wand, no one thing we can do, and that it will have to come from all of the different areas.</p><p>  I will concentrate on one area suggested by a reference Mr. O'Connor made to job creation.  I believe not nearly enough is being done to encourage entrepreneurship.  I did not even hear the word today, although Ms Halligan perhaps referred to it.  I am talking about the possibility of saying to somebody they would start their own business.  It is so interesting to go to the United States and find that people there assume a person will start their own business, although it may be only a very small one or the person might only be at school when he or she starts it.  However, in order to do that, we have to give people the opportunity to expand.</p><p>  The witnesses all referred to languages, in particular Ms Halligan, who referred to primary, secondary and third level.  I believe we have not done nearly enough in this area.  If we can manage to instil in people the fun, the excitement and the joy of having another language, it gives them the first step in that direction.</p><p>  As I have mentioned previously, I was in Drogheda last year and met two men who were unemployed.  I asked them what they had done and they said they had written away and they asked what more they could do.  I then came home and met two young men of a similar age who knocked on my door to sell car cleaning products.  These two students did very well and later sold on their business to somebody else.  It seems there is a different culture in the United States and among some people in Ireland who say "I assume my job is not going to be created for me by somebody else."</p><p>  What can we as a State do?  We can encourage entrepreneurship.  I previously mentioned Mr. Jerry Kennelly from Tralee, who sold his business but wanted to stay in Kerry, so he put his money into entrepreneurship education for transition year students.  Each year he has over 600 students come to Tralee having been trained in entrepreneurship.  I sat beside a young lady who, at 15 years of age, started her own business and is now selling her product on the Internet to 22 countries.  She is now 16 and has only one employee, her father.  The idea was given there that people should not assume the State or somebody else is going to create a job for them and that they should give some thought to creating their own job.  If we can manage to instil entrepreneurship in students at school, we have a much better chance of getting through this.</p></speech>

I have a question for Mr. Strauss.  With regard to the EU literature, one constantly comes across references to apprenticeships and the value that is placed on them in Europe.  In Ireland, however, apprenticeships have lost their currency and status when compared to the recent position when highly skilled manual work and apprenticeships were much sought after and highly valued.</p><p>  As the character of work has changed and new forms of work have emerged, the apprenticeship idea has been sidelined because it does not seem to be as directly applicable given the changing character of contemporary work.  As the EU literature has so many references to apprenticeships, I wonder whether some European countries have managed to transform their apprenticeship styles and redefine them.  It is great to see the term used because it is a very powerful one and has a great resonance with people.  For young people in the 1970s and 1980s, to get an apprenticeship with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Telecom or ESB was a big step forward in their personal and working lives.  That has dissipated.  Young people have difficulty in defining their own importance because they cannot define it in regard to what they aspire to be in their work.</p><p>  I welcome Mr. Jack O'Connor's very provocative statements about creating more urgency on all of these issues and urging Government to be more active.  That is very necessary and we need that sort of sharp, provocative comment.  Mr. O'Connor referred to the priorities in terms of creating jobs, finding ways of stimulating the economy and getting more fluidity into it by getting more money moving around and so on.  As a counter-comment, I point out that while unemployment is difficult for any individual, it is particularly in working class communities, where there are very large numbers of young people clustered together, that there is a sense of powerlessness which feeds off the lack of hope.  These are very precarious situations for individuals and communities, and by the time the general economy trickles down to that level, it may be far too late for them.</p><p>  There is need for intervention schemes of a very different character.  I do not put a great deal of store by some of the schemes we have had in the past in terms of activation measures.  Obviously, there has to education and training in regard to literacy and numeracy but we must change the character of those schemes so they engage the individual in their totality.  I cannot see why well-being, swimming, mountain climbing, rock climbing, canoeing and so forth cannot be included so we build different points of engagement along the profile of the scheme, the more to engage the person in his or her entirety.  Literacy and numeracy are important dimensions to any scheme but we must animate them in much more exciting ways to provide that direct application to the well-being of the young person.  If we opt for that kind of scheme, we may find it easier to draw people closer to work.</p></speech>

I follow the Forf&aacute;s report regularly and know it has been for many years tracking the skills needs of industry.

We have an unemployment rate of 14.8%, almost 60% of which is made up of people who are long-term unemployed, but there is no sense of urgency.  It is not on the radar how devastating not having a job is to a human being.  I saw that devastation during the 1980s when myself and Connie Doody set up Lir Chocolates.  In certain areas of this city the unemployment rate was 40%.  I saw the lack of confidence and the emotional fear in the people we were taking on.  They were afraid they would not be able to do the job.  To see the transformation in those people when they actually got a job and managed to hold it down was marvellous and motivated me to keep going.  I was not interested in profit.  In fact, I had never heard the word before and was never interested in it.  However, there comes a day when one has to face reality and accept that a business is only sustainable if it makes a profit.  I got my energy to keep going from seeing the transformation in people when they got a job.</p><p>  At the moment I am helping young graduates who cannot get jobs and I am seeing the same devastation again.  In the 1980s graduates would have automatically got a job or would have emigrated.  Now we have an incredibly highly educated young population.  The standard and diversity of their qualifications are quite incredible.  I have spoken to young people who went through third-level education and were expecting to find employment on graduating but two years after qualifying, they are still jobless.  Their confidence is gone.  They hang their heads.  They are trying to put on a show-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-18a.125" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Strauss" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012091800011#K01200"><p>Members asked whether some countries have redefined apprenticeships and the simple answer is "Yes".  Germany, Austria and Switzerland are the countries most associated with a well-working apprenticeship system.  It is usually tied in with the vocational education and training system.  Where it works best there is a seamless transition for pre-teen children or teenagers in a vocational stream towards apprenticeships and then jobs.  In the past, such jobs were generally in manual labour or engineering companies but nowadays job options are much broader and can include IT companies and those operating in the services sector.  In all developed economies the service sector is now much bigger than the manufacturing sector.  Apprenticeships are no longer just for manufacturing jobs.  </p><p>  In Ireland, as I understand it, apprenticeship schemes were most common in the construction industry.  That sector has collapsed and is unlikely ever to be as big again, so apprenticeships in the construction sector are of no use because there are no jobs at the end.  Apprenticeships must be redesigned to fit in with the modern service economy.  Germany and Austria have done this and companies of all sizes have links with the education system whereby the non-academic pupils are drawn through the school system and into an apprenticeship system which gives them highly skilled and well-paying jobs at the end.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-18a.126" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Uacute;na Halligan" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012091800011#K01300"><p>In response to Senator Clune's comments about languages, the issue is not just the uptake of languages <i>per se</i> but the uptake of languages in context.  Students going to college and learning all about the Greek, German or French classics is not the answer.  The answer lies in amalgamating such knowledge with the skills one needs as a salesperson, for example.  If one is trying to sell a BMW or agrifood products, for example, the contextual purpose of a language comes to the fore.  In our discussions with various companies and particularly indigenous companies working with Enterprise Ireland in developing export markets, we discovered that often they could find very good salespeople who could not speak the required language or else they could find people who were very good linguistically but did not have the other competencies required.  This is an issue for the universities and institutes of technology.  A language and business studies course that is taught by a German businessperson would improve the context for students, for example.  There are enormous opportunities in that area.</p><p>  Another issue we glossed over was that of sales techniques.  As Senator White may know, selling is not marketing.  We have found that many young people think a salesman sells cars and suchlike and they do not see sales as a potential career.  There is a big difference between public relations and marketing and actual sales techniques.  In that context, we have asked the third-level institutions to introduce a sales module to some of their business programmes.</p></speech>

However, we must be sure we know what we are talking about because we have gone through a long period of confusing speculators and swindlers with entrepreneurs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-18a.129" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1078" speakername="Damien English" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012091800012#L00200"><p>I thank all of our speakers for their useful contributions.  We will be engaging more regularly with them in the next few months.  I hope we will keep in touch with Mr. Strauss and Ms Nolan.  We will finalise our report in the next couple of weeks and hope it will feed into the Action Plan for Jobs, as well as into the preparations for the budget.  Some key recommendations were touched on today.  We will engage with the Mr. O'Connor on the manufacturing initiative.  This is an issue on which we wish to focus, as this topic has been raised in earlier presentations.  I imagine we will make a recommendation to tackle that issue in our report.</p><p>  I welcome Mr. Frank O'Keeffe, partner in charge, Ernst &amp;amp; Young; Mr. Liam Griffin, chief executive officer, Griffin Group, who is part of the Ernst &amp;amp; Young delegation; and Mr. Gerry Moan from the Discovery Zone.  I apologise for the delay in starting and understand the delegates must leave at 4 p.m.  We will try to finish by that time, but should they need to leave, that will not present a problem.  As I outlined the parliamentary practice as the start of the meeting, I will take it as read.  The presentation usually takes about five minutes, but the delegates may take more time if they wish to comment on what they heard in the earlier presentations.  The presentation will be followed by a question and answer session.  We hope our report on unemployment and specifically youth unemployment will feed into the Action Plan for Jobs.  We are trying to highlight new ideas that are missing from key areas.  I invite Mr. O'Keeffe to take the lead.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-18a.130" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank O'Keeffe" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012091800012#L00500"><p>I thank the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for inviting us to talk about unemployment, job creation and, most importantly, what we in the Ernst &amp;amp; Young entrepreneur of the year programme do to try to stimulate entrepreneurship.  I am the partner in charge of our entrepreneur of the year programme.  Effectively, I am the custodian of over 350 of Ireland's best entrepreneurs who have entered our programme in the past 15 years.  I help to co-ordinate them and try to be the beacon of light and a voice for what the entrepreneurs on the island of Ireland are thinking and doing.</p><p>  It is important to recognise that the Ernst &amp;amp; Young entrepreneur of the year programme is an all-island programme, comprising entrepreneurs from different backgrounds and all sectors who have left academia at different stages of their lives but who have common traits around a vision, seeking an opportunity when others see adversity and having the belief to back themselves and encourage others to work with them but, most importantly, having the fearless factor to travel around the world and also nationally to try to win contracts, compete against much bigger companies and generate jobs on the island of Ireland.</p> <p>For us, the collaboration between educators and industry is key.</p><p> Another issue which might not be discussed enough in the media is technology.  A significant number of IT jobs remain unfilled at present.  We ran a technology seminar a few weeks ago at which one of our very high-profile IT entrepreneurs indicated that his biggest frustration is the fact he cannot find individuals of sufficient quality or experience on the island of Ireland to take up employment with his company.  Those in the sector do not want the jobs to which I refer to go anywhere else.  They are of the view that if they could work with the educators in respect of the curriculum in order to create focused opportunities for students, then these jobs could be filled.  This is an important aspect.</p><p> Other initiatives we would suggest are in the area of mentoring.  Within the Ernst &amp;amp; Young entrepreneur of the year community, mentoring happens on a peer-to-peer basis all the time.  However, we are of the view that there should be further mentoring initiatives for students and those seeking jobs.  For example, a significant number of jobseekers might be considering particular industries and those in said industries and entrepreneurs could give something back - in community-based seminars in different parts of the regions - to these people in order to try to help them with their confidence and to assist them in understanding how they might obtain employment in their field of choice or expertise.  This can be done in many different ways.  We have a population of over 350 entrepreneurs in our community.  These individuals are all willing to give back and they do so.  It is important, however, to have in place co-ordinated supports and structures in this regard.</p><p> I am over-running on time at this stage so I will try to summarise the other points I wish to make.  Access to funding is the third pillar.  I am aware that this matter was discussed with the previous panel.  There are many good initiatives being taken and many good things being done at present.  I have listed a number of these in our submission.  Potential and aspiring - not just existing - entrepreneurs need to have access to funding at many different levels.  Sometimes businesses only need a small amount of confidence, equity or debt capital in order to move forward.  We are of the view that there should be an overarching Government-led initiative which would focus on educating aspiring entrepreneurs and making them aware that while there are certain barriers to entry, these can - with the right level of support and guidance - be broken down.  That is absolutely key.  A large majority of our entrepreneurs interviewed globally - 80% - indicated their belief that governments have a really important role to play in creating the right environment for access to funding for young and aspiring entrepreneurs.</p><p> Our feedback to this committee revolves around trying to ensure that there will be some co-ordinated exploration of further credit guarantee systems and banking sector support, not just for SMEs but also in the context of advising and educating aspiring entrepreneurs.  There is also a need to try to focus on and embrace business angel networks.  In the context of sources of finance, such networks probably offer higher-risk funding and will invest smaller amounts for larger bets.  I have just returned from a trip to Silicon Valley in the US for a retreat which was attended by 115 people who participated in our entrepreneur of the year programme.  We learned a great deal from many of the top educators from Stanford University, University of California Berkeley and Singularity University, spent time with the global CIO of Apple and paid a visit to the headquarters of Facebook.  That retreat is all about trying to help stimulate existing entrepreneurs into thinking differently and growing their businesses.  In Silicon Valley, we learned much about access to venture capital and business angel networks.  We also learned that it is sometimes okay to be unsuccessful or to start a business for the second or third time.  The latter is where confidence comes into the equation.  There is a view in Silicon Valley that it is something of a badge of honour to have started again or to try again.  There is a particular confidence that exists in the ecosystem that is Silicon Valley and we must consider ways in which we might replicate this.</p><p> Our fourth pillar relates to regulation and tax.  Globally, there is a recognition that having the correct regulation and tax system to really assist the development of an entrepreneurship culture and allow aspiring entrepreneurs to create jobs is extremely important.  In that context, industry must be brought in at the right level.  We must therefore use the best CEOs that are available on the island of Ireland in order to understand how we might achieve the right level of regulation and the correct balance of taxation to ensure industry assists the Government in rolling out a strategy and a plan.  There are some good examples in this regard.  Our corporate tax rate is extremely important.  One of our entrepreneurs, Mr. Terry Clune, founder of ConnectIreland, is considering how we might use the diaspora to generate and increase the number of jobs on the island of Ireland.  Our recommendations in this regard involve designing and building an effective, inclusive, stable, incentivised and targeted system and using entrepreneurs to become involved with and get behind that system.</p><p> The final pillar to which I wish to refer relates to co-ordinated support.  There is a great deal of support available and many good things are being done in particular areas.  However, there is a need to co-ordinate this support and adopt a one-stop-shop approach.  The latter is very important for aspiring and smaller SME entrepreneurial businesses.  Taking a one-stop-shop approach to simplifying company registration and taxation procedures and educating people on how to get their enterprises off the ground would be extremely useful and would have an impact.  Many entrepreneurs do not establish businesses because they simply do not understand how they might do so.  We are of the view that Enterprise Ireland, the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and the CRO could come together - by means of a simple, one-stop-shop approach - to explain how to get a business off the ground.</p><p> Those are the five pillars we wish to advocate.  We think they are extremely relevant to this conversation and we hope members do too.  There are some areas in which things are done fantastically well.  We do a great deal of good stuff on the island of Ireland but there is also an element of best in class and, as a result, there is not necessarily a need to reinvent the wheel.  Much of what we are advocating is contained in our "Entrepreneurs speak out" brochure, which has been circulated to members.  I would be delighted to forward to them the full document.  Our entrepreneurial community has a really strong voice and comprises some phenomenal people.  I am not an entrepreneur; I am the partner in charge of the programme.  However, Mr. Griffin is an entrepreneur.  He and some of his fellow alumni possess some of the best business brains on the island of Ireland.  We have a very co-ordinated body of alumni and these individuals are focused not just on growing their businesses and creating jobs but also on giving something back.</p><p> We would like to offer to return for an additional meeting with the committee - if it was of the view that this might prove beneficial - with members of our wider entrepreneurial community.  I refer here to bringing before it people with different backgrounds from various sectors in order that they might discuss some of the individual initiatives they might advocate.</p></speech>

We will hear from Mr. Moan before taking the question-and-answer session.  Some members have been obliged to leave in order to attend various other functions and meetings.  As Senator Quinn indicated prior to his departure, he really wanted to be present for this part of the meeting because he has a particular interest in entrepreneurs.  He referred a great deal to Mr. Jerry Kennelly - who was also mentioned by Mr. O'Keeffe - and stated that he contacts him by telephone almost every week.  The Senator asked me to apologise on his behalf for the fact that he was obliged to leave.</p></speech>

Mr. Jack O'Connor referred to putting the cart before the horse.  In that context, I am the horse.  The Chairman asked me to provide an outline of the work of Discovery Zone.  Before doing so, I wish to take up a number of the points made by Mr. O'Keeffe.</p><p>  The notion of start-up and entrepreneurship development is key to what we do in the business I run, which is a training company that is very much focused on entrepreneurship.  My voice is hoarse because I have just left 350 screaming kids in County Meath who are taking part in the student enterprise awards scheme and who are developing start-up businesses.  Next week, I will be spending time with 700 students in County Donegal who are involved in start-up enterprises.  When people state that nothing is happening on the ground, I am of the view that this is because the news is just not getting to them.  Information on the really good stuff that is happening is just not reaching those who make decisions.</p><p>  In the context of what I do and what Discovery Zone involves, I too am a business angel and I invest quite an amount of time, energy and money in technology and manufacturing start-ups.</p></speech>

There is an opportunity with the institutes of technology in particular, as they are on the ground with regard to much of the vocational aspect, to undertake some entrepreneur shadowing.  It would be brilliant to tie EOY into this, whereby entrepreneurs with previous experience could be tied into those who are in the business streams in order to mentor them, guide them and to act as case studies because, again, the other case studies are 25 years old.</p><p>  I see that Deputy Calleary agrees with me.  The dilemma for the committee, with all due respect to its position, is that it is a question of the horse and the cart.  We all seem to agree with what is needed on the ground.  It is really about the energy, passion and conviction needed to get it off the ground.  We cannot do that in the vacuum that currently exists or while we are waiting for county councils to decide whether they want to encourage enterprise or not.  We cannot do it while we are waiting for county enterprise board officials to stop sitting on their hands and decide whether they are going to do this or not.  Enterprise Ireland needs to take account of what is going on with the business angel community and of the recompense for entrepreneurs who go forward to the angel stage.</p><p>  How it is that I can get tax relief on property and be allowed to invest the bulk of my pension in property, a market that we know has failed us, but I cannot invest the bulk of my pension in start-ups?  It does not make sense and needs to be reappraised.  I do not know if committee members see this on the ground but we do.  I thank committee members for their time.</p></speech>

That concludes our round-table discussion in terms of presentations and we have had many views from many sectors in recent months.  It has been a very interesting process and the views expressed today are also very important.  I call Deputy Calleary to begin the questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-18a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1071" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012091800015#O00700"><p>I thank the three presenters, who have given me a little bit of hope again.  I note Mr. O'Keeffe is keen to downplay his role in the EOY competition but every orchestra needs a conductor.  It is a great programme but I never knew anything about the detail in regard to the alumni and the work they do until Mr. O'Keeffe explained it.</p><p>  As Senator Quinn said, we do not have a culture of entrepreneurship.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-09-18a.143" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1156" speakername="Mary White" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012091800016#P00200"><p>I am fascinated by this discussion, which is very close to my own heart because I know it is the small and medium indigenous companies that will provide the employment opportunities for our young people.  I had the honour of being an adjudicator for the Ernst &amp;amp; Young entrepreneur of the year competition, which I was delighted to do.  The transition year students in a school in Buncrana, County Donegal were encouraged by their teachers to make products and approximately 200 children did so.  Their teachers asked me how they could get these children to become entrepreneurs and to become self-sufficient.  Donegal people are extraordinarily self-sufficient and enterprising.  The school in Buncrana was looking for a solution and a way to move forward.  The children were so excited, as were their parents and grandparents, who had helped them to make their products.  It was fascinating.</p><p>  I agree with everything that has been said but to cut to the chase and be political, I was shocked when Deputy Richard Bruton announced in the Seanad, several months ago, that the enterprise boards were to be subsumed into the local authorities.  That was an absolutely crazy idea.  The enterprise boards employ fewer than ten people and should have been merged with Enterprise Ireland.  While I do not wish to insult people in local authorities, it is not in their nature to be enterprising.  They are bureaucrats and they do not have the vision needed to support people with good ideas who come before them looking for assistance.  Those in local authorities have no clue what it is like to set up or run a business and the same is true of those working in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  They are not entrepreneurs.  They are bureaucrats, although some of them are extremely good at what they do.   I was a member of the first Dublin City Enterprise Board.  As Mr. O'Keeffe has said, there are enormous opportunities for people to set up businesses but not if they come up against a bureaucratic stone wall.  People come to the boards full of excitement about their projects.  They have a vision of what they want to do and are innocent in their self confidence.  When my business partner and I started, we did not know what we were facing into.  We had to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week for 16 years.  We worked on weekends, Christmas Day, New Year's Day and so forth and if we had not, the business would have collapsed.  That business now employs 200 people.  It was a labour of love for me, to see people getting jobs. Enterprise is in the Irish nature, which is obvious from the fact that so many do well when they go abroad.  We are very independent-minded and do not have that Anglo or German mentality of wanting to do what we are told.  Entrepreneurship suits the Irish mentality.  </p><p>  I found today's presentation very exciting and I wish the delegates continued success.  We are very privileged to have so much foreign direct investment here but we must drive our recovery ourselves too.</p></speech>

We have a very strong voice, not only through our 350 alumni but also through our media partners, particularly RTE television, which produced five television programmes on entrepreneurship.  Our live awards were attended by President Mary McAleese, as our guest of honour, for the past three years and this year they were attended by President Michael D. Higgins, along with many Deputies, Senators and business-influencers.  We are also supported by <i>The Irish Times</i>, which features our entrepreneurs quite regularly and profiles them when they are announced as finalists.  Through the Newstalk radio station, our voices and the voices of our entrepreneurs are constantly on the airwaves, talking about things that matter to small and medium enterprises and to entrepreneurs, both aspiring and actual.  We do as much as we can to promote entrepreneurship but there must be a balance.  Austerity is much discussed and rightly so, as many people are suffering here right now, but we need to hear a more balanced voice.  We must get the positive message across and prove to people on the island of Ireland that there is a lot of success here.  People need to look at the beacons of light and make sure they give themselves the best opportunity to go forward.</p><p>  Deputy Calleary asked what I would say to an 11 year old in school.  That is a very interesting question which I put to the entrepreneurs in our programme and thankfully it is they who are talking to the 11 year olds and not me.  On a serious note, we must remember that the world is changing at a rapid rate.  Many of our 11 year olds have iPads, mobile telephones and so forth and are using technology in a very different way from us.  They see the world differently and think in global rather than national terms with regard to where they might be for the rest of their lives.  They are very interested in doing different things and what we are trying to do with the entrepreneur of the year programme is make sure that we plant a seed in their minds so that they realise they can actually make a difference.  </p><p>  We employ a significant number of graduates and are in the lucky position of being able to hire 150 new graduates this year.  Those graduates want a different experience at work.  They have many ideas and some of them want to become entrepreneurs themselves, once they qualify as chartered accountants.  As the world changes, we need to connect in with our people and with the younger generation in particular.  If we can make a difference to a small percentage of those 11 year olds then perhaps by the time they are 25 or 35 they will have set up their own businesses and generated significant employment.  It is not just the 11 year olds we must reach, however, but those at all stages in the education system, including third-level students.</p><p>  I thank Senator White for her comments and wish to add to the point she made about Irish people and entrepreneurship.  We are very proud of the fact that, <i>per capita</i>, Ireland is a very strong nation in terms of generating entrepreneurs.  We have a general ability to interact with and integrate into different cultures very quickly.  We are very good sellers and we like a bit of fun.  That is a very good balance and sits well with entrepreneurship, which requires fantastic innovation, self-belief and a strong focus on doing things differently, beating the competition and generating jobs.  That is what our programme is all about.  We are trying to help entrepreneurs to unlock national and international opportunities.  We try to connect them with other entrepreneurs around the world so that they can collaborate, beat bigger businesses and generate jobs.</p></speech>

I have been in business for 38 years now and work 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  We started with four staff and now have 400 and are trying desperately hard to keep them all at work.  With regard to the rates issue, I wrote a cheque yesterday for Wexford County Council for &euro;27,000 for one business.</p></speech>

Then, because it does not have the funding, we end up in front of the Department of Social Protection, and because it does not have the funding, we end up with a cocktail of all the bits, so I end up prostituting my programme around the country.  The people relying on that support end up doing the same.</p></speech>

Obviously, it has been a very positive session and there is much food for thought in everything said, particularly those very strong words from Liam Griffin.  I could see how he was successful on the hurling field.  We have many issues to address.  The banking situation is certainly one that exercises the minds of many.  In the past few days, three guys who set up a nice little business in my town, rescued it from a redundancy situation, had 15 jobs and orders for &euro;1 million between now and Christmas.  However, they have the receiver in because the banks will not give them &euro;150,000 to tide them over.  That is the kind of thing we are up against and we have some major issues to address.  Hopefully, strong people will take strong decisions during the remainder of this year and into next year because if we can address this major crisis in our country and get people back to work, the tide will lift all boats.  We must nurture the entrepreneurs - the people who have the ideas - but we must make it possible for them to do business and start up as well.  I like the idea of the local authorities being prepared to wait until the business is making money before they start levying charges to give them a break.</p></speech>

It was very important that we heard from the delegation before we finished our report because it brought another perspective to it.  Like Deputy Calleary, I did not realise the in-depth work behind everything it does so that was informative and worthwhile.  We will certainly get a chance to read all these documents before we make any recommendations.  Likewise, we hope to contact it again because this is only a start for us.   This is an issue on which we must focus as a committee and make the right changes.  There is no point in our meeting on a weekly basis if it does not achieve anything so our aim is for this to feature into the Action Plan for Jobs and the budget and to keep driving it.  Our job is to keep lobbying, no matter who is at the helm as Minister.  Does the delegation have any further comments?</p></speech>

I thank the committee for inviting us to the meeting.  The entrepreneurial voice is really strong and growing in Ireland and we need to embrace it as much as we can.  There needs to be a better balance and beacon of light for hope in Ireland.  The time is now and we would do anything to support this initiative within my firm but, more important, with the alumni from our entrepreneur of the year programme.</p></speech>

For example, we are taking on all of County Wexford and I am making sure we get into every secondary school this year to talk about entrepreneurship.  That is a small step and we are going to do that with each of us telling our own story.  We have groupings from the mid-20s through to people in their 70s in the alumni and they are exceptional and wonderful people with some great ideas, some of whom have failed but have great ideas as well.  On behalf of the alumni, I can say we will make ourselves available to speak to anybody in private as a grouping at any stage if we can offer anything that will help our country, with no fanfare, talk or cost.</p></speech>
