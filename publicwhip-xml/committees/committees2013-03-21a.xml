It will then lie with the Minister to arrange to have it presented.  There is a period of up to 90 days, or three months, for that.  We are asking the Department to progress it as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

We will ask the Minister that on receipt of the report he make it available to the committee so that we can arrange an early hearing.  The DDDA just wants to get it in order to deal with it as quickly as possible within a reasonable timeframe.  Is there any other business?</p></speech>

I requested that the Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection provide the committee with further figures regarding the interview rates for people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance.  Some figures were presented to us relating to last summer.  We asked if more up-to-date information could be provided.  I assume that information has not been received as yet.</p></speech>

The Vote also includes funding for a range of services including the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.</p><p>  A Supplementary Estimate was passed for Vote 19 in 2011.  As shown in the appropriation account, an additional &euro;10 million was provided for criminal legal aid, on top of the original Estimate of &euro;47.6 million.  The outturn for the year was just over &euro;56 million.  This is on a par with 2010 expenditure.  An additional &euro;5.6 million was also provided in 2011 for the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  An additional &euro;1.2 million was provided for commissions and inquiries.  The increases in these subheads were offset by reductions in the Estimate provisions for a range of services, including the Irish Youth Justice Service, the Office of the State Pathologist and the Criminal Assets Bureau.  </p><p>  The appropriation account for Vote 13, Office of the Chief State Solicitor, is also before the committee today.  The function of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is to provide legal services to the Attorney General, Departments and offices and State agencies.  In 2011, the office recorded gross expenditure of &euro;32.9 million.  Of this, &euro;14.4 million was spent on salaries and &euro;15.8 million was allocated for the payment of fees to counsel and general law expenses.</p><p>  Chapter 15 concerns the circumstances around the lease of a premises for a Probation Service project that gave rise to a situation in which no benefit was received despite a &euro;2 million outlay.  The Department funds 46 community-based organisations across the State to develop and deliver services to adult offenders in their communities. One of these is the Bridge project, which has operated in the Dublin north inner city area for more than 15 years.  The project aims to achieve community reintegration of male offenders, improve their job skills and generally assist in increasing community safety.</p> <p>The programme is delivered by a multidisciplinary team, led by Probation Service staff.</p><p> The Probation Service had concerns about the suitability of the premises used by the project and began to seek alternative accommodation in 2006.  In June 2008, the Probation Service leased premises located in a largely residential building in Wolfe Tone Street, Dublin, for use by the project.  The Office of the Chief State Solicitor negotiated the lease with the owner of the premises on behalf of the Department.  Substantial fitting out was required to meet the needs of the project.  While the fitting out work was ongoing, questions were raised about compliance with planning regulations of the development and the intended use.  There was considerable local and resident opposition to the Bridge Project moving into the premises.  The planning enforcement office of Dublin City Council issued a warning letter to the Bridge Project in March 2010, stating that planning permission granted in 2001 for a change of use of the premises to commercial use had expired in January 2006.  The Department has stated that it was informed - during a meeting with the planning enforcement office - that planning permission did not revert to the previous uses once the permission for commercial office use had expired.  Consequently, the Department would need to apply for planning permission for any type of use of the premises.  Given local opposition to the Bridge Project's accommodation in the premises, permission for a use of that kind would be difficult to secure.</p><p> The Department has incurred expenditure in respect of the rental and fitting out of the premises amounting to over &euro;2 million, without any benefit having been received.  As a result, the Bridge Project continued in accommodation of a poor standard until 2012, when it was forced to leave said accommodation due to health and safety risks.  This was almost six years since the search for alternative premises had commenced.  When my report was being finalised, the project was accommodated under short-term arrangements.  The Accounting Officer for the Department will be able to provide an update for the committee on the current situation relating to the project.  The Department placed a reliance on the Office of the Chief State Solicitor to provide legal advice in respect of negotiation of the lease and to carry out the necessary checks, including those relating to planning.  In the circumstances, it was reasonable for the Department to expect that non-compliance of the premises with planning requirements would have been identified and brought to its attention before the lease was signed.</p><p> The Chief State Solicitor has pointed out that her office followed the established conveyancing procedure of relying on a lessor to provide an architect's opinion on compliance with planning requirements.  An opinion was provided, in the required format, by a registered person and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor was entitled to rely on this in accordance with recommended Law Society practice.  Nevertheless, the statutory period to act on a change of use had expired and the basis on which a change of use would be recognised by the planning authorities was specifically referred to in correspondence between the office and the legal representative of the property owners during the lease negotiations.  Furthermore, the nature of the Department's intended use of the premises and the location of the premises in an otherwise residential complex increased the likelihood of objections in the event that there was any doubt as to planning compliance.</p><p> I recommended that the Office of the Chief State Solicitor should review its risk assessment in respect of planning compliance and property acquisitions and the practice of reliance on architects' opinions.  I also recommended that it would consider the need for additional assurance procedures where compliance risks are evident.  The Chief State Solicitor did not agree with that recommendation and will be able to outline her reasoning in that regard to the committee.</p></speech>

My remit as Accounting Officer is very broad.  There are in the region of 60 subheads in the justice Vote, covering a range of offices and agencies across the criminal justice sector, including the areas of immigration, commissions, equality and disability.  I am also the Accounting Officer for the prisons Vote.</p><p>  In my role as Accounting Officer, I acknowledge the contribution of the Department's audit committee in ensuring that there is a strong system of internal controls in place.  The committee is comprised of four external members and one departmental representative.  The chair is external and independent of the Department.  The committee is supported by an internal audit unit.  This unit functions through its audit work programme and provides assurance that there are effective financial and other controls in place.  In 2011, 24 audit reports were completed and the corresponding figure in 2012 was 26.  In a Department with as wide a remit as that of the Department of Justice and Equality, which comprises over 60 individual subheads and a large number of offices and agencies, such audit assurance is crucially important to me in my role as Accounting Officer.  In addition, given the range and breadth of offices and agencies under the justice Vote, it is very important to have a strong governance structure in place.  This is not to say that we want to stifle or restrict in any way the functions of any of the offices and agencies a number of which are established on a statutory basis.  However, I firmly believe that strong oversight is important to ensure the highest standards of financial control and that value for money is obtained from the expenditure in the justice and equality Vote.  This is something I have continued to build on since my appointment as Secretary General in August 2011.</p><p>  A key feature of the governance structure within the Department is that each office and agency attached to the justice and equality Vote, while operating according to its legislative status and its own business plan and objectives, is accountable to the central Department in terms of budgets and expenditure.  In short, with just a couple of exceptions, all the expenditure in the justice and equality Vote is managed through a central accounting system in the Department's financial services centre in Killarney.  The same rules and regulations apply to procurement and expenditure across the Department, irrespective of the office or agency involved.</p><p>  Turning specifically to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of the lease of accommodation for a Probation Service project in Wolfe Tone Street, Dublin, I have found it very frustrating that a building which was acquired under a 25-year lease and fitted out to the standard required for use by the Probation Service cannot now be used for the purpose intended.  However, I have been advised by the Attorney General's office that this matter remains live and in dispute and that proceedings have now issued in this case.  I have also been advised that notwithstanding the publication of chapter 15 of the Comptroller General's annual report for 2011, it is entirely foreseeable that any further discussion of, or comment on, the facts of this matter as set out in that chapter could, in effect, reveal our hand to the other parties in the proceedings, thereby prejudicing the prospect of the State successfully recovering all the damages it is seeking.  I will, of course, try to answer any questions raised by the committee within these constraints.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-21a.46" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eileen Creedon" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013032100005#D00700"><p>I will try to be brief.  If I exceed my allotted time, perhaps the Chairman will let me know.  I am pleased to be able to attend before this committee to discuss the 2011 appropriation account in respect of Vote 13, Office of the Chief State Solicitor, and chapter 15 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for 2011.  This is my first time to appear before the committee since my appointment as Chief State Solicitor just over a year ago.  As requested, I have forwarded a briefing note which sets out the main developments and challenges facing the office and which includes details of expenditure in 2012 and the current position with the Bridge Project, the subject matter of chapter 15.</p><p>  The status of the lease - the subject matter of chapter 15 - remains in dispute between the Department of Justice and Equality, the landlord-receiver and the architect.  I cannot discuss the case before the committee and in that regard I wish to bring its attention to section 3(5) of the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act 1997.  Proceedings have now issued in this case and I would draw the committee's attention to section 5 of the same Act.</p><p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, in his report of 2011, made a recommendation to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  As this recommendation was made in the context of the Comptroller and Auditor General's examination of the issues outlined in the chapter, I am constrained in any response I can give at this time.  I wish to assure the committee that risk assessment is a matter which is taken with the utmost seriousness by me and my office.  A full response to the recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General will be made at the conclusion of this case.  The outcome of this case will inform that response.</p><p>  The committee may be already aware that my office is a constituent part of the Office of the Attorney General and that it provides solicitor services within that office and to Government Departments and offices.  The Office of the Chief State Solicitor has a wide remit including, but not limited to, civil litigation in all courts - including the European Court of Justice - and the provision of solicitor service in the areas of conveyancing and property law, Government contracts and public procurement issues for an array of Civil Service clients.  Many matters are high profile, sensitive, capable of attracting publicity and sometimes can involve emergency applications to court, strict time limits and complex issues of law.  It should be noted that my office does not provide a solicitor service for the Director of Public Prosecutions in the prosecution of offences.</p><p>  As set out in more detail in my briefing document, it must be noted that my office must meet a number of challenges.  In summary, it has to balance the need to operate within the constraints of reduced resources and budget while ensuring that the legal service it is providing is of the highest standard as required by Government and is achieving maximum value for money.</p> <p>We need to attract and retain high calibre staff and ensure that they have the required resources to do their work to the highest standard while continuing to address the need to achieve further savings.  I set out in my statement the administrative budget subheads, on which I can elaborate if necessary, but for the sake of brevity I will move on to counsel fees.</p><p> Expenditure on fees to counsel amounted to 31.2% of overall expenditure from the Vote in 2011.  I should point out that expenditure in this area depends on the level of activity in the courts and is therefore very difficult to forecast accurately.  There are significant controls in place to manage expenditure on fees paid to counsel.  There are procedures previously agreed with the Department of Finance governing payment of counsels&rsquo; fees.  Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sanction is required for any brief fee in excess of &euro;9,525.  The management of expenditure on counsels&rsquo; fees is a key activity for the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office.  These are fees payable to counsel representing the Departments and offices in litigation before the courts and other tribunals and the European Court of Justice.  They also include fees payable for the provision of legal advice for the State, whether sought for the Attorney General&rsquo;s office or for client Departments.  The committee might be interested to hear that the office achieved an overall reduction of 46% when comparing the outturn for 2012 with that of 2008.</p><p> Subhead C deals with general law expenses.  This subhead provides for expenditure on items such as expert witnesses and stenographers fees as well as payments made under the Attorney General&rsquo;s scheme.  Costs incurred accounted for 16.8% of total expenditure.  The objective of the Attorney General&rsquo;s scheme is to provide legal representation in certain types of proceedings to persons who are unable to pay for such representation and where other forms of legal aid are not available.  The administration of the scheme was transferred to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in 2007 with the Chief State Solicitor's office, CSSO, still accountable for the expenditure.  The Legal Aid Board took over responsibility for the administration of the scheme from the Department on 1 June 2012.  As and from 1 January 2013, the Legal Aid Board has assumed responsibility for funding the scheme, which has been renamed the legal aid &ndash; custody issues scheme.  The cost borne by the office in 2011 for the Attorney General&rsquo;s scheme was &euro;4.08 million.  The cost for 2012 was &euro;3.5 million.</p><p> Thank you, Chairman, for allowing me the opportunity to make this short statement.  I will do my best to assist you and your colleagues in your considerations.  In the event that I do not have the information available to me today, I will do my best to provide any outstanding material within two weeks.</p></speech>

On Ms Creedon's comment on chapter 15, the committee has taken legal advice from the parliamentary legal adviser and our advice is that the matter is properly before the committee and therefore in accordance with Standing Order 163 of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the mandate given to the committee that it is up to us to examine the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General with the Accounting Officer.  In this case, as outlined in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the committee must examine how the State has entered a lease, paid out &euro;2 million to date and yet has derived no benefit from the expenditure.  Our job is to follow this by way of examination with the Accounting Officer as there is ineffective expenditure of public money.  This is our job and we would be failing in our mandate if we did not thoroughly examine the issue.</p><p>  An examination of the issue potentially in a number of years' time is not an option for the committee.  My understanding from reading the Comptroller and Auditor General's report is that the State has tried to get out of the lease and that this has been refused.  There is a potential bill to the State of between &euro;4 million to &euro;5 million.  The likelihood of a court case does not mean that the PAC cannot deal with the issue today.  I refer again to the legal advice given to us by the parliamentary legal adviser.  I also note from Mr. Purcell's opening remarks that he is prepared, within the constraints outlined, to answer as many questions as he can.  Understanding the balance that has to be struck between the position of the office and its dealings with the landlord and the work this committee has to undertake, it is our intention this morning to pursue the matter in public session.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-21a.51" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eileen Creedon" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013032100006#E00500"><p>Thank you, Chairman.  I would like to say that under no circumstances is it my intention to in any way be unhelpful to the committee or to obstruct its work.  I am fully cognisant of the function, importance and duty of the committee to examine matters of this kind.  I am also fully cognisant of the right of the committee and the taxpayer to examine issues where taxpayers' money may be seen to be at a loss or misspent in any way.  I fully appreciate that.</p><p>  As the committee members might be aware, litigation has issued in this case and as Chief State Solicitor I am responsible for the carriage of the case.  In keeping my focus on value for the taxpayer and recovering in this case, my primary focus is the safe carriage of the proceedings through the courts.  I am conscious that if I discuss the matter in public or otherwise and prejudice those proceedings, I am therefore prejudicing the likelihood of making a recovery for the taxpayer in this case.  That is the purpose and function of the provisions in the 1997 Act to which I have referred.  It is a long established principle that officers of the Attorney General's office, of which I am one, confine their comments to matters touching on the administration of the office for that reason.  I fully accept that the recommendation made by the Comptroller and Auditor General to me in terms of risk management touches on the administration of the office.  I fully accept that I need to take on board those recommendations and fully respond to them.  I have no difficulty at all with that.  My only difficulty with the discussion of the case, as I have set out in previous correspondence to the committee, is the timing of it and the fact that it could, without any shadow of a doubt, prejudice the chances of us successfully pursuing the litigation to make a recovery.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, we have a certain difficulty with the matter as the case is still live and is in dispute with proceedings having issued.  Like the Chief State Solicitor, I wish to co-operate in every way possible with the committee.  We can answer some questions within the constraints I have outlined.  Would you, Chairman, consider it appropriate for us to deal with the general Vote issues and then go into private session to deal with the issues relating to chapter 15?  That could facilitate a better discussion.  As the Chief State Solicitor has outlined, there would be difficulties.  As I said in the opening statement, it would certainly be foreseeable that a discussion on the matter might reveal our hand in a way that could prejudice the State's ability to successfully prosecute the case.  I accept the principal remit of the committee is to account for public expenditure.  I am frustrated at the situation.  It was one of the first things that was dropped on my desk when I was appointed as Secretary General in the Department.  I am acutely aware of the fact that we are at a point now where proceedings have issued and this is a matter of concern because it will be contested and we do not want to do anything that would jeopardise our case.</p></speech>

There is no difficulty in dealing with the general Vote and the other matters separate from chapter 15.  I am sure members will agree with that.  In the context of chapter 15, the report itself is a public document.  The facts are contained in a public document and I am sure that the content of a public document can be discussed to a point.  The suggestion to use Standing Order 163 to facilitate a private discussion can be called upon as we deal with the issue.  From the point of view of what is contained in the chapter, we can examine it publicly to the point where the witnesses feel it is necessary to go into private session.  We can deal with the Vote separately and then deal with chapter 15 and we can decide to go into private session for the parts of the discussion that are sensitive in terms of the case the office is taking.  We share the view that we must protect taxpayers' money, whether it is the case that money has been spent with poor efficiency or where the State has been left exposed.  The Committee of Public Accounts does not want to do that but we have a job to do.</p> <p>We will deal with the general Vote first and the chapter thereafter.  Mr. Purcell can then intervene and we can go into private session as he wishes.</p></speech>

The figure for the cost of judicial reviews and other legal costs in 2012, in so far as the service is provided by the legal services support unit of the repatriation division, was &euro;4.36 million, which includes the figure for legal challenges taken against decisions to deport or transfer, as well as for challenges to decisions taken by the INIS's EU treaty rights, general immigration and family reunification areas.  A small proportion of the costs involve arises from other legal challenges to procedural decisions in the asylum immigration process, for example, inquiries under Article 40.4 of the Constitution in respect of detention and injunction hearings.  That figure does not include the cost of judicial review proceedings taken against the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal or the citizenship division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  As I said, overall legal costs for all INIS and related areas amounted to &euro;8.6 million and &euro;6.3 million for the years 2011 and 2012, respectively.</p><p>  Where the courts rule in favour of an applicant, legal costs in a case are usually awarded against the Minister and the applicant's costs are met from the Minister's Vote.  The applicant's costs may also be met from the Minister's Vote in certain cases arising from settlements between the parties.  The Minister's own legal costs which are very significant are met from the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor's office and, consequently, are reflected in the figure given.  Contributions towards the Minister's legal costs have been received from the applicants in a small number of cases and recovery of these costs was managed by the Chief State Solicitor's office.</p><p>  On processing times, one of the matters on which we have received a certain level of criticism during the years has been the asylum system and the length of time it takes to process asylum applications, with the duration of waiting times regularly quoted in years.  That view is not necessarily correct and may sometimes be informed by a misunderstanding of the processing system.  In 2012 the Minister made 1,023 decisions on refugee status.  The medium processing time of asylum applications, including the appeal stage, in this period was 8.3 months.  Persons who are refused asylum enter what is commonly referred to as the leave to remain process under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999.  This is separate from the asylum or refugee status determination process.  The leave to remain process involves consideration of applications for subsidiary protection and other reasons a failed asylum seeker may present for remaining in the State.  The processing of such cases is complex and extremely resource intensive.  The investigation of the subsidiary protection application requires a fresh examination of the entire asylum file, the documentation and country of origin information submitted in support of the application, as well as an examination of the objective and reputable up-to-date country of origin information before a conclusion can be arrived at as to whether the applicant is likely to be exposed to serious harm if returned to his or her country of origin.  Where such an application is refused, consideration must be given to the case in accordance with the provisions of section 3 of the Act, at which point the Minister must make a decision as to whether to make a deportation order in respect of the person concerned.  All of this must be carried out in strict compliance with the Constitution, together with relevant international treaties such as the European Convention on Human Rights.  It will be seen that these are not quick or easy decisions to make, given the life-changing consequences for the persons involved and because of this, decisions must be taken with the most scrupulous care and attention.  </p><p>  Steps have been taken to speed up the processing of applications, initially by redeploying staff from the refugee determination bodies and more recently by the decision to establish a case processing panel of legally qualified graduates to assist in clearing the backlog.  In addition, we hope the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill will substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements and provide applicants with a final decision on their applications in a more straightforward and timely fashion.</p></speech>

The intention is to process these cases as quickly as possible but, as I indicated, decisions can be subject to challenge.  Because of the scrupulous care that has to be applied, this can sometimes delay the process.  If the Deputy wishes, I will forward to him a complete breakdown of all the statistics, facts and figures for all aspects of the process.</p></speech>

There is not a precise target time; it depends.  The individual elements of particular cases are all so different so there is not a precise target time.  I hope I can provide the Deputy with a breakdown of the actual time taken for each element.  It is so difficult because of the very different circumstances that apply in individual cases, but the target is to process these cases as quickly as possible given the difficulties and complexities involved owing to the very personal detail required for every case.  As has often been seen, because of the difficult circumstances in which many people find themselves as they come into the system, there can be issues in relation to documentation not being available.  This, in turn, can create delays.  These are the particular problems that the people processing the cases have to deal with.</p></speech>

I have dealt with individuals who are seeking asylum and also the officials, who all do a great job.  As Mr. Purcell pointed out, it is a very difficult and complicated issue.  I am aware of the amount of public commentary on how long some people are waiting and am struck by the fact that if I look at the different budget allocations in regard to immigration and asylum overall, I discover that cumulatively they comprise the largest single Estimate of the entire Vote by a long way.  Should we not have a target time by which applications are processed?</p></speech>

If we were to set target times in the cases we are dealing with, there would be a danger that they would be so far out that we would be criticised for setting targets indicating it would take too long to deal with these cases.  Alternatively, if we put down tighter target times, we would almost be putting them down in the certain knowledge that we would not be able to meet them.  The hope is that when the immigration Bill is brought through, it will go some way towards streamlining the process and enabling quicker delivery.  We are not trying to avoid anything or make things easy for ourselves because, as the Deputy knows well from his experience in dealing with these cases, they are so complex that it is difficult to estimate at the beginning how long they will take.  As cases progress, invariably and inevitably fresh material begins to arise.  Setting targets could create a risk in that they could be too far out or too tight.  It is impossible to set targets for the broad range of cases and there can be such significant variation in individual cases.</p></speech>

The taxpayer who is funding the process has a right to know how long it will take.  As I stated, the funding for the INIS is &euro;57 million.</p></speech>

The asylum element, although it is a significant part of the process and very intensive in terms of the work involved for the State, the people concerned and the agencies who help them, is only a part of the process.  I will raise this matter in discussions with the officials in INIS to determine whether there is any way in which we could come up with a set of targets that would be meaningful, particularly with an eye to the enactment of the immigration Bill.  We will consider this.</p></speech>

They have a reasonable expectation that there would be objectives in place regarding how long the process will take, notwithstanding the complexities to which Mr. Purcell has alluded and of which I am aware.</p><p>  Let me move on to the operation of the process overall.  As Mr. Purcell rightly pointed out, the asylum seeking end is a portion of a wider set of services that we provide.  For those who are seeking to make citizenship applications, as opposed to those seeking asylum seeker status, how long does the process take?</p></speech>

In 2011 and  2012, more than 38,000 valid applications were received.  In the period from 9 March 2011 to 8 February 2013, a total of 45,800 valid applications were determined.  By contrast, in 2010, a decision was reached in just under 7,800 cases.  So far this year, decisions have been made on 8,300 applications, with the volume for 2013 to be similar to that achieved in 2012.</p></speech>

A recent report found the Department of Justice and Equality spent &euro;655 million on asylum seekers' accommodation from 2000 to 2010.  Obviously, this is a very large amount of money but, as I stated, it is spent for people who deserve accommodation as they wait for a decision to be made for them.  An additional report found that one company was paid &euro;89.5 million across the period.  What steps have been taken to monitor the current cost of direct provision accommodation?  What steps have been taken by the Department to reduce that cost?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-21a.112" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Purcell" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013032100009#H02500"><p>In summary, as has been indicated, it is a very costly system.  A value for money report in 2010 stated there was no cheaper alternative to direct provision.  However, we constantly give consideration to options for reductions in the cost of the accommodation provision given the tight nature of the available budget.  Due to the exceptionally difficult state of the national finances and in response to the need for all Departments to achieve such reductions, we have been looking closely at expenditure in all areas, including the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA.  In that context, we sought and achieved a reduction in spending by an overall 6% from April to December 2009.  That was the equivalent, over a full year, to 8% and these savings continue to be implemented through 2010, 2011, 2012 and beyond.  Together with the rate and bed reductions achieved under this exercise, we have been able to deliver a level of savings that has enabled us to live within our overall budget.</p><p>  We monitor closely all elements of the cost in the centres and continually strive to deliver value for money.  One thing we have tried to do in more recent years is to reduce the level of vacant beds we are obliged to carry in the system.  We have managed to achieve that to a point where we never have more than a maximum of 10% of vacant beds in the system.  We have had this in place since 2011.  It is a large and complex undertaking and as the Deputy is aware, it initially was introduced in a crisis situation and has evolved subsequently.  The primary objective is to provide a level of accommodation and service that is suitable in the particular circumstances.  However, we are doing everything possible to try to ensure we get value for money.  The nature of the element of expenditure to particular contractors obviously is a result of the number of centres we have and their location.</p></speech>

Consequently, simply getting a building from NAMA would only give one the actual building itself.  The likelihood is one then might be obliged to incur further expenditure on modifying it or making whatever structural changes were required.  However, it is not just about the provision of accommodation but also pertains to the services that are provided by the RIA.  In fact, this represents a substantial element of the cost of provision, that is, the contracts that are in place.</p></speech>

It is there to provide a particular service.  We do not necessarily agree with some of the criticisms made regarding the services the agency provides.  It is there to serve a purpose in that we must accommodate people within the system while their cases are being dealt with and it is an effective and cost-efficient mechanism for so doing.  We ensure that standards are maintained.  Undoubtedly, many of the people in the centres would prefer to be living in accommodation that might be provided by local authorities and so on.</p> <p>However, the reality is that if everyone who was in RIA accommodation was put into circumstances where local authorities had to provide housing and other State agencies had to provide the full range of services to them outside the RIA system, the cost to the State would be massive.</p></speech>

We hold clinics in all of them with the people who are resident in the centres at which they have the opportunity to raise any problems they may have.  On a day-to-day basis, they have an opportunity to raise such issues with the management of the centres involved.</p><p>  Having said that, complaints are made and people are not necessarily happy to stay in these centres for lengthy periods.  We have conducted value for money surveys and we believe this is the best, most effective and certainly the most cost-effective way of providing a humane residential accommodation mechanism for those who find themselves in the process.  Nobody has ever said that the system is perfect, but if there are any failings or if standards are not being complied with, we do try to deal with them quickly and effectively.</p></speech>

I accept that point but I wish to go back to the issue we discussed earlier regarding the targets for how long this has been processed.  From dealing with this issue in my constituency, it appears to me that it is pivotal to handle the applications as quickly as possible as well as giving people an understanding of how long it can take.  That can go some way towards allaying much of the difficulty we are discussing.</p></speech>

The Deputy's point is valid.  The length of time that people stay in direct provision is an issue of which we are well aware.  When the phenomenon first came into effect at the turn of the century - it seems strange to be saying that - it was believed they would not have to spend as long as they did.  The experience we have had, however - and this is reflected in other systems elsewhere - is that the underlying question people ask is whether they can stay there.  This question means that even after a determination has been made, they will continue to seek to stay there through every mechanism in place.  It does go the full run of every challenge.  In cases where decisions are taken that people are not going to stay, it can be a long drawn out process.  That, effectively, is the nature of the system.  One could possibly deal with cases much more quickly by getting a decision and then people would be out of the country altogether.  However, given the nature of the process and the scrupulous level of care that has to be applied, it is almost inevitable.</p></speech>

I was not going to refer to the asylum and immigration process but I will react because it is something with which I am familiar and deal with a lot.  When the history of this period is written, we will look back at the institutionalisation of people for five or six years, whereby they suffer from mental health issues due to the boredom involved.  They have &euro;19 a week which barely gets them by and they have no activity.  They are languishing and afraid in a nihilistic existence where they are constantly awaiting a letter to say they will be deported or are allowed to stay.  That history will be damning for the Department and this State.</p><p>  I accept that Mr. Purcell is implementing a policy decision.  I heard him say it is a humane system which serves a purpose and fits in, but those are the type of things we said about the residential institutions and Magdalen laundries over the years.  When we look back, it will be with severe scorn.  I am not directing that criticism at the Secretary General personally, but I must react to the conversation that took place earlier.  Is it true that the system of direct provision was initially introduced with a proviso that no one would stay in it for longer than six months?</p></speech>

The language used to justify those cases is similar to the language we use today to justify keeping families of poor people in a small hotel room for six years, not knowing what is going on, with no money or resources and very little educational standards coming out of it.  That is what I think.</p></speech>

Unlike the situation in years gone by, however, there is a level of examination of what is going on.  Deputies take a big interest in this particular issue.  The very fact that it is open to criticism and that we do our best to address the issues raised is a clear indication that we are not dealing with a situation such as the one the Deputy outlined.  I know that he does not intend to make that direct comparison.</p><p>  It is difficult for the people involved in running these centres and it is tough for the people who are there.  Anyone can understand that where one has uncertainty about one's own or one's family position, it will obviously have an impact on people.  The longer that level of uncertainty goes on, it is bound to have an impact.  It would have an impact on any of us if we found ourselves in those situations.  We must, therefore, try to ensure that the system is in a position to deal with the applications as quickly as possible.</p><p>  I know the Deputy has been involved extensively with the centres in Galway.  He will know that as things progress through the system, there are various stages and challenges which are part and parcel of the process we have.  In turn, that can lengthen the stay for people there.</p></speech>

As I mentioned when speaking to Deputy Donohoe, however, that has been the experience of systems internationally.  Initially the intention was that people would not have to spend too much time in them.  When it was initially set up it was in response to a certain number coming in, but there was a massive expansion in the numbers of people being put through the system.</p></speech>

I am straying into policy issues that we are not really supposed to go into, so I am happy to leave it there.</p><p>  I have one factual question that I would like to ask.  The current system through which most people go is that they apply and are refused.  When they appeal, they are normally refused and then they either go for humanitarian leave to remain or many will opt for a judicial review of their cases.  At the current rate at which judicial review proceedings are being processed by the High Court for those in the asylum and immigration process, how long will it take for all those cases to be dealt with?</p></speech>

We had 314 new judicial review cases in 2012, 453 in 2011 and 374 in 2010.  In 2012 we had 350 cases finalised, 191 in 2011 and 235 in 2010.

However, it will just be an indicative figure which will not necessarily stand up.

Without knowing the circumstances of the case, I imagine, given the time involved, that the application has gone through a level of complexity and probably for judicial review.  As the Deputy knows from his experience in dealing with such cases, they tend to be very complex.  While everyone would prefer that the system could move quicker, it does depend on its ability to process them and, particularly with the cases that go to court, it is down to the ability of the courts system to move them through.</p></speech>

All Departments are operating under constraints in terms of budgets and staff numbers.  We operate under the same constraints with regard to staff numbers and salaries.  We are down to a very low base in terms of recruitment salary.  These are changes that have been made because of the current economic situation.</p></speech>

I can only offer contracts to keep within my ECF, employment control framework, budget.  Despite the economic downturn and the environment in the private sector, it is still very difficult to recruit and retain staff at that level.  That is a challenge for me.  As I set out in my briefing document, the level of work through the office is complex, important and requires specialisms.  I have a large cohort of dedicated and highly qualified staff.  However, as my staff depletes from the top owing to retirements and other issues, recruitment at the bottom remains very challenging.</p></speech>

They will join rather than remain unemployed.  It is gratifying for me that when solicitors join the office, they find the work rewarding and interesting.  However, it is difficult for them to stay with me if they get an offer in excess of the salary we offer.  There was a time when I would have had discretion on the entry scale, depending on an entrant's qualifications and experience.  That discretion has been taken from me.  There were also some increments I could award within that scale to ease the pain of the low entry salary, but that has also been taken away.  This double-whammy imposed in 2010 has made recruitment difficult.</p></speech>

Is that as a result of the office reducing the fees it is paying by a straight cut or is it through skill mixes such as hiring a junior counsel when once a senior counsel was hired?  As a result of this reduction, do senior or junior counsel refuse to work for the office as the fees are too low?</p></speech>

As I said in my briefing document, the review and management of counsel fees is a key activity for the office.  Reviews of fees are sent to a high level group in the office in order that all fee notes are reviewed before they are paid.</p> <p>We have been driving at this hard since 2008 and, as the Deputy can see, it has borne results.  We are conscious, however, that we may at some point reach the floor.  Obviously, because of the type of work that goes through the office, it is very important that the Attorney General be able to recruit counsel with the skills and at the level required for some of the very high end public law cases.  We are keeping a tight watch in that regard.  Certainly we have received feedback from counsel indicating that they believe it has become very tight, but it has become very tight for everybody everywhere.  We have achieved these results.  We are not saying we have hit the bottom; we may not have.  However, we are in a changed environment, with two new taxing masters.  We are watching and keeping with it, but it is due to the reducing amount of money we are paying.</p></speech>

I am looking at the figures for 2012 when a small number applied for asylum.  Some 2,239 persons were refused entry to the State at ports of entry and returned to the place from where they had come.  A small number of these persons applied for asylum and were subsequently granted permission to enter the State in order that their applications could be processed.  There is a constant number of persons coming into the system who are turned around at the border.</p></speech>

By the end of 2012, 60% of residents in the centres had been resident there for more than three years.  According to the figures available to me, 272 persons have been waiting more than seven years to have their applications processed.  What causes such a delay of seven years?</p></speech>

In addition to others, the RIA accommodates persons who are involved in judicial review proceedings.  They are persons who have applied for subsidiary protection.  There are also those who have received deportation orders and are appealing against them.  There are a number of steps in the process.  The effect of all these steps is that it takes time and that, in turn, means they spend a longer time in the system.</p><p>  The persons to whom the Deputy refers who spend a significant number of years within the system are generally those who go right through the process.  I will not use the word "exhausted", but they go through steps.  For example, sometimes there can be delays because after an individual has gone through every stage of the process, he or she then goes through the same steps for his or her children.  This can result in - I hesitate to use the word - delays and increase the length of time they spend in the system.</p><p>  It is a complex legal issue.  I am not sure whether the Deputy was present when I spoke earlier, but we have a duty of care and must be scrupulously careful in the way we deal with these cases because of our obligations under international law.</p></speech>

I am asking not just about the accommodation but what they are permitted to do.

There is a mix of single males, single females, single females with children, a male and female with children.  There is a range of mixes and obviously, then, they would have differing needs.  Depending on the type of accommodation, some of it might be more suitable for single males, for example, than it would be for families.  The level of accommodation and services provided would differ because of that.  That would generally be the reason.  The average rate paid to commercial contractors is around &euro;30 per person per day.</p></speech>

It states that the State has spent &euro;2 million, &euro;1 million on furbishing and &euro;1 million on leases for premises in Dublin that have never been used.  In addition, other premises have had to be sought so additional rent is being paid on top of that.  We have been left with this chapter 15 outturn.  Ms Creedon sent us correspondence quoting the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act 1997.  That Act allows us to seek permission from the Oireachtas committee to compel witnesses and so on.  It has only been used once - for the DIRT inquiry.  Why did she quote that Act to us in her correspondence?</p></speech>

I appreciate that the committee is not in compellability mode at the moment and that I am here by invitation, but I am constrained.  The purpose of section 3 allows the committee to direct certain evidence to be given and papers to be produced.  It has a specific subsection - subsection 5 - and I am an officer of the Office of the Attorney General.</p></speech>

There is very good reason for that.  Section 3 deals with the solicitor-client privilege which is a very important matter.  Section 5 deals with live matters before the courts.  While we are not in compellability mode, I submit that these have been invoked before in similar circumstances where we have been here by invitation and have been accepted by this committee on previous occasions.  If it is a case that the committee wishes to go into compellability mode with me, that is another issue but I am compelled to adhere to these sections because of my overriding duty to the taxpayer to pursue this remedy in these circumstances.  </p></speech>

The first question does not relate to the planning issue.  I suppose it does relate to planning but it concerns car parking spaces.  Paragraph 15.10 concerns how the Chief State Solicitor's office raised planning concerns about eight car parking spaces for use by the Bridge Project.  The office was offered eight car parking spaces but it discovered that something was wrong and excluded them.  Could Ms Creedon give me the background on that?</p></speech>

Therefore, members have an obligation to go through that report and to ask the questions they see as appropriate.  As I see it, from his opening remarks and exchanges up to now, Deputy Nolan can proceed and ask questions but he must bear in mind the constraints mentioned by Mr. Purcell in his opening remarks.  The only footnote to that is that under Standing Order 163, we would be obliged to go into private session should it be requested.  However, the fact is that we are now in public session and Deputy Nolan can ask the questions arising from the chapter if he observes the constraints that Mr. Purcell outlined at the beginning.  He said that Ms Creedon was under certain constraints but there were certain questions she would answer and I think we should proceed on that basis.</p></speech>

I thought I was touching on a topic that was not central to the litigation.  I can ask some general questions but they are all in the chapter.  What I want to understand is why we have the problem.  There are suggestions in this chapter and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that may lay some blame on the Chief State Solicitor's office for the problem we have.  That is what I want to look into and ask questions about.</p></speech>

If Deputy Nolan pursued his questions along those lines, I would ask both the Accounting Officer and the Chief State Solicitor to co-operate with the questions that are being asked as long as we observe those constraints.</p></speech>

The point I am making is that these matters were ongoing so effectively the Comptroller and Auditor General still felt he was able to complete his report.  In that context, there is nothing that has now come into the domain bar what happened yesterday that would in any way change the type of report the Comptroller and Auditor General would have completed.</p></speech>

The focus of the report was really to try and be forward looking and to focus on a general issue of reliance on a compliance certificate issued by a representative of the vendor, a person retained by the vendor or a lessor.  I felt that the suggestion and recommendation I was making was a reasonable one to avoid a similar situation occurring in the future rather than looking into the rights and wrongs, which are matters for the courts to determine in respect of this specific case.</p></speech>

The premises that housed the Bridge Project had its rent increased from &euro;90,000 to &euro;125,000 per year.  Alternative accommodation was sought and a lease with a payment of approximately &euro;300,000 per year was entered into.  When that lease did not work out, the project moved to a premises in Gardiner Row where it is paying &euro;600 per month for the specific rooms.  In addition, the community employment scheme will rent premises at &euro;4,000 per year.  They are currently in accommodation that is costing &euro;10,000 per year whereas a number of years ago, it seemed prudent to go to a place that would cost &euro;300,000 per year from a rent of &euro;125,000 per year.  Are those figures accurate and do they not show that in the first instance, an exorbitant amount of money was being paid in rent for this project?</p></speech>

The Wolfe Tone Street premises was to cost approximately &euro;300,000 a year.  Currently, the project is being housed at premises costing &euro;10,000 a year.  There is a huge difference.  Was it prudent and sound to enter into a &euro;300,000 lease when the project is functioning adequately from a premises costing &euro;10,000 per year?</p></speech>

The head of the Probation and Welfare Service, PWS, is in attendance and if he wishes to address the matter, I will give him the opportunity.  There were limitations to the premises being used in Parnell Street.  Subsequently, those premises had to be vacated due to concerns about fire and safety issues.  An attempt was then made to find suitable premises in the area.</p><p>  From the time the Bridge Project came into being, it was located in Dublin 1 in the vicinity of Parnell Street.  There were reasons it was desirable to maintain the premises in that general area, which I am sure the head of the PWS will go into.  A suitable premises was sought out.  The particular premises under discussion came onto the radar.  At the time, the OPW was engaged to ascertain whether the rent sought was reasonable by reference to similar accommodation in the area.  It should be remembered that this was at the peak of the boom.  In hindsight, it appears from the way the market has gone since that the figure was expensive in terms of both what had been paid out previously and what was actually paid out.  At the time, the PWS engaged with the OPW, which was the body that gave the go-ahead.  The OPW assessment was that the rent represented the lower end of the market for the type of accommodation in the area.</p></speech>

Since then, the project has moved to a different premises on Parnell Street.  The rent at this last premises is &euro;45,000 per annum.  The premises at Gardiner Row, which we got at &euro;600 per month, represented a short-term stopgap arrangement and continued only for a number of months.</p></speech>

I accept that rents have dropped but not to the extent that &euro;45,000 is enough.</p></speech>

It is a very narrow and thin line.  My overriding duty relates to the remedy we have through the courts.  The taxpayer would not be grateful to me if I were to prejudice that remedy in any way.  That is the thin line.  There are provisions in the Act about which we had an earlier discussion.  They are there for a very important reason.  We know why they are there.  It is in order to allow matters such as this to proceed safely.  I am duty bound to adhere to them and I cannot resile from them because I have carriage of the case now and must steer it through.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-21a.374" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eileen Creedon" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013032100017#Q03200"><p>They did, exactly.  Yes.  We are now in live litigation in respect of a live dispute.  My remedy is through the courts and that is my primary concern.</p></speech>

This is now March 2013 and there is clearly an issue for which Ms Creedon seeks a remedy through the courts, which is as it should be.  We all place the interest of the taxpayer at the centre.  There is also an issue for the committee, not just in terms of moneys expended or forgone in any particular arrangement but also in terms of the decision-making structures and the level of oversight that was at play.  For me, the latter outweighs the issue of moneys in this particular case.  It struck me, in private or public session, that we cannot have or the witnesses are not prepared to have a discussion on these matters.  We need to know the precise sequence of events of the acquisition and the remodelling of the premises which were never occupied.  We need to know the exact whos, whys and wheres of how that transpired because that is where the taxpayers' interest is best served.</p></speech>

There is no question of not entering into a discussion about those facts.  It is the timing because they are exactly the issues which will be the subject matter of the court case.</p></speech>

If members agree that to be the case, we will close this exchange and return to discussing the general Vote.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputy Eoghan Murphy was in possession and had asked questions on the general vote.  I call on the Deputy to continue and he has five minutes left.</p></speech>

However, there are cases where deportation orders are issued but the person is not deported for quite some time.  I have figures from a reply to a parliamentary question in November 2012 which give a breakdown up to the end of October that year.  The number of notifications of intention to deport that were issued was 1,779, while the number of persons removed by the State was 246.  The number of persons who voluntarily returned to their country of origin was 387 and the number of persons granted leave to remain was 951.  Looking at the asylum seeker numbers and those who are classified as asylum seekers, there are 272 people in the system for as long as seven years.  I presume those are mainly people who have been issued with deportation orders but who have challenged that and requested leave to remain.</p></speech>

They might not all have necessarily got to the point where a deportation order has issued.</p></speech>

Once all the mechanisms are exhausted and if there are no further appeals arising, deportations are effected as quickly as they can be.  However, sometimes the process will go all the way and then another challenge will be brought.  One cannot definitely say in a case where a deportation order is issued that it will not be challenged.  However, once the process has been completely exhausted and there is no further appeal or if the deportation order is appealed, the case has been heard and the decision is that the deportation order is valid, the mechanisms begin to kick into place in terms of removing the people who are subject to the deportation orders.  However, it is a slow process.  All sorts of things must be taken into consideration in respect of moving people out.</p></speech>

Are all their rights gone at that stage with regard to possibly remaining the country for any additional period of time?</p></speech>

I can give the Deputy the figures for those.  In 2012, leave to remain was granted in 564 cases.  They would usually be granted for a period of three years but can be granted for a shorter period, where the Minister deems it appropriate.  It would of course be subject to complying with the laws of the State.</p></speech>

If people are told they will be deported, they can come back into the formal system by applying for leave to remain.  However, I am asking about when that process has expired and the person has not been successful and is due to be deported.  When the Department moves to deport that person and it turns out that it will interfere in a significant way, for example, with somebody in education where a family is being deported, does the family have a right to put a halt to proceedings and to give them that three or six-month period before we proceed to remove them from the State?</p></speech>

It may be the best the Department can do with the allocation it has and, bearing in mind the draw factor to which Mr. Purcell referred, it is absolutely appalling that some people are left locked in that system for years.  It has definitely affected their families, their mental health and how they view things.  To condemn them for that period of time while not allowing them to do anything or contribute in any way is a policy matter but the system, in dealing with these cases, should have recommended greater efficiencies to achieve an answer, whether to remain or to go.  That should be our target.  I accept that Mr. Purcell cannot give specific targets but that should be a general one.</p></speech>

We entered into a joint project with Dublin City Council.  A tender was issued and the contract was awarded to Michael McNamara.  That proceeded down a particular route and then NAMA appointed a receiver to the Michael McNamara company in November 2010.  As a result, all construction work on the project ceased.  That gave rise to a complex legal procurement issue and other considerations.  By that time, we had contributed almost &euro;2.8 million to the project.  At the time, the capital resources available to the Department were being cut and the comprehensive review of expenditure was carried out.  As a result, we did not have the money to proceed even if we had been in a position to retender to seek a contractor to complete the process.</p></speech>

I am not going to go back over the history of every project that would have begun, many of them were before my time in the  job.  On this project, however, I am not sure how we could have managed it any better in the circumstances.  The contract was awarded and through no fault of our own, the company that was awarded the contract went into receivership.  It was not in a position to proceed with the project and by the time we were at a point where if we had gone to tender to engage another company to complete the project, we did not have the money because our capital budget had been cut.  We could not proceed.  It was not a case that we walked away from a project, writing it off because we had made that decision.  We had no option.</p></speech>

He can explain it away all he likes but when I put this along side the history I have seen from the Department, whether before Mr. Purcell's time or not, going back to 2000, and the leases for properties that were never used, property we discussed earlier that is now subject to a court case, and this project, it all adds up to a shocking amount of money.  That is my point.  I understand the Department has a case to make in saying it had no money but I would have planned this differently if I had been there when the &euro;2.8 million was being spent, along with the &euro;1 million from Dublin City Council.</p></speech>

Some of the properties were then off-loaded for small amounts to the OPW or the HSE.  There are examples of that throughout the country and bearing that in mind, the recent discussion we had with the Chief State Solicitor's office and now the Department on this property, it all goes to show that the Department could manage its affairs better.</p></speech>

The reports from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General on this and other buildings, which may have happened before Mr. Purcell's time, bear that out.</p><p>  There should be far greater control on the spending of public money on projects.  I am sure there is no single person who will be convinced there were no plans for the overall costs of a building on which &euro;3.8 million was spent.  There must have been a plan to get funds after &euro;2.8 million was spent and arrangements must have been in place to fund the difference, notwithstanding the arrangements and the difficulty experienced with the contractor, who walked away with &euro;3.8 million.</p><p>  I will now deal with the cost of tribunals.

The Deputy will see the difficulty that arises where the CAB is going after the proceeds of crime and the legal representatives may not be paid from the proceeds of crime.  This is one of the reasons the legal aid scheme covers cases going before the CAB.  In addition, if one looks back at the CAB and proceeds of crime legislation, which is highly innovative and based on the reversal of the burden of proof, etc., we must also be careful that nothing is done to impinge on the rights of people whose assets are being confiscated in those circumstances.  As I stated, this is complicated by the particular fact that legal representatives cannot accept-----</p></speech>

The commitment in the programme for Government is very clear.  The new legislation is absolutely necessary and required and, I hope, will be fit for purpose.  All things being equal, that should reduce the waiting time for applicants, all of which would be tremendously welcome.  That point has been well made.  Given that the commitment is to move away from direct provision, not just to reduce the numbers in direct provision, would it not be wise for the Department to consider what the alternative model might look like, its shape, and the cost implications?</p> <p>I do not get the sense the Minister has had that conversation or planned that with the Secretary General.</p></speech>

Before we can move away from direct provision, we must first reduce the numbers.  I suppose we could just take the numbers in direct provision and move them out of it, but we are not in a position to do that.</p></speech>

My recollection is that direct provision costs the State one third less than it would cost another system to deliver.  As Accounting Officer for the Department of Justice and Equality, I know that if all the direct provision costs in my Department's Vote were gone, there would be substantial savings in the Vote.  This would be most welcome from my perspective, but the result would be that the overall cost to the State would be significantly greater than the cost of direct provision to the Department currently.  Before we can get out of direct provision, we must reduce the numbers in it.  If we were to try to do that very quickly or any time soon, we would not have a seamless transition and there would be massive costs involved.</p></speech>

Obviously, the objective of the legislation is to ensure that the current long and torturous procedure for applicants is shortened, mitigated and made more transparent, fair and timely.  However, I am concerned that if the settled position is to move away from direct provision, it would be a matter of good planning that the Department, under the direction of the Secretary General, would be considering the various models and planning for that change.  I sense that is not the case.  Therefore, this does not strike an optimistic note for those of us who would wish to see an end to direct provision.</p></speech>

When this issue came to the Department first, we had to move extremely quickly to deal with it.  This is not something that will require a two-year planning process.  When we arrive at a point when we can see this will happen soon or that we will be in a position to move on it, we will start looking at the detailed planning aspects of it.</p></speech>

I would appreciate hearing his understanding of the situation and what interaction his Department has, if any, with the HSE in respect of these children.  Is it involved in their processing when they initially land in the State and in their treatment thereafter?  With regard to those still on the missing list, what contribution does the Department make towards establishing their whereabouts?</p></speech>

However, we do not accommodate individual families which do not have any status or permission to be in this State.  I will check this matter out and will get back to the Deputy on it.</p></speech>

We are grateful to have the opportunity to address the sub-committee on the important topic of angling tourism with particular reference to sea angling.</p><p>  Sea angling is a component of the mix of economic pursuits that make up inshore water-based activities.  The mix in the inshore area requires State, commercial and recreational users to contribute to a delicate balance between sometimes complementary but often competing interests.  The angling sector is estimated to contribute in excess of &euro;500 million annually to the national economy and to underpin employment and income earning for around 10,000 people, mostly in peripheral and rural communities and particularly along the western seaboard.  Sea angling, which is the particular focus of the sub-committee, attracts almost 100,000 participants and generates income of approximately &euro;100 million which is spent almost entirely in the communities in which the activity is based.  We make our presentation to assist the sub-committee in its consideration of the tourism angling sector and to show where sea angling fits into that area.  It is timely to address the sub-committee as Inland Fisheries Ireland is about to publish a comprehensive study of the national angling product and of the requirements and expectations of the customer, both domestic and overseas.  The study is currently being finalised.</p><p>  The study asked anglers, both domestic and international, what their expectations were and its results will offer a strategic guide to build on development plans for the sector to underpin employment and income in the angling sector and in the related hospitality and transport areas.  I stress again that the income generated from angling is spent almost entirely within local communities, which concentration on local earning and spending is almost unique in the inshore sector.  Our presentations will outline some of the most revealing results of the study and provide the sub-committee with a sense of the value and development potential of the sector while emphasising the importance of recreational sea angling to continued viable income generation in coastal communities.</p><p>  Inland Fisheries Ireland, a statutory, independent agency under the aegis of the Department of Communications Energy and Natural Resources, is responsible for the conservation, protection and development of the inland fisheries resource and recreational sea angling.  It has also a remit to promote the inland fisheries and sea angling resource.  IFI has national responsibilities under the EU habitats directive, the water framework directive and eel regulations.  IFI is mindful that the inshore area is vital to coastal communities, and exploitation of this sensitive resource requires a balance among sustainable developments across all sectors, underpinned by a cohesive approach among stakeholders.  It also requires a balance with the State's international obligations on the environment, conservation, biodiversity and natural resource management.  IFI is active in offering inputs to support and advise on development proposals which might impact areas in which we have expertise.  The key objective is to facilitate sectors to develop in a manner that protects as far as possible finite resources and ensures that developments benefit to the greatest extent possible the local communities in which they are based.</p><p>  IFI's development strategy for angling and sea angling in particular is based around keeping visitors returning to Ireland because the quality of the fishing and the support services are second to none.  We must continually reinforce the message that Ireland is an angling paradise, that the infrastructure and information are available to provide for a wonderful angling holiday experience and that there is a real welcome for anglers and the euro they bring.  IFI has an agreed angling marketing strategy with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland.  It also works on an all-island basis with Northern Ireland's Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and the Loughs Agency to market Irish angling internationally.  IFI supports its industry and trade partners to produce information, attend trade shows, market directly to customers and develop the angling product.  IFI's business development section is resourced to deliver on IFI's aim to increase the number of anglers and increase the return from angling and inland fisheries to Ireland.</p><p>  Stable development and balanced exploitation is the cornerstone of IFI's resource management strategy.  The ongoing collaboration between IFI and its partners can ensure Ireland develops sustainably as a top-class angling destination.  The development of sea angling and angling tourism in general requires a modern legislative base.  The Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, who has responsibility for the inland fisheries resource, has advanced a project to modernise and simplify the entire inland fisheries legislative code.  This project will serve the sector well into the future.  The review of legislation will go to public consultation in the near future.  A key overriding objective of the legislative project is to put in place a statutory basis for IFI to develop the potential of the sector by increasing the number of anglers utilising the resource, empowering stakeholders to take an active role in its development and to maximise the returns from inland fisheries to local communities and the State.</p></speech>

As such, we do a great deal of work to promote all angling activities in Ireland, including the sea angling product.  Shore angling is perhaps the most popular form of sea angling in Ireland and attracts many participants who fish estuaries and from piers, rocks and beaches all around the coast.  Shore angling can take place during 12 months of the year.  Small boat angling is carried out by anglers from locally owned small boats at small ports nationally.  Small boats go out about 5 km and the activity is weather dependent.</p> <p>For the most part, small boat angling takes place from spring to autumn.  There are approximately 80 chartered skippers nationally who run small businesses based in local communities.  Up to 12 people can go out on a boat hired from a chartered skipper for the day.  They go up to 30 km out to sea.  The species targeted by anglers include bass, shark, ling, cod, pollock and, the one everyone thinks of, mackerel.  There are 33 species which are regularly the subject of a normal small boats competition in the south east or south west.</p><p> Sea angling is an important part of the overall Irish angling product.  The latest comprehensive study which is about to be finalised indicates that angling is worth more than &euro;500 million to the economy and is estimated to support 10,000 jobs in rural and peripheral communities.  I cannot stress enough that recent studies from NUIG demonstrate that all of the income generated by small, community-based, marine businesses stays in the local area.  It has been estimated that there is a multiplier effect of 0.48 with such income.  If &euro;1 million is spent, there is &euro;1.5 million worth of an economic impact in local and peripheral communities.  The statistics which our survey is generating show that there are 250,000 Irish anglers who are currently active.  Approximately 250,000 further anglers have fished in the past and would like to go fishing again.  We have identified 40,600 anglers coming from Northern Ireland while the latest figures from Tourism Ireland show that in 2011, 113,000 came from European and other destinations.  Participants in sea angling number 97,000.  While that suggests that 25% of all anglers are sea anglers, it is a complex area.  Most anglers target a number of species.  One could have a salmon angler who is also a bass angler and a trout angler or a sea angler who also fishes for pike or other coarse species.</p><p> Our study comprised a household survey carried out in two tranches at two different times of the year, a survey of recreational anglers carried out at 50 locations nationally and a survey of stakeholders including trade and industry interests.  Sea anglers take 773,500 trips per year and 72% of them are under 55 years of age.  Almost 25% of anglers are in the 18 to 34 years age bracket, which is a slightly different profile to the perception of anglers which exists.  Anglers are generally seen as grey-haired men older than 55 years.  We have a young cohort who are eager to develop.  Sea anglers are estimated to spend &euro;1,300 annually on their sport while bass anglers in particular spend approximately &euro;2,600 each annually.  It is impressive that people are willing to spend these sums on their pastime.</p><p> When IFI goes to markets abroad, we generally accompany Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, though sometimes we go on our own.  We market Ireland as Angling in Ireland, <i>Angel en Irland</i>or <i>Peche en Irlande</i>.  People abroad would not understand a reference to Killybegs or Ballycotton but they will understand Ireland and the Irish product.  The product is sold as an experience of good fishing, good craic, beautiful scenery and an unspoilt environment.  That combination is what tourists tell us they want.  Promotional activities include shows, brochures, articles, filming and information on specimen fish and predator hunting.  The expertise within IFI means we can carry out these activities ourselves except any printing required.  We have expertise that can provide information on angling, produce brochures and accompany journalists on visits.  It is fundamental to anglers that they benefit from expert marketing.  It is not enough for an ordinary Joe Soap to tell them about angling as they will be caught out.</p><p> We provide information on the angling product daily through social media, websites and blogs and by way of weekly e-zines.  Information is going out all year.  We gather information all the time through our marine tagging programme, which is voluntary, and our chartered skippers' voluntary logbook programme.  We are currently facilitating the Donegal angling pilot programme which involves chartered skippers and game anglers coming together to market an overall product.  Most of our angling stakeholders are very innovative and see that one cannot send anglers to the pub for the day.  They are examining alternatives.  If an angler cannot go sea fishing one day, he or she can go game or coarse angling.  The Cork sea angling hub is another great example of the work being done by agencies and stakeholders.  There are approximately nine chartered skippers between Ballycotton and Kinsale and accommodation, restaurants and boat hire are all tied up together in a hub to offer a complete package to anglers.  Competitions are run which attract many international visitors.  When anglers come they stay longer than typical travellers and spend all their time on the west, south-west and north-west coasts and in the Shannon region.  They only spend 7% of their time in Dublin.  They are travelling to the peripheral and isolated communities where the money is kept by small and local businesses.</p><p> Bass fishing is most interesting in terms of developing trends.  It is the only fishery that is managed as a recreational marine species.  The proliferation of bass angling guides, accommodation providers and the comments of anglers lead us to believe there is a developing business in this area.  Figures in our study will show that.  Kayak angling is a niche angling activity which attracts younger people.  It is not too popular in Ireland yet, but it is somewhere between small boats and shore angling.  It provides anglers with a bit more mobility and excitement and represents the type of adventure-style holiday that people are seeking now.  Light rock fishing is something we see on the horizon.  It is a change of use of tackle and involves going to heavier tackle rather than lines to lighter tackle which can target more species.  This is the up and coming thing in the tackle industry which we can see developing throughout the world.  It will come to Ireland.</p><p> There are many perceptions and concerns which we came across in the study.  Illegal fishing and netting continue to be a concern of stakeholders.  Fewer anglers, depleted fish stocks, regulations which are not obeyed and policed and higher fuel costs for small boat owners and chartered skippers are also concerns.  Last year was a concern for most people as fewer anglers came due to the bad weather.  While we saw fewer anglers, it was because weather conditions did not suit them.  We are happy to discuss the concerns set out in more detail if members wish.</p><p> The study is comprehensive and will be published shortly.  This is a huge sector with very significant potential.  It brings &euro;500 million into the economy and supports 10,000 jobs.  There is potential to grow the number of anglers domestically and internationally.  Given that 250,000 people want to go angling but have not done so in the last year and the market abroad is huge, there is massive potential.  We need a cohesive approach by all stakeholders which ensures the sustainability of the resource and increases the return to Ireland.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-21a.606" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013032100004#C00300"><p>I welcome the witnesses to the sub-committee.  I am delighted that they are here today.  Within their sector, there is huge potential for development.</p> <p>If we were to consider rural recreation in its widest form, from walking to angling on lakes and rivers, from cliff climbing to surfboarding and every recreational activity on sea and land, it would be possible to create 6,000 jobs, spread around the coast, which would be totally sustainable.  That is a conservative estimate when everything is taken into account.</p><p> Inland Fisheries Ireland is talking about one element.  We need an overall picture of what we could do with our land and marine resources to exploit them in a positive and totally sustainable way to bring people to Ireland for activities, particularly the areas best suited to this which do not have many industries and tend to be remote.  I commend Inland Fisheries Ireland's approach.  Work was done on the issue of rural recreation, particularly walking.  We were expanding to include everything from hang-gliding to whatever people wanted to do, whether it be angling on inland waterways, walking along canals or sea angling.  Inland Fisheries Ireland's figures are very impressive, but we are only scratching the surface.  When people talk about areas in Britain for walking and I see what we have and our small population, I think we are sitting on a goldmine that we have not yet exploited.  We underestimate how urbanised Europe has become; even Ireland is becoming urbanised and because of this people want to get out into nature again.  I am delighted that representatives of Inland Fisheries Ireland are present.</p><p> Another positive aspect of the industry is that it is locally-owned.  There are small owners with multiple participants between providers of tackle, services, accommodation and so on.  That is why it is very sustainable.  This has to form a key part of any effort to help coastal and island communities.  The integrated product presents the challenge.  If we want to bring people in, we have to have the accommodation, back-up services, boats and so on that they need.  If one goes to a ski resort in Austria or Switzerland, there is a very comprehensive package, even though they are all private operators; everything is laid on, including equipment rental and so on, making it possible to do it whatever way one wants.  We have not reached that level of integration; for example, our range of accommodation does not always match what is possible.  Some people want high quality hostel accommodation, not the sort found in the 1960s but more suited to 2013.  Others want to stay in hotels, guesthouses and so on.  We have a lot to do in providing these choices.</p><p> The debate started because the Aranmore fishermen wanted to fish wild salmon.  I have a certain sympathy for them and notice that wild salmon angling was not included in the presentation.  If we are serious about alternative activities for islanders and the more remote coastal communities, this should be considered in a structured way.  We set up Comhairle na Tuaithe and brought all the players around the table, including Waterways Ireland, to discuss walking and associated activities such as mountain biking.  For a long time there was an argument about who might be responsible for marine leisure activities.  There was an intention to set up what I would call Comhairle na Mara to do what Comhairle na Tuaithe was doing but in a water-based context; it would not confine itself to the sea but would include estuaries and inland fisheries.  It would seek to bring together Waterways Ireland, Inland Fisheries Ireland and other interests to try to develop an integrated product and encourage people to get involved in this industry.  Is there any talk between Departments of setting up an umbrella organisation of that type to bring all the players together to iron out difficulties because there are always some and to consider the matter in a positive way?</p><p> If one is setting up a business, one needs grant aid.  There is plenty of grant aid available under the Leader programme which has funded angling boats.  That was in response to individual applications, but it was not part of a master plan in which all of the elements were seen and the jigsaw was put together until the picture was complete.  Has there been development in trying to get all of the players around the table, including the Leader companies, to develop a co-ordinated approach in order that there will be a drive to provide top quality services?  One can market all one wants, but one can only market what one has available.  It is fine to have fish in a beautiful sea, but if the backup services are not available, people will gravitate towards places where it is easy to access services and get the product, all done to a high standard and which is marketable.  We have a wide variety of products, but what is being done to develop them?  What could this committee do to make a detailed recommendation to the Government on how to expand on Inland Fisheries Ireland's work to reach its potential and bring all of the players together?  For example, would it be a good idea for us to recommend for sea-based activities a body such as Comhairle na Mara to bring everyone together to draw up plans and mediate where conflicts or other problems arise?</p><p> This industry is particularly suited to the mind-set of people in these communities.  Many rural people like to be involved in small operations.  They like to be self-starters because they are used to having their own boats which they might have used for salmon fishing, the starting point for this debate.  They do not particularly want to become employees.  They like the concept of local control and working for themselves.  This work is particularly suited to the psychology of these communities.</p><p> Would it be possible to explain the remit of Inland Fisheries Ireland?  I know it deals with inland fishing, for example, on Lough Corrib and Lough Mask.  However, does it have responsibility for sea angling, no matter how deep the sea or the species involved?  I know it has responsibility for salmon fishing and understand this extends to wherever salmon are found within our waters.  </p><p> Ms Campion spoke about perceptions and concerns.</p> <p>What is the perception of intensive fish farming?  I understand there is a plan to put approximately 100,000 tonnes of farmed salmon around the coast on a phased basis.  I am not talking about any particular application because that is under consideration but about the larger issue of major aquaculture.  If we are to follow the example of Norway in aquaculture, would that affect the perception and the quality of the product?  Does it matter to people that there are major aquaculture fin-fish farms?  Do they want to go to those places or not?  Ms Campion said that sea-anglers fish for mackerel.  An inshore fisherman in Connemara told me that where there are fish farms the mackerel are scavengers and tend to be bloated and not the kind of fish that one would want to eat because they eat the residue of the fish in the farm.  I do not know whether this is true.  If it is, are there other species of fish in that category?  Is that a concern?</p><p> How much of a threat does illegal fishing and netting pose?  There is good sense in the adage about poacher turned gamekeeper.  I am not justifying illegal fishing or netting but many people feel that their livelihood was taken away and they are damned if Europe or the State or anybody is going to take away something their forefathers did.  The only way to deal with that is to provide alternative activities.  They could have a stake in the preservation of the fish.  I recall when oysters were being taken illegally from Bertraghboy Bay.  I was on the board of Gael Linn at the time and it decided to sell it to the local co-operative.  Once the co-operative owned the oysters the poaching dropped dramatically because it was in the interest of the local people to ensure that seasons were observed and people did not damage the oyster fishery.  How much could one reduce the incidence of illegal fishing?  It will never be policed.  If the whole country decided to break any law it would not be possible to police it.  Most laws are policed by those who agree with the law and adhere to it of their own volition.  If this industry could be developed and made profitable and the benefit lay in protecting the species, would that be a way of reducing the threat of illegal fishing and netting?  I believe that when people own a resource they tend to respect it and want to preserve it, whether or not the State is watching them.  The State cannot watch everything at once.  This is exciting.</p><p> Finally, to the National Parks and Wildlife Services, I was reading its Natura 2000 document.  We face a challenge in the way this has happened, and I have been involved with it.  Except when it suits them, most people in rural Ireland see Natura 2000 as an imposition from above with no benefit and a lot of rules.  It seems to say "No" to everything.  If all of this protection is so important to Europe there must be some way to exploit it commercially.  If people want bog cotton or salmon we must find ways with the local community of exploiting it in a positive way.  Why preserve it unless somebody is interested in it?  If there are hundreds of thousands of Europeans interested in this conservation, if it is so beautiful and wonderful why are they not coming to look at it?  Why are we not organising for them to crawl across the bogs if that is what they want to do or to go around the coast looking at all the wonders we are preserving for them, whether they be bottle-nosed dolphins, seals or whatever?  The agencies in the Gaeltacht which are linked to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht should try to draw up a plan for a sustainable way to attract people to look at these wonders on which we spend millions of euro and for the sake of which we impose restrictions on people.  There should be some new economic gain from the conservation so that the local communities can see conservation as a positive contribution to society rather than the set of "no-nos" that it seems to be.</p><p> There is a significant fear factor.  When one reads the small print one is told on the notifiable actions----- </p></speech>

I live in a coastal community where sea-angling and angling from the shore contribute significantly to the local economy.  I fully understand and appreciate the presentation on the benefits of this and the knock-on effect especially when tournaments are run.  That brings people into Fenit, and Banna Beach and gives a great boost to the local economy.  The figures show the value of this, for example, the participation of 97,000 people in the sea-angling and almost 750,000 trips a year.  This is very significant.  Sea anglers are estimated to spend &euro;1,300 annually on their sport while bass anglers in particular spend approximately &euro;2,600 each annually.  It is one of the few things contributing positively and significantly to local economies.</p><p>  Ms Campion mentioned the depleted fish stocks.  Does that refer to bass?</p></speech>

It is a point of contention with commercial Irish fishermen that people from other EU countries are allowed to take bass from Irish waters but our fishing fleet is not allowed to do that.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned the issue of support for people going into the industry, particularly those upgrading their boats for sea-angling trips and so on.  Does BIM support that activity?</p><p>  Do local authorities in counties that have a large coastline make any input to the marketing or provide a support base or promote the sector?  In many areas the local authorities own piers and harbours where much of the sea-angling happens.  There is an opportunity for them to play a role in supporting and promoting that activity.</p><p>  It offers a great deal of potential in coastal and rural communities, never more so than now, when there is so little money coming into the local economy.  It could mean that some young people would find employment.  Ms Campion says that 10,000 are employed as a result of the development of the sector.</p> <p>Is there a strategy to develop and market angling more?  We have a fantastic coastline which has great variety of fish species.  Not much can better being on a boat three or four miles off the coast with a nice bobble.  It does not matter whether one is fishing for pollack, mackerel or whatever because one gets a great sense of freedom from sea angling.  There is a lot of potential for sea angling and I would appreciate hearing the views of the delegation on same.  </p><p> It was said that all species are under threat.  Is that due to the depletion in stocks?  Nearly all species are under threat.  Is that the result of over fishing at a commercial level?  Are other factors involved?  </p></speech>

There is potential to develop the industry, particularly sea angling.  We must assist traditional fishermen to avail of new opportunities in the angling sector.</p><p>  The committee started its hearing with submissions from the Aranmore islanders on the loss of wild salmon fisheries due to a ban on drift nets.  The islanders sought to retain the salmon fisheries rather than diversify because they view themselves as traditional fisherman.  That is what they want to be.  We must find a way to allow traditional fishermen to continue yet examine other opportunities for them.  </p><p>  It was mentioned in the presentation that the industry supports 10,000 rural jobs.  I presume that includes all angling, including river angling.  How many jobs does sea angling provide?  Can the delegation outline its projections for growth?  What supports are needed to allow growth to take place?  How much does it cost a boat or sea angling provider to enter the sector if they decide to diversify?  I presume that a traditional fishing boat would not be incompatible with an angling vessel.  Therefore, diversification would require a new or second vessel.  Has the delegation researched how it could work with traditional fishermen to combine an angling product with traditional fishing?  Can traditional fishermen do both for a period while he or she develops his or her business?  </p><p>  I have questions on the support given to fishermen who want to take up angling.  The European fisheries fund provided funding for diversification and for fishermen displaced due to restrictions imposed by the Common Fisheries Policy.  Has the delegation ever targeted that funding to develop an angling product?  We know that Ireland has never targeted any funding from the fund.  When compared with countries like Spain we have neglected to apply for potential funding.  A vital part of a proposed development is funding.  It is all right having a report that proves that people want a product but if we cannot put the infrastructure in place then it will be impossible to capitalise on the initiative.  The cost of entry into the sector is significant enough to make it difficult for small fishermen to join.</p><p>   I presume that the committee will address the salmon issue at a later date.  Salmon fishing might be another day's work.  Angling shows potential and I am interested to hear how the delegation views its development.  </p></speech>

Obviously the infrastructure of small piers are essential for people to access the sea.  I am not referring to the larger piers at Rossaveal or Killybegs.  The piers in much smaller communities are inadequate.  One example is Dunbeg, County Clare but there are other examples in the county.  Dunbeg has a lot of tourism footfall, the area also has a well known golf course which attracts a lot of tourists and it has become a wedding venue.  Dunbeg has a small pier which is inadequate because it is tidal and people can only access the pier at certain tides.  The community is very active and hosts a well known drama festival which also attracts tourists.  The community is doing everything possible to develop tourism.  Dunbeg is on the coast so sea angling would be a normal extension of its tourism product.  However, the pier is inadequate and tidal.  There is money available from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to develop piers but only when the project has passed the stages of planning and environmental impact statements.  Both those stages must be undertaken by Clare County Council but it does not have the money to progress the project.  The community has been left with no option and cannot develop the infrastructure, a potential source of extra tourism that could also retain tourists that visit Dunbeg.  Can the delegation do anything for piers in places like Dunbeg?  There are small piers dotted along the coast ranging from Donegal, to west Cork and around the east coast.  Is there a proposal to build piers?  Is there a proposal to get piers to a stage where they can be built and then apply for funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine?  </p><p>  I have a few questions on sea lice.  Is sea lice an increasing problem?  Does it impact on sea angling?  What measures can be taken to mitigate the problem?</p><p>  Is IFI, a Government agency, happy with the general degree of co-operation by BIM?  Obviously IFI and BIM are Government agencies with different remits but they both work in the same waters.  How has BIM treated submissions by Inland Fisheries Ireland?  I do not know whether the submissions can be discussed but I do expect an answer on the general co-operation between IFI and BIM.  </p><p>   On 6 March the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine stated that Food Harvest 2020 constituted a Government strategic plan.  Does Inland Fisheries Ireland think that the agriculture component of the plan should be submitted for an environmental impact statement?  I ask the question in view of the potential impact by Food Harvest 2020 on sea angling and the development of tourism off our coasts.    </p><p>  I know that weir fisheries are not within our remit.  However, I commend the work done by Inland Fisheries Ireland and the ESB on eel fisheries, particularly at Parteen weir.  </p></speech>

In a previous Administration, I had meetings with all State agencies responsible for State lands.  The State is the biggest landowner in the country.  The idea was to utilise State lands to the greatest extent.  To that extent, the IFI is working very closely with our colleagues in the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  We have been activating rural recreation officers to get them involved in angling and we also worked on the national trails development programme.  We are not there yet and there is a huge job of work to be done.  The survey shows we are scratching the surface in terms of what we can do.  In this context, I am concerned about angling but when one comes off the canal, one should be able to go fishing or on a Coillte mountain bike trail or a walk.  It involves linking those activities.</p><p>  In terms of the angling product, we are working with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  We have a strategy entitled "Travel, Stay, Fish &amp;amp; Play".  We are responsible for the fish portion of that but, as others have pointed out, if the travel, stay and play elements are not sorted out, it does not matter how good the fishing is.  If one cannot get in or cannot satisfy the kids or the wife, it does not come together.  The initiatives Ms Campion talked about, such as with Donegal angling, show the suppliers realising that sometimes it gets windy and wet in Donegal and one may not be able to go sea fishing so an alternative is provided.  Equally, if one cannot go lake fishing, one should give sea fishing a go.  People are linking accommodation providers and chartered providers.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is helpful because it gives us a certain classification and people can get an angler's welcome.  When people see the angler's welcome ticket, they know there may be somewhere to store the tackle, some freezer capacity for fish, somewhere to store bait or the ability to have lunches made when they are going fishing.  These small things can make a difference between someone coming to Ireland and going elsewhere.  We are working closely on that.</p><p>  We have had many questions about the survey.  The survey is the first part of our strategy, which we have not yet developed.  The IFI is under three years old and this is the first time we have sat down to consider angling in Ireland in a comprehensive way.  We are starting to get results that will form the foundation of the sectoral plan.  We have huge figures but we must think about how to grow them further and where are the best places to grow them.  In order to develop a strategy for angling, we must consider what we have currently.  Where is there really good quality and where is there poor quality?  Deputy McNamara asked about our infrastructure.  It may be that we have a major deficit in piers but an oversupply of angling stands in lakes.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked about illegal fishing.  Long before us, currently, and long after us there will be people willing to partake in illegal fishing.  Perception is very important because it acts like a magnifying glass.  With the advent of social media, blogs and Twitter, someone sees an illegal fishing net and can get onto Facebook.  It can go viral.  The perception of what is going on is worse than what is going on.  Illegal fishing is taking place but we are working very hard to contain it.  It is not as significant a problem as some make it out to be.  The tourist will have a particular perception if they see someone with an illegal net, and that is what we are trying to avoid.  Things move through social media very quickly and so what gets out on viral media is not the reality on the ground.  People have posted comments on the IFI Facebook page and then genuine anglers on that river or lake have also commented that they did not see what was reported or that the matter was blown out of all proportion.  Illegal sea netting for salmon and bass is a problem and we are working very closely with stakeholders.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v pointed out that when people have shared ownership, instantly they have responsibility.  Irrespective of what the State says or does, they take a greater interest.  That is why we are pushing forward with the value of angling locally and people are starting to grab hold of the idea.</p><p>  Deputy Ferris asked about depleted bass stocks.  The bass stock is very much depleted.  The estimate is that there is a recovery in the stock but only to 5% or 10% of its historic level.  Bass is a commercial fish species managed for recreational angling.  It is a long living species and it is not particularly suitable for commercial fishing.  If the stock is fished hard for whatever reason, it takes a long time to recover.  Much of the bass angling practised at the moment is on a catch and release basis.  The reason the bass angling product is developing well in Ireland is because England, France and Spain have commercial bass fisheries but no bass angling.  Ireland is the last remaining Mecca for bass angling.  It should be maintained as a recreation angling species given the status of the stock and the biology of the species.</p></speech>

We are talking about two discrete stocks.  The Irish stock of bass is very close to the coast, very vulnerable and very slow growing.  Our advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, a scientific body that gives advice to every European country, is that the stock is discrete and is not the same as that fished further off the coast.  The stock lives within our six mile and 12 mile limits.  It is more vulnerable than the stock further out.</p></speech>

I am not in a position to speak for BIM but I understand it ran many schemes and grants.  Typically, they were aimed more at commercial inshore fisheries.  We are at the start of a development in terms of survey work.  We are only getting information now and the information we have provided to the committee is hot off the presses.  We must sit down and chew over it, decide the best way forward, the resource and the issues involved.  Only then do we bring in the stakeholders.  One of the members mentioned the coastal local authorities, which have a huge remit in angling and tourism promotion.  We have had some very positive interaction with Kerry County Council.  Ms Campion will brief members on that.  When we get a clear understanding of the figures, we will be in a position to speak to local authorities, who will be key stakeholders.  Without a base of information, it is a stab in the dark.</p><p>  If this is where we are now, what can we do?  Mr. Maher referred to legislation and barriers to entry.  Deputy Pringle asked how we can interface commercial inshore fisheries into recreational angling.  That will form part of our strategy.</p><p>  With regard to species under threat, a general comment is that there is pressure on many of the inshore fishing stocks.  We are interested in recreational angling.  To a large extent, it is a sustainable activity.  When fishing with a rod and line, there is only so much angling pressure people put on a fishery.  I cannot speak for my colleagues in the Marine Institute or BIM but I am sure they would concur that there is pressure on inshore stocks.</p><p>  Deputy Pringle's questions also relate to the number of jobs related to sea angling.  I do not subscribe to the paralysis by analysis idea but a survey such as this begets other questions, which we must answer.  If we are to develop the strategy, we must have more resolution.  Of the 10,000 jobs, we must decide how many to ascribe to sea angling.  This involves what to do with charter skippers and what inputs we include.  I concur with some of Deputy Pringle's comments on the point of entry for traditional fishermen and the kind of boats and technology they may have <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> what is needed for getting into being a charter skipper.</p> <p>We have not gone into huge detail on this but from experience, there is a significant difference in the requirements, in terms of licensing, certification and health and safety, between going out potting for crabs and taking ten people out on a boat.  With upgrading grants, some boats will be able to make that transition, but in other cases they will not.  This raises the issue of cost, and one is then into a completely different cost category.  We have to work on the issue.  If this is what we will push for, we then have to make space to consider different aspects as well as how we will fund it.  If the decision is to increase capacity in an area, then commensurate increases must take place in the support services, such as tackle, B&amp;amp;Bs and hotels.  What one does not want to do is to bring people up to Arranmore Island, doing a big sell to get the local people involved in charter fishing, and then find that no visitors can get up there or that there is no accommodation for them.  There is a multi-pronged strategy.</p><p> In terms of funding and supports, there will be a new version of European Fisheries Fund, EFF, called the European marine fisheries fund, and the IFI has been very active in terms of getting involved in that, because one of the pillars of that fund is diversification funds for former inshore fishermen to get into other areas.  One of the areas for which we will be looking for funding is that of charter skippers.  Our colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine ultimately manage that fund; however, we have been working very closely with them.  I understand discussion on the fund is still at European level but we have had a number of meetings with our colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and we are making great progress in that regard.</p><p> I will now respond to Deputy McNamara's question on sea angling.  He gave the good example of Doonbeg Pier.  Those involved are caught between a rock and a hard place.  I see our survey as being the first step in a strategy.  Certain issues must be tackled and unwound.  If one does it in isolation, one will end up with a lovely plan, but with a strategic plan on the shelf.  Without talking to stakeholders and unwinding these specific types of instance, ultimately recreational angling is local and the money that is generated stays local.<font color="#0000FF"> </font>One must be able to deal with local things.  To come up with a high-end product, we must deal with local issues.  This applies to Doonbeg Pier in County Clare and is replicated around the country.  I foresee our tackling these issues as part of the next phase of understanding the numbers and expanding the resource.  The Deputy also raised specific questions on sea lice and the impact they have on sea angling.  Strictly speaking, sea lice are not a significant issue for sea angling <i>per se </i>because most of the species one goes for in sea angling are marine fish species.  Sea lice are an issue for migrating salmonids.  When juvenile salmon are migrating with a heavy sea lice burden it is a significant issue, and it can be an issue for adult salmon migrating back.  However, in the specific context of sea angling, sea lice are not a major issue.  </p><p> On the question of the degree of co-operation with BIM, we are all aware that an application is pending and I do not wish to comment on it.  We have very good levels of co-operation with BIM and the chairman of IFI.  I met the chief executive and chairman of BIM two weeks ago, and we will be doing so again in the next couple of weeks.  There are two processes and there are agencies with different views and concerns and we are working through them in a very collegial manner.  There has always been good co-operation between us.  There is an ongoing process and I do not wish to comment on it.</p><p> The aquaculture component of Harvest 2020 should be subject to an environmental impact assessment, EIS.  At the moment, there is a specific aquaculture application that is open and certainly IFI has made submissions on it.  We hope, and I presume, that our concerns will be adequately taken on board.  It will be the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine that runs the process.  We are still waiting to get the output from it.</p></speech>

I will lead off but will refer to Dr. Byrne, as he is the scientist.  The major issue in the debate centres around the issue of sea lice.  I appreciate Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's question on sea angling.  It is the impact on angling<i> per se </i>and the statutory responsibility of IFI that would be of concern.  It is fair to say - I am sure Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Ferris will know this from their own areas - that the debate on sea lice has been ongoing for more than 20 years.  It is characterised among stakeholders by entrenched views, with very hard-hitting statements made by those supporting the project and equally hard views expressed by the angling community.  We need to move beyond the arguments of the past 20 years.  I have a background in seafood, where I worked for ten years, and I understand the arguments put by both sides.  I believe we need to move it on.  What we have suggested is an independent review of all the scientific data from both sets of stakeholders, which would allow for some level of accord among stakeholders.  That is the key.</p><p>  In respect of aquaculture, we have consistently said - as have both Ministers - that we will give 100% support to aquaculture projects that do not have an impact on other areas.  That is what I spoke about earlier with regard to a cohesive response across all stakeholders, including agencies.  We have made suggestions about where the location should be but there is disagreement on the scientific elements.  We have consistently said we support the development of aquaculture as long as its impact is not detrimental to any sector.  I will now ask my colleague Dr. Ciar&aacute;n Byrne to comment further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-21a.630" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ciar&aacute;n Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013032100009#H01200"><p>I talked at length about perception.  On the question of whether an aquaculture facility will have an impact on sea angling, I do not believe it will have a significant negative impact.  A poorly managed facility could have a significant impact on wild salmonid fisheries, as the Deputy is aware from the Corrib river.  If the facility is well managed I do not believe it will have a significant impact, but it is down to perception.  When one is trying to get a tourist to book a trip to Ireland and pay money online, an aquaculture facility is likely to have a somewhat negative effect on the perception of sea angling.  It may have little or no impact on the actual fishing, but one is managing the perception.</p><p>  Deputy Pringle raised the issue of drift netting in Arranmore Island.  It is a difficult question to answer.  On a biological level, it is easy; there are no rivers coming off Arranmore Island.</p> <p>This means that every salmon which passes the coast is coming from and going to somewhere else.  This is the classic bad example in terms of mixed stock fisheries because when one throws a net off Arranmore Island, one can catch 20 salmon that are heading for the River Moy which has a very healthy surplus or the last 20 salmon heading for the River Loire or River Rhine.  The mixed stock fishery ceased for this reason.  This is a difficult issue for Inland Fisheries Ireland because fishermen are not gardeners, plumbers or painters and want to fish, yet we must tell them they cannot fish for salmon.  It is inherent in fishing that one will fish in mixed stock fisheries.  I do not see any potential for salmon fishing until such time as the mixed stock nature of the fisheries either improves or one has some confidence that the fish being caught all come from sustainable stocks.</p><p> That said, representatives of Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Department attend the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization, NASCO, every year.  NASCO is a United Nations treaty organisation which encompasses all of the salmon producing countries on the entire Atlantic rim.  The issue of socioeconomics is coming to the fore in this regard.  One has a management, scientific and socioeconomic aspect to fishing and what we have been doing in recent years is prioritising the scientific aspect.  Questions are being asked about how we incorporate socioeconomic factors into scientific and management decisions.  Certain countries, Canada, Norway and Sweden for instance, have native populations - Canada has the First Nations peoples, while Norway has the Sami people - to whom they give allowances.  To some extent, they have started the process of incorporating socioeconomic factors in decisions.  While questions are being asked about socioeconomics at international level, unfortunately, this does not offer much solace to fishermen on Arranmore Island who want to go fishing now.  We are starting to move in that direction.</p></speech>

Inland Fisheries Ireland has been working with Leader companies all over the country and been successful in helping small groups and businesses to secure some Leader funding.  As members will be aware, the Leader window is pretty much shut as the applications in hand are being assessed.  Concerns have arisen about transferring Leader funding to socioeconomic committees in county councils.  Some time ago Inland Fisheries Ireland made a proposal to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that we be permitted to be a lead promoter or project promoter.  We did so because we found that smaller angling clubs, chartered skippers and so forth did not always have the wherewithal either to fund a project or put one together.  Inland Fisheries Ireland cannot obtain Leader funding.  While we do not want funds for the organisation, we want stakeholders to secure funding and have a policy of facilitating them in doing so.  We have provided what are known as &quot;How-To&quot; guides for the Leader programme and assist and design projects where we have resources to do so.  Unfortunately, our resources are not evenly spread around the country.  However, in areas where we have resources, we are working with Leader companies at a level close to project design.</p><p>  The South Kerry Development Company is working with Kerry County Council and Inland Fisheries Ireland to develop the <i>GoKerry.com</i> angling website which will provide a one stop shop of game fisheries, accommodation providers and so forth that will enable people to book a holiday, guide, accommodation and fishing licences.  Inland Fisheries Ireland has also facilitated the development of the Donegal Angling Tourism Alliance, a group of chartered skippers and game fisheries which also hopes to establish a one stop shop website offering a combined product to make it easier for anglers to visit. </p><p>  The marine and countryside guides programme is run by F&aacute;ilte Ireland with our support.  Its key role is to get people involved in the marine and countryside sector to become guides and offer a tourism service to anglers or others who want to participate in marine and countryside activities.  It allows people to change roles, for example, to move from commercial fishing to guiding.  Local knowledge is best in fisheries.  A number of providers have entered from overseas, have learned the Irish way and know where the best fishing is.  They practise catch and release and bring many tourists to the country through different companies.  They live in Ireland and do a fantastic job in promoting the country to our tourist friends elsewhere in Europe.  They are always crying out for guides and gillies with local knowledge.  Many people could do this work, but they need specific training which is the issue we are trying to address.</p></speech>

A memorandum on the proposal will go to the Government shortly, after which the proposal will go for public consultation.  The 1959 Fisheries Act is 53 years old and of its day because it is based on legislation that predates the founding of the State.  It is increasingly no longer fit for purpose.  The legislation we are proposing contains a number of key elements, one of which is the decriminalisation of some of the minor offences contained in the Act.  It is hoped we will introduce a system akin to the penalty points system, rather than continuing to criminalise infringements and waste court time with minor offences, some of which have been committed inadvertently.  Another key area relates to invasive species which have the potential to destroy native species.  As there is no legislation on invasive species, legislative provision must be made on this issue.</p><p>  We spoke of perceptions in terms of protecting the fishery resource and illegal fishing.  As Deputies are aware, we are in an era of tightening resources.  We would like to legislate to create a fisheries reserve.  Inland Fisheries Ireland staff at local level will speak about the enthusiasm of anglers and boat skippers for helping to protect our resource.  Legislating to create a fisheries reserve to act alongside our inspectors would create opportunities for Inland Fisheries Ireland to deploy its resources more effectively, for example, by using surveillance technology rather than constantly patrolling rivers.  These are some of the main elements of the legislation, the main purpose of which will be to modernise the existing Act which is old and increasingly unfit for purpose as it is based on legislation that dates back more than 100 years in some cases.</p></speech>

I have been working for many years with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, initially in County Donegal and more recently in Dublin.  Dr. Kelly was an inshore fisheries development officer in south Kerry in a former life and is familiar with many of the issues involved.  We circulated this morning a note on the current state of play in regard to statutory nature protection.  It is worth reflecting on this discussion which is about identifying a valuable resource for sustainable use.  We spoke a great deal this morning about the protection of this resource and how to maximise the benefits from it.  Much of what we deal with in terms of nature protection is about protecting that resource.  As Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v stated, issues arise about ensuring the best possible use of the resource.  Reflecting on our discussion on commonages some weeks ago, I was struck that the commonage issue first arose when tourists who were walking the hills started to ask what was being done to address the overgrazing that was destroying the hills.  The matter ended up in the European courts and Ireland was told to sort out the issue.</p> <p>If we look after the resource we have huge potential for using it subsequently.  I do not want to take all the time of the committee by going through the note we have circulated page by page - members are probably familiar with most of it - except to say that the main drivers of our work are the EU birds and habitats directives which have been around since 1981 and 1993, respectively.  They require us to designate Natura 2000, the European network of protected areas for a substantial list of habitats, including many marine habits, and also quite a few species, including the grey seal, harbour seal, harbour porpoise and bottlenose dolphin.  Those directives put very strict protection on all citation species, the whales, dolphins and porpoises, regardless of whether they are inside or outside of a line drawn on a map.  We have to look to that very carefully.</p><p> The EU directives set the criteria by which we had to select those sites, a process whereby that would be reviewed over a period to ensure that each member state contributed a fair amount to the overall European network and the legal means for protection within those sites.  </p><p> On the marine side, Ireland has a very substantial and rich biodiversity.  Therefore, there is an obligation on us to protect marine and coastal sites to a substantial extent.  We went through a process some years ago where the EU Commission convened a meeting to see what we had proposed.  It was not totally happy with what we had done and required us to do some more, as a result of which in recent months the Minister published a small number of additional SACs under the habitats directive.  The protection of the sites is laid out in Article 6(3).  While I do not want to go into the detail of it, what it sets out to do is to make sure that any proposed use or development of one of these SACs or SPAs in the case of birds is consistent with the objectives and that the use is sustainable.  When this arose, other colleagues and I embarked on a series of meetings around the country explaining, particularly to fisheries and agriculture interests, what was coming in and having a discussion on its implications.  What we said at the time was that existing uses appear to be consistent with having a rich nature value on the site, otherwise we would not say this was an important area.  Subsequently a European Union court case, notably the Waddenzee judgment in the Netherlands, laid down that the licensing process, for example, for aquaculture had to be gone through whether or not it was traditional.  In other words, it was not enough to say we have always had cockle fishing here and that we will continue with it.  The judgment made clear that such activities were required to undergo a proper assessment.  </p><p> This became a key issue in a case taken in the European Court of Justice against Ireland in respect of the birds directive<b>.  </b>An issue which has occupied us greatly in recent years is putting in place a coherent system which is agreed by the EU Commission as a response to the European Court of Justice judgment whereby there is an integrated process of setting objectives for the sites and using that to assess aquaculture or fisheries licence applications within those sites.  The final determination is made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  </p><p> There are many people who are trying to have a clear regulatory path in order to be able to run businesses.  We have done much work in collecting the data on all the SACs and SPAs around the country in order that we can feed it into a process within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine whereby it can issue licences and fishing can proceed.  We have made substantial progress in that area and a system has been set up.  It is lengthy and difficult.  Given that we have been through a European Court of Justice case, inevitably we have been required to do things even better than if we had passed under the radar.  We are proceeding at a good pace at this stage and providing the information as necessary to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p> We have almost finished the entire process.  I wish to inform the committee that there is a final formal process of legal designation by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht for the SACs and we have to go through a notification process.  There is nothing new happening in this area.  There is no new legal protection and no new sites.  It is a final formal process that must be gone through.</p><p> In regard to the birds directive sites, the SPAs, we have not yet looked at the marine territory and the offshore areas to ascertain if there are any areas which are of such importance as to warrant designation.  Therefore, some work will continue in the coming years as resources permit and as the pressure comes on from the European Union for us to finalise that process.  </p><p> I did not bring any information on the economic value of these.  Clearly much of the tourism, particularly in the western half of the country, goes to areas which are of high nature value and where protecting it is valuable.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that more could be done in terms of using what we know about these sites, particularly where we have substantial amounts of scientific information, which will be of interest to a certain category of visitor, and to point out that these are of European significance if they cannot see that for themselves.  There is already substantial activity, quite apart from the land-based tourism.  The committee will be well aware of the whale watching business, the dolphin watching business and the seal watching business.  Where I live on the east coast, north of here, in the past couple of years, three young men got a boat.  They and their fathers before them had been lobster fishing and now they are doing sea tours.  It is a small but developing business and it appears sustainable.  They go into the areas that are protected under the habitats directive to keep the birds and the bird colonies around Lambay Island and Skerries Island and are reaping the benefit of these areas. </p></speech>

Recently we published details of a small number of new sites in the marine areas.  We have finished on the SAC front on land where there is a final formal designation process.  In terms of the possibility of removing them, in theory it is possible but in practice it is exceedingly difficult to persuade the EU Commission and would have to be based on a scientific purpose.  If it can be shown that since the habitats directive came into force the scientific interest, whatever it was, is being lost, the first question is how did one manage to lose it, and that creates a difficulty.  If it is still there, it would not normally agree to the removal of a designation.  It has not happened so far.  We had a look at it in the context of some rivers with pearl mussel sites, which is a difficult species to look after, where we proposed in light of new information that there were possibly some better rivers that we might substitute. We did not succeed because the EU Commission said that these populations are very important in European terms, whether or not, there are better ones in Ireland.</p></speech>

However, they have experienced a revival due to whale watching, which is now an important source of revenue for those towns.  This is a relatively undeveloped and underdeveloped aspect of Irish tourism.  An Irish whale and dolphin group was set up and it operates out of Carrigaholt.  The Haughey family donated its boat, <i>Celtic Mist </i>, to that group.  Are there any supports for that kind of endeavour?  Earlier this year there was a striking photograph taken by the navy of a pod of blue whales in Irish waters.  Many tourists would travel far and pay significant money to the Irish Exchequer through the tourism industry to see such a sight.  Are there supports available to develop this area from the point of view of either tourism or the important research being carried out by the whale and dolphin group?</p><p> I put a question to Inland Fisheries Ireland earlier, but it might be more appropriate to direct it to Dr. O'Keeffe.  European and Irish law establish regulations for where an assessment finds that a current level of licensed activity is above that which is envisaged within the site's conservation objectives.  Given the objectives contained in Food Harvest 2020, which the Minister for Agriculture and Food has said is a strategic plan of the Government, do such licensed activities require an environmental impact assessment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-21a.648" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/995" speakername="Noel Harrington" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013032100012#L00200"><p>I apologise for missing the first presentations.  With regard to the Natura 2000 sites around our coast, when this committee was dealing with its work in this area, these sites featured hugely, no matter where one went along the coast.  In the aquaculture area for example, in the period since 1993, when the Natura 2000 sites designations were made, aquaculture developed in Scotland at ten times the rate it did here although Scotland had to observe the same habitats directive as we did and had to designate sites.  I do not know where it designated its sites, whether they were inland or offshore, or how it managed to do it and still develop its aquaculture, but it was working under the same European legislation as us. The perception exists here that much of the licensing restriction that has inhibited an aquaculture industry in this country is because of the Natura sites in the bays and harbours around our coast.</p><p>  Another issue is that because of the lack of scientific information when these sites were designated, if a licence came in for a new activity - whether based on tourism, the marine or aquaculture - there was no way of assessing the impact of that proposed activity.  In the presentation made to the committee yesterday, we were told the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine had to start from scratch to develop a data model to assemble the information to assess the impact such a licence would have on a Natura site.  We have gone about this backwards.  We have a Department that is trying to develop an aquaculture industry to fit the targets of Food Harvest 2020, but to do that it had to start from scratch to get the scientific data.  It worked in conjunction with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and others to get a base model.  Obviously there was some scientific information available, but it was not sufficient to allow an educated or informed decision on licensing.  The Department has informed us that it can now use its model not just for aquaculture but for anything.   This effort has been going on from 1993 up to the past year or so.  Therefore, why is it that in the context of the economic and social impact of the designation of Natura sites, for example, the information does not add up?</p><p>  We have seen countries which have been working under the same legislation outstrip us by a factor of ten.  The perception that exists must be dealt with.  Whether wrongly or rightly, communities here feel very hard done by, not by the designation of the Natura sites, but by the inability to move ahead and deal with applications.  That is the problem.  We have fallen 20 years behind in this regard.  If that perception is wrong, we should deal with that.  How we can move ahead is something with which this committee must deal.  If we are going to come up with a report, we must show how we can move forward in these areas.  If we want to introduce tourism infrastructure, aquaculture or marine leisure or sea fishery projects in these areas, we must be able to assess their impact on these areas.  If we can deal with this, we should, but if the requirement for an impact assessment is going to continue to inhibit progress this should be a fundamental part of our report.  We need to be able to tell people whether they can or cannot progress a development in these areas.</p></speech>

Following on what Deputy Harrington has been saying, it appears to me from discussions I have had with the Marine Institute and the Department that the Commission is making an example of Ireland and making us jump through all the hoops and dot all the i's and cross all the t's.  Research I have done indicates the regime is completely different in every other European country.  The explanation for this seems to be that we took a court case and they did not.  That seems to be the only reason we have been forced to go down this road and through this whole procedure.  One reason I am disappointed is because this is a torturously long process, but I understand the data sets must be built up and the research must be done.</p><p>  The last paragraph of the presentation mentions the issue that has arisen between sea-fishing and the Natura sites.  I understand this has been an issue for well over a year at this stage, but it appears we have not got any closer to a resolution.  Getting a decision requires liaison between the different Departments and the Commission but the process of getting a decision at that level is very slow.  This is holding up the final stages of decisions for a number of bays on getting their conservation objectives established.  Is this issue anywhere near a resolution?  Will it happen anytime soon and will that decision free up the system to allow decisions be made and the process move forward?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-21a.650" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ciar&aacute;n O'Keeffe" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013032100012#L00400"><p>I shall start off with the responses and my colleague, Dr. Eamonn Kelly, will join in as well.  On the possibility of support for marine-based tourism, I believe there are many possibilities, but our Department does not work in that area.  However, there has been substantial support in the past for the whale and dolphin group mentioned.  We provided the group with a certain amount of seed funding some years ago and we also provided the group with contracts supporting its scientific work.  The Heritage Council, which is funded by our Department, has also provided the group with substantial support over the years.</p><p>  With regard to the general designations issue, it is correct to say that things did not move as fast here as they did in other countries.  There are a number of reasons for that.  First, we started off with very little baseline data in comparison with other European countries, which had substantial research institutions working on the basic information and they had that information to hand when the habitats directive was introduced.  We did not have the same level of information.  The clock was ticking in Europe and designations had to be made within a certain time, yet the collection of the basic information to determine whether the sites are worthy of protection takes significant time.</p><p>  When it comes to licensing, ideally one would have all the information needed from the first day of the notification, but it was simply not possible, within the resources afforded, to get all of the information.  Therefore, we have been working very hard and have been co-funding the work on the data gathering with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine so that small industries do not have to try to get that information.  In many other cases where a developer wants to do a project, he must pay for EIA work.  In this case, the State is doing the work in order to enable the licensing process to go ahead.</p></speech>

There are different levels of complexity in terms of the information one needs.  The first step was a national survey, called BioMar, which was carried out in the 1990s and it identified those areas with the richest biodiversity which fell within the parameters of the Habitats Directive as the best sites.  That study identified bays, areas of coastline and so forth.  However, when it comes down to an individual wanting to set up an operation in a very specific location, the question arises as to whether we have sufficiently detailed data to make an informed decision in the context of the European Court case.  That was not the case so substantial additional work had to be carried out in order to enable an informed and legally satisfactory decision on a licence application.  Deputy Pringle is correct that, having been through the hoops in the European Court, the burden was onerous in terms of the quality of the work that was required, which has made life more difficult than it would have been had we passed under the radar.</p></speech>

Approximately 13 years ago I was in the Civil Service in the United Kingdom doing very similar work.  I raise this in the context of the question about how Scotland managed matters effectively while we, under the same legislation, seem to have stumbled.  From first-hand experience I can say that the type of products we are generating now were being generated 13 years ago in the United Kingdom.  That was after they had collected the necessary data in the middle to late 1990s.  Obviously, when the European Commission came calling, the UK was in a better position to make more informed decisions and to apply the regime of appropriate assessment to the decision making process.  When Brussels looked around the member states at the time, it found that Ireland was making little headway in applying the appropriate assessment provision to aquaculture licensing.  One of the main reasons was that, as Dr. O'Keeffe has said, while we had some data, it was only sufficient for designation purposes and not for spatial management of activities within sites.  It is one thing to be able to take a sample at sea and determine that an area is an inlet, bay or estuary or that there is a large reef in a site.  That is enough to have a site designated but in order to spatially manage the complexity of activities within a site like Galway Bay, for example, one needs a much greater amount of detail, a lot more samples and a lot more analysis.  That was the next step that always needed to be taken and we were somewhat slower in taking it than other member states.</p></speech>

That is the reality of the situation.</p><p>  We have managed over the past few years to collect a massive amount of information, all of which is necessary.  That will be a national asset in so far as it can be utilised beyond the fisheries and aquaculture sectors and should allow a much more efficient and proactive administrative process in terms of coastal developments.  It is important to understand that there are different types of data and we did not have the type of data required.  The data we collected in order to facilitate the designation process was not entirely fit for purpose in terms of facilitating spatial management.  A much more robust level of data is required for that.</p></speech>

We had hoped that this would have been long since put to bed.  The difficulty is that there has always been a lack of clarity at a European level as to where exactly fisheries and fisheries licensing sits within the realms of the Habitats Directive.  It is not clear whether it should be dealt with under article 6.3 and appropriate assessment or under article 6.2, which is a much broader, risk-assessment approach.  That is the specific issue at question with the European Commission and it is fair to say it is a challenging issue for all concerned.  I am aware, from checking e-mails in the last day or two, that we hope to be able to engage the European Commission in the coming weeks.  There is talk of a bilateral meeting to move things on and we hope to see progress on that in due course.</p></speech>

We are trying to establish a socioeconomic base for coastal and island communities so that they can have a viable way of life.  The study that is taking place, when completed, will allow all potential activity, including wind farms, offshore oil and gas explorations as well as aquaculture, angling and so forth, to be assessed properly to determine whether it is suitable and appropriate for the location, based on scientific knowledge.  The determination as to whether the activity could take place will be based on science.  When the study is completed it will amount to an environmental impact assessment because it will indicate whether aquaculture of a certain scale is allowable and compatible with everything else that is happening on a site.  That is the aim of this study which has been described, rightly, as a national asset.  When this data is collected and finalised, we will have an invaluable asset.  It should enable us to fast track some of the applications going forward.  We are in catch-up mode at the moment and there is no doubt about that.  Unfortunately we cannot do anything but try to catch up.  </p><p>  I thank Dr. O'Keeffe, Dr. Kelly and those who contributed earlier.  Members have been given a flavour of what we are trying to do in this area.  I think we need to make time for a submission on the island communities.  We are not just interested in how this affects the coastal areas but also the island communities, who have other challenges to live with, by virtue of their isolation.  Perhaps we can invite someone from the Department who deals specifically with the islands, if the committee members believe it would be helpful.  </p><p>  I thank everyone for their attendance.  </p> <p>The sub-committee will adjourn until 9.30 a.m. on Thursday, 28 March 2013 when we will hear from NGOs such as the Federation of Irish Fishermen, the Irish Fishermen's Organisation and Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann and the IFA aquaculture group.  </p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I am delighted to welcome Mr. James Doorley from the National Youth Council of Ireland, Mr. James Higgins from the European Youth Forum and Mr. Dermot Stokes, an ex-member of Youthreach.</p><p>  As members will know, at the end of the February the Council of the European Union reached political agreement on a recommendation addressed to the member states to establish a youth guarantee scheme, the aim of which is to ensure that all young people under the age of 25 who lose their jobs or who do not find work after finishing formal education quickly receive a good-quality offer of employment, continued education, or an apprenticeship or traineeship.  The guarantee states that they should receive such an offer within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education.  The guarantee is intended to provide for a smooth transition between school and work, support labour market integration and make sure that no young person is left out.  The measure is a key part of the response to the worsening youth unemployment situation in Europe.  In Ireland, youth unemployment stands at 32% and in countries such as Spain, the unemployment rate for those under 25 is almost 50%.  We all recognise that something needs to be done and this committee is interested in exploring how the proposed scheme might work in practice.  In that context, we look forward to hearing the views of our witnesses today on how such a scheme might work and whether it could be customised for the Irish market.  </p><p>  I wish to draw attention to the parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against an individual or entity either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it easily identifiable.   By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-21a.670" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Doorley" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013032100003#B00300"><p>On behalf of the National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI, I thank the committee for the invitation to speak on the youth guarantee.</p><p>  The NYCI is the representative body for more than 50 organisations working with young people in almost every community in Ireland.  We have 40,000 volunteers working in the youth sector in Ireland and around 1,400 full-time-equivalent staff.  A lot of people work on a part-time basis but the overall figure is approximately 1,400 whole-time equivalents.  A recent independent assessment of the number of young people participating in programmes run by youth organisations in Ireland showed that there were about 382,000 in the 10-to-24 age group involved.  A significant number of young people are, therefore, engaged with our member services and 53% of those young people are from what can be described as economically and socially disadvantaged areas.</p><p>  Members are well aware of the seriousness of youth unemployment, but there have been some changes in that regard since the crisis first hit.  The number of young people on the live register has dropped relatively significantly since 2010, by approximately 23,000 to 24,000.  Alongside that, however, we have seen an increase in long-term youth unemployment.  At the end of October 2012 there were 30,000 young people who had been signing on the live register for 12 months or more.  There has also been a significant amount of emigration, with estimates indicating that 142,000 people under 25 have emigrated.  Obviously, many more between the ages of 25 and 30 have also left.  Even though the number of unemployed young people has come down, the number of young people in the labour force has also dropped.  In 2012, the labour force participation rate for young people fell by about 10%.  Between 2008 and 2012, the number of young people under 25 in the workforce almost halved.  It is important to put those figures on the record to demonstrate the scale of the crisis we are facing.</p><p>  Levels of youth unemployment are directly related to levels of education and qualifications, which is not a new phenomenon.  International and national studies have shown that young people insulate themselves against unemployment to some degree by continuing in education.  High educational attainment will not provide complete protection against joblessness; figures show that the level of unemployment among young graduates was around 18%, but among those educated only to primary level it was 70%.  Ireland has the fourth highest number of young people who are in the so-called NEET category, meaning they are not in employment, education or training.  The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions estimated that it costs approximately &euro;150 billion per year, at a European level, to have that number of young people not engaged in the workforce or in training.  The cost to Ireland is estimated to be &euro;3 billion per annum.  My colleague Mr. James Higgins from the European Youth Forum will talk some more about the European dimension, but the committee might be interested to note that recent statistics indicate that there are almost 14 million young people between 15 and 29 who are not in education, employment or training.  That is equal to the population of seven member states - admittedly, seven of the smaller states - and is a staggering figure.  </p><p>  On the issue of education and training, we are of the view that while there has been some increase in the availability of some of the existing schemes, as well as new initiatives such as Springboard, MOMENTUM and JobBridge, overall, there are not enough places and opportunities to meet the demand.  A few weeks ago an affiliate of one of our member organisations in Tipperary had a meeting to recruit 20 young people for a training course, but 120 turned up.  Mr. Stokes would know more about this than I do, but there is evidence that many Youthreach centres have long waiting lists for their services.  The lack of capacity is a major issue.  We are particularly concerned that the young people who have the lowest level of educational qualifications and who may be dealing with other issues such as lack of parental support, bad experiences in school and so forth are being pushed to the back of the queue.  The increase in unemployment has been so great and the demand for training courses so extensive that the young people with greater resources at their disposal are the ones who end up getting a lot of the training places, to the detriment of those who might need those places most.  We did an analysis of some of the existing Government programmes and found that the number of long-term unemployed young people participating in some of them was very low, which is a worry.  Additional efforts are required to address this issue.  Youthreach is certainly doing a lot of excellent work but, as far as I am aware, the capacity of Youthreach has not been increased significantly since the start of the crisis.  </p><p>  We are also concerned about the quality of some of the programmes and courses on offer.  While there is a lot of good work being done, there are some courses and training opportunities which are short-term and not very well targeted, whose value to participants is not clear or which may not be useful in leading to either further education or employment.  We are spending significant resources in this area but the question arises as to whether those resources are being spent wisely and well.</p><p>  We strongly welcome the youth guarantee and the decision of the EU Employment and Social Affairs Council last month to agree it.  We compliment the Irish Government on securing that agreement.  The NYCI was one of the first organisations in this country to call for a youth guarantee and for one to be implemented in Ireland.</p> <p>However, the idea is a good one.  The issue is how to implement it and how it will work in practice.  For us, the three key issues are funding, quality and progression, and reaching and supporting the most disadvantaged young people in Ireland.</p><p> The International Labour Organization carried out an analysis of the funding of the youth guarantee that operates in Sweden.  The analysis concluded that it cost approximately &euro;6,600 per participant.  Clearly, we cannot take a scheme from another European jurisdiction and plant it in Ireland and suggest it would be the same here, but I believe that figure would be rather low with regard to engaging with the most disadvantaged young people.  Likewise, among some people who may need limited support, that figure could be rather high.  Let us suppose we took the figure of &euro;6,600 and applied it to Ireland.  Let us further suppose we were to engage with young people who have been unemployed for 12 months or more.  We would be facing an annual bill of approximately &euro;200 million.  However, we maintain that is money well spent because the cost of leaving that cohort of young people on the live register rather than having them engaged would cost us more in the long run.  The &euro;6 billion that has been agreed by the European Union-----</p></speech>

The &euro;6 billion is welcome but perhaps Mr. Higgins has more expertise on that issue and I will leave it to him.  Anyway, there is an issue in that the Irish Government will have to provide matching funding and this is something we need to address.  I do not believe that somehow all of this money will come from Europe.  Sometimes there is a sense that it will always come from Europe but we know that is not the case.  However, Ireland is in a strong position to draw down significant resources from the fund.</p><p>  We are keen to put the issue of the private sector on the table.  The private sector benefits from the education and training of young people and many sectors of the economy have vacancies.  There is a question of whether the private sector could contribute as well.  It is clear that there is a lack of capacity.  If the Government decided to implement a youth guarantee in the morning, we simply would not have sufficient training, education or work experience places.  I am not suggesting it cannot be ramped up over time, but we certainly need to consider that issue.  Another issue we have identified is that there has not been the right emphasis.  We need a national emphasis but we need to engage with groups at local level as well.  I imagine all Deputies and Senators are aware of great work that is being done at local level.  We should engage with the community and voluntary sectors to deliver some of these places as well as ramping up schemes such as Youthreach and others.</p><p>  It is important we do not increase the number of places for the sake of it.  We must have regard to equality and progression.  We need to ensure young people benefit from the programme, especially young people who have had a bad experience of the education system and who perhaps have other issues.  Such people may need longer-term supports to enable them to get the benefits from education and training.  Some young people may have literacy or addiction issues and we believe we need to do more in that regard.  We do not want a situation whereby a young person goes through the youth guarantee process but ends up in a part-time or temporary job on low pay, because he or she will simply end up back on the live register within a short period.</p><p>  We need to put in considerable efforts in Ireland to determine how we can implement this in the best way possible and how to make the best use of resources.  There is also another concern.  The United Kingdom introduced what was known as a payment-by-results model.  The Irish Government is considering the introduction of third parties from the private sector to the activation system.  As far as I am aware in the United Kingdom, the payment-by-results model involved getting a cohort of people off the live register and moving them into employment.  Those responsible were paid based on the percentage of those who were brought into employment.  However, some of those people were progressed into not very satisfactory employment.  There was also a tendency to cherry pick those who were close to the labour market and those who needed least support.  We need to consider these issues carefully.</p><p>  We believe there is a need to concentrate primarily on the most disadvantaged young people.  We are now four or five years into the crisis.  One could argue that we are heading towards the previous scenario again but we do not want to create the problem which we had in the 1980s and 1990s whereby we created a cohort of people who were long-term unemployed and who needed a great deal of support to get back into the labour force.  In particular we are calling for an emphasis on the long-term unemployed, especially the 30,000 people who have been unemployed for more than one year and the 17,000 people who have been unemployed for two years.  They need a particular focus.  The youth guarantees in Sweden and Finland, which have been quite successful, were not as successful with this cohort.  We believe that the youth sector and the organisations we represent, which are working with young people and which have credibility in communities, could play a role.  We have already spoken to the Government in this regard and in terms of putting forward proposals that some of the money coming from the youth guarantee should be designated to address the hardest to reach and the most disadvantaged young people.  If it is not, there is a danger they will be marginalised and left behind once again.  I will leave it there but I will be glad to answer any questions later.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-21a.675" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Higgins" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013032100004#C00500"><p>I am glad to be here.  I will give some European context to the debate.  On 28 February, the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, EPSCO, approved a recommendation for a youth guarantee.  This directly followed the European Commission proposal as part of its youth employment package at the end of last year.  The Council recommended that member states begin to implement the scheme as soon as possible and preferably from the start of 2014.  I will provide some rationale behind the scheme.  Mr. Doorley said it is based on a Nordic model of early labour market activation measures which have been in operation in some ways since the 1980s.  Sweden first introduced the job guarantee, as it was termed, in 1984.  It was followed shortly afterwards by other Scandinavian countries, including Finland.  There have been many reworkings of these schemes since they were first introduced and there is a good deal that European member states can learn from the way these countries have had to adapt and change schemes to allow for the way the labour market has changed, specifically with regard to young people.</p><p>  One significant element of the Commission's proposal was the idea that youth organisations and the representatives of young people should be involved in the design and implementation of the scheme.  The reason for this, as Mr. Doorley remarked, is that it is difficult, unfortunately, to reach long-term unemployed young people because of some of the issues of social exclusion that arise for them.  Often, it requires civil society organisations to intervene.</p><p>  One major advantage of the youth guarantee, in the way it has been implemented in the Nordic model, is that it prevents the onset of long-term unemployment when it is implemented correctly.  Unfortunately, statistics show that long-term unemployment is growing in Europe as a whole.  It has increased by 3.7% since 2008 and it is increasing at a rate higher than the adult rate of long-term unemployment.  This is almost unheard of considering that young people usually do not fall into long-term unemployment in the same way as older people.</p><p>  I will outline the way it has been implemented in Sweden and Denmark.  As Mr. Doorley remarked, the programme costs approximately &euro;6,600 per participant under the Swedish model and there is considerable popularity for the scheme there.  In 2008, approximately 10,000 young people were participating in the scheme in Sweden and that figure is currently at 53,000.</p><p>  The implementation of the youth guarantee in the short term places a large strain on public employment services.  There needs to be a reorientation of public employment services in some ways towards the uptake from young people.  I will offer one example.  In Finland in 2009, due to an increased demand from young people, there was only one youth adviser for every 700 young people participating in the scheme.  Therefore, Finland had to invest radically in the scheme, but it had a good deal of success.  In 2010, Finland put more public expenditure towards it and there was successful intervention for 83.5% of young people participating.  This meant they got some form of training or a job within the three months in Finland.</p> <p>Although a lot can be said about the cost, one of the reasons it has remained popular in the Nordic countries is that in the medium to long term, it not only saves money but there is a net profit per participant.  As Mr. James Dooley mentioned, it costs approximately &euro;6,600 for young people.  However, a Swedish report produced in 2010 found that the state tends to recoup the amount of money it has invested within one year.  After the one-year period, the average net gain per participant in the scheme is just over &euro;4,000.  The short-term investment produces a long-term gain especially in terms of preventing young people from falling into long-term unemployment.  </p><p> A total of &euro;6 billion funding has been earmarked by the European Union under the MFF over a six-year period, based on the &euro;21 billion recommended by the ILO, which equates to about 0.5% of eurozone expenditure.  Even if this money was to be matched by member states, it would still be insufficient to implement the scheme fully.  As we have seen from the way it has been implemented before, if there is not sufficient investment the services often become over-burdened and the scheme will not work to the same extent.</p></speech>

In Ireland it led to the establishment of community training centres, subsequently the Youthreach programme and PLCs, initially as VPT.  It became the trigger or the driver of quite substantial system change.  It is important to bear this in mind.  I have now retired from active service, as it were, but I have been doing a study for the OECD on local youth employment strategies.  I am bringing some of the encounters from that study to this discussion.</p><p>  I will begin by stating that youth is changing.  In 1994 when the social guarantee was in place, the transition between school and employment, between youth and independent adulthood, was a fairly straightforward.  It was, relatively speaking, a short experience.  Now, a generation later, youth begins earlier; physical puberty is achieved earlier and independent adult status is achieved later.  Therefore, adolescence, <i>per se</i>, has been stretched out now between the ages of 12 and 25 - some would say even later - before emerging adulthood.  It has become an extended and quite complex process.  It is important to understand this process.  We may think that helping young people to find a stable place in the labour market is a simple exercise but in the modern context that is not actually the case.</p><p>  Work is also changing.  Young people now have a greater capacity to communicate and much greater personal freedom but there is also much less structure and predictability and jobs are of shorter duration.  This has a significant impact on how services conceive the idea of jobs and the transitions.  Although there is increased mobility, the crisis has eroded the shield that qualifications provided.  Now it is the case that unemployed young people include those with degrees.  This was not the case ten or 20 years ago when a degree was a pretty good shield against unemployment.  There are also significant levels of under-employment and part-time employment.  The guarantee is not just a matter of switching on somebody who is stuck; it is a much more complex process.  </p><p>  In Ireland we are engaged in a major and extremely ambitious reform programme with regard to employment services, education and training structures and provision and reform of local government.  These are very onerous reforms to be attempting while at the same time also trying to deal with a very complex issue such as youth employment and unemployment.</p><p>  There is no youth employment strategy.  One can infer a strategy from what is there but there is not such a strategy in place.  We have to acknowledge that the Irish education and training system is socially reproductive.  There are high levels of retention - meaning more people staying in education up to leaving certificate level - which is unusual in the European context.  However, much of this statistic may be made up of parking, so to speak, where people have no alternative.</p><p>  We have very late vocational choice in Ireland, which is unusual in the European context.  That includes vocational choices in higher education.  We have an extremely sophisticated and effective framework in vocational education training as per the national framework of qualifications.  However, that is not necessarily mirrored in the cohesion of the vocational and education and training system.  For example, we have a very small apprenticeship system and vocational education has a very low status relative to higher education and secondary education.  In this regard we are quite different to many other European countries.  </p><p>  There are major issues to do with pathways for young people.  In countries where the youth guarantee scheme has been effective they tend to have stronger vocational pathways and greater clarity in the structures.  The German system is quite determinative but our system is virtually open choice and <i>laissez-faire</i>.  Where there are not strong vocational pathways one needs to place a greater emphasis on guidance.  In Ireland one could set out on one page a set of guidance measures.  There is virtually no cohesion across the board and a very wide range of guidance issues.</p><p>  Reference was made in the earlier presentation to the issue of disadvantage.  I endorse everything Mr. Dooley said.  However, when one talks to employers, there are other issues related to education and training which are very pertinent in the context of a youth guarantee system.  I refer, for example, to the mismatch issue.  Employers will say that they are not encountering people with the required qualifications.  People are coming out of education with qualifications but these are not the qualifications which employers want.  In other words, an employer advertises a job vacancy for which many applications are received but these applications do not match up to the job being advertised.  We are not producing an appropriate balance of intermediate skills.  Employers in the call centre sector, in the hotels and catering sector, the hospitality sector or in retail, will say that they are not encountering people with the skills they require.  The jobs are available but they cannot be filled.  Very often, employers have to import talent, so to speak.</p><p>  We may also be producing large numbers of people with qualifications in ICT but employers will say that the particular qualifications are not the ones required by employers.  We have many web designers but we do not need that many web designers; we need people with other IT skills. </p><p>  Migration is an issue.  Non-Irish people are emigrating and at the same time people are coming into the country.  We have an immigration and emigration scenario.  The research has found that some of those who are emigrating have jobs and they are moving to other jurisdictions.  I refer to a study by Mary Gilmartin in Maynooth.  Her view is that it is too early to draw absolute conclusions.  We may actually be seeing an extended form of the gap year migration.  It may be that instead of staying in Ireland in a low status job, young people are travelling the world and they may still return.</p><p>  I will focus on a couple of issues to do with the youth guarantee scheme.  Is it a quick fix for the current crisis or a trigger for systematic change?  In my view it should be the trigger for system change.</p> <p>It is important to take a long-term view as well as seeking to understand the immediacy of a crisis.</p><p> A question was asked as to whether the live register is the gateway to the youth guarantee.  As members are aware, many young people are not on the live register.  Information released a couple of days ago shows that the number of young people on the live register has decreased.  If that is the case, then we have an issue and we must ensure all young people are accounted for on the live register.  That would create another potentially significant political problem because the numbers would appear to be going up, even though it would not necessarily be indicative of any substantive change in the employment scenario.</p><p> There is an issue relating to increased caseloads in respect of Intreo and the new converged employment service.  Those involved in the relevant services are also expected to meet clients three times more frequently than was the case in the past.  Once one gets into caseloads, one is at risk of developing a process whereby attempts are made to move people into and off the system quickly.  There are issues in respect of personal plans and profiles.  For example, IBEC has questioned whether the personal plan model is appropriate if it is not embedded in a deeper guidance model.  This is a matter which we must address.</p><p> Reference was made to employment options and I was asked whether there are enough jobs and, if not, what action should be taken.  I was also asked if the education and training options are suitable to local employment contexts and to the needs of the individuals who are coming through the system.  Travelling throughout the country with the OECD's LEED team, we were certainly impressed by the social enterprise models - as an alternative to employment - we encountered.  To return to what Mr. Doorley stated, this relates to the need to keep people out of long-term unemployment and to ensure the engine of employment continues to run.</p><p> There are issues with regard to quality.  The quality of what one obtains from a short-term programme must be equivalent one would obtain across the board.  Quality is a measure of evaluation and it is important it is consistent and is based on good data.  It must be remembered that there are structural and cyclical issues at play here.  Early school leaving, for example, is a structural problem.  All European Union and OECD states experience early school leaving both in good times, when systems are operating at optimum level, and in bad times.  There is a need for structural responses to structural problems and cyclical responses to cyclical problems.  It becomes quite an awkward issue because one may well be asking private sector providers to become involved in short-term contracts to provide for extra groups.  This then begs a range of questions with regard to supervision, evaluation, monitoring and so on.  In the context of the Youthreach programme, there is a quality framework whereby inspectors from the Department of Education and Skills provide external evaluations.  Those inspectors publish their evaluations on an ongoing basis in the same way as they would in respect of schools.  That is a perfectly open, transparent and rigorous quality system.  There is also a quality system in place in the youth sector whereby anybody who has been commissioned to do work with young people not from those sectors needs to be able to satisfy the same kind of rigorous quality standards.</p><p> Overall, there is another issue which arises in respect of system animation and connecting the various elements of the system.  This involves cohesion and communication.  When IBEC compiled a study of employers that are using the different supports and incentives available to them in order to take people on, it discovered that a significant number of employers were not aware of these.  We met groups of small and medium employers who stated that incentives were suited to very large employers but not to small employers.  Many stated that they had not heard about the incentives, etc.  I have figures relating to that matter which I can make available to members.  It is really important to communicate what the youth guarantee involves and what we are trying to achieve.  The Government recently changed the incentives in exactly the way that would have been recommended by employers and experts.  However, it is important that employers should be informed of this.  What we are discussing here must not merely be a mechanism for moving people off the live register.  Rather, it must change the system and be part of a wider dialogue or discourse about employment, employment generation and economic regeneration.</p></speech>

This is an important debate.  I am compiling a report on the youth guarantee for the committee and everything our guests are saying will feed into that.  If, therefore, I ask very specific questions, they will know why.</p><p>  The areas on which I wish to comment are: the practical and operational details of the youth guarantee; the successes and failures which have occurred in other states and the lessons we can learn from these; funding; and the level of roll-out required in this State.  Having considered the research material, I have discovered that the failure of youth guarantee programmes in other states came down the public policies that were pursued.  I refer in this regard to the public employment service infrastructure.  Are our guests of the view that public employment structures in Ireland are both up to standard and fit for purpose in the context of trying to deal with the youth guarantee?  How will these structures need to adapt?  Will additional funding be required?  Who will assess the success of the public employment structures into the future?  Will our guests indicate how the roll-out of the youth guarantee can be monitored effectively - in the context of job creation and placement services - to ensure it will be of good quality and will not merely be a tick-the-box exercise?  Do the public employment services have the capacity to deliver on the guarantee and to monitor the various matters relating to it?</p><p>  Mr. Doorley referred to youth unemployment figures and indicated that he is considering these in the context of young people who were educated to primary level and junior certificate level and those in disadvantaged groups.  He indicated that failures occurred in Sweden and Finland in terms of successfully targeting disadvantaged groups.  Will he inform the committee with regard to how we might reach out to young people who are far removed from the labour market at present or who do not traditionally come on the radar of the public employment services?  Mr. Doorley referred to a role for youth organisations in that regard.  The Council recommendation on the youth guarantee states that we should define the corresponding starting point to deliver the youth guarantee for young people.  Do youth organisations constitute an alternative starting point to the public employment services and, if so, how does Mr. Doorley believe they might deliver in areas in respect of which those services fail?</p><p>  Mr. Higgins referred to public employment services and the funding thereof.  He indicated that even if there were matching funding for the &euro;6 billion included under the youth employment initiative, this would be insufficient in the context of trying to deal with youth unemployment on a European level.  How should this matter be addressed?  There is a danger it could just be a flash in the pan and that people will say: "We are going to deal with youth unemployment and we will make some money available but we will not provide matching funds."  How can we ensure the guarantee will not essentially be a damp squib?  From where might we attract matching funding?  What kind of financial commitment should the Government make to roll out what is envisaged?  What schemes should it roll out as part of its initiative in this regard?</p><p>  I will leave it at that.  I am very interested in the practical and operational details.  If, however, our guests have views on particular failures relating to the schemes rolled out in other states and what we might learn from these, I would appreciate hearing them.</p></speech>

While tentative, that is indicative and welcome.  A total of 12,500 new jobs were created last year, which is good.  We have a crisis with youth unemployment that challenges all of us.  A rate of 30% youth unemployment is not acceptable.  The drop in the live register to 68,361 from 91,646 is welcome.  I am interested in Mr. Stokes's reference to the live register.  What explanation does he give for this reduction?  I presume some of it is due to the creation of new jobs and educational and training opportunities.  I understand emigration, while remaining high, has stabilised.  Given the decline in emigration, the reduction in the number on the live register cannot be explained fully by emigration.  Will the delegates explain how they interpret the change in the live register?</p><p> I wish to raise the issue of apprenticeships.  I recognise that the construction industry is in a bad place, as we all know.  However, Senator Kathryn Reilly and I were both campaigning for a couple of schools to be built and there is still infrastructure to be developed.  I accept that there is a problem in the construction sector, but apprenticeships are important.  Is enough being done to simulate apprenticeship conditions within schools, colleges and training centres?  It is not possible for young people to be offered apprenticeships.  It is good for a young person to do an apprenticeship.  One might ask what is the point in qualifying to become a blocklayer, carpenter, plumber or electrician in the current conditions, but if a person has an aspiration and a capacity in the area, it is a building point.  What do the delegates know about what has been done to simulate apprenticeship conditions to avoid people having to go on a treasure hunt seeking an apprenticeship which tends to be like jobs in Guinness&rsquo;s long ago which were passed from father to son.  It is impossible to be offered an apprenticeship.</p><p> I was preparing a speech in recent weeks for a debate in the House and during my research I came across the fact that there was a great dearth of IT personnel.  The IT sector has indicated there are approximately 4,800 vacancies which we do not have the domestic capacity to fill.  The situation is replicated in particular in Germany and other European countries.  Do the delegates consider we are doing enough to produce expertise in the sector?  Long-term unemployed youth have been identified as a problem.  It is a challenge for us to deal with the problem.  Could those with low educational attainment and the long-term unemployed be directed to the IT sector?  Are there jobs at a basic level or are all of the jobs in the sector for graduates or those who require postgraduate qualifications?  It is correct to applaud Youthreach.  We have good Youthreach centres in the constituency.  When a young person comes out of a Youthreach centre at the age of 17, 18 or 20 years with a low level of educational attainment &ndash; perhaps with FETAC qualifications &ndash; is there potential for him or her to pursue a career in the IT sector?  Could such young people find a job at the level of programmer or are all of the jobs in cloud computing and at other exalted levels?</p><p> The payment-by-results approach is interesting, on which I would like some elaboration.  I presume the training units and educational centres would receive payment according to results.  There would be equality results also.  I am a former teacher.  Reference was made in the presentation to the fact that a person should stay for the maximum period in the traditional formal school system.  Therein lies the key, as the statistics for youth unemployment bear out.  It was clearly outlined that the bulge in the pyramid relate to people with low educational qualifications who had left school young.  When the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, was in opposition, he examined this issue.  It is not always easy to get the money to do such things.  What is the opinion of the delegates of incentives to keep people in the traditional school setting?</p></speech>

Durkan, I remind members that we are expecting a vote to be called at 3.15 p.m. or 3.20 p.m.  Bearing this in mind, I urge the next speakers to limit their contributions to three minutes.  That would be appreciated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-21a.686" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013032100007#F00300"><p>I congratulate the delegates on their presentations.  This is probably the most important presentation we have heard in recent times because youth unemployment is an important and sensitive issue.  Youth are impressed by what they see around them.  In terms of a determination of what is likely to happen and what has happened, they have a short perception of history.  Montgomery said in the 1950s that in 1939 Britain was capable of fighting the First World War.  In 1993 or 1994 we were capable of dealing with the unemployment problem in this country that we had inherited from the 1980s.  That was the sad part about it and Mr. Stokes is a fitting example.  I do not say he lost the hair on his head for that reason, but my hair changed colour in the intervening period.  It is amazing the lessons we learn over a huge period.  We saw in the early 1990s that graduates came from other European countries, both from within the European Union and outside, to seek job opportunities in this country.  They worked at any job that was available.  They worked as waiters and waitresses, although they were laden with degrees.  It was embarrassing at the time and they were ideally placed to fill positions that became available.  We discovered during the 1980s that we had to deal with the problem on the basis of applying sticking plasters.  One assessed and tried to deal with issues one by one and moved on to the next group that was coming on-stream to address the matter from the point of view of the person who was unemployed and had few prospects.  The changes that have taken place in meeting market requirements in terms of job skills are hugely important.  All of us have tabled questions on the issue in recent years and it is clear that there was a disconnect somewhere along the line.  In order to meet the requirements of the market there should be some relationship with the education system to find out what is required and how to plan accordingly.  That is what we must do.  I accept that the delegates are doing this and I congratulate them on it.</p><p>  We also had another important issue to face.  During the late 1990s and 2000s a huge number of young people with great expectations, ability and capabilities were in the education system which, unfortunately, they left early.  They went into the marketplace to fill jobs in areas where there was a big demand at the time.  Huge salaries were available to people with relatively few qualifications and people were attracted to them.  How could one say to a young person that he or she should stay in education for another three or four years and that there would be a nice job for him or her or that there was the prospect of a job at a fairly attractive salary?  We must ask ourselves what are the options.  To my mind, the options are stark and simple.  We must, first, encourage young people to move in the direction which is in their long-term interests.  Two colleagues referred to outreach schemes.  That is a conduit we must explore to a greater extent.</p> <p>We have done all of that previously but the Government schemes are now beginning to focus on the issues that are affecting the young people of the country.</p><p> The emigration issue distorts our situation to some extent.  We all know young people who were in painful circumstances in that they had the option of remaining on the dole for long periods, perhaps doing the occasional nixer and being caught, or emigrating with a view to doing something for themselves and trying to get back some dignity.  It is very difficult and heart breaking to have to deal with those situations from the point of view of parents, the educational system, the youth services that are doing a great job throughout the country and the individuals themselves.</p><p> I would like to have the opportunity of having a longer debate on this subject because what is happening is not new.  It has happened throughout history, and it will continue to happen because every generation makes a mistake, even though the previous generation did so and did not learn lessons from it.  We try to introduce the finger in the dike to stop the flow at the time it happens and sometimes it works, but sometimes it does not.</p><p> I refer to the group of people throughout Europe who are disaffected and disconnected.  They are not interested.  The people in that group do not see any reason to continue.  All the people here deal with young people in that category, and they do not see any prospects for themselves.  They believe there is nothing available for them.  </p><p> We must separate from that group the people with addictions because they are different.  There is a tendency to encompass the people who are disconnected and disaffected in the same group as those who have addictions.  The people who have addictions need to be dealt with separately.  Their addictions and other problems have to be addressed.  They must be helped to understand their particular circumstances and that their addiction will not be a help to them.</p><p> The people who are disaffected are slightly different.  They have no confidence in the system.  They believe that politicians are a shower of so-and-sos.  We hear that on a regular basis.  They believe the system does not address the issues of young people, but that is wrong.  When I first came into this House a colleague of mine was the later Professor John Kelly who told me that he felt very sorry for young people, but they were not the first young generation.  We were all once part of the young generation.  Looking at the colour of the hair on my head the Chairman probably thinks I was never young, but I was.  All these situations presented themselves to us in very difficult circumstances because there were very few options available at that time.  </p><p> Why is there not enough places in education and training?  I know the answer, but I would like to hear it again.  </p><p> I referred already to the question of the most disadvantaged and those most in need being pushed to the back of the queue but what is the reason for that?  I will contribute again later.</p></speech>

I welcome the three witnesses who are specialists in the field.  Unfortunately, they are posing as many questions to us as we wish to pose to them.</p><p>  The &euro;6 billion from the European Union is more than welcome.  I presume it would be over the five year period of the budget and internationally targeted throughout.  I understand it will probably be broken down even within wealthier countries to targeted areas of disadvantage.  </p><p>  A major problem in this country is the class and structural divide between the early school leavers and the social housing dependent groups.  I want to ask about the type of structures we should be putting in place.  When I first got involved in the community sector I almost had to learn a new language but even in terms of targeting people into employment, we currently have JobBridge, community employment, T&uacute;s, the JobsPlus initiative and the Momentum programme.  I do not know at this stage whether the CERT training programme still exists.  That was a training programme for people in the catering industry.  We also have SOLAS as a new structure.</p><p>  My particular interest is in the statistics the witnesses presented to the committee, particularly about targeting the long-term unemployed.  The long-term unemployed, in the main, tend to be early school leavers but I understand this European youth guarantee only comes into play for those between the ages of 18 and 24.  To talk geographically, I represent Dublin South Central and I can tell the witnesses that one can read the statistics about the degrees of disadvantage in Dublin 10 and Dublin 8.  The disadvantage is comparable in terms of early school leavers, social housing schemes, all the inner city flat complexes.  In terms of Cherry Orchard and Ballyfermot, Dublin 10, there is a large number of statistics to prove disadvantage.</p><p>  Do we need a number of new structures to target people?  Somebody mentioned the need to involve the community and voluntary sector.  Those of us who know the area well will be aware of the EU urban programme attached to Cherry Orchard and Ballyfermot, of which I was a big fan.  That programme transformed Cherry Orchard and Ballyfermot.  It was a successful, targeted programme to uplift a community not by way of employment, but by way of the provision of services from cr&egrave;ches to preschool facilities, parks, leisure centres and so on.  Do the witnesses believe there is any validity in arguing that specific structures be put in place within regions of Dublin, for example, targeting a particular structure in Dublin 8 and Dublin 10 for a particular coterie of people?</p></speech>

Sorry about that.</p><p>  It is rather complex.  We might revisit this because I am not sure what criteria central Government will use in drawing down funds.  Are we building this up as a solution to a problem that has already been created by the children who leave school before the age of 18?  </p><p>  What would we do if we could not look at what our Nordic cousins are doing?  The problem is that they pay a large amount of taxes.  The people of this country want the services but do not seem to be able to come to terms with the cost of the provision of these services.  </p><p>  I know intimately the work of Youthreach.  It is a phenomenally successful concept and the staff who work in it are well able to relate to the client base.  Everyone involved in Youthreach should take a bow.  I am not as familiar with all the other programmes as I am with Youthreach, as a former CDVEC employee.  My questions are about the structures and whether we are coming too late to help that coterie of people, namely, the early school leavers who will become long-term unemployed.</p></speech>

It concerns the timescales for this process.  Mention was made of the need to ramp it up and that there is not a sufficient number of schemes.  What is the witnesses' best estimate on when a youth guarantee scheme can be up and running in its entirely in the country, bearing in mind the issue of funding and the need for some sort of pilot scheme?  When do the witnesses believe something will happen in this country?  Bearing in mind the time, I ask the witnesses to limit their comments to about six or seven minutes each.  Does Mr. Higgins want to go first?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-21a.692" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Higgins" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013032100008#G00600"><p>I thank the members for the questions.  I want to clarify I am not here on behalf of any Nordic Government.</p> <p>There are a lot of questions specific to Ireland that I will leave to Mr. Doorley.  I will address Senator Reilly's question on the operation level of the youth guarantee.  The first phase in tackling youth unemployment is to bite the bullet.  The official rate across the Union is 24% but young people are much less likely to approach their public employment service than older people.  The first stage is to get a real grip on the actual number of young unemployed people.</p><p> One weakness of the Swedish model was that it focused too much on jobs.  What happened, unfortunately, was that some young people were pushed into jobs that were not appropriate for them.  I refer to the skills mismatch that was mentioned.  The Swedes have worked to address the problem.  The Finns knew about the problem when they began with implementation so there was much more focus on vocational education and training, with a slightly more long-term approach.  It has had more success, even in respect of the level of uptake among young people interested in the scheme.</p><p> One of the main problems in many European countries, as mentioned by everyone, especially Deputy Durkan, is that some public employment services unfortunately operate at a level that obtained perhaps ten or 20 years ago in terms of the labour market.  The labour market is much changed, especially in regard to the flexibility younger people have by comparison with older workers.  In Belgium, where the European Youth Forum is based, it takes between nine and 12 months to obtain one's social benefits and dole.  This period involves an activation measure that applies before one is eligible to obtain benefits.  For many young people, it takes so long and it is so difficult to get benefits that it is very difficult to motivate them to come off them.  This is just one example of how some of the schemes are not in the interest of young people.</p><p> Senator Reilly asked about funding and its origin.  The &euro;6 billion that is earmarked is for a six-year period.  It applies to a region known as NUTS 2 and is distributed on a regional basis.  This has many advantages because some regions in Europe have a level of youth unemployment that is much higher than the national average.  The fund will go to about 16 member states.</p><p> The funding of &euro;6 billion is an investment and is to be welcomed for what it is, but in terms of the overall budget, the European Youth Forum contends that young people deserve a much bigger investment, specifically when one considers how much money the youth guarantee could save in the longer term if implemented correctly.  Let me give an example.  I read in <i>The Irish Times </i>recently that &euro;5 billion in EU funds was misappropriated in 2010 alone.  If one compares this with the &euro;6 billion investment over six years for the youth guarantee system, one gets a more comparative figure.</p><p> There were many questions on vocational education and training.  The German and Austrian systems are very developed in this regard and there is much to be learned from them.  In Germany, there is a labour market that very much lends itself to vocational education and training.  It is a very highly developed industrial labour market that can absorb young people who undertake training in this area.  In the Irish case, there is a lot to be learned, specifically in respect of getting young people into the IT sector.  The sector is well represented here.</p><p> On the question of whether we need new structures, I have learned from other countries that it is not necessarily a case of throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  There are many structures in place that are very good.  It is about reorienting them towards the needs of young people and bringing in measures in which young people can believe.  It may be a matter of bringing in youth organisations as part of a monitoring mechanism to ensure the youth guarantee schemes that are introduced are always in the interest of the young people who participate in them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-21a.694" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Doorley" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013032100009#H00200"><p>Senator Reilly asked whether the public employment service is fit for purpose.  We surveyed young jobseekers two or three years ago and asked them about their experience in engaging with F&Aacute;S and the Department of Social Protection.  Generally, jobseekers understood the system was under a lot of pressure and that the numbers had increased a lot in recent years.  Generally, apart from one or two good examples, there was a sense that jobseekers did not receive the sort of engagement they needed.  Jobseekers just felt they were given information at a hatch five or six times without getting the expected support.  The new Intreo model represents an effort to have greater engagement, but this requires many more people on the front line engaging with jobseekers, especially young jobseekers because many of them do not have work experience.  They are in a different set of circumstances.  It is really important that their needs be addressed.</p><p>  Many young jobseekers take jobseeking very seriously because they feel that if they make the wrong choice in regard to a training course or work experience, it could be detrimental to their careers.  They regard engagement with the service as similar to a job interview and are disappointed if they are just given five minutes.  I have heard some really dispiriting examples.  Just last week, we had consultation with youth workers who are working with the category of young people in question.  People in the public employment services are working under great pressure and have considerable workloads and many are doing great work, but in some cases young people get a very negative reaction from staff.  They may feel demeaned and this does not really help to encourage them to engage.</p><p>  We need independent monitoring of the youth guarantee in Ireland.  We will need to know whether it is working and we need the involvement of the young people who are using the system.  The latter is vital.  There is not enough external evaluation of public employment services.</p><p>  One must put oneself into the shoes of disadvantaged young people.  Many young people might have had a very bad experience of the education system.  The level of trust of young people in the system is quite low, as stated by Deputy Durkan.  They get the letter in the post from the F&Aacute;S office and automatically assume it contains bad news.  Many of our member organisations and youth workers have credibility and a track record.  We are not saying they comprise the total solution but that people working with disadvantaged young people have a role to play.  We are not training providers and we are not offering an employment service but many of our member organisations could serve as a bridge to the young people who will not go to a training centre.  Many young people in the category in question have actually been thrown off training courses because they are not prepared.  They might have had difficulties and started with an addiction problem, as said by Deputy Durkan, and may not have the supports necessary to help them.  It is a question of support to keep them on track.</p><p>  With regard to Deputy O'Reilly's question on whether the rate is lower, emigration is obviously a factor.  The number staying in education and training is also a factor.  There is a growing category of young people who do not qualify for social welfare benefits.  They are living at home with their parents and might be just over the threshold so do not see the point of signing on.  Mr. Stokes might have said that if the live register is to become a gateway for the youth guarantee, we will have a problem.  This is because there will be a category of young people who are not signing on and who will not come under the guarantee under the current model.</p><p>  I agree on apprenticeships.  The number of apprenticeships dropped from 8,000 per year to 1,000 per year because of the crash in the construction sector.  Apprenticeships are a real alternative for many young people who may not want to be web designers.  They may want a trade or skill and we need to do more about this.  I recently encountered a scheme in Drogheda that offers funding to do up old local authority houses that have been neglected.  The scheme uses young people to renovate houses over eight or nine months.</p><p>  Under the payment-by-results model in the United Kingdom, as I understand it, the Government involved the private sector and offered to pay a certain sum if 70% or 80% of 10,000 unemployed people, for example, were moved on within a certain period.</p> <p>Our concern is that for some young people, it might be very ambitious to state they will be in a job in six or 12 months.  They might need a lot more support and if the process is completely focused on getting a young person into a job within six or 12 months, the young people who are closer to the labour market will be picked and the others forgotten.  My understanding is it created some absurd situations where churning took place, whereby people were being moved into jobs but ended up back on the dole again, even though the private provider was paid for moving them on into that job.  There were a lot of issues in this regard.</p><p> Deputy Bernard J. Durkan also is correct when he observes we have been here before.  Unfortunately, all the analysis shows the youth guarantee is the sort of thing one would have in the good times because it would catch people before they fell into long-term unemployment, rather than doing so in the middle of a crisis.  As has been noted, it is a major task to do it while undergoing such huge institutional reform in the public employment services and further education and training sector.  However, our point on the most disadvantaged young people in particular is that it is about giving them a little confidence or hope.  Some young people may think to themselves there is no point in going on a training course or staying on to complete one's leaving certificate examinations because no jobs are available.  However, we are trying to put forward the argument that while things may be tough, one can give them that sense of hope, as well as resilience and the soft skills many employers also seek.  While people may not have hard skills, employers certainly need soft skills such as consistency, the ability to work in a team and make decisions, as well as showing innovation and similar skills that are really important in the current labour market.</p><p> On Deputy Eric Byrne's points, I agree that we must ensure the money is targeted.  As to how this is done, while obviously it is a matter for the Government, during the 1990s particular schemes operated - the Deputy mentioned the urban programme -  that made sure the money did not get lost between the European Union, Departments and different agencies.  It did go almost straight into communities, which definitely is what must be ensured.  The Deputy also made a valid point with which I certainly agree in respect of coherence.  I have been trying to carry out an analysis of the different schemes and programmes and there is a lack of coherence because a lot of schemes have different conditions for different age groups.  While there are certain reasons for this, there is also a lack of coherence and even the staff dealing with jobseekers find it very difficult to understand for what a person who comes in, having been unemployed for nine months, actually qualifies.  It is a difficult job and perhaps we might try to make further education and training and the employment support system a little more coherent and a lot less complex.  In addition, as Mr. Stokes mentioned, we could try to make it more joined up in order that it is not a lottery.  People become extremely upset when they think they are eligible for a course and then find out they are obliged to wait for a further six months.</p><p> On the Chairman's points on the timescale, it would be an issue in certain respects.  I assume the European funding is an integral part for the Government, but it may not commence until 2015.  However, the Government can do a lot immediately.  There is a pilot scheme for which it has applied in Ballymun, as far as I am aware, in which we are involved.</p></speech>

While one must take a long-term view of all these measures, one can start in the understanding that one will not finish it very quickly.  I was handed the brief for Youthreach in 1988 and it took the guts of two decades to move from the point at which there was nothing to something that was able to stand alongside other things.  Consequently, one must take a long-term view, even though one must act very quickly and one can do both.</p><p>  As for the local structures, one item afoot under the proposals in respect of education and training boards and so on is an attempt to establish local structures that will be responsive.  There is a risk that this could be instrumental and would lose the developmental functions, for example, that VECs traditionally have fulfilled.  However, if one takes into account the education and training boards that are coming into play, the local development companies and partnerships, as well as the new structures in the context of the local authority reforms and realignment, it may not be a matter of establishing new entities at local level.  However, as Mr. Doorley also mentioned, local action is extremely important.  This is because there are variations right across the board and whatever national framework policies are introduced they must be capable of interpretation at the local level in flexible ways that are tailored to working.</p><p>  In respect of the payments for results issue, the critical point pertains to cherry-picking.  If several hundred young people are looking for a place, if one has 20 places available and placing them all in employment is a condition of getting all of one's funding, inevitably one will select those who are most employable and cherry-pick.  That was a major problem with some of the F&Aacute;S programmes in the late 1980s and early 1990s such as the youth skills programme.  When one comes to monitoring their effectiveness, one actually winds up monitoring the "in person" factors rather than the "in training" factors, if members understand my point.  In other words, what looks very effective when one considers the results may actually not pertain to the effectiveness of either the training or the action but to the people one has selected to participate.  This is a significant issue.</p><p>  On apprenticeships, I wish to make two points.  First, I refer to those areas where numbers declined in, for example, traditional apprenticeship areas.  Incidentally, we have a very narrow apprenticeship system in Ireland.  However, with regard to such areas, in the past we have made use of mechanisms such as, for example, the community youth training programme that F&Aacute;S used to run.  One still sees signs around the country that houses, buildings or old heritage sites were renovated.  In many instances, they were temporary employment mechanisms that allowed people to continue on the path of apprenticeship during a period of low employment or a period in which employers were not able to take them on board.  F&Aacute;S also had a linked work experience programme, which was another useful mechanism.  Consequently, the models are available to maintain the apprenticeship line, but it also is the case that there is an increasing interest internationally; one can see it here in initiatives such as JobBridge, in what might be described as apprenticeship-style measures that focus on using the workplace, linking the training and the workplace and putting the individual in a work environment.  There are many benefits to so doing, but perhaps it is at a higher level and might be described as a professional apprenticeship model.  That also would surmount a comment which frequently is made by many employers to the effect that many young people are ill-prepared for work when they are employed.  I have heard it from small employers and very youth-friendly employers, as well as people who had no particular bias one way or the other and it is a consistent comment from small, medium and large employers.  Some of this pertains to expectations, perhaps as a hangover from the Celtic tiger period, when people expected to walk straight into a job which paid well.  There are many possible explanations for this.</p> <p>There is a remarkable consistency in what employers say.  For example, a person may come in having done a degree and having had 30 days to do a project in the workplace, they are expected to do that within a day.  I have met groups of employers in Dublin and the south east as part of the study I was working on.  They consistently said it takes six months for a young person to get up to speed in order to make a contribution to the enterprise.</p><p> Apprenticeship approaches, including internships like JobBridge, are a way of overcoming that.  They are also a way of connecting the world of employment and work with the world of education and training.  Over the years in Ireland we have allowed for that.  The high demand in the labour market meant nobody needed to work hard at that bridge, which simply existed by virtue of high labour market demand.  As a model to connect the world of work with the education and training sector, apprenticeship is very significant and important.  I anticipate that we will be paying much more attention to that in future.</p><p> A question was asked about IT skills.  The FIT programme is an effective way of working, particularly in relatively disadvantaged areas and connecting them with work in the IT sector.  There are good data supporting the approach and a strong evaluative culture within that action.</p><p> It is the case that those who find it most difficult to engage with the labour market and services are, simply by virtue of how things work, liable to wind up at the back of the queue.  That is something that must be addressed.</p><p> A question was asked about whether public employment services were fit for purpose.  A discussion needs to occur at the operational level between employment services, education and training providers, and community and voluntary services, including local development companies.</p><p> People on the social protection side are focused on the disadvantaged and those furthest from the labour market.  Their worry is that because education and training providers will be judged on the basis of placement and results, the focus will be on the easy to place and not the most disadvantaged.  Regardless of whether that is correct, it indicates a strong need for them to talk and all be of one mind when it comes to focusing on target groups at a local level.  In other words, the action must be consistent, coherent and collaborative between different arms of the service.</p><p> It comes back to the point about whether the public employment service is the gateway to the youth guarantee.  If so, it would suggest that the public employment service is in the driving seat.  That sets up another relationship with employers and education and training providers who become clients of the public employment service.  Historically, there has always been an uneasiness on the public employment services side regarding their relationship with education and training providers.  Equally, the latter are very uneasy with seeing themselves as being service providers to the public employment service.  Therefore, a serious conservation needs to happen, especially at a local operational level.</p><p> The question of guidance is particularly pertinent to the more disadvantaged clients of the public employment service.  It comes back to how people are being trained.  At the moment, substantial numbers of people are being drawn together from three very different services into the one organisation through Intreo.</p><p> A community welfare officer has a set of skills that do not readily translate into the case management of an unemployed person, yet that is how the service will operate.  There is a good deal of inter-service knowledge exchange, which will be important.  Creating the time for that is also important.  Intreo staff will have to meet people three times as often as they did under the national employment action plan process.  Suddenly therefore, people will have a significant increase in their workload.  At the same time, we are asking them to engage at close quarters locally.</p><p> Employers consistently say they are not talked to locally about service provision, employment services or education and training.  We had a meeting with some very significant employers, who have been doing important developments in the south east.  They said it was the first time anyone had ever asked them to such a meeting.  The employment service got to meet that set of demands from the local education providers and also increased their level of activity.  It is quite a challenge.</p></speech>

Its mission statement is to lead the effort to improve the outcomes for children and young people in Ireland.  Therefore, by its nature, the Department has a cross-departmental focus and remit.  I will outline some of the key areas that might be of interest to the committee with regard to what we are doing to tackle child poverty.  The Department is currently developing a high-level national policy framework for children and young people from birth to the age of 25.  This is expected to include inputs from all relevant Departments and to be approved by the Government later this year.  It will be supported by three detailed strategies which will focus on specific and overlapping age cohorts: children in the early years from birth to the age of six, children from birth to the age of 18 and young people from the age of 12 to the age of 25.  This reflects the different emphases at different stages of young people's lives and the key transitional points between each stage.  It is intended to have a single implementation plan which will be monitored and reported on to the Government over the lifetime of the three strategies from 2013 to 2018.</p><p>  The issue of child poverty will be addressed by the Department through its policy framework by linking in with key Departments such as the Departments of Social Protection and Education and Skills, both of which are represented at today's meeting.  In addition, the Department oversees a number of policy areas and forms of service provision which help to address the cycle of poverty.  I will speak briefly about them in a moment.  Early childhood care and education is provided through the free preschool year programme.  Subsidised child care is provided to low-income parents.  The Department is responsible for the National Educational Welfare Board and for youth work programmes.  It encourages inter-agency work and implements prevention and early intervention programmes in areas of high disadvantage to break the cycle of poverty.  This has the effect of encouraging more effective service provision at national level in the longer term.  The free preschool year and early childhood care and education programme was introduced in January 2010 as a universal free programme to provide equal access to early education for all children, particularly the most disadvantaged who might otherwise not attend preschool.  It has a take-up of 95% and currently costs &euro;175 million per annum.  It is availed of by approximately 66,000 children at the moment.</p><p>  The Department implements two child care schemes which subsidise child care places for low-income parents.  First, the community child care subvention scheme is operated through approximately 900 community child care services.  Some 25,000 children receive subsidised child care under the scheme.  The weekly subsidy - &euro;95 for full day care - is paid to such services in respect of parents who are in receipt of social welfare payments such as family income support and who also have medical cards.  A lower subsidy of &euro;50 per week is paid to services in respect of parents who have medical or GP visit cards.  The community child care subvention scheme costs approximately &euro;50 million per annum.  Second, the child care education and training scheme subsidises child care places in approximately 1,450 community and privately operated child care services.  This scheme is open to qualifying F&Aacute;S and VEC trainees and students who are required to contribute up to &euro;25 per week for a full day care place.  Some 2,500 full-time equivalent places are available at any time under the scheme.  It is estimated that this equates to some 8,000 students and trainees benefitting from the provision of places each year.  Obviously, not everybody needs a full day care place, or a place for the full year.  The child care education and training scheme costs approximately &euro;20 million per annum.</p><p>  The Department is responsible for the National Educational Welfare Board, which is due to become part of the new child and family support agency when it is established later this year.  The board is responsible for supporting regular school attendance and advising and assisting schools, children and parents in cases of attendance or behavioural issues.  The board works with between 8,000 and 10,000 children and families each year.  Some &euro;9 million is being provided to it in 2013.  The board implements the educational welfare service and is responsible for the school completion programme, which supports 124 projects in 472 primary and 225 post-primary schools, most of which are linked to the DEIS programme.  The aim of the programme is to keep young people in formal education until they have completed the senior cycle or equivalent and to improve the quality of their educational participation and attainment.  Each project under the programme is tailored locally.  The projects provide in-school, after-school and holiday-time interventions to approximately 38,000 targeted children and young people throughout the country who are at risk of leaving school early.  This year's provision for the school completion programme is &euro;26.5 million.</p><p>  The third area for which the National Educational Welfare Board is responsible is the home school community liaison scheme, which is a school-based preventative strategy that targets children and young people who are at risk.  As the 408 co-ordinators under the scheme are seconded teachers, their staffing costs are borne by the Department of Education and Skills.  They work with parents, teachers and local voluntary and statutory groups to tackle issues that impinge on learning.  Rather than providing support directly to children, they tend to favour more indirect forms of support.  The National Educational Welfare Board is working to integrate the three services I have mentioned under the "one child, one team, one plan" model.  It is intended to bring the three services together as a single seamless service for children, young people and families.  The unified service will record assessments of need, provide intervention plans and take inputs into those plans from all three services.</p><p>  The Department also has a significant youth work programme, which supports the youth sector in providing effective non-formal education and development opportunities to young people, thereby allowing them to enhance and develop their personal and social skills and competencies.  Some &euro;53 million is available for these universal and targeted schemes this year, of which &euro;40 million is targeted at more disadvantaged youth.  Youth work programmes and services are delivered to some 400,000 young people by approximately 1,400 youth workers.  We also have a volunteer base of approximately 40,000.  The Department also funds the development of youth cafes, of which there are approximately 75 across the country.  These successful interventions are provided to young people in an alcohol-free environment.  Another major concern of the Department is to promote inter-agency working at local level.  To date, we have established children's services committees in 16 counties.  These committees are important because they bring statutory and non-statutory service providers in local areas together to adopt a co-ordinated approach to their planning and delivery.  This results in more effective service delivery as well as being more cost-effective.  The work that has been done to date is being consolidated this year by the Department.  We intend to standardise the process and, subject to Government approval, roll out children's services committees as a national system from next year.</p><p>  In budget 2013, the Government announced two initiatives to support children and families that are being implemented by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The first of these involves an area-based response to child poverty.  It has been given funding of &euro;2.5 million this year, to increase to approximately &euro;5 million in each of the subsequent years up to 2016.  The initiative has been developed jointly by the Department and the T&aacute;naiste's office.  It continues and builds on work that was previously done by a previous initiative of the office of the Minister for children, which has been delivered in partnership with Atlantic Philanthropies since 2007.</p> <p>This initiative, known as the prevention and early intervention programme, PEIP, tested a number of service interventions for children and families in Tallaght, Ballymun and Darndale.  It was essentially the pilot phase of the area-based approach to child poverty.  The programmes in the three areas in question have been evaluated and the impact on outcomes for children in an Irish context assessed.</p><p> The work of the prevention and early intervention programme will be continued in the new initiative, which will focus on the programmes that have been proven and found to be cost-effective.  Commencing later this year, the initiative will be rolled out to a number of additional sites where there are high levels of disadvantage and poor outcomes for children.  We also hope to begin the process of mainstreaming the proven and cost-effective programmes at national level.  I hope this process will be assisted by the new child and family support agency when it is established later this year.  It is hoped the agency will lead the charge on mainstreaming.  The Department has been working on implementing the initiative since January and is being assisted by an interdepartmental project team.  It is hoped to launch the application process for the initiative in April and, if possible, have projects selected by the end of June.  The three sites which were under the PEIP are expected to continue in the new initiative, with the focus, as I noted, on proven and cost-effective programme delivery.</p><p> The second initiative announced in budget 2013 is a school age child care scheme, which will have a provision of &euro;14 million in a full year.  This funding is being transferred from the Vote of the Department of Social Protection to the Vote of the Department of Education and Skills.  Work is under way between the two Departments to introduce the scheme, which will provide more than 6,000 school age child care places to primary schoolchildren of targeted social protection clients who are entering employment.  Similar to existing schemes, parents will receive subsidised after-school care, resulting in their contribution being limited to approximately &euro;18 per week.  We hope to pilot the scheme from next month and have it fully operational from September.  In addition to it being an additional scheme operated by the Department, we are also planning for it to fit into the continuum of our existing child care supports for low income parents in order that they can move from one scheme to another, as appropriate.</p></speech>

I understand the joint committee first invited the relevant Departments with a role in children and youth affairs that are best placed to contribute to a cross-departmental strategy on childhood poverty and that it seeks an update on the work being done in this area by the relevant Departments.</p><p>  I will first comment on the general role of the Department of Social Protection.  According to its statement of strategy, the mission of the Department is to promote active participation in society.  It does this mainly through providing a range of income support and other payments and through the provision of employment services such as job assistance, job search and other supports aimed at allowing persons to improve their living standards and life chances.  The Department administers more than 70 separate schemes and services which impact on the lives of almost every citizen.  Expenditure in 2013 is expected to be in the region of &euro;20 billion.  These payments play a key role in supporting those most in need, including children and their parents, persons who are unemployed or sick, carers, people with disabilities and older people.  Specific roles provided by the Department include the development of social protection and social inclusion policy; promoting and supporting the incorporation of anti-poverty and social inclusion objectives in policy development; monitoring the implementation of these strategies; administration of a wide range of social insurance and social assistance schemes for children, persons of working age, carers, persons with disabilities and pensioners; and activation, employment and community services and programmes to promote development, progression, participation and social involvement of our clients.</p><p>  These payments and functions set the context for considering the Department's specific role in tackling childhood poverty.  The most obvious role is to pay benefits to families with children, with specific supports directed at such families.  While the best known of these supports is the child benefit payment, there are also a number of other payments such as increases for qualified children to the main adult weekly payments, the family income supplement and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  The Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection only yesterday held a meeting with the chair of the advisory group on tax and social welfare on the issue of payments to families with children.  The meeting was held to discuss the group's recently published report on child and family income support payments.</p><p>  An increasingly important role for the Department is the activation of parents and the provision of assistance to allow them to take up employment.  While this is a long-standing objective of the social welfare system, the recent merger of the Department with the employment services of F&Aacute;S and the community welfare services of the Health Service Executive has had major implications for this role and the future potential of the Department in addressing parental and child poverty through employment and measures to improve parental employability.  The Department also has a role in monitoring its national action for social inclusion, in particular the Government's target to reduce the number of people in poverty.  Following a review by the Department last year, the Government set a new poverty target and announced its intention to introduce a specific sub-target for children to refocus efforts on this issue.  Practical discussions on how to implement this decision are under way with interested stakeholders. </p><p>  The Department does not work alone in this area and participates in a number of interdepartmental bodies, including the national children's strategy implementation group led by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Through this work, it seeks to participate in a joined-up way in tackling issues of child poverty.  The Department also represents Ireland on international bodies involved in social policy, notably the Social Protection Committee of the European Union, which played a major role in drafting the Council of Ministers conclusions on preventing and tackling child poverty and social inclusion and promoting children and well-being, which were published in October 2012.  The Department is also co-ordinating the preparation of Council conclusions on the European Commission's recently published social investment package.  One element of the package was the Commission recommendation in the area of investing in children.  I will be pleased to elaborate on any of the issues I have outlined.</p></speech>

Members will have noted the links in this area from the presentations made by my colleagues, particularly that of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>  The Department of Education and Skills has a strong focus on tackling educational disadvantage and social inclusion generally.  I will speak about the DEIS programme, which is the central plank of the Department's policy in this area.  While some of those present who have a background in the education sector or in working with children will be familiar with the programme, it is useful to give some context to the later discussion.  DEIS, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools: An Action Plan for Educational Inclusion, is the policy instrument of the Department of Education and Skills for addressing educational disadvantage.  Since its introduction in 2006, DEIS has focused on addressing and prioritising the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities, from preschool through to second level education.  Its frame of reference is based on the definition of educational disadvantage in the Education Act 1998, according to which educational disadvantage involves the "impediments to education arising from social or economic disadvantage which prevent students from deriving appropriate benefit from education in schools".  These impediments are complex and multifaceted and are underpinned by a range of factors, which includes family poverty.</p><p>  Research carried out by the Educational Research Centre prior to the introduction of DEIS found strong evidence that the disadvantage associated with poverty and social exclusion assumes a multiplier effect when large numbers of pupils in a school are from a similar disadvantaged background.  This is known as the social context effect.  In recognition of this, DEIS included a standardised system for identifying schools on the basis of their relative levels of disadvantage and prioritised supports in schools serving the most disadvantaged children and young people.  The objective of DEIS is clear; it provides supports to schools to combat the underlying cause of educational disadvantage, in other words, to level the playing pitch in order that young people have an opportunity to derive maximum personal benefit from the education system.  Enhancing attendance, progression, retention and attainment are central elements of DEIS.  Interventions include a concentration on literacy and numeracy from an early stage, strong links between home, school and community, strong links between schools working co-operatively together and added value from links between education and other services working with children and families.</p><p>  A key focus of current policy is to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk and optimise access, participation and outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged and marginalised groups.  Therefore, the additional resources available in DEIS schools should be used to achieve good outcomes for those children who are identified as the most at risk of not achieving their potential through education.</p> <p> It should be noted that DEIS is part of a continuum of interventions to address educational disadvantage.  These include early childhood care and education, through the universal preschool provision scheme, early child care education, ECCE, second chance education and training and access measures for the minority of our young people, who for various reasons leave education early without the knowledge and skills they need to support them in later life.  A further element of this continuum is the ongoing development of provision for pupils with special educational needs.</p><p> Since the implementation of DEIS, there has been an ongoing evaluation of the programme and the findings indicate encouraging evidence that the DEIS programme is having a positive effect on tackling educational disadvantage.  Separate Educational Research Centre, ERC, and inspectorate reports published in January 2012 show some encouraging results to date.  For example, there have been significant improvements in both maths and reading ability in primary schools.  Progress appears most marked among pupils with the lower levels of achievement, which is encouraging.  Practically all of the primary schools reported significant measurable improvements in the attendance levels of their pupils, while the majority of post-primary schools had effective measures in place to improve attendance.  There is increased positive engagement with education on the part of parents in school life and in their children's education.  A recurring theme when one talks about this area is that the involvement of parents in the school life and education of their children and the valuing of education by parents is key to this issue.</p><p> The reports also point to where improvements are needed in some schools with regard to planning and outcomes.  Acting on this, in 2012 the Department issued revised guidelines on the appropriate use of the DEIS grant, emphasising that DEIS funding should be used to obtain the outcomes identified in the schools DEIS action plan, the importance of each school having a DEIS action plan and that it should be available for inspection by the Department's inspectorate.  In other words, schools should do what the DEIS programme asks them to do.  The Department also emphasised in grant payment letters issued to all DEIS schools the link between inputs and outcomes in the context of the evaluation of the programme.  It is also surveying selected schools on the spending of their DEIS grant in order to identify supports and interventions which are key to the schools' delivery on their DEIS action plans.</p><p> During 2013, the ERC will undertake further research in DEIS post-primary schools to review the implementation and outcomes of DEIS supports at post-primary level.  It will also carry out further testing at primary level to ensure that the longitudinal element of the evaluation can be maintained, adding to data already collected in 2007 and 2010.  The Department is focused on ensuring that existing resources are deployed in the most cost efficient way and it is currently undertaking a review of the delivery of the existing programme, with a view to ensuring that schools make the best use of current funding.  The findings of completed and current studies will provide the basis, in terms of programme implementation and outcomes, to inform an exploration of future policy on educational disadvantage generally.  While the outcomes of DEIS are largely positive and achievement levels are improving, the performance in DEIS schools still falls below the standard norm.  This points to a requirement for continued support for these schools, to build on the gains identified in the evaluation of achievement testing.  </p><p> I would like to give the committee some idea of the kind of money made available for educational disadvantage so as to illustrate the financial commitment being made by the Department to tackling this area.  Overall funding in 2012, on interventions ranging from early childhood to supports for third level students, was in the order of &euro;690 million.  Some &euro;94 million is allocated to the DEIS programme to support over 165,000 pupils.  This funding provides for reduced class sizes, a home-school liaison service, the support teacher project, DEIS and book grants to individual schools.  DEIS schools also receive further support from the colleague Departments of Children and Youth Affairs and Social Protection through the school meals programme and the school completion programme.  I will be happy to deal with questions on this in our discussion.  The Department has also been involved in some of the PE initiatives that have been in place for a number of years and will also be involved in the area-based poverty initiative to be rolled out later this year.</p></speech>

I probably reflect the situation for most of us when I say that we did not have prior sight of the contributions that they were going to make, which normally help us to concentrate and prepare for our discussion.  I am winging it here in terms of what has been said, but there are some broader points I would like to make in the context of tackling child poverty.</p><p>  It is great that we have representatives from the three Departments here together.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is a new Department and I am hugely enthusiastic about it and believe it will, given the fullness of time, prove its worth.  Mr. Bohan is the unfortunate holder of the responsibility for the Department of Social Protection here today.  Many of our concerns are reflected in that area, particularly due to the austerity programme and the cuts and impacts of it for our respective constituents.  I acknowledge there have tremendous improvements in regard to the Department of Education and Skills and that there have been some important initiatives in terms of improving the circumstances in which children are educated.  There is much yet to be done and I have no doubt all of our witnesses are more than cognisant of everything I have said.</p><p>  In my view, there is one glaring omission here, the HSE.  As things stand, despite Ms O'Mara having alluded to the advent of the child and family support agency, for at least this year the responsibility rests within the HSE.   For the time being, the Family Support Agency continues under the aegis of the HSE, but it is not represented here.  However, while the representatives of the three Departments are here, I would like to say that I feel that while they are here together, they are not always acting together in the interest of children.  There is not sufficient evidence to give me confidence or certainty that there is real joined-up thinking across Departments <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>  the consequences of decisions made and matters being implemented.  They need to move from this point to a greater level of relationship with regard to the impact of decisions made.  This would give me great hope.</p><p>  We have a population of just over 1 million people under 18 years of age, which puts into context what we are talking about here.  Child poverty is a huge area and it represents itself in many ways, as we have all mentioned here time after time.  We have real poverty, relative poverty and many other indicators of situations where children are left out.  They may not be viewed by many in their immediate communities as being in poverty or threatened by poverty, but the impact of being left out of opportunity and of having the doors of opportunity closed to them has adverse effects on these young people preparing for adult life.  I accept this view is shared across all political views in this committee.</p><p>  It is very difficult to focus on what we can do other than encourage the joined-up thinking approach.  Like the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. we are very anxious to see the child and family support agency established and to see the various pieces of legislation, which I expect will have a very positive bearing on the situation regarding children, passed. </p> <p>Even with the passage of all that has been signalled, it comes back to the fact that resourcing is hugely important.  We have made this point time after time.  I am not closed to acceptance that we do not have an endless pool.  It will mean different prioritisation as well as the creation of new forms of resourcing.  I believe that both are achievable.  What those of us at my point in life want to see in later adult life is hope restored for our children, and not necessarily for us and our time, because that may not be achievable within the current circumstances.  Hope must be restored for our children and for their futures.  What that would mean to parents and communities would be massive.</p><p> I will conclude with some observations, if I may.  I apologise for being a little long-winded.  I refer to many of the measures taken by the Department of Social Protection, although I am not suggesting for a moment that the responsibility rests on the shoulders of Mr. John Bohan and the Department, because these are political decisions ultimately.  However, I am deeply concerned about the impact of many of these decisions in some of the areas that have been alluded to, which I will not single out.</p><p> I acknowledge that the Department of Education and Skills has done much.  Children spend the greatest part of their week in school conditions under the stewardship and guidance of teachers who are also trying to contend with deplorable circumstances.  In my constituency and throughout the length and breadth of the State there is so much work that needs to be done.  This all has a bearing on the issue of child poverty.</p><p> The delegates referred to educational, social and economic disadvantage, but there is also locational disadvantage, depending on where one happens to be born, the circumstances of one's community and the supports that the various State agencies have put in place.  These circumstances can impair the prospects of young people into adult life.</p><p> I promise the Chairman that this is my final point.  Today is World Down Syndrome Day.  Yesterday, in the course of addressing the Bill that facilitates a reduction in the threshold for qualification for a medical card for those over 70, I instanced a situation that has presented only in the past couple of weeks - that of a Down's syndrome child who has other serious health issues.  The child holds a long-term illness card due to the Down's syndrome designation and previously held a full medical card on the basis of a discretionary assessment of the child's other medical needs.  However, the full medical card was withdrawn in the past two weeks.  While the Department is signalling the removal of up to 40,000 medical cards, the greater number of them from those over 70 years of age with incomes in excess of &euro;600 per week, are discretionary cards the next line of attack-----</p></speech>

Deputy Conway's initiative is very welcome.</p><p>  I refer to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's final point about the Department of Health.  The delegates are not in a position to answer the question but that Department does have a direct role in dealing with the issue of child poverty.  I support what Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said.  The committee found out - if that is the appropriate term - about who is responsible for child and family services.  The public perception is that Gordon Jeyes is the person responsible, but in fact it is Tony O'Brien who has delegated the responsibility within the HSE to Brian Kirwan.  That is the current position until the new agency is established.  I believe more information about who is responsible should be in the public domain.</p><p>  I welcome the establishment of the new agency and I also welcome the high-level national policy framework, which is long awaited.  I look forward to seeing it.  Ms Moira O'Mara said it would be available at the end of this year.  I ask Ms O'Mara to assure us that the Department of Health is co-operating in the development of that policy along with the other Departments in attendance today.</p><p>  The policy framework will be particularly important in an examination of the issue of child poverty across all age groups.  The early years are very important but, equally, we have seen how the issue of teenage poverty continues into adult life and sets a life path for a young person.  We must remember to include teenagers in our examination of child poverty because a person is a child up to the age of 18 years.</p><p>  I welcome the free universal preschool year, although I acknowledge it is only three hours a day for 38 weeks of the year.  It is a relatively short period of time.  I have been talking to providers dealing with certain categories of children such as special needs children.  Recently I visited the direct provision centre in Athlone where the free preschool year is being provided to children of asylum-seekers.  It is a very small provision for children who need to be integrated and included in society.  I suggest that this category of children be considered in any plans to expand the service.  The universal preschool year is provided as part of the plan for helping working parents and is based on sound educational models.</p><p>  The model for funding of after-school care was referred to by Ms O'Mara.  I ask her to outline whether there will be guidance on what constitutes after-school care.  From my observations around the country, there are different interpretations.  I am afraid that an <i>ad hoc</i> system may develop and in some instances it may be interpreted simply as keeping children occupied, while there may be a planned programme of activities in place in other centres.</p><p>  DEIS is an important initiative.  Will there be a linkage between the experience of DEIS and the policy of an area-based response to child poverty?  Ms O'Brien raised some very important issues about learning from DEIS.  Can the information about DEIS be used in the policy of area-based responses?</p><p>   It is important, when looking at the new areas and the current areas, that whatever policy is funded should be mainstreamed and replicated in other areas.  Is it a case of having to wait for the pot of money to come to an area?  What is needed are clear programmes that can be adapted and are flexible, but that address issues such as rural isolation and care for certain categories of children who are particularly isolated and vulnerable.</p><p>  Access to third level is an issue that hit home to me when I visited the centre in Athlone.  Children in such centres are literally on the edge of a cliff because the supports are not available to them once they finish the leaving certificate.  The programme stops for them at that stage.  I think back to my leaving certificate and the incentives I had to work hard.  I knew that my parents would encourage me to go to third level and that they would provide for that.  However, if one knows there will be no support, that incentive to do well and to go further in education or training or employment is not present.  Those linkages are vital and they should be an important element of the national policy framework for those aged 12 to 25 years.</p><p>  On the issue of child benefit, I will not repeat what I said during a very good debate in the Seanad on the advisory group report.  Mr. Bohan attended in the Visitors' Gallery for that debate.  Part of my frustration with the system is that very often each Department can only look for solutions within itself rather than looking for solutions through connections with other Departments.</p> <p>The Department of Social Protection often can only look at solutions that are linked to other areas and that is the reason we have a decision on the mean testing of child benefit rather than considering a universal payment plus services and developing out those services.  I followed part of the proceedings of a committee yesterday during which this issue was discussed.  If we are serious about tackling child poverty, we should examine measures such as the provision of free health care and school books, which are areas that directly impact on a child's well-being.  We could then ensure that all children have the opportunity for positive outcomes.  How do we empower such co-operation among the Departments who engage in these areas?  That is where  the new agency and the new policy framework will come into play, but are they the answers or do we have to look elsewhere?</p></speech>

The first thing that strikes me in the context of the reading I have done on this area and the evidence we have heard thus far is that everybody is talking about interdepartmental and inter-agency working, but from what I have heard, seen and experienced this is hard to achieve.  What is being done to address that?  People have alluded to the fact that there are no representatives present from Department of Health but I would equally say why are there no representatives present from local government, the Department of Justice and Equality or the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  If the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, is serious about getting people back to work, I point out that women account for 50% of the population and they are often engaged in child minding activities.  They have a vested interest in the provision of child care services and in the provision of and access to funding in order that people and not only the Department of Social Protection can provide that kind of access and support for people.  Local government has a responsibility for the housing provision, the services that are available in communities<i> vis-&agrave;-vis</i>  libraries and the literacy strategies that we want to implement not only in schools but across communities.  What is at issue is that kind of a shake-up.  We can equally talk about justice and juvenile justice and prevention programmes that work very well in many communities throughout the country.  Some of them now fall under the remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs but they, equally, are stakeholders in this approach to tackling and eradicating childhood poverty and providing people with equality of opportunity.</p><p>  The witness from the Department of Children and Youth affairs spoke about the work and the money that has been focused and funnelled on this area.  I would like to know how are the outcomes in this respect being measured.  The witness spoke about the large number of people who are involved in youth work but have we any indication that what they are doing is making any difference?  I am not saying that in a flippant way.  Often people do things with the best will in the world but in this respect I am not sure we are getting the value for money that the children, the families and the State deserve.  People are well-intentioned and do good work but sometimes we have to stop and ask if what we are doing is the right thing for this family and for this community.  Equally, I would say that the hardest thing about reform and change is to ask somebody to stop doing what he or she is already doing and to do it in a different way.  That is what is hard about inter-agency work.  In some ways people are being asked to stop doing something or to hand over control.  Each of the witnesses' Departments has gained huge experience and learning from the types of initiatives they have in place but, unfortunately, they are often pilot projects.  A good quote was made at a hearing of the committee last week, namely, that there have been too many pilots projects and not enough mainstreaming.  All the Departments would be guilty of that.  How will we get that learning from all the Departments to show outcomes?  Will outcomes be measured as opposed to blanket cuts being simply imposed?  We know of some youth services that took a great deal of time and effort to devise a programme that would provide the best outcomes for the children in their community rather than simply doing  what they had been doing, yet they were levied with the same cuts as everybody else, even though they could show that there was a marked improvement.  I would like to know from all the Departments if what they are doing is working, how do we know it is working and if something is not working, how can we change it.  That is what we want to try to find out.</p></speech>

As Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, I agree that the establishment of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is a positive development.  The witnesses spoke about many positive developments.  The high-level policy framework document was mentioned and it is to be welcomed.  The establishment of the child and family support agency must be welcomed also and there are many positive developments in the area of early child care and subsidised after school care.  The main issue is resources.  That is a very important consideration.  Even though a great deal of good work has been done, and I am glad there has been a good deal of joined-up thinking and that Departments are working together, because of budget constraints much of the good work can be undone.</p><p>  The people who come into our constitutency offices talk about the effects of austerity and budget constraints.  It all very well to establish all the Departments and identify what needs to be done, but I would hate because of budget constraints to see them dismantled or chipped away in the long term.</p></speech>

I apologise for missing some of their presentations.  I have problem in terms of bilocation often on a Thursday morning.  We are fortunate in Ireland that a huge number of people give of their time voluntarily in sports organisations and so on and that is to the benefit of children.  We sometimes forget that huge voluntary effort that many people in Ireland make from which we as a society greatly benefit.  It is important to say that from time to time.  I often think some of those people are the real patriots of this country.</p><p>  In Ireland we give a very high level of child benefit and in many ways that is a beneficial payment for families.  As against that, we are not so good at giving other supports such as the provision of free health care for all children.  Do the witnesses consider it would better if some of that money was directed towards the provision of universal free health care for children?  I acknowledge such provision is something to which we are aspiring.  Do the witnesses have any comment on that?  </p><p>  DEIS schools is a subject on which Deputy Conway, myself and various others fought very hard a year ago because we believe they provide a very important service for the children who attend them.  Can the witnesses comment on the measurement of the success of DEIS?  In parts of my constitutency there are homework clubs and so on, which are beneficial for children who come from families where there is not much of a tradition of formal education.  Do the witnesses have a measurement of the success of those?  Can they outline the extent to which such provision is available throughout the country?  </p></speech>

We have moved a good deal in the past five to ten years in terms of working together as Departments.</p> <p>The public sector reform process is supporting us moving further down that road because there is the idea now of cross-Government thinking and reporting.</p><p> In terms of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs linkages with, say, the Department of Education and Skills, the literacy and numeracy strategy was a joint strategy between the Departments.  The preschool year has brought us together in terms of developing the workforce and the requirement for qualifications in the sector.  The area based poverty process is bringing us together also.  Both Departments are on the project team and we need to bring the learning from both the PEIP and the DEIS programmes because they ran in parallel.  We do not want that to happen with the new initiative.  We want them to work together.</p><p> The school completion programme is an example of a programme that moved from the Department of Education and Skills to our Department.  We need to review that in terms of its future position.</p><p> With the Department of Social Protection, the school age child care initiative is an example of some of the savings from the child benefit reduction being transferred into supports for low income parents.  That is a start on the road of a connection between funding and service provision.  It is about the linkages and the balance between them.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in mentioned and Senator van Turnhout focused on the need to use our resources better and to work better together.  We have a very good convergence this year in terms of the policy framework, which I hope will be brought forward towards the end of September.  The cross-departmental policy framework is being developed along with the establishment of the child and family support agency, the consolidation of the children's services committees, the new area-based response to poverty, and a number of reviews of the programmes we are implementing in the Department.  As Deputy Conway said, having flat cuts regardless of the value of the particular project or programme does not make sense and therefore we are carrying out a review of our youth programmes and also a review of the school completion programme.  We have an opportunity to reconfigure them and make them fit with whatever objectives we identify in the policy framework.  That might be a little ambitious but I am hoping that by the end of the year we will have a clear direction as to where we are going in the Department with our resources in terms of reconfiguring them and using them better, and the way we are linking up with other Departments.</p><p> That leads me to the area-based poverty response.  There are a number of elements to that.  On the one hand we know there are areas where poverty is more deeply entrenched than in other areas, and they will always need more significant intervention, particularly for a period of time, be that ten to 20 years because it is a generational issue.  However, we need to mainstream.  The new initiative will build on the learning of the PEIP and of DEIS.  It will move to consolidate and also push towards mainstreaming, but more exploration of the programme will have to be done because we are not quite there yet in terms of developing it fully and knowing exactly where we want to end up.  </p><p> Senator van Turnhout asked if 38 weeks preschool was enough.  It is modelled on the primary school year.  It was designed to be one step down in terms of what children of that age can manage.  Under the PEIP one programme was trialled which involved a longer number of weeks, a longer number of hours, and better ratios of staff to children.  There were some improvements in the outcomes for children, although not as many as members might have imagined.  One idea that we could develop in the new initiative is separate the three strands whereby in one area we might have a 45 week programme and have the lower ratios and so on in the other areas.  That would give us outcomes as to the best way to proceed in two or three years time.</p><p> On the question of inter-agency and interdepartmental work being difficult, we have moved towards that.  We are half way down that road and we will continue to do that.  The review of the programme was to get better use of resources, which are an issue.</p><p> In terms of measuring outcomes, that is very much at the heart of what our Department is doing.  As members are aware, we have a dedicated research unit.  In youth programmes, for instance, national quality standards are now in place.  That is measuring outcomes from all the services.  We are in most cases moving to a situation where we want to see what is being delivered by a project.  We are taking a balance between policy evaluation and value for money because one project might be achieving the same outcomes as another project but with fewer resources going into it.  I hope I have addressed some of the issues raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-21a.741" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Bohan" time="10:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013032100009#H00200"><p>I will deal with the various comments made, starting with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's point.  As he said, I cannot comment on Government policy regarding the budget and budget measures but I can provide a number of facts which might put the issue into some context.  As Deputy Dowds mentioned, we still have one of the highest rates of income support.  I know there are issues about income support versus services which were mentioned by other members but child benefit remains one of the highest universal payments in Europe, and we can provide statistics on that.  That means when that is combined with selective instruments such as the QCIs, we are still meeting the national anti-poverty strategy target, which is that child income support is to meet 33% of the adult rate.  Under those measures the Government is still meeting the target of approximately &euro;62 per child in disadvantaged households, and that is the amount of resources available.</p><p>  There is a major issue regarding the income transfers versus the available supports, but in looking beyond the effects of the immediate measures one should probably examine the existing structural issues.  Evidence produced by our research programme showed that approximately one-quarter of children lived in jobless households, therefore, 50% of children in consistent poverty were in jobless households.  The fact that we had a very high rate of jobless households pre-existed both the boom and the bust in the economy.  That suggests that what needs to be done about child poverty is in the structural area of getting parents back to work, improving supports, and improving levels of activation.  That sets the tone for some of the changes being made in the Department.</p><p>  On the system of income support, the advisory group has identified a clear need to examine the area of reform and has put forward its report for consideration, including by this committee's sister committee, the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, and looks forward to hearing the views of that committee.</p><p>  Senator van Turnhout and Deputy Dowds made a point about moving beyond the terms of reference of the advisory group.  Yesterday, our chair said that the terms of reference did not allow the group to move beyond income support to the question of whether better value for money would be achieved by moving into child related services.  There is evidence that those countries which put more effort into services get better results in terms of child poverty.  The reason for that is that it addresses the structural factors I just mentioned.</p><p>  Deputy Dowds asked if there was any evidence for that.  The Department undertook a value for money review of the child support system published in 2010 in which we produced evidence from different countries which showed where the better results were being obtained, and it correlated with higher levels of spending on services.  There were better outcomes in many other countries but one would have to take that on a case by case basis.</p> <p> Clearly, the income support system and child benefit are extremely important to people with regard to how they plan their own expenditure and so on.  However, were one to put it into some other service, one almost would be obliged to evaluate that specific service itself.  A very good example is the one mentioned by my colleague, Ms Moira O'Mara, about the abolition of the early child care supplement payment and its replacement by the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme.  While that was universally acknowledged as a very good example of how one would do this in practice, one almost would be obliged to make that analysis on a case-by-case basis.</p><p> If I may turn to the points made by Deputy Conway, she mentioned the difficulty of joined-up government and she is not in the first person to make such an observation because I recently re-read something from 2002, namely, the strategic management initiative's <i>Delivering Better Government</i>, which identified this to be one of the more difficult areas of public sector reform.  While it acknowledged many changes within Departments, it observed this was one of the most difficult areas.  I believe the Office of the Minister for Children was established around that time and as my Department actually set up and assigned staff to that office, we participated wholeheartedly in that initiative.  The Department of Social Protection also has had fruitful collaborations with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I mentioned the national children's strategy implementation group earlier and we also are working on the children's longitudinal study and the area-based poverty initiative, into which we obviously are trying to put our input.  The decision regarding the budgetary measures was announced with a transfer of funding arising from some of those savings from the social welfare Vote into a child care initiative, as well as the area-based initiative.  In that context, we are engaging on a number of fronts with our colleagues in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on how best to implement that.  In addition, in an example that demonstrates how the children's framework is important for my Department, when the Government accepted our Minister's recommendation to reset the new national poverty target, we also recommended setting a child poverty subtarget.  However, rather than selecting a target at that time, we thought it best to go through the process of interdepartmental and stakeholder consultation to set the subtarget in a more robust framework.  In a way, this comprises a concrete part of my Department's plan to have better joined-up government.  Finally, the Department of Social Protection organises an annual social inclusion forum, which will take place next week, to cover many areas that emerge from the national action plan for social inclusion.  It will include a workshop on child poverty and hopefully, some of the issues will emerge from that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-21a.743" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caitriona O'Brien" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013032100010#J00200"><p>I also will go through the points as raised, some of which already have been covered by Ms Moira O'Mara.  I will start with the point raised by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and others regarding joined-up working and it is absolutely true.  In a way, at a time when we have less money and fewer staff resources across Departments, we must consider ways of working smarter and doing things better.  One obvious thing to do is to link with other Departments and try to share some of the workload.  Literally, this has happened in respect of the early childhood education space because even before the Department of Children and Youth Affairs was established and ever since the days of the Office of the Minister for Children, the early childhood education section of the Department of Education and Skills has been physically located with the Office of the Minister for Children.  That has put them in that kind of different thinking space as well, which is very useful.  Another example is research capacity, because that is where we get the information.  We get the data that give one the evidence on which to base whatever policy decisions one makes.  The Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal study is a huge, highly valuable study.  The Department of Education and Skills is participating in that and for a number of years we have taken the view that if researchers are going into homes and schools to ask questions, one should make sure they are asking all the questions they possibly could.  Consequently, we have fed questions into that study which would be of particular value to our Department, even though the research project is located in the office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  Although the ESRI is heading up that research project with Trinity College, in addition to the overall data bank they publish individual reports all the time, one of which is about to be published on attendance levels in schools.  This actually comes from the Growing Up in Ireland data on foot of the kind of questions we were seeking to have included in it.  This is just an example of Departments thinking together and working just a little bit more smartly to get better outcomes.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in also referred to conditions in schools and really it is the idea of rural isolation and the overall position with regard to small schools and so on.  Members probably are aware of the programme of the planning and building unit, that is, the Department's forward planning section.  A couple of things are going on including the amalgamation project or process if one wishes to call it that, the divesting programme and the outcome of the recent value for money review of small schools.  While stuff is going on regarding the schools' physical story, the bigger question concerns equipping the teachers to teach the children in such schools and to deal with the kinds of issues that come up.  In this regard, the focus is on both building up initial teacher training capacity and in the kinds of continuous professional development, CPD, teachers get.  This is because, in common with the rest of the public service, there are fewer teachers and they need to have better capacity to deal, within the school day and in the school building, with the variety of things against which they will come up.</p><p>  Another key area that keeps coming up in all of the research we look at concerns parents and parental involvement in schools.  This probably is true most of all in rural communities, where the school is one of the key parts of the local community.  Parental involvement is key and it particularly is the case for certain minority groups, like the Traveler community, ethnic minorities and immigrant communities, that the involvement of parents from those communities is key.  While those issues often are perceived as a problem, in many cases they make school and community life all the richer for their participation.</p><p>  On the issue of access to third level, the point to make is that pre-DEIS or in its very early stages, the focus was on progression from primary to post-primary school.  Happily, the focus has shifted from making sure that children progress from primary to post-primary school to giving consideration to ensure they completed the junior cycle.  While that was the focus, happily we now are in the space that the worry, if one likes, concerns our wish to ensure they go to third level.  There is much going on in this regard such as transition year initiatives and the involvement in schools of business and the private sector.  Such entities enter schools or take children into their companies and businesses to show them what working life would be like.  This is an impetus in its own right.</p><p>  To mention the G word, that is, the guidance story in schools, although there has been a reduction in this regard, the emphasis, like in everything else, is turning to building up capacity among the overall school team.  In other words, just because one is a geography teacher or a history teacher does not mean one does not have a role in guidance or in the pastoral story in the school.  It really is about teachers encouraging the children in their classes and placing the kind of value they should have on education and on getting further education.  This is difficult and it is difficult for many families who are struggling themselves.  In particular, much of the research shows that in the case of parents who themselves have not progressed past primary level or who do not have second or certainly not third level education, it is difficult for them to put themselves into that space.  However, the emphasis really is on the teaching community and the capacity in schools to put value on progressing.  Moreover, to be fair to the third level colleges, they also do a fair amount of work in this area, as do the student organisations in third level.</p><p>  I will talk a little about the learning from DEIS and the prevention and early intervention programme, PEIP.  Deputy Conway asked about the link between them and the difficulty in a number of the projects that have been implemented to date has been that they did operate in parallel.</p> <p>The Department of Education and Skills is keen that would change in the next phase and that we would start to get some of the learning out of it.  Apart from anything else, there are good lessons to be obtained from it.  There is valuable information and learning which we would like to see being brought into the mainstream system.</p><p> I will cite a couple of examples of what we have learned.  One of the very important parts of DEIS is to encourage leadership, schools linking together and principals building up networks.  For instance, in Limerick there is a network called Oscailt which works in the system with Mary Immaculate College and the University of Limerick, with funding from Atlantic Philanthropies.  The result of that is a strong team of DEIS principals who have done a lot of things together and have shared valuable learning.  From that has come a change to the kind of things one would ordinarily expect to be happening in the DEIS programme.  When it came to doing the next project with more funding, rather than taking on board yet another literacy project to be delivered after the school completion programme, their literacy programme is now concentrating on continuing professional development, CPD, and training for teachers.  In that way, teachers are better equipped to deal with the kind of issues that arise in their schools as well as being better able to deliver literacy and numeracy.  Therefore, instead of delivering yet another programme for children, they are concentrating on the teachers.</p><p> One of the important messages to come out of the DEIS experience in Limerick - but also in other parts of the country - is the value of interventions relating to behaviour.  Programmes, such as "Incredible Years", are valuable because the earlier the intervention takes place the better it is.  That programme has been operated in a number of locations around the country with philanthropic funding and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, which is involved and working with the private sector.</p><p> Ms O'Mara mentioned homework clubs and the school completion programme, SCP, which is now with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  There is a planned review of SCP and the Department of Education and Skills will be looking forward to assisting with that because of its integral link to the DEIS programme.  </p></speech>

Every time one does any research into literacy, parental involvement is mentioned.  All too often, however, I hear from parents' groups that when they bring their child to school they are told by the teacher not to teach children reading because the school has methods for doing that.  Parents may be told to ensure that their children can tie their laces and eat lunch in the allotted time, but we need to embed a culture of bringing parents into the classroom as well.  In that way, parents will not be seen as doing the extras while teachers educate, because education is in all aspects of a child's life.</p><p>  Regarding the success of the universal pre-school year, I am delighted that Ms O'Mara is here because she was the architect of that success.  She ensured that it was done in an appropriate way.  We have a high take-up rate and have the names of children in the free pre-school year.  I do not understand why the National Educational Welfare Board, schools or the Department of Education and Skills are not empowered to track those children through primary and secondary school.  The difficulty is that when we examine drop-out rates between primary and secondary school we are looking at numbers.  We are not actually looking at whether the drop-out rate could be attributed to emigration, moving elsewhere within the country or registering in their name as Gaeilge.  The situation is not always clear.  Perhaps some of that data could be used positively to get the evidence - as with the longitudinal study - and thus understand what is happening.  </p><p>  I also wish to comment on special needs with regard to the universal pre-school year.  I welcome the earlier comments on seeing how different things work.  To add to the mix, I have heard from early child care providers that the difficulty with some special needs children is that five days a week is too much for them.  Inspectors are saying, however, that if the child does not attend five days per week he or she cannot avail of the scheme.  I can provide evidence of this from different parts of the country.  The early child care providers have said they will spread the attendance over the year for a child in order to ensure they get the scheme, even though five days a week may be too much.  They may need to be eased in gently.  Perhaps we could have some flexibility to ensure that the Department that is funding the scheme gets value, while also ensuring the desired outcomes for children, even if they are not on the roll on a given day.  That issue has arisen.</p></speech>

I would like to go back over some of the answers we got, particularly what Mr. Bohan said about 50% of children living in jobless households and the structural issues involved.  What involvement, if any, does the Department for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation have concerning child poverty?  What involvement has the Department of Justice and Equality had, given that we know the importance of investing in children?  Although we have not had such a study here yet, all the longitudinal studies in America and the United Kingdom show the benefits involved.</p><p>  This is particularly the case with the HighScope pre-school programme where an intervention is given to children aged three to five.  The study followed those children into their 40s and 50s, and showed that their peers - particularly those from disadvantaged communities - who did not get the intervention, often ended up incarcerated.  This is a preventative measure, so the Department of Justice and Equality should have an interest in this area, particularly if we can invest in children from disadvantaged communities.</p><p>  Some years ago, I had an opportunity to visit Penn State University to work on a project.  This involved working with children who were living in chronic disadvantage.  That kind of early intervention programme was being delivered by teachers in the local community, in partnership with parents who were being encouraged to become involved in literacy programmes and improve their own literacy.  It had a two-fold effect.  It showed that the children who did not attend were 50% more likely to end up in trouble with the law.  It is a very real point. </p><p>  In fairness to the witnesses, they are probably like the usual suspects when it comes to discussing child poverty.  We invite in representatives of the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, but what are other Departments doing in this regard?  If they are not doing anything, what can we do to get them involved?  This issue needs to be dealt with in a cross-departmental manner, rather than just involving the usual suspects.</p><p>  I know that the sex education programme is still being designed.  Perhaps the witnesses can comment on the rural issue when it comes to registered child-minders.  They should be considered for providing an after-school service in rural areas.  Large areas of the country have no child care facilities, so a parent may have to drive 20 miles to drop their child to a centre so they can attend work or retraining.  City and county child care committees all over the country have invested huge resources to upskill child-minders who are in a position to mind sibling groups, or drop and collect children from school and elsewhere.  They constitute a major resource so we should examine the provision of child care by such people, rather than focusing only on the provision of child care at designated centres.  </p><p>  In Australia and elsewhere abroad, they call it home-based child care or day care.  We should examine that because this group of people wants to provide such a service and wants to be regulated.  I have had major interactions with them in recent months on this issue, which would be a cost-effective way of providing after-school child care all over the country and not just in urban centres.</p></speech>

One of the questions we ask parents - clearly the answers do not ultimately turn out to be 100% correct - is the primary school they intend to send their child.  It is useful information we transfer to the Department of Education and Skills and helps its planning.  We also have a national data strategy.  We have just got a new head of research and I am hoping we can develop and push this out, and that would be an issue there.  Since the start, the parent of a child with special needs can opt to have two days a week in the first year and three days a week in the second year.</p><p>  The only inspection we have for the pre-school year is that Pobal makes compliance visits on our behalf.

I believe I missed something the Senator said the first time around.</p><p>  Deputy Conway asked about the role of the Department of Justice and Equality.  It is involved on our children services committees in the 16 counties where we have them.  It works with local players there in terms of youth diversion.  At the moment it focuses down as far as youth and they try to divert children from 12 or 13 years of age.  I agree on the need for early interventions which is where our Department's perspective arises in terms of working with parents.  We actually work with parents of prenatal children as well as young children.  As well as working with early years, the new initiative will work up to 18 years, so we do not want to cut off at that point.</p><p>  We do not have a regulatory system that is appropriate for child minders - only 600 people have notified the HSE.  I know there have been some voluntary notifications but there is no legal protection there.  I know the Minister is very concerned about getting child minders more into the system.  We need to regulate the child care sector better.  I understand the HSE is moving to a registration system which should be operational by the end of this year.  That will be a first step in moving from notification to registration.  Then we hope to bring in regulations and move to the next step.</p><p>  The Senator asked about having a proper programme of activities for the new school age sector, which is also unregulated.  As with the ECCE programme, there is no legal requirement for a qualification.  However, any service that is in contract with us will need to deliver a programme that we will require.  We are working on developing that at the moment.  We will probably not have it for the pilot, but we will have it from September.</p></speech>

I wish to make a correction to the statistic she quoted.  I realise it is very difficult to discuss statistics on this area.  I said that a quarter of children were in jobless households.  That has meant that 50% of children in poverty are in jobless households.  It is just a different way of presenting the same statistics.  I offer to send the committee our jobless household studies so members can see some of the basic statistics there.</p><p>  I am loth to comment on the roles of other Departments, so I will say something general and something specific.  Generally the Government's strategy on poverty is based on the premise that all aspects of Government policy have an impact on poverty because poverty is multidimensional.  Given that it is so multidimensional it is incumbent on every Department to examine its proposals and schemes to ensure it is having a positive impact on poverty.  We remind them whenever a social-impact assessment or poverty-impact assessment is to be undertaken.  As part of the implementation of the review of the national poverty target, we are hoping to strengthen that role in the whole process.  That is the general point.</p><p>  Specifically, the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 attributes a number of actions to individual Departments.  There are certainly some actions attributed to the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which used to be the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Some of those have migrated with the F&Aacute;S services to our Department, so my answer is somewhat complex.  I can send the committee the list of actions from the national action plan, which will give members an idea of the specific actions the Government has asked those Departments to take on poverty.  We update those actions regularly and we tend to complete it in time for the social inclusion forum.  After that we might send the committee that list and members can get an idea. </p></speech>

It is very easy for us to talk because we are not busy and frazzled teachers in classrooms.  However, the Constitution provides that parents are the primary educators of children.  What the Senator was discussing is the kind of thing that has come up in some of the DEIS-related PEIP programmes.  Of course maths is now taught completely differently from how it was when I was at school.  Parents are a resource.  In particular, parents of children in DEIS schools want to be a resource but often do not have the capacity and are nervous about making the approach in the first place.  In a number of cases there is an after-school programme - a school-completion programme - where there is either a numeracy or a literacy initiative or both.  The parents are involved in that and the programme is explained to them.  There is almost a parents' pack so they fully understand what is being taught and how.  They can then do their bit at home.</p><p>  There is a good outcome for children but the spin-off effect has been that parents have found a renewed interest in education for themselves, as they want to be able to follow their children up through the school system.  In some cases parents have physically come back into the school building, which is a major achievement for parents who might have had bad experiences in school themselves.  They find themselves back in the school atmosphere and have gone back to education themselves.  Parents, some of whom barely completed primary school, are now back doing their junior certificate examinations at the same time as their children, which is very encouraging, although not enough of it is happening.  One would expect that schools and teachers should see parents as a resource but often a certain amount of work needs to be done to equip them to become that resource.  It is a challenge for teachers who have fewer resources and so on.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-21a.768" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Behan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013032100002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman.  Together with my colleague from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, we hope to be able to address for the committee the issues and concerns that arise for Ireland in considering this legislative proposal.</p><p>  This proposed directive on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure was published at the end of January.  To provide some background to the development of this proposal, the European Commission's March 2011 White Paper, the Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area, called for a reduction in the dependence that transport places on oil supply and set targets for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions of 60% by 2050.  In the White Paper, the Commission announced it would develop "a sustainable alternative fuels strategy, including the appropriate infrastructure" and provide "guidelines and standards for refuelling infrastructures".</p><p>  Concerned by the slow attainment of alternative fuels infrastructure across the EU, the Commission considers that, along with the lack of common technical standards, this represents a major obstacle to the market introduction of alternative fuels.  It has, therefore, developed a proposal for a directive which aims to deliver a build-up of alternative fuels infrastructure conforming to common technical standards so as to facilitate a quicker transition to cleaner transport.</p><p>  The proposal contains mandatory requirements for the extent and coverage of alternative fuels infrastructure for transport and also common technical standards for their construction and interoperability.  The main alternative fuel options that could replace oil as the primary fuel source for both road and maritime transport are identified as electricity, hydrogen, bio-fuels and natural gas in the forms of compressed natural gas, CNG, liquefied natural gas, LNG, or gas-to-liquid, GTL, and liquefied petroleum gas, LPG.</p><p>  The draft directive would require member states to adopt and publish national policy frameworks for the market development of electric, hydrogen, bio-fuels and natural gas refuelling infrastructure.  Member states would be required to co-operate with one another, either through consultations or joint policy frameworks, to ensure measures would be coherent and co-ordinated.</p><p>  To assess fully the implications of these proposals for both transport and energy infrastructure investment, consultations within our two Departments and with key stakeholders have commenced or more will be undertaken shortly.  However, based on our initial assessment of the proposals, the Irish Government position could be summarised as follows.  In matters such as common standards, action at an EU level will be required to ensure market harmonisation and acceptance of refuelling equipment by users across the EU and, therefore, the technical common standards should be supported.  It is also the case that strong action will be necessary if Ireland and the EU are to achieve overall greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets.  This proposal will set minimum requirements for alternative fuels infrastructure across the EU and it is likely that EU-wide targets such as this would give increased reassurance to car manufacturers and investors in making the long-term investment required to speed up the shift to lower emission vehicles.</p><p>  Mindful of the need to ensure measures are proportionate and cost-effective, however, the role of national policymakers in setting targets within individual member states needs to be considered further.</p> <p>While the targets for CNG refuelling points and electric vehicle charge points do not appear at this stage to be overly onerous, careful consideration is required as to how these targets could be met and how and by whom they would be financed.  Additionally, there are no LNG facilities in Ireland and practical implications, including the associated high costs of the proposed obligation, require further analysis.  Consideration will also be required as to whether there should be flexibility in the directive for member states to amend targets to reflect technological and market developments that may take place over the period concerned.</p><p> Discussions on this file have commenced under strong Commission impetus, although they remain at a very early stage.  Only one meeting of the working party on intermodal questions and networks was devoted to it prior to the transport Ministers exchange of initial views on the proposal last week at Council.  Although very preliminary and caveated by transport Ministers, given the very recent publication of the proposals and the essential consultations between transport and energy Ministries on national implications, the tone of contributions was generally very supportive of developing the market for alternative fuels in the EU with a great deal of caution expressed, however, regarding the imposition of binding national targets for refuelling infrastructure networks.</p></speech>

In terms of promotion of it as a policy in Ireland, we are trying to encourage fleets that might be able to be able to invest in a refuelling infrastructure.  At the moment it would be a cheaper fuel so there would be benefits to fleets in taking it up, but the initial investment costs are quite high.</p></speech>

When considering alternative fuel options - I note natural gas was mentioned - there is growing evidence that the emission rates from fracking for gas is much more severe than the emission rates for securing any other form of fuel.  If this is part of a clean air policy, it should specifically exclude fracking for gas.  It is like taking out a bad appendix and putting a worse one into the patient.  I doubt if that would work.</p></speech>

ESB Networks is working very closely with its Northern Ireland counterpart on the electric vehicle-refuelling infrastructure.  They have jointly applied to the EU for TEN-T funding for the fast-charging infrastructure.  Standards and absolute interoperability apply across borders on electric-vehicle recharging.  We are already in discussions with our counterparts in the UK on this directive and the application of the additional infrastructure network that will be required.  For example, if the directive were to require a compressed-natural-gas refuelling point every 150 km, we would obviously co-ordinate with our Northern Ireland colleagues so that would also apply on a cross-Border basis to ensure that roads across the order would be encompassed in the same network.</p><p>  I believe that fracking is beyond the scope of this directive.  In terms of the use of gas in Ireland, I imagine that the gas that would be used would be gas that is fed into the natural grid, which currently is not in any way derived from fracking.</p></speech>

How realistic are the targets that have been set?  We have experience of unrealistic targets where semi-State companies, primarily, represent a huge obstacle to change.  In particular, I cite Bord na M&oacute;na in the use of renewables.  It is not in its commercial interest to change or adapt in any way to use alternative sources of biomass, for instance, as a derivative for energy.  Realistically unless somebody can sweep our semi-State companies objections and lack of co-operation out of the way, I cannot see these targets being met.  My experience is - the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources would back this up - while the Department will outline policies and put schemes in place, the semi-State companies will just not play ball.  How will that mindset and culture in our semi-State companies, particularly Bord na M&oacute;na, change?</p></speech>

She stated that all proposals for alternative energy would involve high costs.  That seems to be a common theme regardless of what we are considering - wind, wave, ocean bed currents etc.  As an island nation we have plenty of these resources, which will not increase in price like oil.</p> <p>The ocean and the wind will always be there.  Some parts of our country are more subject to wind than others.</p><p> Asking my next question might not be fair, but I will ask it anyway.  I acknowledge the co-operation between Northern Ireland Electricity and the southern interconnectors and the benefit this brings to both sides of the political divide.  On what alternative energies should our Government focus all of our resources?  The year 2020 will come and go without us having reached our targets.  How is that work going?</p></speech>

It is true.  The Commission has set out targets in a directive on the basis of its impact assessment.  It conducted an analysis of our plans for electric vehicles, EVs, and examined the levels of urbanisation and vehicle ownership.  Some people consider the targets to be fairly steep, particularly in terms of the EV refuelling infrastructure.  The target for compressed natural gas is less onerous at one per 150 km.  Only time will tell whether the targets are overly optimistic in terms of take-up.  There are seven years between now and 2020 and there may be a high take-up of electric vehicles in the intervening seven years.</p><p>  Most member states have identified that setting targets now for unknown fleet numbers in 2020 is something that we may need to bear in mind when negotiating the directive.  For example, a review clause may need to be inserted for three years down the line to determine whether the targets are feasible in light of developments in the intervening period.  The nature of the targets will be a matter for negotiation.  Listening to the transport Ministers around the table, we are not alone in believing that we may need to reconsider the targets to make them non-binding if infrastructure is not being developed quickly enough to meet the level of vehicles in the market or to insert a review mechanism to determine whether the targets are still appropriate a few years down the line.</p></speech>

It will devise an agreed target with the European Commission and put an incentive scheme in place.  We are dependent on commercial semi-State companies to buy into the scheme.  Recently, the Government put in place a refit scheme for biomass, but Bord na M&oacute;na did not want to opt into it because there was a more lucrative scheme, the public service obligation, PSO.  This at a time when the Government is trying to achieve renewable energy targets.  The intransigent block in the middle of the road was not involved in the negotiations between the State and the Commission.  Unless commercial semi-State companies are involved at an earlier stage and made to pony up to their obligation to deliver on behalf of the shareholder, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and follow the Government's policy statements, we will not be able to achieve anything.</p></speech>

From our initial consultations with ESB Networks and Bord G&aacute;is Networks, they have been enthusiastically pursuing the rolling out of this infrastructure.  I am not sure whether the roadblocks to which the Deputy referred will apply in this instance.  The Commission has not stipulated how the targets should be achieved.  It also sees a role for the private sector.  The semi-State companies will not necessarily deliver on the infrastructure networks.  We must work out how the Government will deliver on the targets and whether the semi-State companies will be the mechanism through which that will be done.  We must bear in mind that the cost would be passed on to the consumers of gas and electricity.  So far, I have not got the sense that the semi-State companies will pose an obstacle.</p></speech>

I do not anticipate a problem.  In fact, ESB is in the vanguard of EV infrastructure and the relevant smart technology, even in a European context.  Recently, it was successful in a European competition to secure funding.</p><p>  The directive is agnostic in terms of how member states should engage with the market to achieve targets.  In an Irish context, careful consideration must be given to determining how to implement and fund these measures and who will be responsible for both aspects.</p></speech>

If one works on the basis that the Government and society should make it easier for people to do the right thing, then people should be able to travel more cheaply by using alternative fuels than they can by using oil.  We are discussing putting in place infrastructure that makes it easy for people, companies and organisations to do the right thing.</p><p>  If someone seeks planning permission for a filling station, do our planning regulations require an alternative fuel point?  If not, why?  This is a simple matter.  If I seek planning permission for a house, the size of my door and the house's distance from the road will be specified, yet our planning permission for filling stations does not require them to be ready for the next decade of travel, never mind the next century.  We need to get on top of these simple matters.</p><p>  Although the next issue I wish to raise is not within the Department's brief, it must be handled by someone.  I spoke with a number of people who have alternative energy sources.  One had an anaerobic digestion system.  When seeking a connection to the nation grid, the quote received effectively made the project unsustainable.  It was &euro;250,000, &euro;500,000 or something like that.  That is outrageous.</p> <p>As we are considering high-profile interconnectors and major infrastructural products, we have taken our eyes from small projects that can be done.  We must make it easier for people to do the right thing.  The people coming up with realistic alternative energy sources should find it easier to get on the national grid.  Is that within the brief of the witness?</p></speech>

We must be careful because gas and electricity are regulated sectors, and the cost of such products must ultimately be borne in the pricing to someone.  It would be very difficult for us to comment on pricing, which is ultimately a matter for the regulator.</p></speech>

It is also the case that they tend to be cheaper to operate in the longer term.  It is a case of managing the issue of getting over the initial high investment costs to allow the likes of wind energy to be used through electric vehicles, which could recharge using wind energy at night.  It is a good fit and that would be a cheap source of fuel for vehicles.  Initial investment costs would need to be overcome and how those costs would be borne by the Irish taxpayer or consumer of energy must be worked out in the development of this directive.</p></speech>

As far as I am concerned, wind is free, along with waves and ocean bed currents.  We do not have to worry about a calm day, for example.  The expense must come down if we are to speak about alternative energy from wave, wind and ocean bed currents.  Perhaps the infrastructure is expensive but I am sure there is payback in that we would not have to import more fossil fuel, for example, and costs would be minimised.</p></speech>

The current schemes which support renewable electricity, for example, are designed to encourage the development of wind bioenergy in the most cost-effective way.  Fuel costs are low for wind or ocean technologies but significant capital investments are required and even connections to the grid must be paid for.  The prices in the tariff supported under the refit schemes are designed not to overcompensate developers but rather give them a fair return, ensuring the price of electricity is not prohibitive to the consumer.</p></speech>

The Chairman has already introduced my colleagues.  To assist the committee, the Department has prepared a briefing note on the proposals and I understand this has been circulated to members.</p><p>  The objective of EU railway policy over the last two decades has been to reverse the Europe-wide trend of rail passengers and rail freight traffic shifting from the railway to other transport modes.  In particular, rail transport in Ireland faces major competition from the road-based transport modes, especially since the completion of the major inter-urban motorway network.  For Europe's railways to gain, or even to retain, their share of the market, it must be ensured that railways can deliver a high quality, reliable and efficient service that is also environmentally friendly.</p> <p>The European Commission 2011 White Paper sets out the objective for a single European railway area whereby administrative and technical barriers are removed allowing ease of access to railway markets.  The proposals under the fourth railway package deal with greater market access, in particular, the amendment to EC Regulation 1370/2007 dealing with opening of domestic rail passenger markets and the competitive tendering of contracts for public service obligations, PSO.  In principle, there is broad support from the European railway industry for further opening of domestic railway markets, with an understanding that there should be protections for existing PSO routes.  However, these are politically sensitive issues for many member states.</p><p> The recast first railway package, which was adopted late last year, was an important step to reaffirming the structural foundations required for further railway market liberalisation.  The Commission ambition is for complete unbundling of the railway infrastructure manager from any railway undertaking.  Some of the larger member states view this as a step too far.  This view was bolstered by a recent decision of the Advocate General to the European Court of Justice which found in favour of the holding structure model in Germany.  The final decision of the court is awaited.</p><p> The Commission proposal under the fourth railway package, to amend Directive 2012/34/EU establishing the single European railway market, reflects recent events and allows for an alternative to complete institutional separation of the railway infrastructure manager and railway operator.  However, the proposal also puts forward other new requirements for discussion concerning necessary safeguards under any alterative structure, which would ensure non-discrimination of access to the railway market.  In Ireland, we are currently in the process of introducing reforms to ensure EU regulatory compliance in the context of the ending of our long-held derogation from certain aspects of the first railway package.  This will see a reorganisation of our national rail company, an independent rail regulator and safeguards to ensure non-discriminatory access to the market.  In Ireland's case, there is a fine balance to be maintained between ensuring that our railway is organised and positioned in such a way as to be open to the benefits that are envisaged under the single European railway area while, at the same time, to ensure changes reflect the small size and capability of the rail network in Ireland and do not create any undue burdens.</p><p> The previous EU railway packages have underpinned the improvement made over the past two decades across Europe in terms of railway safety and technical interoperability of railway systems.  In particular, the use of common safety indicators allows us to better measure our safety performance against our European peers.  In the areas of technical interoperability of railway subsystems, harmonisation of technical rules can lead to more cost effective and interchangeable components on the market, which can give rise to economic benefit, even for Ireland, despite the unique features of our infrastructure such as rail gauge.</p><p> The fourth railway package recognises that safety and interoperability form the cornerstone of an effective and reliable railway system.  Proposals for amendments to the safety and interoperability directives under the fourth railway package seek to refine and build upon the regulatory framework established under the previous packages.  During the Irish Presidency, progress will be made on these technical aspects of the European Commission's proposal.  Further improvements in these areas will form the basis for overcoming other obstacles to achieving a fully integrated rail system in Europe.  Towards this objective, the fourth railway package proposes a central role for the European Railway Agency in the areas of common safety certification and systems for the placing into service of vehicles and command and control systems.  The future relationships and optimal distribution of responsibilities between ERA and the national safety authorities in member states is a matter for further discussion under this proposal.</p><p> Under previous European railway packages the introduction of standard training requirements across Europe has been of benefit to the railway workforce in terms of greater opportunity for employment mobility within Europe.  While there are no specific proposals in the fourth railway package addressing workforce issues, in its official communiqu&eacute;, the European Commission acknowledges the need for protections for workers in the context of further railway market reform under the proposals for market opening and the competitive tendering of PSO contracts.</p><p> Ireland has in the past argued that physical and geographic limitations prevent compliance with the EU railway model.  Ireland does not have a rail connection with the mainland rail network of Europe.  However, we share a rail network and our 1,600 mm. rail gauge with Northern Ireland, which differs from the standard rail gauge in Europe.  Furthermore, the Irish rail network is small by comparative standards with a total length of 2,400 km. covering inter-urban and suburban commuter service.  However, there are potential benefits to be gained through the regulation of common European standards, in particular with regard to railway safety, but also in the area of technical interoperability of railway systems across Europe.  The proposals under the fourth railway package will build on the regulation of such standards.  Furthermore, the ongoing development of transparent and non-discriminatory systems for access to the rail market envisaged under the fourth railway package is necessary to support future opening or access to the railway market, even in Ireland and potential benefits that this might bring.  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee.  My colleagues and I will be glad to deal with any questions.</p></speech>

The freight market was liberalised in Europe from 1 January 2007 and the international passenger market was liberalised with effect from 1 January 2010.  Ireland had a derogation from the implementation of those requirements until now and, therefore, there are two separate things happening.  On the one hand, the derogation Ireland has availed of has been brought to an end-----</p></speech>

Second, a new package of measures is on the table which will extend liberalisation across Europe.  The immediate implications that arise from the ending of the derogation are that we have to apply the regulatory model for a competitive framework.  The major element of that is we have to ensure we have full accounting separation of the functions within Irish Rail that are related, on the one hand, to the network and its maintenance and, on the other, to the provision of train services.  That has been implemented by the railway company.  There is a range of further measures but two are of particular significance.  One is that we need to establish an independent regulatory body responsible for economic regulation of the railway market and the second is we also have to establish an independent function to ensure the charges for access to railway tracks and the procedures for allocation of capacity of the rail network are carried out on a basis that is fully independent and does not confer advantage on the incumbent operator.  Those are the measures we are working on implementing-----</p></speech>

It will have a function independent of Irish Rail and the objective is to ensure there are fair conditions of competition.</p><p>  The new proposals on the table are from the Commission.  They have to go through the European legislative process before they ultimately become law and, obviously, they are subject to amendment during that process.  The major elements of the proposals relating to Irish Rail are the prospect that the passenger market will be open to competition with effect from 1 January 2019 and public service contracts will have to be opened up to tender with effect from 1 January 2019.</p> <p>This is not a case of these contracts being automatically taken away from the railway company.  Rather, the existing railway company is entitled to participate in a competitive process.  There are protections built in with regard to employees.  These arise under the existing directive relating to the transfer of undertakings which provides that the rights of employees cannot be affected in the context of a merger or takeover.  This existing provision applies in full.</p><p> The new regulatory framework does not impact on the capability of a member state to determine what services can be provided through the allocation of a subsidy in the general economic interest.  It is not the case that this package would require that a subsidy be removed with regard to particular services or lines.  It requires that where a subsidy is provided it must be provided through a competitive process rather than through the direct award process which obtains at present.  I am not sure whether I have dealt with all of the questions.</p></speech>

The documentation we received before the meeting states with a view to achieving a modal shift of passengers to rail and better value for public money, the opening of the domestic market through the introduction of mandatory tendering of PSO contracts is sought.  It is almost as if there is an unstated assumption that mandatory tendering will lead to a modal shift of passengers to rail.  Has this been independently verified, validated or demonstrated anywhere?</p><p>  If we had a submersible rail link between this Ireland and Britain and on to Europe the proposal would make much more sense.  I can see how the proposal makes sense on the Continent, but I find it much more difficult to see how it makes equal sense for an island such as Ireland which does not have a submersible link to Britain.</p><p>  There is to be non-discriminatory access to rolling stock, particularly where there is no well-functioning rolling stock leasing market.  I assume the rolling stock here is owned by taxpayers.  How will we ensure the taxpayer gets a return on this ownership?</p><p>  Perhaps my next question has little or nothing to do with the discussion we are having, but it is interesting.  Section 1.4 discusses a social dimension in terms of job quality and safeguards.  We should probably examine this with regard to tendering for public service contracts in the wider arena.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-21a.844" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fintan Towey" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013032100007#F00900"><p>I will deal with the first issue raised, which is modal shift.  The thrust of the Commission's approach in proposing these reforms is that there is enormous scope to drive greater efficiency in the provision of rail services and this is the basis on which rail can regain market share and stem the decline to which it has been subject for quite a long period.  With regard to tendering specifically, in the material the Commission states significant efficiencies are to be gained through mandatory tendering and gives examples in Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands in particular of savings in state expenditure on public service contracts of approximately 20% to 30%.  In its background analysis and impact assessment, the Commission has presented evidence that mandatory tendering drives efficiencies in the railway business.</p><p>  I take the point made by the Deputy on the potential benefits of these reforms being reduced somewhat by virtue of the fact that Ireland is an island which does not have a rail link to the Community rail network.  It is clear the major benefits to be obtained from these reforms will arise on the European mainland where there is a very extensive network and there are major opportunities to develop new services.  The potential benefits are somewhat reduced for an isolated small network.  I do not believe this means there are no benefits to be gained.  The background to our decision to bring our derogation to an end was that there are benefits to be gained from the application of the European model.</p><p>  With regard to access to rolling stock, very high fixed costs are associated with the infrastructure of the railway business and with the rolling stock.  Accessing the market is only possible where new entrants are able to readily access rolling stock.  In markets with more developed competitive structures, such as the UK, leasing companies exist from which railway rolling stock can be obtained by new entrants and competitors.  This issue must be addressed in other member states where such structures do not exist.  With regard to ownership of the rolling stock in Ireland, some of it is owned by Irish Rail.  Some of the rolling stock which has been procured using Exchequer funds in recent years has been subject to a condition that ownership can revert to the State, although I cannot put specific figures on the proportion of the rolling stock to which these provisions apply.</p><p>  The Deputy's final point on safeguards was more a comment than a question.</p></speech>

What will happen from now on?  With regard to the ownership of rolling stock, is there a possibility to lease rolling stock?  Would it be permissible for the State to establish an agency to be responsible for leasing out the rolling stock?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-03-21a.846" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fintan Towey" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013032100007#F01100"><p>With regard to the fourth railway package and what will happen from now on, the European legislative process means the Council and Parliament will separately examine the proposals and eventually come to an agreement through the co-decision procedure.  The implementation timeframe for the market reform elements I mentioned earlier is 1 January 2019.</p> <p>The first question is in what form will the proposals finally be agreed and when.  It is difficult to state a timeframe.  It is not unusual for the European legislative procedure on a major set of proposals to take two years or a timeframe of that order. </p><p> With regard to the question on rolling stock, the draft legislation says that it is a requirement for member states to ensure that there are non-discriminatory arrangements in place regarding access to rolling stock.  That provision will require some action on our part and we must determine what arrangements should be put in place.  We are different from the European mainland because we are an island so have a different rail gauge.  It is not simply a case that we can take excess rolling stock from one country and move it to another.  That option does not exist.  If we are to have an efficient provision of services within the market then we need to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place to make the best use of the stock of rolling stock.  </p><p> To directly answer the Deputy's question, it would be permissible to set up a State agency that had ownership of the rolling stock.  That is one option but options will have to be examined.    </p></speech>
