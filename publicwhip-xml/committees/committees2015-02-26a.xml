It is a follow-up letter from our meeting on 22 January.  This is to be noted and published.  We will be returning to a number of issues relating to the HEA and there is a number of pieces of correspondence outstanding, especially relating to the merger between Waterford and Carlow.  I also understand that the Comptroller and Auditor General is currently doing a report on the HEA.  There are figures in that correspondence that do not correspond with the information we had received previously so that might be a matter that can be dealt with when the Comptroller and Auditor General is examining it.</p></speech>

It is to do with figures we got the last day to do with expenses and so on.  I think the figure we got the last day came from the briefing we got and they do not correspond with the figures in Mr. Boland's letter.  We have to examine it in more detail, and the way to do that is perhaps through the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

A very considerable amount of money was spent.  The feasibility study was conducted in 1997.  Two airstrips were completed, one in Clifden and the other in Inisbofin, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.  Another study was done on how to manage them and so on.  The total amount of money was in the region of &euro;9 million, and the ongoing managerial aspect involves a very substantial amount also.</p> <p>  In regard to the amount of money spent on the purchase of the airstrip, the contract for the construction, in one case it is over &euro;5 million and over &euro;3 million in the other case.  Could we get a breakdown of where the money was spent?  It is not in the reply that was given.  There are two replies.  One from the Secretary General, Mr. Hamill, and the other reply is from the Department itself, presumably in Mr. Hamill's name, but there are two separate documents.  It is not in Mr. Hamill's document but in the other document.  There is the reference to the timescale and so on.  Could I request that we get a full breakdown of the costs in regard to all the items of expenditure that brought about the situation where close to &euro;10 million was spent?</p> <p>  There was no detail either on the future use of those airstrips.  There is the optimistic hope that they might be used by the Coast Guard or by a private person to set up some sort of tourist resource but there is no firm information on that.  We do not even know whether these people are still engaged with the Department on it.  It is very much up in the air.  There was no extra detail on what was given to us when they appeared before the committee.  Could we get a full breakdown of that?</p></speech>

The Clerk to the Committee might remember this.  I asked the Secretary General a question specifically about Department's specific plans to memorialise the people who died in 1916.  The Department spent a good deal of money in 2014.  I believe it was &euro;22 million, but the witnesses were to come back and outline the specific plans they had to memorialise those individuals who died in the Rising.  I have not read this but-----</p></speech>

On the invitation we received from the National Library of Ireland, a number of us around the table visited yesterday to inspect the system and see the difficulties in the system.  A large quantity of priceless documents are housed in circumstances that are unacceptable from an environmental point of view.  If a problem arose and it involved paper, it would go up in smoke and the building would disappear rapidly.  Also, damage is being caused because documents are not being housed in a sustained environment in that it is too hot or too cold.  This is a priceless treasure in the library which is at imminent risk.  Having listened to what was said and inspected the conditions under which they operate in the National Library, I believe there should be some response from this committee to the need for urgent action to protect that invaluable resource, which goes back hundreds of years.  A great deal of the material in the library is not digitised so there is no other record of it in many cases.  The documents are in their original format but they are being housed in dangerous conditions.  We should contact the Government or make a special effort to ensure some action would be taken to protect them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-26a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015022600002#B01600"><p>That is agreed.</p> <p>  No. 3A.4 is correspondence from NAMA in regard to the De Vere Hunt case.  I want to put on record that I am not one bit phased by this correspondence.  While it may be factual in terms of how it quotes what the members have said and the action that was taken, the fact of the matter is that this letter was sent to us on the day they had a meeting with this lady.  It is clear from that, therefore, and from what is in the correspondence, that they are attempting to tick off the Committee of Public Accounts, and I reject that approach.</p><p>There is a reference to nominating a solicitor in this case and it mentions various things that were discussed in the course of the meeting, such as the serving of papers.  In my view, in a case where a person has died by suicide, it is not acceptable to serve papers by throwing them at the porch door.  There are other ways of doing business than using such tactics, particularly when a person is acting on behalf of the State.  I wish to put my view about that on record.  The correspondence also quotes Deputy Mary Lou McDonald.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-26a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015022600002#C00200"><p>I have not had the opportunity to look at the transcript but I have no doubt they quote me accurately.  The impression I was given as a member of this committee was that mediation was the preferred channel of resolution.  A reasonable person who went back and read the totality of the exchange would come away with that impression, although I am prepared to go back and look at exactly what was and what was not said.  I may have been too emphatic in my understanding of what the delegates were saying but it does not, at any rate, resolve the issue and I do not know where it leaves this particular family or other people caught up in this process.  My impression of the delegation was that they were quite sure-footed and I felt reassured that they were committed to mediation as the best and first option.</p> <p>  This correspondence leads one to a different view.  It states that it outlined how mediation works, which it did, and the purpose of mediation.  It also states: "NAMA's evidence about its attitude to mediation was very clear, as is evident from the various excerpts of the transcripts of the meeting.  It cannot be reasonably well argued in the circumstances that the committee was misled."  I am not saying they were deliberately misleading us but I took a different meaning from them on the day from the meaning I get from this letter.  This letter is mediocre in tone as regards NAMA's commitment to mediation but that was the whole basis of our discussion in regard to the matter we were probing in respect of Mrs. De Vere Hunt and her family.  Rather than clarifying matters, I feel this correspondence has confused things.  I would like clarity from NAMA and would like them to write to us to amplify the position they took while before the committee.  I would like to know what their commitment to mediation is in general and in the particular case of the De Vere Hunt family.</p></speech>

It is fairly detailed but it still leaves us with the reality that the recoup for the State was extremely low when measured against the full asset value in the accounts.  I suggest we ask Revenue to attend the committee to walk us through the information they have provided and give members the opportunity to raise other matters.  For example, one thing that jumped out at me was the statement that 33 investigations were initiated, 27 had been completed, six were ongoing and a small number of cases were being considered for investigation.  In other words, the process is not complete even though they first had notice of this in 2010.  Given the extent of public concern and interest in the matter and the money involved, I propose we invite Revenue to attend to explore the issues further.</p></speech>

There are serious questions to be asked about all the circumstances surrounding the HSBC offshore accounts.

I would love to extend an invitation to someone from HSBC to attend and if they were willing to do so, I would love to hear what they had to say.

Under the details for WIT, it states the institute has incurred direct costs of &euro;152,000 and it gives a breakdown of the expenditure.  It includes travel and subsistence of &euro;5,900 and office and other expenses of &euro;5,000.  I am trying to relate that to the cost of the merger as set out in our briefing document.  Perhaps we can clarify these figures before we talk to the HEA again.  There are a number of points in this letter.  We had asked about the projected costs for Carlow and Waterford and, despite of the significant amount of work already done on this, the letter states that the costs are not yet available.</p><p>This is the very point we were making, that they do not have a business plan or a forecast of the costs or what it entails.  Yet they are going down the line of this amalgamation without knowing what the costs are.  It just does not make sense.  I believe we should ask the HEA to address that fact before it comes before us again.  The other issue I want to raise on this correspondence relates to Carlow Institute of Technology.  At our meeting we referred to the costs of the two communication companies and as we can see from the reply,  the tender for the press liaison and public relations service of Wednesday, 18 September 2013, provided by Kearney Melia Communications<font color="#E01F25"></font>was &euro;4,070 plus VAT per month.  That is &euro;78,000 per year they are paying one company for public relations.  The second company they use, by tender on Friday, 9 May 2014, provided by the Communications Clinic, was &euro;30,645.  That is &euro;109,000 simply on PR and we have not gone into the procurement process in this.  We need clarification on these points as to the plan, the costs of these PR firms and the whole procurement process that is gone into.  We may be better informed when they come before us again.<br/><br/>I will turn to correspondence from individuals.  There is correspondence to be noted from Mr. William Tracey of Horse Racing Ireland and from Mr. Thomas Duggan of Millstreet Equestrian Services around the ongoing issue with Horse Sport Ireland.  I would advise the committee that arising from this correspondence the clerk and I met with Mr. Kieran Mulvey and Mr. John Treacy of the Irish Sports Council and we discussed the detail of the correspondence in order to move the issue on.  What came from that meeting was that the mediation process initiated by Mr. Mulvey had failed to bring the parties together.  <br/><br/>It is to be suggested to Millstreet that a binding arbitration process be entered into by both parties.  On the matter raised today in the letter from Mr. Duggan, the Irish Sports Council will now audit the State funding to Horse Sport Ireland and will come back to the Committee of Public Accounts with that outcome.  These are the two points of action agreed upon.  <br/><br/>No. 3B.3  is correspondence from Mr. Gary Delaney of Loc8 Code regarding the national postcode tender process. I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General for a response to that. </p></speech>

The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is undertaking a project to develop postcodes.  It is ongoing for a number of years.

She quotes the Act in her response to us and reference is made to not commenting on individual cases.  We have asked that the Chief State Solicitor's Office would come before this committee for examination of its spend on administration and so on.  We are not interested in names in cases, what we are interested in is the approach to how cases are taken, the cost of each case from any Department or agency which may have gone on for years and have been lost or dropped by the State for various reasons.  The committee wants to determine the spend on those cases without needing to know who was involved in the cases.  I believe we are in agreement with the contents of the letter but we certainly want to get more detail on the administration of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, the cost of the office and the cost of the cases I have described.  We will write back in that vein and set a date for the office to come before the Committee of Public Accounts.</p><p>No. 3C.1 and No. 3C.2 are briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.

I draw attention to two things in relation to the institute.  The accounts for the past two years show that it incurred deficits in both of those years.  If one looks at income and expenditure for the institute there are substantial transfers to the group of companies which provide services on the campus.  The results of those companies are not yet consolidated into the financial statements of the institute.  A process is under way to make them subsidiaries of the college and to incorporate their results.  I understand they will be in position to consolidate the full results for the 2013-14 financial statements.</p></speech>

I just draw attention to an unsanctioned loan taken by one of Horse Racing Ireland's subsidiaries.  It is a relatively small sum.  Horse Racing Ireland has the sanction of the Department to borrow up to &euro;40 million on condition that any specific element of borrowing is subject to departmental approval and it did not seek that approval.  We note this as an irregularity.</p></speech>

We have had our attention drawn to the two issues by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p>Last week, as part of the work programme, we went to Howth to see the situation out there.  A number of members examined the properties and heard from local business people.  It was quite a shocking experience to listen to the story of properties being vacant for considerable periods of time and no plan either to develop or assist local businesses.  There was also very little information on the background to what was happening regarding the leasing of these properties.  I propose that we draw together the information we have and get the information about leasing.  Would we ask the Office of the Chief State Solicitor about that or is it independent?</p></speech>

The appropriation account for the OPW Vote shows gross expenditure of &euro;399 million in 2013, mainly comprising expenditure of &euro;71 million on flood risk management and &euro;323 million on estate portfolio management.  Expenditure of &euro;5 million was incurred in 2013 on the national procurement service, which engaged in central procurement of goods and services for public bodies.  Since 1 January 2014, the service has been incorporated into the Office for Government Procurement, and the related expenditure is accounted for in the Vote for that office.</p> <p>  Under its flood risk management programme, the OPW spent approximately &euro;35 million on flood relief schemes, &euro;15 million on ongoing maintenance of arterial drainage and flood relief schemes, and &euro;2.3 million in the form of contributions to minor flood relief works carried out by local authorities.  Over &euro;7 million was spent on studies and development of river catchment flood risk assessment and management plans, referred to as the CFRAM programme.</p><p>These are required to meet Ireland's obligations under the 2007 EU floods directive.  My office has examined progress on the CFRAM programme and a special report on the findings is being drafted.  I expect to complete that report in the next couple of months.  <br/><br/>Expenditure by the OPW on estate management included &euro;97 million spent on rent and other charges related to property rented for use by public bodies; &euro;54 million was spent on maintenance of Government property and related supplies; and &euro;48 million was spent on new works, alterations, and additions.  The committee may wish to note that the latter included payments in 2013 totalling &euro;8.9 million in relation to an unsuccessful land swap deal at Harcourt Terrace, which I have previously reported on, and which has previously been examined by the committee.  Payments under a public private partnership contract relating to the National Convention Centre in Dublin in 2013 amounted to just over &euro;48 million, while expenditure of &euro;36 million was incurred on heritage properties and related visitor services.  <br/><br/>Apart from the estate management expenditure accounted for in Vote 13, the OPW also incurred expenditure of the order of &euro;59 million in 2013 on a range of services and capital projects that it was carrying out on an agency basis for other public bodies, including other central Government Departments and offices.  Chapter 4 of my report outlines the results of our examination of the manner in which the accounting for this arrangement was managed in 2013.<br/><br/>The concept of providing certain required services on an agency basis on behalf of other public bodies is potentially useful, such as where the agent makes available specialist skills and expertise to other organisations that have no long-term requirement for such services, and which it would be costly or complex for the principals to procure in other ways.<br/><br/>The standard procedures to be applied by agents and principals in controlling and in accounting for such arrangements in cash-based appropriation accounts are set out in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s <i>Public Financial Procedures</i>. <br/><br/>In most cases, the OPW receives funds in advance from the principals for each project or service required.  The OPW operates a separate suspense account for each project or service, with a corresponding suspense account on the principals' side.  Corresponding entries should be made in each account pair.  The amounts paid out by the OPW to suppliers should be notified promptly to the principals, who adjust their own suspense accounts accordingly and charge those costs to their own appropriation accounts.  In 2013, the OPW operated suspense accounts in respect of around 3,700 projects being carried out on an agency basis for a variety of principals.<br/><br/>Allowing for inevitable timing differences, balances in the OPW suspense accounts should match the balances in the corresponding principals&rsquo; suspense accounts. However, our analysis found that at the end of 2013, the OPW recorded that it held &euro;20.8 million in respect of 35 vote principals.  In contrast, the principals&rsquo; accounting records indicated that the OPW held funds of &euro;11.4 million.  There were both positive and negative variances, resulting in a net difference of &euro;9.4 million.  As a result of this analysis, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs made an adjustment of almost &euro;7 million in its appropriation account.  This reduced the difference between the OPW and the principal suspense accounts to a net &euro;2.4 million.<br/><br/>The examination found that some departments did not operate suspense accounts when they made advances, which they charged directly to their appropriation accounts.  In other cases, confusion about who was principal for individual projects had arisen when functions were transferred between Departments.  The OPW was late in notifying principals of some payments made in 2013, with the result that a number of appropriation accounts under-recorded their 2013 spend.  Unspent balances from advances on some accounts had not been refunded to the principals, and there were many cases of transfers and reallocation of fund balances between projects.<br/><br/>Overall, I concluded that the system of accounting for agency services provided by the OPW did not appear to be operating efficiently and effectively.  Improvements in accounting and control systems need to be made both by the OPW and by the Departments availing of its services.  I have made a number of recommendations for improvement, which have been agreed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and by the OPW.  My Office will monitor the implementation of changes to ensure that a more rigorous system evolves, and that any discrepancies in records are reconciled promptly.</p></speech>

I will first deal with today's item on Chapter 4: Accounting for Office of Public Works Agency Services, which the Comptroller has just spoken about.  In order to update the members, I have provided a short briefing note to the committee on the actions implemented to date in dealing with the recommendations.  As the Comptroller has said, the OPW provides many services on an agency basis to Government Departments.  Funding is provided to the OPW by the sponsoring Department and ultimately it appears as a charge on the account of the client organisation.  The value of these contracts and services where the OPW acts as agent, accounted for over &euro;120 million in 2014 - the Comptroller has referenced &euro;59 million in 2013 - with the main areas of investment being capital works on Government buildings, including schools, the leasing of accommodation for departments and agencies and the maintenance works on State-owned premises.</p> <p>   The chapter under consideration today looked at the extent of these agency services provided by the OPW and the procedures in place, in both the OPW and client Departments and agencies, in accounting for these services.  The chapter, in its findings, highlighted discrepancies in the suspense balances recorded by the OPW and the client Departments in the annual appropriation accounts.  In summary, the OPW has continued to work with client Departments to reconcile these balances.  The biggest difference recorded in the report, of &euro;7 million has since been amended in the principal&rsquo;s appropriation account to agree with the OPW position at the end of 2013.</p> <p>   Together with this reconciliation exercise the OPW has implemented a process of making detailed statements available to clients on a quarterly basis to bring to attention the early identification of any discrepancies.  These quarterly statements were issued to all clients in October 2014 and January 2015. </p> <p>   As highlighted in the chapter, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, &ldquo;is satisfied that the OPW, as agent, provides a centralised service to a high standard of expertise which avoids potential problems in respect of procurement, contracting and inter-departmental competition that might arise if departments were to engage in construction projects on their own account&rdquo;.  </p> <p>   I am of the view, as I have mentioned in my response to the Comptroller and Auditor General, that a review of public financial procedures could be of benefit, identifying the optimum manner of funding these agency services so that they can be provided efficiently.  In particular, when a contract is being placed by the OPW on behalf of a client, the certainty of funding required for the delivery of the project needs to be secured within the Estimates process, if necessary on a multi-annual Estimate basis.  The existing annual Estimates process and cash-based accounting sometimes present challenges for Accounting Officers when funds voted to a Department in one financial year are not fully expended, albeit contractually committed, and even though the works may have been completed, with no guarantee that those unexpended funds will be made available in the following year.  This creates an unnecessary pressure on principals to charge available funds to their Vote.  I would suggest to the committee that this practice might be considered further in terms of robust, flexible, multi-annual budget and expenditure systems.  I note that a report of the committee in October 2014 made reference to this.  I welcome that.  </p> <p>   I will now, in summary, refer to some important aspects of the work that was funded through the 2013 appropriation account and touch on the challenges that lie ahead in the two main areas of work for the OPW.       </p> <p>   On flood risk management, as the lead agency for the management of flood risk in Ireland, the OPW invested &euro;45 million in capital on this programme in 2013 and a total of &euro;411 million from 1996 to the end of 2014.  Major projects in 2013 included schemes completed at Clonmel, Mallow, Tullamore, and Carlow, and the continuation of works at Bray, Fermoy, and Ennis, with &euro;2.3 million provided to local authorities under the minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme.  The strategy for flood risk management is being addressed through the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment Management, CFRAM, approach.  This has involved an unprecedented level of surveying and analysis of each and every river catchment area in the country.  The members will be aware that the roll-out of a public information and consultation programme is under way through public consultation days to bring this mapping exercise and the mapping of areas at risk from flooding to the attention of the public for their comments and observations.</p><p>This year much of the work in this area is focused on the development of the risk management plans for the 300 areas for further assessment identified in the preliminary flood risk assessment.   </p><p> The National Procurement Service or NPS was established within the Office of Public Works in 2009 and was tasked with centralising public sector procurement arrangements for common goods and services.  In 2013, contracts initiated by the NPS covered major procurement areas such as electricity and natural gas, uniforms and personal protective equipment.  As the committee is aware, a Government decision of April 2013 agreed the outline plan for the development of an expanded central procurement function and from January 2014 the Office of Government Procurement has subsumed the NPS under its own Vote as part of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform group. </p><p> The final programme, estate portfolio management, encompasses the management, maintenance and development of a large part of the State&rsquo;s property portfolio including the care, protection and presentation of national monuments and national historic properties.  The programme utilises a wide variety of project management and professional services such as architecture, engineering, valuation, quantity surveying and property management. </p><p> Expenditure under this programme in 2013 included the payment of rents on behalf of all Government Departments to the value of &euro;97 million, a much reduced figure from the 2008 outturn of &euro;131 million.  The annual reductions in both the rental bill and the State's accommodation footprint continue to be achieved through a targeted lease rationalisation programme and a dynamic approach to property management which will continue to be pursued through the property asset management delivery plan, a priority reform area for the Government. </p><p> In 2013, some &euro;54 million was expended on property maintenance, which includes the facilities management function of the OPW and the management and maintenance of cultural buildings such as Leinster House and Dublin Castle.  However, in 2013, the OPW also assumed funding responsibility for all non-elective building maintenance on departmental property.  Essential maintenance is now provided on a shared and prioritised basis to Government Departments from one central maintenance fund managed by the OPW.  </p><p> The management, conservation and presentation of 780 national monuments and 30 national historic properties continues each year with a combined provision of 70 visitor centres accounting for an outturn of &euro;36 million in 2013.  I am glad to report that visitor numbers at these sites are steadily increasing with over 4 million visitors recorded at our heritage sites in 2013 and 4.4 million in 2014.  There are, of course, many millions more unrecorded visitors.  As part of the capital works programme in 2013, the &euro;48 million invested included works at the Irish Museum of Modern Art, improvement works at Garda stations and Government offices country wide and a wide-ranging energy conservation programme.</p><p> Ireland hosted the EU presidency in 2013, with the OPW providing a facilities and conference management role at properties such as Dublin Castle, Farmleigh, Castletown House, the Royal Hospital Kilmainham and the Botanic Gardens, providing the Government with a centralised and cost-effective Presidency for the 245 events hosted in the six month period. </p><p> I thank committee members for their attention today and am happy to take any questions they may have on the 2013 appropriation account, the chapter on agency services, or any other matters they wish to raise.</p></speech>

I wish to start with decentralisation and the property portfolio.  A reply to a parliamentary question that I tabled in January 2015 stated that the Road Safety Authority, RSA, has a lease on a property in Ballina costing &euro;442,828; in Carrick-on-Shannon, the Department of Social Protection has a 20-year lease for &euro;600,000; while in Limerick the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has a 20-year lease for &euro;900,000.  These are just three examples from that reply, which went on to state that 142 capacity places were provided in Ballina.  Will Ms McGrath tell me how many public servants there are in each of those locations, Ballina, Carrick-on-Shannon and Limerick?</p></speech>

Long-term leases are a property solution for the provision of accommodation for public servants.  We operate in the market and a long-term lease is one of the solutions we use.  As the Deputy knows, lots of private companies use that option too, rather than acquiring property on a permanent basis.  When we provide the accommodation, we do so based on the brief and the number of places required.  We are in the business of providing the seats but the actual occupancy is a matter for the occupying Department.</p></speech>

However, when we conduct surveys on the estate in the context of rationalisation, we would have regard to the current occupancy.  In respect of civil servants, for example, we would approach PeoplePoint which would provide us with the numbers.  In the ordinary course, however, we would not be recording the numbers actually occupying a premises.  We would be recording the places.  Our work would be on the basis of a brief at the outset, outlining the requirements.  In recent years, Civil Service numbers have reduced which is partly why we are in a position to surrender leases and to undertake rationalisation.</p></speech>

We are looking at this area and are taking what I described earlier as a dynamic approach to property management.  We are looking at normalising space accommodation to in or around 12.5 sq. m per person.  When we take accommodation, we have regard to the demands of the client and what we will allocate per person.</p></speech>

We had regard to space currently occupied by the Department in those locations and whether they had capacity, and we had regard to whether there were other public bodies in those vicinities.  Certain local authorities provided us with accommodation.  If those two were not met, we had to go to the market, and in that regard, we would be looking mainly at leasehold.  One of the issues on the Government's reform agenda is that the State wants to know what the State holds.  We have developed a register of State property which is currently being populated by public bodies.  As part of that, all public bodies can have regard to it when they need space, and they can see what other public bodies are in the area.  Those other public bodies will be identified through the register.</p></speech>

I must point out that private rented accommodation is an absolutely proper way to provide long-term accommodation.  One has regard to all the demands.

In other areas it gives great flexibility because if there are changes in respect of decisions, as in the contraction of numbers, we have been able-----</p></speech>

The properties are held by the Office of Public Works and the actual demand for operations comes from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Priorities are set by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to refurbishments, extensions and whatever.  In regard to own capital allocation, which was referenced, a third of it is expended on behalf of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's present prioritisation is cell refurbishment.  After that it is property evidence stores and then extensions.  It does this on an operational basis.  Since January 2013, the year in question in relation to the accounts, the maintenance of Garda station funding was held by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That transferred on a shared service basis to the Office of Public Works and we are now funding and responsible for the maintenance.</p></speech>

When we take leases, no less than any private company, we operate within the market.  We have never been at the high end because we have chosen not to be.  We are not about taking properties on a speculative basis; we do so because we have demands for accommodation.  Two factors here are, first, the reduction in numbers in the Civil Service and, second, as I have said here previously, the concern to optimise our utilisation of the estate and increase densities, that is, have greater numbers in accommodation.  We are using the owned estate more for that.  When we are taking leases, I do not have any greater say than anybody else against whom I am competing in the market.  Taking leases is an appropriate solution in certain instances.</p></speech>

One person received &euro;38,690 in overtime payments in 2013, while another person received &euro;33,831 in 2012.  This seems to be extremely high and shocking, given that it is higher than the average salary.  Will Ms McGrath explain why the figures are so high for one or two individuals?</p></speech>

The year 2013 was the year of the EU Presidency and much of our work was focused on particular facilities.  Staff are involved in particular specialties and there was additional demand for overtime in arranging functions.  I referenced the fact that there were 205 to 245 functions.  There was, therefore, increased demand during the six month period.  It was in respect of specific OPW grades.  In the Houses of the Oireachtas there are evening sittings and we provide maintenance facilities to ensure the electrics, which means we have people on standby.  This is due to the nature of the work we do.  It also covers heritage sites.  Employment contracts for heritage sites are centralised agreements and where staff have to work outside hours where sites are open, there are extra attendance and overtime payments.</p></speech>

Ms McGrath mentioned individual cases, but as overtime payments are included in the report, I thought she might answer the question.  The figures are not confined to 2013, the year of the EU Presidency.  In 2012 one individual was paid &euro;33,831 in overtime payments.  Therefore, it is not isolated to 2013.</p></speech>

So we would have specialist staff - one or two, a couple of individuals - who would then, in working in those areas, be working outside of hours.  So that would be where overtime would arise.</p></speech>

It comes up in the measured term contract, about which I can talk.  We have outsourced.  We have been early adapters in a certain respect in public sector reform because where our numbers have contracted we have used external service delivery to deliver.  We are doing that quite considerably.  There are certain things where we do need the resources to be in house.  In that instance we would use overtime, but I hear the point that is being made.</p></speech>

While I might be reading between the lines, is there a suggestion that some of the accounting procedures were done so that Departments would not have to surrender money at the end of the year?  We have come across other Departments where money was transferred to a different organisation, spent quickly or accounted for differently so that the Vote surrender would not happen at the end of the year.  Is there any suggestion that was going on with some of the discrepancies between the two accounts?</p></speech>

It certainly is in the interest of a Department to pay what it can pay in a particular year rather than surrender it and have to then meet the cost the following year.  The Chairman has alluded to that being a difficulty for Departments.  I suppose the point of end-of-year accounting procedures is to make sure they are done in a proper way in compliance with the accounting and payment rules, and that there is not any massaging of the figures or whatever.  That is what we try to identify in the course of audit to ensure that if there is a charge that is not proper to the year, then it is not charged to the account.</p></speech>

However, this was happening at a time when cashflow was extremely restricted and the State was borrowing at extremely high rates.  Also money that was spent and not surrendered was effectively borrowed and interest was being paid for on it.  It was not exactly a harmless accounting figure, if it was being done deliberately or if it was being done to save budgets.</p></speech>

That is the focus.  We need to know what the costs of services are.  So there is an argument that could be made that if it is charged on one account as opposed to the other, it is circular anyway, but in terms of identifying the cost of a service in a year, it is better that charges that are proper to that service in that year are properly accounted for in that year.</p></speech>

There can always be issues on timing, whether it is the weather or in terms of the contractor getting started.  They have made plans based on one thing.</p> <p>  As I said in my opening statement, I am minded that Government accounting could be looked at in this area.  I might say the Office of Public Works should be treated as a mature liability from the point of view of the demand to avoid this kind of re-accounting.  In certain respects on what I call our maintenance side, that has now been eliminated by one of 13 transferring the funds to us.  We are now dealing with them, and doing the work and the funding, so that has eliminated some of this issue.</p></speech>

There is one there that is very significant of &euro;7 million, for example, in relation to one project.  From our point of view we were pre-funded for that.  The Department brought it to account but has changed it since.  That money was expended within the first couple of months of the following year; we paid the contractor.  It is this timing question that relates to it.</p></speech>

So one can pay the money to OPW but one does not charge it in the year.  It is holding funds for one.  It is as if one had it in one's own bank account.  That is the whole point of the suspense account - so that the transfer is not charged in the year because it may or may not have been spent by OPW at the balance sheet date.</p></speech>

They came in and lifted the paintings from the wall.  We stood out for a minute and they catalogued everything.  It later emerged that there was an intense investigation into missing paintings in the Leinster House complex.  Media reports suggest up to 24 paintings are missing, some of which are of considerable value.  I know one McEntaggart painting is worth about &euro;2,400.

We have changed our methodologies on that.  In the instance of art being allocated to occupiers of this building the Superintendent's office takes responsibility.  We would not have previously had that be the case but would have relied on our own resources.  With changes of Government, people decant and there are changes in where people are located.  Things are boxed up and moved. A lot of the art has been located in boxes that were on the move</p><p>It is a considerable amount.  Taking the Chairman's point, the Leinster House complex is not just this building, but all of the offices that attach to it.  We will conduct a further survey, which we should do anyway, of the assets.  As the Deputy mentioned, there is only one piece of art that is worth a substantial amount.  Largely speaking, the value of the art is low, but that in itself is not a reason not to locate the missing pieces.  I hope that this exercise will be completed during this summer.</p></speech>

We will monitor the agreement for the contract's 25-year duration.  The State has acquired a dedicated convention centre that is being operated by the PPP company to international standards.  It has won numerous awards for its operation and exceeded expectations in terms of international delegate numbers.  We have been making the payments under the contractual agreement.  Some relate to the capital cost of the facility, which the State owns, and the rest relates to the unitary charge.</p> <p>  The State recognised from the outset that the lack of a dedicated convention centre was disadvantaging the State in terms of business commercial tourism.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has identified that &euro;1,275 per person is the wider economic benefit that accrues from international delegates attending.  Some 110,000 international delegates have attended the convention centre to date.  Under the project agreement, the operators of the convention centre have targets to achieve annually in that regard.  We will work through that project agreement.</p> <p>  There has been a share ownership change in respect of the centre, but it has no impact on the centre's operation.  We are the State body that will consent to that change.  We were advised of it today or yesterday.  We will work through a process with our advisers on the matter.</p></speech>

A number of years ago, flooding caused devastation throughout the country.  In the recent storms, there was also damage to coastal areas.  The OPW faces major demands in that regard.  A process to identify areas is under way, but how will the OPW progress its plans in the short term?  What is its budget and what budget does it need to complete the works required?</p></speech>

Under the EU floods directive, we have undertaken a preliminary flood risk assessment throughout the country.  Following consultation, we have identified 300 areas that are at risk.  I am treating this matter separately from what we are doing at the moment in terms of our capital programme.  CFRAM is the strategy for the future.  We are involved in initial consultations in respect of the 300 areas.  We are publishing the flood risk maps.  The process is ongoing and we have undertaken 145 or 150 consultations on the maps.  Towards the end of this year and into the beginning of 2016, we will publish the outline designs.  They will not just be a document.  They will be outline designs for the 300 areas that are at risk, of which 90 are coastal.  The designs take account of climate change.  The return period on the fluvial side is 100 years, which is the international standard.  On the coastal side, our return period is 200 years due to the tidal impact.  The designs take account of all of these elements.</p> <p>  Our programmed capital allocation is in the order of &euro;45 million through to 2016.  Works are in train at some of the 300 areas, but it will not be until we have the outline designs that we have clarity on indicative costings.  We expect that there will be a significant increase in the demand for capital to give effect to the implementation of the schemes.  Given the current position, we expect the additional demand to occur from 2017 or 2018 onwards, depending on the Government's opinion on the duration of the programme.  If it is to be a ten-year programme, which might be our suggestion, the capital will be allocated accordingly.  We must discuss with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform the setting out of capital figures, but there will also be an internal capacity issue if we are to move to that level of resourcing.  We will identify it as a demand.  While we might commission consultants to develop the schemes, we will manage the schemes internally.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned coastal storm damage.  Following the events at the beginning of 2014, the Government made an allocation for the repair of flood defences.  That &euro;19.1 million was channelled through the OPW's Vote.  Of that amount, &euro;7.5 million was drawn down in 2014.  Local authorities applied to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for funding based on the damage caused.  Based on those local authority demands, the Government decided on what was more or less an equivalent amount, which has been channelled through us.  The local authorities have undertaken the work.</p><p>Subject to agreement, on seeing that the work is done, they recoup the money from us, or they draw it down to undertake the works.  There is the remainder for 2015.  As they did not get to do it all in the year, an element of it comes within the allocation for 2015.</p></speech>

The scheme involves the provision of new walls and embankments at the Curraheen, Glasheen, north channel and some parts of the south channel.  It involves flow reduction on the south channel; the development of a detailed flood forecasting system; the development of optimised dam operating procedures for extreme events; and localised defences between Iniscarra and the city, where we are talking about a distance of 19 km; designation of upstream washlands &ndash; areas of agricultural land which will be temporarily flooded; flood gates and some footbridge and boardwalk locations; and localised surface water pumps.  It will also involve channel clearing and maintenance at Blackpool, the removal of a pedestrian bridge at Orchard Court, the replacement of the roadbridge at Orchard Court and flood defence walls at Orchard Court.  There is an alternative in that regard because following local consultation an issue arose about a wall that was not seen and there was a view that there should be a sealed culvert.</p></speech>

It was outlined in an OPW report that during the extreme flooding in November 2009 and previous flood events drainage channels at this location had been blocked and that an issue had arisen with a bridge which had led to a house being flooded.  The OPW carried out the report and described what was wrong at the location in the Ballinasloe engineering area in Galway.  The problems were described and the council applied for funding, following which a total of &euro;15,000 was allocated.  The house of the individual in question and others in the general area continue to be flooded.  Has the OPW examined works to determine in terms of the profile of work for which the council had applied for funding whether it was carried out and completed and, where it has not worked, as appears to be the case in this instance, does it examine the location again to determine the nature of the problem?</p></speech>

I think I might have written previously to the committee on the particular location to which the Chairman referred.  We are satisfied with the independent expert's report commissioned by the county council in question in identifying that value for money was achieved in what was done.  We concur with this.  The works in question and the drawdown, irrespective of the amount, were signed off on by a director of services.  We are satisfied in this instance that value for money was achieved.  It may be that further improvements are required, but that does not necessarily mean that the additional works would be cost beneficial.  What has been done is.</p></speech>

It states clearly that the channels overflow onto private lands and the public road and ultimately cause flooding in a particular house.  The council carried out work.  According to the owner of the house, flooding continues to be a source of danger.  In spite of the expert report, has someone looked at the issue to determine whether there is something that could be done to resolve the outstanding matters?</p></speech>

In the case of minor works we will not have that level of protection.  It is designed to give some measure of relief that is sensible and moderately costed.  An independent hydrological consultant was appointed to look at the issue.  What was done has helped to reduce flood levels by about 370 mm.  That offers a good measure of protection to the house but not against a significant flood.  It has improved the condition significantly for the small sums indicated.  To do further work would require much more work on the channel, including underpinning a bridge, the cost of which would probably run into hundreds of thousands, if not more.  That would not be cost beneficial in protecting one house and a length of road.

We would have had regard to Castletown Estate, Farmleigh Estate and, in the main, Dublin Castle in that context.  We would have had substantial engagement on our facilities side with the Departments involved to determine the nature of the varying demands and requirements related to intergovernmental meetings, ECOFIN meetings, break-out meetings and those which would take place on the margins, etc.  An interdepartmental group led by the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach was put in place to oversee what was to be done.

We obtained from the Courts Service the courthouse, which adjoins the gaol, and are undertaking substantial works to it.  As the Deputy is aware, access to Kilmainham Gaol is restricted because of the fact that there is a single entrance and exit.  This leads to people being obliged to queue to gain entry.  We are, therefore, developing the adjoining historical property, namely, the courthouse, to enhance access to and increase throughput at the gaol.  We are also carrying out works to improve visitor facilities at Kilmainham Gaol.  The gaol will be a key element in the commemorations to be held in 2016.  This project is the most extensive in which we are involved in terms of works being carried out.</p> <p>  The Deputy inquired about monuments outside Dublin.

The policy on this is that we look in the first instance as to whether there is other public use.  In that regard, eight stations have been put to other public use.  This is where I also talk back to the register on the identification of these properties.  Consideration must also be given to the value of some of these properties.  We then look at their disposal or, depending on their location, they may be strategically held because we have to have regard to the future.  We have looked at the communities initiative.  Where communities have been able to make a business case and have the wherewithal to take on a licence and the legal obligations therein, we have been very happy to facilitate that within communities.  I believe there are in the order of 17 such cases.</p></speech>

What are Ms McGrath's views on making available tables and so forth to help communities avoid the direct cost of purchasing such items?</p></speech>

My issue is one of capacity.  The remit of the furniture division is the provision of accommodation for Departments for which we have responsibility.  The division has received a green procurement award for the sustainability of its operation in relation to the contracts it has in place.  Most Departments re-use their furniture unless there are very specific requirements.  We have a policy of disposing of redundant furniture.  I am not certain how this is done but it is a policy because we do not wish to hold substantial stores of furniture.  I would have to examine the issue.  We hold auctions in this regard and funds come back into the Exchequer.</p></speech>

There is a strong connection with social enterprise and community regeneration.

The Congreve Foundation has decided to remain <i>in situ</i>, which takes much of the pressure off us in terms of the opening of the gardens and the employment of garden staff.  That area is secure.  The Attorney General is involved, which is positive, and the local authority has now become involved as well.  Given the location of the gardens, increased involvement at local level will be more beneficial.  There is dialogue under way in regard to negotiating the long-term future of the gardens, the extent of State involvement and who the participants on the State side will be.  This is being explored by the various parties and the Attorney General.</p></speech>

Deputy Deasy has raised the issue and is familiar with it as the estate is in his constituency.  I visited the estate and believe the State would benefit by keeping ownership of it.  It is a fantastic property and I am surprised the OPW has not got over the line in regard to reaching some form of agreement by now.  It was reported that progress was being made and that matters were working out.  Would it be wrong to suggest that the reason it has gone in a different direction is that the OPW has not been as proactive as it should have been?</p></speech>

The Congreve Foundation holds two seats of the trusteeship and operates the gardens.  What is at issue is the cost of operating the gardens.  The trust scheme goes back to the legacy of the late Ambrose Congreve, who received substantial tax benefits from the State and in return he was to provide funds to maintain and operate the gardens for the currency of the trust.  The gardens will remain in trust for 20 years before they ultimately come to the State.  The Attorney General advised there must be further examination of how this operates.  This created a new set of issues for us.  To answer the question as to why there has been an inordinate delay, it has been because of the legal position, specifically provision of a fund to maintain and manage the gardens into the further currency of the trust.  This has created issues and proceedings have been launched before the courts by the State.  On the positive side, we are working our way through these but they are highly complicated.  We must abide by the decision and advice of the Attorney General.  As I mentioned earlier, the fact the local authority is involved in negotiations means we are hopeful we can progress this.  We must have due regard to the legal advice we receive from the State's legal adviser.</p></speech>

The disadvantage of coming last is many of my questions have already been asked.  With regard to flood risk management, the witnesses spoke a lot about coastal flooding.  The report mentions 300 areas, 66 of which are connected to the Shannon.  In 2009, we were told major works would not be done because they would not be cost-effective and we would have to wait for the CFRAM report.  To be parochial, I am concerned because in 2013, &euro;71 million worth of work was done in places such as Mallow, Clonmel and Fermoy.  When I was fighting for flood relief in my area, I was told the works would not be cost-effective and we would have to wait for the overall picture in the CFRAM report.  Why have these works been done but not others?  At the time, we were told various local authorities could receive small sums of money for minor works.  What constitutes minor work?  Of the money allocated, how much of it was drawn down and how much work was done?  I speak in particular about the River Shannon.  Those living in an area at risk of flooding have been waiting for the CFRAM report for a long time.  I assume when the report comes out there will be a lead agency for the River Shannon which will be responsible for monitoring the river.  There are many difficulties with regard to whether the OPW, Waterways Ireland or the ESB is responsible.  Will this come out in the CFRAM report?</p> <p>  It seems a long time ago since Deputy O'Donovan spoke about rents.  I was shocked to read &euro;17 million was spent on rent for Revenue and &euro;14 million was spent on rent for the Department of Social Protection.  I am shocked because these are not new Departments.  They have been in existence for a long time.  Why do we spend this type of money on an annual basis renting property for a Department which will obviously be in existence for a long time?  Why do we not consider buying premises or using premises we already own?  It does not seem cost-effective or business-like.  One would not do it if one was running a private business.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-26a.447" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Clare McGrath" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015022600002#T01000"><p>I will come back to the question on what is being drawn down by the local authorities in the areas affected in order that the Deputy will see what was sought and what was drawn down with regard to the River Shannon.  In the 1980s, the Government made a decision to discontinue arterial drainage.  After this, it was recognised there were urban areas where schemes were needed, and ten schemes were identified.  The Office of Public Works undertook these schemes, and funds were made available.  Since then, significant flood events have occurred in particular locations, and these have been an element in driving demands with regard to considering the feasibility of what could be done and what was viable.  Much was determined on the potential costs and benefits and what would be the greater return, such as the number of houses protected.  In this exercise, 300 areas have been identified, and multi-criteria analysis will determine the order in which work will be undertaken, subject to capacity and funding.  We will use systematic and objective criteria to determine nationally what projects proceed.  The Deputy mentioned 66 locations, but a considerable number of locations along the Shannon have been identified in the CFRAM report and among the 300 locations.</p> <p>  It is not proposed to have a lead agency for the management of the Shannon.  As it is, there are local stakeholders such as residents, the farming sector and other sectors and other stakeholders such as the ESB, Waterways Ireland, Inland Fisheries, angling associations and other amenity users of the Shannon, some of which have statutory responsibilities and others with ownership rights.  There is also Bord na M&oacute;na and various other public bodies.  Our role, through the CFRAM process, is management of flood risk.  We do not control the Shannon and all of its elements.  It is very important to us that all stakeholders come together, which is part of our public consultation effort, to ensure we achieve balance between the competing demands while providing flood protection.</p></speech>

Meelick is not in my constituency, but a man-made cut there, which is overgrown, is affecting my constituency.  We cannot get one half of it cleared because it is a special area of conservation and planning permission is required.  One is passed from Department to Department because it is not its responsibility.  There needs to be one lead agency in control of the entire situation.  Otherwise we will be on a hiding to nothing.  Farmers working on the shores of the Shannon know the river better than anybody.  They want this piece of the cut cleared, but they cannot get it done because there is no lead agency.  Waterways Ireland does not want it and neither does the ESB.  It is a special area of conservation.  It is absolutely ridiculous.  We are spending a lot of money on a report for which we have waited since 2009.</p><p>When the report comes out it will provide maps for the whole country.  I know we have never had such maps before and it will probably be an advantage.  The people who live in the region have been affected by floods.  They are not just numbers; they are people who have homes and livelihoods in the region.  They know the River Shannon better than anybody else and want this piece of land cleared.  They cannot get that done even though they have jumped through hoops.  It would be useful to have a lead agency, which one could approach with ideas of what needs to be done, and then the lead agency could give a directive for the work to be done.  At present there are too many chiefs and not enough Indians.  People are saying who should do what but nobody is doing anything.  That is why I firmly believe that after the CFRAM report there should be one lead agency that will direct all the other agencies, an initiative which is very important to the people on the ground.</p></speech>

The Deputy has asked a larger question on policy; our responsibility is to do with flood risk.  If there is a particular instance or case of flood risk, we would probably treat it along with the local authority if something needed to be done.  </p> <p>  It is fair to say - I did not mention this - that environmental issues are a consideration.  In our maintenance works we must have regard to environmental issues, as well when we are in the river, and we comply with that.  The Deputy has raised a policy question.  I am saying, in respect of the policy for which the OPW is responsible, that we are developing CFRAMs.  If there are cost benefits to be had then measures will be identified.</p> <p>  As the Deputy has rightly said, CFRAM is not a report.  It is for all 300 areas and will be an outline design.  There are flood risk maps but there will be outline design schemes for the 300 areas, which is a step towards detailed design.  That means they will be ahead compared with where we were previously on identifying a location.</p></speech>

In certain circumstances one could talk, in the long-term, about acquiring sites, building buildings or whatever, but for a small demand.  One would have to look at numbers in locations.  The better option is to look at this on a cost-benefit and value-for-money basis, maybe to take a lease at a location.  It is good economically that we are availing of space in the local market.  I take the point made by the Chairman earlier that we might, for larger projects, identify locations and rent.  International companies that have been in this country for quite a long time rent, and they reassess the situation after a period if their circumstances change.</p></speech>

We have moved, in regard to our surrenders, to holding more owned estate.  As I have said previously, at all times we will have regard to the property register.  For example, if a local authority in an area has a local authority office then we could avail of it.  We might have to pay the local authority rent, but it would still be movement within the public sector.  In some of these instances, that is what some of these rents would be.  The Deputy was right to say that we have largely obtained them in the market.  We will revert to the Chairman on the matter for the larger ones.</p></speech>

In 2013, consultancy fees were in respect of ISO, International Organization for Standardization, accreditation for OPW systems.  We were doing audits for these.  There was a capacity issue around some of our internal audit functions, which meant the office had to use an external service provider.</p></speech>

At our first session this morning we will hear from Mr. David McWilliams on issues related to early warnings, divergent and contrarian views in the context of the banking crisis in Ireland.  David McWilliams is an economist, writer, broadcaster and journalist.  He worked initially as an economist with the Central Bank of Ireland, the Union Bank of Switzerland and Banque Nationale de Paribas.  Since 1999 he has been a broadcaster, writer, economic commentator and documentary maker.  He has written four books, writes two weekly economic columns and he has made various documentaries.  He has brought a one man economic stand-up show to the stage at the Abbey Theatre.  David McWilliams is credited with being one of the first economists to predict a boom in Ireland's economy and for his predictions of an Irish property bubble building from 2000 to 2007 which would ultimately burst.  He was the first to coin the phrase &quot;ghost estates&quot;.  In January 2007, David McWilliams was selected as one of 250 young global leaders by the World Economic Forum and he is a regular speaker on the international circuit.  I welcome Mr. McWilliams.</p><p>I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If the witness is directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, and continues to do so, the witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of the evidence.  The witness is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  The witness has been informed previously that the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that Members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official by name, or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Can I invite Mr. McWilliams to make his opening remarks to the inquiry please.</p></speech>

It is a pleasure to be here.  I just want to make some opening remarks about the period in question, starting with 2000 and going up to 2008 and beyond.  It is my opinion that the Irish banking system, and by extension the rest of the Irish economy, was set up to fail.  </p>  <p>         I saw this earlier than anybody else and I made this opinion and these ideas available as widely as possibly.  In fact, I probably spent the best part of a decade trying to warn as many people as possible on as many platforms as possible that our property market was going to crash and that when it did, our banking system would be in a situation where money would fly out of the system and lead to a banking crisis.  I did this in hundreds of thousands of words; not thousands, but hundreds of thousands of words, in dozens of articles, two a week in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, the biggest selling newspaper in the country, and in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>.  <br/><br/>I made documentaries about this.  I had my own TV show on TV3, which was watched by tens of thousands of people.  I warned people at every juncture that our housing market was a credit bubble and credit bubbles bust and it is not a matter of if they bust but when they bust.  The documentaries of <i>The Pope's Children</i>book, which I wrote, were watched by 36% of the Irish watching audience; that is a lot of people.  <i>The Pope's Children</i>, and I do not say this for any other reason than to make the point, was disseminated extremely widely and was the bestselling non-fiction book, not of the year, but of the decade, and it was published in 2005.  So these ideas were out there, disseminated widely, in the most accessible way.  When I hear the view that nobody saw this coming or that this was in some way a shock or we were taken by surprise, I do not believe that is the case.  I think the Irish property crash and the banking crash were both incredibly predictable and absolutely preventable. <br/><br/>This testimony will be a little bit different in the sense that it will not be about what should have or could have happened, and if we had seen that, if we did not see that, and my God I cannot believe we missed that.  This testimony will be taken from contemporaneous articles, pieces of work that show thinking at the time.  This was not isolated thinking.  In fact, I believe, and my experience through the period from 2000 onwards was, that many thousands of ordinary Irish people could see what was happening.  The difference is that I was an economic commentator and an economist and I had the platform of the media to deploy these ideas.  I cannot tell you the number of times I went into bars and pubs and chatted to people and they said, &quot;Hold on a second, this doesn't seem right; what is going on here?&quot;  So it is not as if a significant part of the population was not already worried.  I want to make that point that this was preventable and predictable, and that these views were widely disseminated.  There were not a huge coterie of individuals doing this but it was certainly out there.  <br/><br/>One could probably ask oneself why did this guy, who is a former Central Bank economist, an investment bank economist, why did he not just come home to Ireland, keep his mouth shut, play the game and get on with business.  The reason is I felt that if one has a specialty, if one understands something, one has something like a patriotic duty or a moral imperative to say that the policy or numbers of policies that we have together will lead our country into catastrophe.  I think it was a patriotic thing to do.  It certainly was not a worthwhile thing to do and it certainly was not fashionable and it certainly did not make me popular.  The interesting thing is that all through this period I was accused of being unpatriotic when I believe in actual fact it was something that was essential to do if one had the education and the experience to do so.  I remember people saying that I was unpatriotic for talking down the economy.  The committee might remember that expression, &quot;Talking down the economy&quot;.  I think that was maybe a reaction on the part of certain parts of the establishment to somebody saying, &quot;Hold on a second, this thing will not last.&quot;  <br/><br/>It seems to me from a political perspective that on every big economic issue, Ireland tends to split between insiders and outsiders.  The insiders are people with &quot;pull&quot;, the old fashioned word, with access to power, and the outsiders are people who are actually on the outside.  In the case of the property market and the associated banking and credit explosion, the insiders were the bankers themselves, estate agents, people who were doing well out of the property market, parts of the professional classes who were doing very well, and senior Government officials who were looking the other way or were not necessarily taking on board what was clear.  These are the people on the inside who were actually doing well.  Then, of course, political parties, because if there is a property boom there will be a tax boom.  If there is a tax boom then there will be lots of goodies to give out, lots of sweeties to give out.  So I think they are the insiders and in the situation of a housing boom where house prices are rising well above what the average person can afford, the outsiders are simply the people on the outside who are forced to play a game in which the dice is loaded against them from the start.  I think that is important; there is a political context in this.  <br/><br/>I suppose I devoted such enormous energies to trying to warn about this for two main reasons.  The first reason was because I believed that hundreds of thousands of ordinary Irish people would end up in negative equity and would end up in debt and would end up in a situation where their lives would be destroyed by the debt associated with the housing market and they would end up being the people who paid.  That is a social reason.  The second reason, and this is very important for the context of this, is that I had worked both inside the Central Bank in Ireland in a crisis but, more crucially, I had also worked outside in investment banking.  What I see and what I saw were panics in investment banks, panics in financial markets, and I could see that every single day we avoided taking responsibility for this mess.  Every single day we said, &quot;It will be grand,&quot; or, &quot;There will be a soft landing,&quot; or, &quot;Don't worry about it, it is the markets.&quot;  We were therefore condemning ourselves to run out of options when the crisis happened.  The more we ignored, the more desperate we became and therefore the more we ignored the more likely we were to end up, which we did when the crash came, in a situation where our choices were not between good and bad but between bad and worse.<br/><br/>The crash was inevitable.  Now why was it inevitable?  This is the key.It was inevitable because of the way in which the banks were financing themselves.  Again I wrote all of this at the time.  I was writing this in 2000 and 2001.  This is not me thinking back and looking with hindsight.  This was obvious to anybody who was trained.  It was obvious.  This is not the sort of thing that anybody who is trained could not see.  This panic did not have to happen.  The panic of September 2008 did not have to happen.  It was not anything that was pre-ordained.  It could have been fixed very early.  The problem is if there is no housing boom there will be no banking boom.  If there is no banking boom there will be no banking crisis.  If there is no banking crisis there will be no interventions, such as the guarantee, and there will be no bailout.  All of these things are the consequence of bad economic policy, not the cause.  They are the consequence.  What happens in banks when they get out of control is that they all end in bank runs.  A bank run is when people take their money out.  A bank run is called a run because it happens quickly; it is not a bank amble or a bank stroll or a bank stroll around the park with a dog.  It is a run because people panic.  That panic will be more extreme if there is what is called hot money, if there is international money financing the banks.  When I saw this in 2004 that was when I realised we had a serious problem.<br/><br/>The Irish banking crisis began in 2000, not in 2008 as is sometimes suggested.  It began in 2000.  The great English economist John Stuart Mill, speaking about the railway crash that happened in Ireland during the Famine, said that crashes do not destroy the wealth of a nation, they merely evidence the extent to which wealth has already been destroyed by stupid decisions taken in the boom.  So the destruction of the Irish balance sheet did not happen after 2008; it actually happened before.  That is the nub of the issue, because prevention is always better than cure; we know that.  There is a direct link therefore between not heeding the warnings and vilifying those who warn.  </p>  <p>         There is a direct link between this and the subsequent panic which need not have happened and the decisions that were taken. <br/><br/>The best way to look at this credit banking panic is through the prism of a forest fire.  Let us imagine a forest fire in a small place; the pyromaniacs start the fire which, in this case, are the banks and the forest is the general economy.  The people who are supposed to be the firemen, the regulators and the monetary authorities, look the other way and say &quot;Don't worry about the fire&quot;.  Some people would have said we have had them before and they have been quite nasty but this one will be different.  The firemen say &quot;Don't worry, we'll be grand, it will blow itself out.&quot;  Then the fire engulfs, not only the forest, but is about to engulf the entire village beside it.  The village leaders, the politicians, are faced with the choice - does one let the thing blow and see what happens because one never knows maybe a house will remain, or does one put it out?  At that stage one has to put out the fire with every single method possible.  Why?  Because it is already engulfing the entire place.  If one looks at the situation in that way one can see the way in which I, who wrote this a long time ago, think about these situations.<br/><br/>Who started the fire?  I wrote many years ago that property markets can only increase with credit.  Property markets do not increase as a result of supply and demand.  That was a big canard.  It does not happen that way.  It is credit.  Who gave the credit?  The banks.  Worse, what happened?  When the banks ran out of our deposits - normally the bank would say to itself I have a deposit here that will allow me to lend - they borrowed other people's money to give to us to buy houses that we were buying and selling to each other at expensive prices and calling it a miracle.  Whose money did they borrow?  They borrowed from the Germans, French, British, etc.  There was hot money coming in.  For example, one of the largest banks took 100 years to build up a balance sheet of &euro;60 billion but it doubled that in three years.  Let us think about that.  Why?  Because it had all this money coming in.  <br/><br/>What was the regulation called?  It was called light touch regulation.  Light touch regulation means one guarantees, almost makes certain, that the banking system is going to implode because hot money always leaves.  When hot money leaves then the rest of the money leaves too.  We actually set the entire thing up and this is crucial to a fail.<br/><br/>The interesting thing is a lot of people said:  &quot;Don't worry.  The free market will discipline the banks.&quot;  That does not happen.  Let me explain what happens in the free markets.  On the way up the free markets do not discipline the banks but do the opposite and allow the banks to do what they want.  As a consequence we have an  extraordinary situation where one joins the EMU, which was an unusual decision we might talk about later but it had a material impact on the economy, most of which in my opinion is negative.  We have light touch regulation, we get this flood of money into the banks which facilitates over-lending and then the over-lending facilitates over-borrowing.  All of this sounds familiar now but back in 2003 nobody was discussing it or those who did were vilified.  I shall play the committee a little 40-second clip of me on &quot;Prime Time&quot; in October 2003 which was watched by 400,000 people.  This is important and I said: </p><blockquote>The Irish housing market is a scam.  It is an enormous financial swindle that could potentially confine an entire generation of young Irish workers to years of bad debt.  Far from being a reflection of economic vitality and fundamental demand the housing bubble is, in the main, a vacuous financial confidence trick that has been foisted upon us by an alliance of banks and the landowners.<br /><br />Today, in Ireland, the price of the average house is close to ten times the average wage.  This represents an economic failure on a monumental scale.  Behind this nonsense is excessive and irresponsible lending from our financial institutions.  The situation would be laughable if it were not so serious.</blockquote> <p>That clip dates from October 2003.  I said: &quot;The Irish housing market is a scam.&quot;  That is what it was and that is what I want to come back to.  It was financed by over-lending not demand.<br/><br/>A lot of people have asked me what made me think like that while other economists did not.  I will wrap up but I want to make the following point about what happens when house prices rise.  Economics tells us that when the price rises the demand falls, that is what we teach kids in school.  In Ireland the opposite happens with house prices.  When the price rises the demand rises because people get panicked.  One hears that all the time.  People say: &quot;Jesus, prices are going up by 10%.  I'd better get on the ladder now because if I don't I'll have to pay another 10% next year.&quot;  A very active rise in prices, once it is allowed, creates a dynamic in people's heads to buy more, not less.  This is why economists could do with common sense, which is what I have always felt.  I urge them to talk to people.  I suggest they forget the models, talk to people, ask them what they think and then think about supply.  Economists will say &quot;Oh, when the price rises the supply goes up&quot;.  <br/><br/>The main houses we have in Ireland are a stock of housing.  The houses are already built.  Someone like my Mum would trade down from a family house, she would move on and some other family would have the home.  Let us think about what happens when house prices rise.  My mother would say, and it is natural, &quot;I won't sell that now if they are going up by 20%.  Wouldn't I be mad to sell so I shall sell next year&quot;.  That would be a totally rational decision for my mother.  Not only does the price not work, it amplifies the problem.  It ends up that supply eventually adjusts but it adjusts far too late.  We end up building houses in the wrong place for the wrong people at the wrong price.  That is why I coined the expression &quot;ghost estates&quot;.<br/><br/>In 2006, I was travelling back from Westport having visited Allergan, a factory which produces Botox, not for my own use.  I visited for a piece of research I was doing about who made Botox.  While I drove back from Mayo to Dublin I saw that every little town had a huge big estate and was reminded of a conversation I had had the night before.  I was thinking, because I had talked to a local guy the night before about the famine in Mayo, about how extraordinary it was and how unbelievably catastrophic it was.  He talked about the famine villages around Delphi and that neck of the woods.  He said they were like ghost villages and were kind of creepy.  When I saw the estates on my drive back home I thought they were exactly the same and that they were ghost estates.  It is funny because when one comes up with a term one does not realise that it will drop into the lexicon so quickly.  Obviously the &quot;breakfast roll man&quot; was building the &quot;ghost estates&quot;.  All these things happened but the ghost estates are indicative of how supply does not respond.<br/><br/>One wonders why people behave like this.  I want the committee to understand, at the very beginning, why the economy behaves like this.  People behave like this because we are all impacted by each other.  Economists think we are all rational.  We are not.  We are highly irrational.  Has anyone every met a more irrational animal than us?  We fall in love, we follow stupid football teams - all the things that make no sense.  The reason is that everything we do is impacted by other people.  <br/><br/>A couple of months I was in the Aviva stadium with my son.  In Dublin, there are two types of people.  There are those people who buy their own tickets to the Aviva and there those people who get paid to go to the Aviva.  I fall into the former camp.  I remember Ireland scored three tries against Australia in the first 18 minutes.  Even though I had really good seats with my 12-year old I saw none of the tries.  Why?  Every time the Irish team did well everyone seated in front of us stood up.  Then I had to stand up and my kid had to stand up and get on my shoulders.  Then the people behind me had to stand up and that continued for all the people behind them.  That is exactly how the economy works too.  The fellas who stood up first had no idea they were sending a signal to me to stand up because I was behind them.  I had no idea that I was impairing the view of the people behind me.  We had all paid to sit in the Aviva but we ended up standing.  That is how is the economy behaves.  When people see house prices rising in Ireland they buy houses, if they can, not because they want them but because other people are buying them.  That type of herd behaviour is essential to understand why a property boom in a country like ours, if it is not controlled, gets totally and utterly out of hand unless of course one is lending to this property boom in which case one is making money so does not care.  </p>  <p>         The question is, why did the banks not see this? Why did they not see that their own balance sheets were being impaired? I believe it is because banks' balance sheets play tricks on them.  Every time a chunk of money goes in to the economy, house prices rise.  That means the banks' collateral rises so they feel safe.  Every time the collateral rises they feel safer and safer and ultimately they lend more and more and more.  Then, if your bonus is related to your share price you have a greater interest in lending more because lending more makes you rich and gives you profits.</p></speech>

I am saying the banks' balance sheets play tricks on them and they ultimately go bust.  Why is that?  Because they are allowed to borrow yet more.  They keep borrowing and the balance sheets look fine.  Then they realise the more they borrow, the worse the balance sheet is, but they don't see it.</p>  <p>  Why did the interest rate not rise? Because we are in the EU.  We have this crazy situation in that we have decided we are Germans. What is that all about? Ireland does most of its trade with Britain and the US, yet we have a currency attached to Germany.  Somebody else may elucidate as to why that is.  When German interest rates fall, our interest rates fall too.  When our interest rates fall there is no warning sign from outside.  That is hugely important because it is material to the next ten years, not just the last ten years.  </p>  <p>  We also have an issue with groupthink.  Why did nobody, or very few, speak out?  I believe groupthink is something that happens in many aspects.  I believe that if you have ideas in Ireland which are beyond the mainstream, those ideas go through three phases.  The first phase is open ridicule, the second phase is violent opposition and both of these happened to me.  The third phase is where we are now which is that everybody pretends they were on your side all the time.  This is what happens.  Groupthink shifts because it is a conventional wisdom.  We can talk about this during the questions.</p></speech>

During 2007 and 2008 I became very worried.  My articles became extremely agitated.  I could see the smart money leaving the country.  One could see this in repo rates and credit default swops.  In The Pope's Children and in the accompanying TV series, I said that certain well known Dublin banks were then little more than out of control hedge funds, leveraging themselves and their clients' money into property.  I said that these outfits usually went belly-up.  I worried, but not because I had any contact with the banks.  I was so toxic at that stage that I had never been in any of the banks.  I may have bumped into one or two of them at economic conferences but that was the height of my contact.  I had no insider knowledge or data.  This was simply an economist working in the banking system, on his own and at his own desk, who could see what was going on.</p></speech>

The lead questioners today will be Deputy John Paul Phelan and Deputy Pearse Doherty with 20 minutes each.  Other questioners will have eight minutes after that.  I will set the scene.  Mr. McWilliams, you mentioned the housing price bubble in your opening address this morning.  Given that you were warning for such an extensive period of time, was there any point prior to 2007 when you thought that your warnings may have been mistaken?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-26a.577" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David McWilliams" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015022600002#D00900"><p>No.  I became increasingly certain because the evidence was all over the place, from the hard economic numbers to the anecdotal evidence and conversations.  When you see house prices going completely out of kilter, you realise there is a serious problem.  One of my best leading indicators was a piece in the Irish Times called Take Five, a part of its property section which offers city by city house price comparisons.  The article showed readers the difference between a two-up two-down house in Dublin city for &euro;500,000 and a 17 bedroom chateau outside Paris with a direct RER rail link to Place de l'Op&eacute;ra, for the same price.  As the property-credit-borrowing binge became worse, it struck me that there was no way we could avoid a banking crisis.  It became a matter of when, not if.</p></speech>

You based this on the Minsky Kindleberger credit cycle analysis.  Can you please outline to the Committee what that theory means?</p>  <p>  Can you also inform the inquiry if any person in authority contacted you in regard to the concerns you were raising at that time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-26a.579" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David McWilliams" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015022600002#D01100"><p>It is an interesting question.  The book The Pope's Children was so widely read that these ideas were in the ether.  This was not an academic book that nobody read, it was the biggest selling non-fiction book of the decade.  This has all happened before, all over the world.  We can go back to the Romans or even the Bible.  Deuteronomy and Leviticus, two books in the Old Testament, deal with debt forgiveness after booms.  We are not talking about something new, we are talking about something that is deep in our culture.<br/><br/>Most mainstream economists in Ireland believe in classical economic theory and I do not.  I never have.  I will give an example of what happens in peoples' heads when prices rise.  There are two stand out American economists I learned about after I left postgraduate studies and university in Ireland; Charles Kindleberger and Hyman Minsky.  They understood that once credit was put into the mix,  it profoundly changes the way people behave.  Members will know this from talking to their constituencies.  Kindleberger outlined the various stages of the cycle.  There are seven stages.<br/><br/>One is when something material happens or actually changes.  In our case we joined the European Monetary Union and our interest rates in the long term went from a real interest rate of about 6% down to almost zero.  Our interest rates fell which changed the landscape profoundly.  House prices begin to rise in this first stage of Kindleberg's model. The second stage is euphoria.  People begin to think it is because of themselves that their house price is rising.  They think they are clever.  House prices continue to rise. The third phase is gearing, which is when the banks get involved with the idea that one can remortgage a house to buy two gaffs in the Algarve.  Gearing means that the whole thing starts to get a little bit crazy.  The fourth phase is the mania phase when people become manic.  People actually flew to Bulgaria to buy houses, financed by their houses in Ireland.Banks are now pushing the money.  The fifth phase is the bubble phase.  We all lived through it and know what it is.  The sixth phase in the Kindleberger cycle is the phase of distress.  This is when people start to dislike the smell of the situation.  Early people get out and start selling.  The seventh phase of the Kindleberger Minsky cycle is called <i>torschlusspanik, </i>a German phrase from when it happened in Germany and Austria in the 19th century.  It translates as shut door panic, when everybody jumps and runs for the door and tries to sell.  The whole thing collapses.  This happens in assets all the time and I could see this.  <br/><br/>There are three phases which happen next.  The first is the Minsky moment.  This is crucial because our banks had a Minsky moment in September 2008.  </p>  <p>         A Minsky moment is when a bank realises it does not have any money and must sell good assets to pay for the losses on bad assets, because those assets are entirely bought on margin.  Once one buys something on margin, one is in the lap of the gods.  So we had Kindleberger's seven stages, then we had a crash and then came the Minsky moment where we had bank collapses.  Again, this is all in the book.  At that stage only massive state intervention can help.  It is described as requiring a hegemon, that is, a big country or large institution, a central bank or the ECB, say, to come in and right the situation.  That is because they, like me, do not believe in classical economics.  The economy will not right itself after this type of boom and there must be an intervention.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. McWilliams to be as succinct as possible in all his responses as we have another witness attending later.  He referred to that big moment and the big intervention that is required-----</p></speech>

I did not answer his last question, which was whether anybody in authority contacted me, at any stage, to discuss my concerns.  The answer is "No".  Categorically, not one adviser, not one Minister, not one civil servant, not one member of the regulator contacted me.  Nobody did.  In actual fact, I would have been toxic to all of them and they probably would have avoided me like the plague.  All of this was going on and never once was I asked my opinion on anything by anybody, informally or formally.</p></speech>

In the Irish situation, it was in the form of the banking guarantee.  Did the design and implementation of the guarantee have any relationship to Ireland's entering a bailout programme two years and two months later?</p></speech>

As I said at the start, the guarantee, the bailout, all of these issues are the consequence of the pathetic policy from 2000 to 2008.  The outcome was foreseen and certain.  It was simply a matter of how bad it was going to be.  That was really the question that was revealed over the course of the subsequent few years.</p></speech>

As a pope's child myself, my first question relates to his book, <i>The Pope's Children</i>, published in 2005.  It was this book, in many respects, which brought Mr. McWilliams to national prominence.  One reference in that book particularly struck me when I reread it recently, namely, the statement that the decline of Germany had changed Irish psychology and was central to Ireland's success.  Will Mr. McWilliams outline briefly what he meant by that?</p></speech>

What I was trying to explain, which had not really been explained before and certainly had not been explained to the Irish people by the policy makers, was that once one joins a monetary union, what one is effectively doing, if there is no regulation of one's banks, is getting the PIN number to the ATM card of the richest person in the room.  Of course, the richest person in the EU's room was Germany.  It was rich and it was in decline.  After reunification in the early 1990s, the united country swallowed up the former East Germany and it cost it a fortune to do so.  Germany's economy then began to stagger under the weight of those repayments and as a result of the cultural and demographic shift.  The country started to go into decline in the period from 1995 to 2005.  For Ireland, this meant our interest rates, which were really set for the Germans, went to levels that were totally inappropriate for the boom we were having.  It meant that the normal way in which one warns people that things are out of kilter, which is by setting higher interest rates, not only did not happen but we actually got lower interest rates.</p>  <p>  I was trying to explain in the book where the money was coming from.  I remember going to pubs and people asking, "Where is all this bloody money coming from?".  I recall a builder friend of mine who worked with me years ago in Boston saying to me that the difference in Ireland at that time, compared with the past, was there was now no problem getting money.  For the 2005 book, I invented a German character whom I named Udo Lindenberg after a German crooner.  This guy was sort of the German version of France's Johnny Hallyday - not a great gig to attend, I suspect.  I invented the character and named him for this singer I had heard of.  Udo represented the old, parsimonious German saver.  Banks hate savings because they do not make any money on them.  In fact, they pay out for savings.  In that situation, they asked themselves who they could give them to in order to make money on Udo's savings, and over here was Ireland.</p></speech>

In a radio interview on RTE's &quot;Saturday View&quot;, he stated that a crisis was imminent in the Irish banking system and that at least one Irish bank would be closed before Christmas.  He said in his 2009 book, <i>Follow the Money</i>, that he received a number of telephone calls from bankers in the wake of that interview who accused him of causing panic.  Will he indicate how many calls he received and what was said during those conversations?</p></speech>

This goes back to a very important point.  In Ireland, we have an inability to accept reality.  It is a national issue we have.  In a crisis, the most important thing is to define one's reality not as one would like the world to be but as it actually is.  Once one has defined that reality and got the facts, then one can do something about it.  Once something has been done about it, one can then face into the crisis.  It struck me that in Ireland, all the way through 2007 and 2008, the official policy was to delay and pray.  It was a case of we will say everything is grand and pray the cavalry will come over the hill and save us.</p></speech>

The problem with that is that I knew, not from talking to bankers but from looking at what are called repo spreads and credit default swaps, that all the hot money, this significant investor money, was leaving.  Whose money gets called after that?  Your mum's money and my mum's money gets called.  It falls to depositors, in other words.  What struck me as really strange was the more they spoke about "dangerous talk", the more they imperilled the deposits of the little guy, because the big guy always gets out first.  The context is this idea of delay and pray and not being honest with ourselves.  The more they denied it, the more terrified I became because it either meant they did not understand the significance of what was happening, they did not have any facts at their disposal or they actually did not care.</p></speech>

I was on a panel with him; Brendan Keenan, my colleague and economics editor at the <i>Irish Independent</i>; and then member of the Opposition, Deputy Richard Bruton.  I had written an article the night before for <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>in which I said exactly what I have just outlined, namely, that the banks were not being truthful.  Either they did not know what was happening, which is unforgivable, or they would not admit what was happening, which is another issue.  </p>  <p>         My recollection was, now that I have the transcript, that the first about half an hour was spent talking about the public sector.  I think Brian Lenihan was involved in a partnership negotiation.  We talked about the public sector, and there were budget cuts coming.  I interjected and said, &quot;We can talk about this all we like - I can read the echo<b></b>verbatim, but we will put it into the record - but the problem is the banks and that the Irish banks risk going bust in the next couple of months&quot;.  I cited the Swedish example and I said what was happening in Ireland was exactly what happened in Sweden and in Japan.</p></speech>

The Minister replied to me and said, "That is dangerous talk".  I think when we get to a situation where telling the truth is regarded as dangerous, the Deputy knows that we are in the last resort saloon.  We came out of the RTE interview and there was chitchat and pleasantries and Brian Lenihan said to me, "You seem to know what's going on".  He said to me, "You got all this right in the last couple of years" and he laughed.  He said, "Why don't you come in and advise me because everybody else is in advising me?"  That was the actual quote.  He said, "Here is my number" and he scribbled it down.  I scribbled it down, I think, on the back of one of the books I had taken in with me.  That was the first time I met Brian Lenihan, so I took his number.</p></speech>

I was really fully expecting a strategy to come out, that this is what we were going to do, that we have a bank resolution mechanism and we know how to deal with this.  At every juncture during those two weeks, nothing was coming.  It was still the same thing, that the banks are well capitalised and that the Irish banks have been stress tested.  One will remember all that sort of stuff.  The crucial point to appreciate is that the rich guys get their money out; it was a poor average person who gets burned in a bank run.  That is what happens.</p></speech>

If the United States could not let Lehman's go, with the deepest financial market, with the best central bank in terms of ability, with its own currency and with its own monetary policy, we could not do that because it did not work in the States.  The second day after Lehman's failed, the Americans did what would be called the nationalisation route.  They nationalised AIG, the massive insurance company.  Nationalising would not have stopped the bank run in Ireland because the bank run was systemic in the sense that people were taking money out of all the banks, so you nationalise one but it just means that people will say, "Who is next?".  That is exactly what happened in America.</p>  <p>  The next day Merrill Lynch went bust.  I did mention to the Minister that I found it ironic that his lead advisers were Merrill Lynch, people who could not even keep their own bank solvent, let alone advise others.  At the time, he was aware.  </p>  <p>  The third option was that one of the big Irish banks would buy one of the small Irish banks, the idea being if you have a big balance sheet, you can actually take over a smaller balance sheet but I said to him at the time that all the Irish balance sheets were bust because we all knew they were doing the same thing.  So even without the figures, you knew that they were all bust.  I remember saying to him that I thought "two bad balance sheets does not make a good one".  </p>  <p>  Then he said, "What about the idea of giving a &euro;100,000 guarantee to depositors?".  I said, "That could work but you cannot really be half pregnant, Minister" and I remember he kind of smiled at this.  I said that if until yesterday you said the banks are well capitalised and then tomorrow morning you say, "Do you know what, not only are they not well capitalised, they are going to bust but we will protect some people".  When the hot money is owned by people in trading floors, that does not cut it.  In fact, that proved to be the case.  </p>  <p>         A limited &euro;100,000 guarantee was introduced on the Friday after that and it did not work as money continued to flow out.  Just as I had been thinking, once you admit that you have a problem, having denied it all the way up, it opens the floodgates, which it did.</p> <p> Finally, I said, "There is one other option," and he said, "Well, we are working on that other option."  The Merrill Lynch options show that the Department was working on what was called the blanket guarantee.  Blanket guarantees have been used in 14 out of 42 bank crises.  They are not unusual, but the Irish one was followed in Denmark and Germany a week later.  It is only as a last resort and I remember saying to the Minister, "I don't know; I don't have the facts, but I think we are at the last resort.  What you have got to do [this is very important for the record and it is written down in black and white in all of my documents] is you have got to introduce a holding guarantee which buys you the time to allow your auditors and your civil servants to go in and find out the facts.  You cannot do something permanent when you are not in possession of the facts and if you are not in possession of the facts and that is the case right now, you need to do something temporary with a time limit.  That time limit you have got to figure out."</p></speech>

There are 14 other instances around the world of last resort guarantees, given when time is running out and confidence is shattered and the state has to step in or the alternative is a bank run and a total collapse of the banking system.  We know from the Great Depression that this is not what you want.  This causes recessions to turn into depressions.  However, in all cases, there is a distinction between debt and equity for corporate finance receiverships.  Equity like instruments are never included and subordinated or junior debt is subordinate to or underneath and at no stage did I ever imagine that such debt would be included and the reason is that it is known that in all corporate finance receiverships subordinated debt is an equity like instrument.  It comes at the very, very last and has many more of the characteristics of a share than a bond.  You get paid more to hold the subordinated debt, so you are being paid for the risk.  If you are being paid for the risk over and above everybody else, when the risk materialises, you cannot expect to be paid in full.</p></speech>

He was very professional.  He never gave me indications that anything was being decided.  He more or less wanted to use me as a sounding board rather than anything else.  He did not have to explain a partial guarantee.  What it means is that if it is &euro;50,000 or &euro;100,000, the state will be behind it.  I said to him that that was all very well if the bank run was Irish people going to ATMs, but the bank run would be the billions of euro of hot money being traded on international financial markets.  What they would look at in the context of a partial guarantee was if all of the denials up until then had been wrong and that would spook them even more.  I have worked on financial markets and seen how they work.</p></speech>

It had not worked and, therefore, they had to realise that.  Their hope was things were not as bad as they seemed and this is consistent with an entire orchestra of underestimating the problem.

I said that it could but that it would not stop a bank run.  We must be very clear about what we were trying to do.  We were trying to prevent a national run on the banking system.  What signal does it send by nationalising a small bank?  It sends a signal that the bank is problematic.  In a panic, does it say that people should not worry and that the rest of them are fine, or does it make a depositor wonder what will happen if one bank has been nationalised and is about to go under?  I informed Brian Lenihan that exactly this tactic was taken by the IMF in 1998 in Asia.  There was a crisis in Thailand with the baht, followed by crises in Malaysia and then Indonesia.  The IMF came in and said the countries should nationalise the bad banks, which they did.  People thought that this was the organisation that did not see anything coming and was now telling us that it was limited to a certain bank.  It created an accelerated bank run.</p>  <p>  The second thing is that by nationalising a bank in the middle of a crisis, we take on all of the liabilities so we do not give ourselves the temporary idea to find the facts.  This involves crystallising losses today.</p></speech>

The purpose for him calling me when I was in China was to see what people on the outside were saying.  I told him at one stage that one of the deflating things about being an Irish person is that others do not think that much about us at all.  We think that they think hugely about us but they do not.  To the extent that I was listening to them, they were saying that all the European banks have problems, that the European Union must come in and that Ireland was in the eye of the storm.

This is something that has been repeated time and time again.  Can Mr. McWilliams inform the committee when he formed the view that the guarantee should be rescinded?</p></speech>

The question is whether that should be in one year or two years.  The time horizon is important.  I remember saying to the Minister that if people are worried their money will not be in the bank when they go to get it out, and a two-month or three-month guarantee is given, that is not long enough to assuage the average punter that their money is safe.  People must be given time sufficiently far out that they think they will be grand.  Two or three months would have taken us to Christmas and was not that far.  On the other hand, I said to him that auditors need to find out the facts about the maturity obligations of all the loans of the banks so that we did not cover too much.</p></speech>

The first was about the inclusion of subordinate junior bonds and the second was the way of tying the weaker banks into other banks.  I became worried that what I thought was an emergency measure to protect depositors was going to end up being used as a cloak to protect bank creditors.</p></speech>

After meeting Brian Lenihan on 4 October, I found myself back on the outside, where I had been since 2000.  Contact became sporadic and then there was nothing at all.  I thought this was simply the way he was moving away from my thinking.  </p>  <p>         My thinking was to be as flexible as possible and to try, as much as possible, to buy oneself time.  His thinking, and the Department's thinking, became harder and harder and then the migration towards we are going to pay everything became almost obvious to those of us who were worried about it.  I began to write constantly warning people that this was being used as a way for full payment, in the case of a bankruptcy, which was never the objective.</p> <p> I argued that we should move to what is called the savings and loans model in the United States.  That model came about as a result of a big collapse there in the 1980s and 1990s where eventually they realised the cost of bank bailouts was going to be too much.  They decided that what they were going to do was force the bondholders - the debtholders - to take equity which made them shareholders in the banks which, in a way, allied the banks and shareholders in the same place.  That was increasingly my thinking and then the following became so obvious to me after NAMA.  What NAMA did with the guarantee was it ensured that this country would end up selling our assets at a discount and buying our liabilities at a premium.  That is morally wrong but is also a financial disaster.  At that point we had created the ELA or emergency liquidity assistance.  That meant the banks' liquidity was solid so one could have rescinded the guarantee, kept NAMA in place and nothing would have happened because the ECB was back in there and the Central Bank was back in.  That was the idea by-----  </p></speech>

His nightmare scenario was an Irish property market slump, coincident with a change of management in Ireland's major banks.

I think this was a conference that I was chairing.  Because it was 2005 and because nobody at that stage was talking about property busts and our banking problems, and I was the chairman, so I said "Hold on a second.  It is all very well to say that the economy is flying along.  What happens not if, but when, this implodes?"  I said what was likely to happen was that Irish banks would be bought by some other banks, Wilbur Ross-type characters or whatever it happened to be in the case.  I then got the response that it would be better if Irish executive remained at the helm.</p></speech>

Mr. McWilliams has provided the committee with extensive evidence in the form of documentaries and written material that he had written from the period 2008 which foretold the financial crisis.  If it was as obvious as he has said, why was it ignored by what he called the insiders?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-26a.685" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David McWilliams" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015022600002#J01300"><p>That is a huge question.  In a small country one gets significant vested interested.  When a small country experiences a banking and property boom many people will make a lot of what looks like very easy money.  That cohort of people have a clear incentive to vilify the maverick.</p>  <p>  With respect to my own profession of economics, it amazed me at the time that so few, in any positions of power, did anything or said anything.  I have found it amazing that people were swanning around with titles like bank expert and international bank expert.  I said "Well, hold on a second.  You were living in the country that had the most catastrophic bank crisis and you didn't open your beak."  People watching this are entitled to ask that question.  </p>  <p>  There is a thing in Ireland which I refer to as conventional wisdom.  When conventional wisdom sets in it is repeated by serious people.  People say "He is not a serious person but I am a serious person because the guy beside me is a serious person."  Then he repeats the mantra and then mantras replace hard thinking.  Once mantras replace hard thinking then every serious person buys into them.  J.K. Galbraith said something very interesting about changing one's mind.  It is very hard to change one's mind if one is a serious person.  He said that when faced with the choice of changing one's mind or finding the proof that indicates one does not have to, the vast majority gets busy finding the proof.  Let us consider that thought in the context of this country.  People like me were regarded with the view that it could not possibly be right, what this guy is saying, because the vista is too apocalyptic.  One of the views was "Ah but he spent too much time abroad."  </p>  <p>  I feel, and this is worrying for subsequent future years, that when this society coalesces around what I would call a simple truth, such as there will be a soft landing or the banks are well capitalised, it is an extraordinarily dangerous place to be.  It means that, like lemmings, we all go over the cliff together.  </p>  <p>  As I have always thought, if one thinks of a quadrant of maverick, consensus, right and wrong, which applies to politics as well, if one is in that consensus and one is wrong then people adopt the view that we are all wrong together and sure that is grand.  People think "We are all a bit stupid but we are all stupid together".  If one is in the consensus and one is right people think "Sure, we are all geniuses, that is great. Jesus, you are smarter than me.  Oh my God, you are outrageously smart."  If one is a maverick and one is wrong then one is a maverick that is wrong.  In that case one is incredibly isolated, laughed at, sneered at and regarded as being somebody who is not serious.</p></speech>

That is the key.  If one thinks it is illiquid then one has to prevent it from being illiquid because if it is illiquid it will go insolvent in a panic.

Wage earners become relatively poor ... Periods of speculative excess also lead, in every country, to extraordinary disparities of wealth.  The &ldquo;new rich&rdquo; typically have their counterpart in a &ldquo;new poor&rdquo;.

He colourfully referred to the Spanish conquest of Latin America and the ransom which the Incas paid for their unfortunate emperor.  In one week, he wrote, &quot;the Spaniards plundered more gold [from there] than the entire continent of Europe produced in a year&quot;.  He continued, &quot;A monumental mass of gold and silver crossed the Atlantic between 1540 and 1580 - Gold robbed from Latin America paid for everything&quot;.  He concluded:</p><blockquote>There was hardly any lasting positive effect on the Spanish economy.  How did Spain manage to waste one of the biggest financial windfalls in human history?  And are there any lessons for modern Europe and Ireland in the history of the Spanish gold rush?</blockquote>  <p>In Ireland, were there any equivalents of the indigenous peoples of Latin America who were robbed?  If so, who were they?  Were there individuals or institutions that were the equivalent of the Conquistadors?  Were there individuals or institutions that were the equivalent of the Spanish aristocracy who Mr. McWilliams said in his article benefited hugely?  How did Ireland manage to waste the biggest windfall in the history of the State?</p></speech>

The interesting thing about human nature is that it never changes.  All these things happen again and again.  At the time, what really struck me as fascinating from an economic historian&rsquo;s perspective was how Spain went from being the richest and most aggressive colonialist country in Europe in the 16th century to the poorest in the 17th century.  How did that happen?  There are many theories but one in particular struck me.  What actually happened was that when they plundered all the gold from Latin America, it became easier not to work.  Huge swathes of the Spanish manufacturing and agricultural sectors stopped because the Spaniards did not bother working.  The people who actually got the most benefit from the Spanish plunder of the Inca gold were not the Spanish but the Dutch and the British who actually made the nails, the hammers, the guns and other products they sold to the Spaniards.  That always struck me as interesting.</p>  <p>  What the Spaniards had was a massive monetary stimulus, like in the context of Ireland.  They woke up one morning and had all the money in the world.  We woke up one morning and through the banks had all the money in the world.  As had happened in Spain, when one has all the money in the world, prices and inflation rise and one abandons manufacturing.  Why should we make stuff when we can actually sell a site down the road?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-26a.704" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David McWilliams" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015022600002#K00800"><p>It is less risky at the time.  If the Deputy thinks about it, if one puts money into land in Ireland, how many tax breaks does one get?  Loads.  How much cheap capital does one get?  Loads.  Why does one get cheap capital?  It is because the banks say they know what land smells and feels like.  However, take someone like Apple&rsquo;s founders.  They tell the banks they are going to build the most amazing computers out of a garage and will need X millions of euro to do so but have no guarantees or collateral, just that it is all in their head.  The banks will not give someone like that money.</p>  <p>  What I was trying to explain in the historical context was that one part of our economy would become bloated with capital while another part would become totally starved.  That is where we have to got to in Ireland.  We have a massively efficient multinational sector but very little domestic industry.  I believe this is because of the way in which Irish capital was given out in the boom, namely, that it always favoured land.  At the very top of the boom, 88% of every single loan given out by an Irish bank in this country was to a property or property-related investment.  When one allows the banks be the sole arbiter of the distribution of capital, one will get endemic short-termism.  Why?  It is because it drives up their share prices and bankers&rsquo; bonuses are paid by share prices.</p></speech>

Never once was anything I ever said muzzled by any editor.  I have written for <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>all the way through.  It is the newspaper of the economic, financial and political class.  I went through three editors at that newspaper.  Nobody ever telephoned me or censored my articles.  I have also worked for the <i>Irish Independent</i>for many years.  It is the largest newspaper in the country and, again, never once has anything I ever said been spiked or questioned by an editor.  I am bit of a gypsy because I have worked for TV3, RTE and Newstalk, the main television and radio stations.  Never once has anything I have written or suggested been interfered with.<br/><br/>It is not that there was a corporate line for people like me.  Maybe I was like an exotic creature in the zoo in that they always have to have one of us.  What is quite funny is the number of people who wrote about the boom saying it would all be grand and it was fantastic but are now saying they all saw it coming.  I have never been muzzled or interfered with by anyone.</p></speech>

I really think that and do not think there was a general feeling.  That said, if one picks up a newspaper and one has 1,000 words by David McWilliams stuck in the middle saying watch this, and one has 20 pages of glossy advertising in the supplement then clearly, there is a bias in there.</p></speech>

If a banger turns up on a team and scores five goals against one, one knows there is something wrong.  The young fellows are tiny and he is a big lad.  Banks can be bangers too, by which I mean that if a bank emerges out of nowhere and begins to record profits that are extraordinary and way out of sync with what traditionally had been the case, either the people are geniuses or there is something going on.  If one thinks about banking, it is a very simple business.  One lends 2% or 3%.</p></speech>

The regulator should scare the daylights out of bankers.  The regulator is the Elliot Ness of the gig and should swagger in.  The regulator should be able to say "Come in lads and lock the door; I am worried about this".  Once one gets a situation where they perhaps are all a bit too cosy, the institutions - I am not talking about individuals - become part of the problem.</p></speech>

I appeared on John Bowman's "Questions and Answers" television programme in or around 2004 and alluded to the fact that all the commentary about Ireland was about a budgetary expansion at the time of approximately &euro;3 billion.  There was the whole budget thing and the Minister for Finance of the day was on the panel.  I said the most important thing was not that &euro;3 billion has been injected into the economy by the Government but that &euro;23 billion has been borrowed in the same period by the private sector.  The private sector was borrowing and injecting into the country eight times more than the budget surplus.  In my mind, that would have been a moment.</p></speech>

I do not see them rocking up to Bordeaux.  They go to the English-speaking world.  There is no scintilla of economic evidence that suggests anything other than a prejudice.  EMU is a continental system; we are an Atlantic race and an Atlantic economy.  It makes no sense and it has been disastrous for this country.</p></speech>

I was working as an economist in the department that was dealing with the European Union and the putative European Central Bank, as it became.  </p>  <p>         I was always amazed at the extent to which the people on the inside denied reality.  The beauty about Ireland is that if a currency is overvalued, one can see it not in outflows of money but in the length of the queues of Toyota Corollas at Sainsbury's in Newry to buy cheap Harp for Christmas.  Deputy Doherty will know this as someone from Letterkenny.  If the Irish currency is overvalued relative to sterling, the currency of our major trading partner, Irish people go across the Border to buy stuff.  We have a living economic experiment in Dundalk, Letterkenny and Lifford.  During the currency crisis I pointed out to one of our bosses who was claiming there would be no crisis or devaluation that the <i>Irish Independent</i>was reporting on these queues of punters, although they were probably driving Ford Escorts rather than Toyota Corollas at the time.  I got the impression that sometimes when one was inside, one was being dictated to by the tyranny of one's own peer group.  If one's peer group consists of the fellows one meets in Brussels, conversations might not reflect the country one is supposed to be discussing.  I refer to that psychology in a book called <i>The Good Room</i>.</p></speech>

At the moment, if an individual's house price increases, the bank can loan more against it.  That is a built-in inflationary mechanism.  In 2000 I came up with a backward looking house price index whereby the last house price increase was divided by the average of the index and then multiplied by the loan-to-value ratio, which means that the increase in prices reduces the amount of money that can be lent.  It would be a dynamic system which could regulate itself.  That is how one should do it.  It is a simple statistical rule and it would be unbelievably easy to put in place.  It would strangle house price inflation because house price inflation would limit the amount of money that could be lent.  That is the sort of regulation we need.</p></speech>

The liability risk was the hot money coming in seeking a higher yield and financing commercial property.  One stops commercial property prices rising by managing liability risk, that is, both sides of the balance sheet.  If, for example, the regulator saw that a bank had just issued a short-term liquidity instrument of &euro;500 million, which was happening all the time, it could have said, "Hold on a second, you cannot do that."  The regulator would manage the bank's liabilities, which are the source of its delinquency, and as a consequence the bank would not be able to lend for commercial property.  That is what we have to do in an open economy.  Instead, however, we were looking at the asset side of the balance sheet and praying it would be okay but then panicking.</p></speech>

I told the then Minister that he had reached the last resort.  Sweden had reached the last resort in 1992.  When it had a similar boom-bust cycle, it introduced a blanket guarantee of all deposits, excluding subordinated debt, and by this means it stopped a bank run.  Our objective was similarly to stop a bank run.  Sweden quickly realised it would have to set up a bad bank and it did so extremely quickly.  It wrote down the assets very quickly and minimised the cost.  However, it also devalued its currency by 40%.  Once a country devalues its currency, it is back to life.  What happened in Ireland's banking crisis was that, amazingly, not only did we not devalue our currency, but it actually increased in value between 2008 and 2010.  Sweden cut its interest rates to zero, but our interest rates went up after the crisis.  We had an extraordinary set of policies that even a student taking leaving certificate economics would know was wrong.</p></speech>

Over the last five years an amazing number of scenarios have been painted about what could have been done if, could, must, blah blah.  Hindsight is a great luxury.  At the time we had a banking system that had been set up to fail.  It was not a matter of "if", it was a matter of "when".  The combination of hot money and a bank run is the most vicious and contagious financial episode one can imagine.  It is the financial equivalent of Ebola.  One needs to come in with all possible interventions to reduce the perceived risk in the minds of people that their money will not be there when they go to the bank tomorrow.  That is crucial.  Much of my testimony has been about how, in God's name, did we let it get to that situation.  Once one is in that situation, however, one has to ask whether one knows the facts and, if one does not, whether one should take the risk that not knowing the facts might imperil the banking system.  There is absolutely no way one can do that.  It is in black and white in all my writing that the guarantee needed to be temporary in order to give us time to get into the banks to investigate the situation.</p></speech>

The phrase "let us say" is hardly a scientific formula.  I told the then Minister that the period had to be sufficiently long to assuage the fears of Irish depositors but sufficiently short not to encompass everything.  </p>  <p>         I said to the Minister it has to be sufficiently long to assuage the fears of Irish depositors but sufficiently short not to encompass everything.

On 28 September you said the only option is to guarantee 100% of all depositors, creditors in the banking system.  After the guarantee on 1 October you described it as a masterstroke, a practical blueprint for the new financial architecture that will emerge from this global crisis but 18 days later you were critical of the Government&rsquo;s approach.  Why?  What changed in the interim given that at that stage PwC was already in the banks assessing the balance sheets of the loan books?  What did not happen in that 18 days that you believe should have happened?</p></speech>

If the objective was to stop a bank run and that was achieved, that was a very important achievement.  Had it not been done and had the Government gone down the road of allowing banks to go bust where would that have left us?  That is a risk I do not believe any government can take.</p>  <p>  The second idea is that the bank run had been stopped and the Government was beginning to take its own hands off its throat and breathe again to the extent that it had some calm.  PwC was in the banking system.  I do not think it is speaking out of school to say its report was not really worth much.  It said the banks were quite okay.</p></speech>

Brian Lenihan told me he liked speaking to me sometimes because I spoke English not economics and &ldquo;economicese&rdquo;.  I told him to regard it as being like writing an insurance policy.  If one writes an insurance policy for a young fellow to drive there will be small print to the effect that if he is drunk or taking drugs, etc., the policy is null and void.  I told him to put in conditions to protect himself because we were still buying time.  Everything was calm, amazingly, given what had gone before.</p></speech>

There had to be negotiations with the ECB to say the Government needed emergency liquidity.  It then began to emerge that the black hole in Anglo Irish Bank was enormous.</p></speech>

In the article of 21 September he wrote about guaranteeing deposits and made reference to a complete blanket guarantee for two years.  Then on 28 September his article appears to be almost a carbon copy of the actual guarantee that was announced a few days later.  When did Mr. McWilliams write that article of the 28 September?</p></speech>

I was one individual writing from my desk about what I saw going on.  I have to be very clear about this.  There were dozens of paid advisers deep in the system writing reports and advising.  What struck me as interesting was that despite having dozens of advisers they missed the whole thing.  I was writing on my own, as I had been since 2000, about what I felt was going on in the economy, and I still write on my own about what I think goes on in the economy.</p></speech>

Mr. McWilliams always articulated in the past that bondholders in a free market are risky capital.  The blanket guarantee that was put in place guaranteed risky capital and subordinated debt.  He articulated this in his article of the 28th of September and in his book at page 22, where, speaking to the Minister, he said, "However, I argued because the Irish banks funding has become so unstable, if we did not guarantee the funding as well as deposits the banks would come crashing down."  That is at variance with his previous articulation.  Did the blanket guarantee cover bondholders?</p></speech>

I will tell him how.  He is talking about the difference between a panic in a financial market and a period of calm.  The whole point of a temporary guarantee is to make sure that everything is calmed right down by doing what has to be done, because the banks are going to go to wall, for no other reason than the fact that people will take their money out.  That is the first thing.</p>  <p>    The second thing is that during the period of calm when the liquidity issue has been addressed the Government must establish what is in the best interests of the State.  Is it in the best interest of this State to pay out into perpetuity every single creditor of insolvent banks or is it in the best interests of this State to do what I said, which is to introduce a temporary guarantee and then move against the creditors?</p></speech>

The Irish guarantee is the third shortest.  Can I explain that to the Deputy again?  It is the third shortest.  So it is as close to the minimum that has ever been given in the OECD and that involves Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, Germany, Honduras, Iceland, Ireland, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Sweden, Thailand, and Turkey.  That is the first thing.<br/><br/>The second thing is what happened to our relationship.  Nothing.  Brian Lenihan and I always got on quite well.  What happened was I kept saying to him:</p><blockquote>Make it conditional.  Make it conditional.  Don't be open ended.  Make it conditional.  You are in the driving seat now.  You own them.  You are the boss.  Make it conditional so that we are not in a situation where we end up paying off risk capital.  You have to stop the crisis, which is absolutely essential.  Once you have done that you are in the driving seat.  You do what you want.</blockquote>  <p>That was what the opportunity was.  We could have done what we wanted.

We have that period of calm.  Thereafter I suspect that there was almost a sort of a banking <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i>in policy.  It seemed to me that the interests, not so much of the banks but the bank owners, the creditors, were being elevated, and I had been told that the ECB had said that no bank can go under.

I wrote at the time that if that was the ECB's directive, it should pay for the consequences of this policy.  If one thinks about it, in the case of a bank going under, only four groups or institutions can pay for it: the taxpayers of Ireland, the taxpayers of Europe, the ECB itself, by injecting a promissory note-type instrument, or the creditors.  We had the choice and we did not seem to negotiate.  I have no idea why.  I think this is the European element, which I am sure the committee is coming up to, as to what the ECB involvement in all this was.</p></speech>

I have always said that I felt incredibly sorry for Brian Lenihan the individual, because I felt that here was a good man in the middle of an enormous financial storm, having been put into the job in recent months.  He was really trying to get on top of things and he was really open.  That was the interesting thing.  He never closed himself off.  He was always saying, "That could work, that might work".  How did I feel?  I felt that if something was not done in order for him to appraise himself of the facts, we would have a monumental crisis.</p></speech>

When one goes to find out what is going on, one needs facts.  One needs the hard numbers.  Is it 1 million or 10 million?  The impression I got was that he and the people around him - the paid advisers and all these people - were not in possession of the facts at all.  Therefore, they could not do anything permanent.  They had to do something temporary because they had to calm it down in order to find the facts.  As a former investigative journalist, Senator O'Keeffe knows that one needs to dig.</p></speech>

This is an important distinction.  At a time of crisis, there is a massive move for institutional self-preservation.  It is a general rule.  It is human nature.

I did not know John Gormley particularly well.  The thought that went through my mind at one stage was, "Why didn't they ring their own bloody advisors?  Why are they ringing me?"  I never got paid a cent for all this.  If I had actually billed out all this, I would be a reasonably wealthy man.  John Gormley called me and asked what I thought.  I told him I was in Tianjin, which is a city in China that I had never heard of, but Senator D'Arcy said it has 11 million people in it.  There was a sense of "I think this is happening, I'm not too sure".  What struck me was why they had to telephone a bloke in China to find out what was going on right under their noses.</p></speech>

They had been told prior to that that the Irish economic boom was based on fundamentals and that was wrong too.

I was making a Galway tent connection between a political party and a very significant industry.  I do not think that anybody will refute the fact that proximity of a political party - or of many political parties - to certain parts of industry probably means they are going to be treated differently.  This is not exclusive to Fianna F&aacute;il.

In particular, a firm&rsquo;s access to political elites grows with its interconnectedness, geographic footprint, and the number of employees and creditors that can be persuaded to contribute on its behalf to re-election campaigns.</blockquote>  <p>He was making a statement about the American situation.</p></speech>

The committee has one of the very few guys, namely, me, who spent nearly ten years issuing warnings about all of this, including the nexus between bankers and developers and how this was sucking away the resources of the country.  Although I made all of those connections, my major concern, as an economist and a commentator, lay in the fact that if one sees all that stuff emerging, it only reinforces the need to have really strong, independent regulation.  People do what people do and this constantly underscores the need for strong, independent, highly vigilant regulators.  The most important point about regulation is that one can have the best regulation in the world but if one does not police it, it is not worth the paper on which it is written.  </p>  <p>         As such it is better to have fewer points of regulation which are well policed rather than to have pages and pages of unpoliced regulations.  What the Deputy has painted is a picture which underscores absolutely the need for strong, independent, unimpaired, almost loner-type figures.  There is no problem with being a loner and not having a gang to hang out with in order to police what the Deputy speaks of.</p></speech>

I would have thought - and I said it in all my writings - that the normal rules of corporate finance should apply in the case of insolvency.  Therefore, the guarantee would have been rescinded as the liquidity problem was already plugged.  Then one would have lined up all the creditors in a room and had a bank resolution mechanism as that is the system whereby we as a society deal with bad banks.  At the very top, one would have what I call "trust creditors".  They are creditors in trust, which is to say depositors.  When my mum goes to put her savings into the bank, she does not realise that technically she is lending money to the bank.  In her head, it is a nest egg, something for grandchildren and what she has put away for a rainy day.  She does not have any realisation that technically in the event of a bankruptcy, she is a lender.  Therefore, my solution, as I wrote at the time, was that as simple depositors trust the system, they should be regarded as trust creditors and encircled.  Under that, one then has the normal hierarchy of creditors which everybody understands.  It happens every single day in this country in receiverships.  That is the system we could still have.  That answers the Deputy's question.  If there were massive insolvencies, they would have been dealt with in the normal way.</p></speech>

In his writings, Mr. McWilliams makes implications around some of the resolution measures that followed the guarantee, for example the design of NAMA.</p></speech>

Over the years, the Swedes seem to be very good at public administration.  What they did was to write down their loans incredibly quickly, which had the effect of allowing the banks that were good to begin to lend again very quickly.  This materialised rapidly in the significant growth of the Swedish economy in the 18 months after their banking crisis.  My feeling was and to a degree still is that the NAMA process was so slow in writing down and it never freed up the banks that had got the stuff off their balance sheets to begin the process of lending.  We remained in what Keynes would have described in a traditional liquidity trap for a long time.  Irrespective of how low the interest rate was, people had too much existing debt and did not want to borrow any more while the banks had too much bad debt and did not want to lend.</p></speech>

My final question relates to an article I have just found from the <i>Irish Examiner</i>on Monday, 2 November 2009, which was written by Se&aacute;n Connolly, the political correspondent.  The article was on a war of words that erupted between Mr. McWilliams and the late Minister, Brian Lenihan.  It was a year and a bit after the guarantee.  I refer to a specific quote from the late Brian Lenihan who said, &quot;He contacted me through my brother, Conor, and said he wanted to meet me and I happened to be meeting another friend in that part of the city that evening who lived further up the road&quot;.  That is a direct contradiction of the outline of the initial contact Mr. McWilliams had.</p></speech>

Brian Lenihan scribbled down a number to me.  I went to look for it that night.  I looked for it but could not find it.  I had his brother's number because I had been the breakfast presenter at Newstalk and the brother had been a regular on the show.  I telephoned the brother and said "Listen, your brother gave me his number.  I have not got it.  Can you give it to me?" and he said "Yes".</p></speech>

I want to take Mr. McWilliams through 28 January 2008.  His former employer, UBS, had issued a recommendation at that time.  It issued a sell recommendation on AIB and Anglo Irish Bank as a result of mounting fears that they might suffer a rise in bad debts due to their exposure to falling commercial property markets.  UBS estimated a 30% possible decrease with rents remaining the same.</p></speech>

Ian Keogh reported on 24 February that within two hours of this call being made, 34% of the value of the Irish banks was stripped away.  Mr. McWilliams said that this was obvious to anyone who was trained.  What information did UBS have to be able to make such a strong recommendation on AIB and Anglo Irish Bank that the Department of Finance, the Regulator, the Governor or politicians could not see?</p></speech>

A bank like UBS will have a bank analyst whose job is to look at banks all the time.  The analyst would have been able to see the complexion of the loans given out by the Irish banks; how much was for tracker mortgages and how much was for commercial property, etc.  </p>  <p>         The person at UBS was doing what I had been doing for years previously, namely, trying to value the commercial property for which these banks were lending enormous amounts of money.  One values such an asset by estimating the stream of income that will come from it and multiplying it by a multiple.  UBS probably saw that the stream of income coming from Irish commercial property was falling because much of it was empty, similar to the ghost estate situation.  UBS was saying if the stream of income from the commercial property goes to zero, the loan goes bad immediately.  The only way the loan can be made good is if one continues to lend money against it, which is what happened in Ireland.  This is the type of analysis UBS would have come up with and it would have said a chunk of the balance sheet could go bust.  UBS would have asked what the share price of the company was and realised it was very high.  Given UBS was not being paid to take such a risk, it would sell it.</p></speech>

In a newspaper article of 28 September 2008, entitled State guarantees can avert depression, Mr. McWilliams discussed the costs of various options that could be taken regarding nationalising banks and stated:</p><blockquote>There is another reason for not nationalising, and it is taxpayers' money.  Once you start using taxpayers' money, you have to be careful.  The lesson from the US in the past week is that using taxpayers' money is unsuccessful and deeply unfair.  The beauty of guaranteeing deposits is that you use no money &ndash; not a penny.</blockquote>  <p>With the benefit of hindsight, do you believe these comments underestimated the potential cost of the State guarantee?</p></speech>

At the time, the options before the State were to incur many billions of euro of costs immediately with the notion of crystallising losses.  The article explicitly said it would not cost a penny at that moment.  The idea was to buy time by doing it temporarily.  No banking crisis can be dealt with without cost.  At the time, major discussions were taking place about budget deficits-----</p></speech>

Before joining NUI Galway in 1995, he held posts at the Institute of Industry Studies at Cornell University, Canisius College, Buffalo, and Dublin City University.  He has published numerous books and academic articles, was on the editorial board of the Review of Radical Political Economics and is currently on the editorial board of the International Journal of Pluralism and Economics Education.  His current interests include globalisation, American and Irish economic history, political economy, the history of economic thought, and economics education for labour and community groups.</p><p>Before we begin, I advise Professor McDonough that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and, as they were previously informed, the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Professor McDonough to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Along with the rest of the nation, I am looking forward to learning about many of the specific events and decisions leading up to the Irish banking crisis.  In contrast, however, I will concentrate on addressing today's brief, which concerns the international, European and Irish policy context of the banking crisis.  In doing so, I will be presenting a macroeconomic analysis of the overall crisis which still faces the world's peoples today, at least seven years after its inauguration.<br/><br/>It is important to understand that the situation affecting Ireland at the time of the banking guarantee cannot be characterised only as a financial crisis.  Instead, Ireland at this time was caught up in a perfect storm, one whose great winds have periodically abated only to blow up again.  It is popular in some quarters to refer to Ireland's crisis as homegrown, and it is certainly true that one storm front blew up within the borders of Ireland.  However, 2008 saw the tragic convergence of this front with two other influences, one the global storm of the international crisis of global neoliberalism.  This blew Ireland against the other influence, namely, the unforgiving shores of the euro system.  We do not have to go all the way back to the proverbial butterfly flapping its wings to find the origins of this maelstrom.  The global crisis, the European crisis and the Irish crisis all find their origins in the same basic institutions of the age.  All are rooted in the four institutions of globalisation, neoliberalism, repression of labour and financialisation.<br/><br/>What are these institutions?  Globalisation<i></i>is the disintegration of production processes into their component parts and the location of each of these components in that area of the world most congenial to making profits.  The production process is then reintegrated through free trade across borders.  This process brings employers and workers face to face across the globe.  Neoliberalism<i></i>is a complex phenomenon.  It can perhaps be most succinctly described as market fundamentalism, a belief that important social decisions about production and income distribution are almost always and everywhere best left to be determined in markets.  This idea manifests itself in institutions like the World Trade Organisation, policies like deregulation and privatisation and ideologies like free market economics.  The repression of labour<i></i>involves the erosion of the power of labour to defend its organisations, working conditions and standard of living.  It is most dramatically evidenced in the decline in union density.  Financialisation<i>, </i>according to the American economist Jerry Epstein, &quot;refers to the increasing importance of financial markets, financial motives, financial institutions, and financial elites in the operation of the economy and its governing institutions, both at the national and international level&quot;.<br/><br/>All these institutions date from the early 1980s.  Their beginnings are marked by the political victories of Ronald Reagan in the United States and Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom.  These new institutions can be collectively labelled the era of global neoliberalism.  This new stage of capitalism at first led to recovery.  In the 1970s, capitalism was in a period which has come to be known as the Great Stagflation, a condition of simultaneous high unemployment and high inflation which was unpredicted by the Keynesian economics of the time.  Together, globalisation, financialisation, neoliberalism and the loss of labour influence led to a period known in some quarters as the Great Moderation.  Profit rates, which had been falling from the late 1960s, bottomed out in the early 1980s and over time returned to their previous levels.  Growth recovered, although it did not reach the standards of the earlier post-Second World War period.  Employment rose and inflation fell and remained low.<br/><br/>However, this economic recovery is only one side of the story.  The same set of institutions which led to the global neoliberal recovery from stagflation would eventually create the most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression.  Problems became evident almost immediately.  Globalisation led to the unification of previously separate national markets for goods and services.  Competition within this new larger market led to the emergence of excess capacity in many industries.  Labour's loss of bargaining power led to the stagnation of real median family income in the United States.  This wage stagnation occurred despite the continual increase in the productive capacity of labour.  These two factors, excess capacity and stagnant wages, led to a rate of investment which, while positive, was relatively sluggish by historical standards.  This relatively sluggish investment was accompanied by restored profitability.  If the restored profits were not being invested in productive plant and equipment, where could they go?  Financialisation made it increasingly easy to fund the purchase of various categories of assets, driving up their prices and creating capital gains, which could only encourage further speculation in asset prices.  Borrowing on the basis of rising asset prices temporarily sustained demand in the face of sluggish investment and stagnant wages.  When the asset bubble burst, however, the full force of listless investment and low wages was felt in the emergence of what was, in Keynesian terms, a crisis of inadequate demand.  For the ordinary household, it was a crisis of unemployment.<br/><br/>That is the global context and, naturally, we are much more concerned with the specific situation of Ireland.  </p>  <p>         A close look at the origins of the Celtic tiger, however, reveals that it was a creature of these same four institutions of global neoliberalism, namely, globalisation, neoliberalism, the repression of labour and financialisation.  As is often the case in Ireland, we had to wait a few years for the advent of global neoliberalism - Irish style.  For Ireland, the key date is 1987.  A neoliberal approach to government in Ireland began when a minority Fianna F&aacute;il Government came to power in 1987.  Minority status led to seeking a consensus economic strategy which could attract the support of other parties.  It was supported by Fine Gael&rsquo;s adoption of the Tallaght strategy under the leadership of Alan Dukes.  Two years later the neoliberal Progressive Democrats entered coalition with Fianna F&aacute;il.  O&rsquo;Riain and O&rsquo;Connell summarise the turnaround in public spending:</p><blockquote>Restoring order to the public finances was achieved by severe cutbacks in public expenditure in 1987-1990.  Total current spending fell by over ten percentage points in real terms between 1987 and 1989.  Total current spending fell from 57% of gross national product in 1985 to 42% in 1990.</blockquote> <p>The fall in expenditure created room for tax cuts.  The top rate of income tax fell from 60% to 48% over five years.  Basic corporate income tax rates also fell.<br/><br/>In addition to embarking on a new macroeconomic strategy, the new Fianna F&aacute;il Government also convened the first of a series of tripartite industrial negotiations leading to a national partnership agreement, the Programme for National Recovery, PNR.  For the unions&rsquo; part, they could sense a rightward shift in the political system and feared the Government might be capable of importing the Thatcherite strategy of a massive attack on the unions aimed at negating their economic, social and political influence.  The PNR established a neoliberal pattern of achieving wage moderation through the promise of future tax cuts.  Frank Barry calculates these tax cuts accounted for about one third of the increases in take-home pay to 2004.  Such moderation under social partnership led to a falling wage share.  The wage share was 71 % of gross domestic product in 1986 and fell to 54% in 2001.  Days lost through industrial disputes dropped off drastically beginning in 1987.  Accordingly, the repression of labour in Ireland led not to wage stagnation, as in the United States, but to wage moderation under social partnership.<br/><br/>The social partnership process was careful not to jeopardise Ireland&rsquo;s traditional internationalisation strategy.  Teague and Donaghey conclude that social partnership operated &ldquo;hand-in-glove with the wider policy of economic openness&rdquo;.  The Single European Act came into effect in 1987 and was approved by referendum in the same year.  The implementation of the Single Market coincides with a boom in foreign employment in Ireland, with such jobs growing by 50% between 1987 and 2000.  The Single European Act was accompanied by plans to expand Structural Funds spending.  Structural Funds were doubled in 1988 and again in 1993.  A new Industrial Development Agency, IDA, strategic plan was unveiled in 1983.  The new strategy would concentrate on technologically advanced firms with high potential for market growth.  These developments copperfastened globalisation as an essential element of Ireland&rsquo;s growth strategy.<br/><br/>The year 1987 also saw the investment hunting capacity of the IDA applied in a new realm.  It was decided by the incoming Government to target investment in international financial services through the establishment of the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC.  By 1999, attracted by light touch regulation, 66% of all FDI, foreign direct investment, inflows were accounted for by the IFSC.  It was the source of 24% of all services exports.  The IFSC would be an important conduit for foreign capital flows and was central to Ireland&rsquo;s participation in transnational financialisation.<br/><br/>Irish participation in the global neoliberal social order was no longer in doubt and this institutional framework underpinned the advent of the famous Celtic tiger.  Of course, the tiger is also now infamous because, as was the case at the global level, the elements of global neoliberalism would not only set the conditions for Ireland&rsquo;s rise but also its spectacular fall from grace.  Under Ireland&rsquo;s peculiar labour institutions, wages rose but the level of inequality rose much faster.  The fear of Thatcherism had fed into the formation of social partnership.  As noted before, wage moderation was traded for tax cuts.  This tendency was strongly reinforced by the perceived need to compete globally through low taxes and a neoliberal policy preference for minimising the capacity of the State.<br/><br/>The economic momentum of the Celtic tiger eventually fed into blowing up the real estate market.  Financialisation provided the wind beneath the wings of the Irish asset bubble.  Rising levels of inequality created an aspiration for levels of consumption which for many could not be supported from current income.  Rising house prices provided an expensive asset of expanding value for those in the housing market and collateral for borrowing by those who already owned their own homes.  Household debt rose from less than 120% of disposable income in 2003 to 220% in 2009.  The bubble in the property market provided an alternative source of government income through stamp duty and construction-related VAT, compensating to some extent for the overall low tax regime.<br/><br/>Ireland was now poised for crisis.  We had a property bubble which could be traced back to financialisation.  We had high levels of household debt which could be traced to the property bubble and rising inequality.  We had a low tax regime which could be traced back to the repression of labour, globalisation and neoliberalism.  The property bubble burst in 2007, endangering the banking system.  The global crisis hit in 2008, intensifying Irish problems.  The collapse of banking, construction and the tax regime produced a fiscal crisis.  The financial crisis, the fiscal crisis and unsustainable household debt then created an unemployment crisis.  It was at this point that the global storm front and the Irish turbulence combined ran up against the sea cliffs of the inflexible euro system.  This euro system was also rooted in global neoliberalism, a global neoliberalism - euro style.  The drive for globalisation led to the Single European Market.  Globalisation linked with financialisation to create the euro currency.  The Single European Market and the euro led to trade surpluses in some countries that were recycled into blowing up asset bubbles and trade deficits in other countries which weakened their fiscal positions.  Financialisation, linked with a strong dose of neoliberal ideology, led to a fiercely independent European Central Bank aggressively limiting its responsibility to inflation control.  Neoliberal ideas of small government and limited intervention in private markets, with the declining influence of labour, led to a monetary union without any fiscal capacity to address problems through increased government spending at European level.  Together the Single European Market, the euro, the European Central Bank and limited fiscal capacity can be said to constitute the euro system.<br/><br/>When the turbulence hit, the euro system made sure Ireland could find no haven through devaluing its currency, conducting an independent monetary policy or receive help through fiscal stimulus.  The euro rules have forced Ireland to cut spending and raise taxes in the teeth of a depression.  Instead of a port in the storm, the backwash from the euro cliff intensified the maelstrom.  On 29 September 2008, in the dead of night, Ireland desperately tried to signal for help, but the cannon broke loose and holed the ship of State below the waterline.<br/><br/>How could this catastrophe have been avoided?  The only path was to have seen the storm coming and been prepared for it.  This is not a question, as some have recommended, of hiring more economists in the Department of Finance.  In fact, professional politicians and professional economists in the lead up to these events all saw the world in much the same way.  </p>  <p>         To avoid the storm, both would have had to see the world differently.  I have lived for 20 years in Galway.  It is said of the weather in Galway that it is either raining or about to rain.  Similarly, in the mainstream economic view, the economy is either calm or rapidly becoming calmer.  This theory may barely pass muster in good times, but to prepare for a storm you have to see the economy as potentially tempestuous and riven with conflict and contradictions.  A view of the capitalist economy which ignores its historical dynamics, which sees it as a haven of harmonious give and take, a peaceful equilibrium of supply and demand, which works best when interfered with least, will inevitably lead to foundering on hidden shoals amidst unexpected turbulence.  This is where Ireland still finds itself today. </p></speech>

In your opening statement you make strong reference to a neoliberal policy programme that has been in place since 1987 up to the present.  Can you define what you mean by neoliberalism?</p></speech>

The first point is the relatively low level that public expenditure takes up in relation to Irish GDP.  This is somewhere around 30%, whereas the EU average would be around 40%.  This has been consistent throughout this entire period.  It is similar to the situation of the tax take, which came down subsequent to 1987 and has not come back much.</p>  <p>  The question of openness and free trade and the strategy of internationalisation and running export surpluses would be very consistent across all the governments, in this case since 1957, certainly from 1987 to the present.  We have also engaged in very light touch regulation which has persisted since 1987 and the foundation of the Irish Financial Services Centre, IFSC.  While these policies might not have been defended enthusiastically by any given Administration they have remained constant.</p></speech>

It is relative to the levels of expenditure which would have been achieved under other policy regimes.  While those levels of expenditure are substantial and not negligible they would be smaller than those of our European partners.  They compare favourably with those in the United States and Britain but those countries would be examples of heavily neoliberal influenced regimes.</p></speech>

He states:</p><blockquote>The global crisis, the European crisis, and the Irish crisis all find their origins in the same basic institutions of the age.  All are rooted in the four institutions of globalisation, neoliberalism, repression of labour, and yes, financialisation.</blockquote>  <p>Which of these does he believe was the most important in causing the Irish banking crisis?</p></speech>

The linking of Ireland to the global financial markets was extraordinarily strong.  There was quite a bit of money available which consequently was brought into the country and transferred to domestic activity.  The low level of regulation and the high level of openness to financial movements would probably be where I would lay the most emphasis.  This is also closely related to the whole goal of globalisation and the establishment of the IFSC was part of our globalisation strategy.</p></speech>

The tax levels were not high enough to cover the expenditure.  Previous to 1987 the Irish regime was a more typically Keynesian one rather than a neoliberal one.  That would be true across the board in North America and Europe as well.</p></speech>

It argues that markets consistently use the maximum amount of the best information to come to valuations which reflect the best information at the time.  This could therefore always be trusted to form the basis of further action.  Governments could not really compete with markets in gathering this information and felt themselves to be at a disadvantage.  Governments felt the best thing to do was reinforce wherever the markets were going.</p> <p> When the banks came to the Government and explained they did not have a solvency crisis but simply a temporary liquidity crisis which could be addressed through a guarantee to get over the hump, I believe the Government can be partially forgiven for believing this.  Not because it was correct, clearly it was not, but that was the conventional wisdom of the time.  The conventional wisdom of the time led us to the depressed situation still facing us today.  The conventional wisdom of the time needs not to be reinstated but broken with. </p></speech>

This is one of the larger points I want to make in the context of this hearing today.  While there is much emphasis placed on the financial troubles that faced Ireland, Europe and the larger global capitalist system, this should not blind us to the fact that there were other deeply rooted institutional factors.  These factors contributed to the inauguration of the crisis in 2008, but also seriously contributed to the failure to address that crisis in subsequent years.  These factors particularly relate to stagnant wages; the falling power of labour to defend its working conditions; low levels of investment closely related to high levels of excess capacity associated with globalisation on international markets; the inability of governments at local Irish level, at larger European level and at the global level to find a way to intervene to compensate for the financial chaos we faced; very low levels of private investment and the increasing inability of the ordinary person to prop up consumption in the economy because of falling wages and falling standards of living.</p>  <p>  The crisis is broad but at the same time much deeper.  It goes to the basic institutions of the era in which my students have grown up, which began  in 1987 in the international context and in subsequent years in the Irish context.</p></speech>

The Irish context did not experience wage stagnation to the same degree, in fact Irish wages and income probably doubled in the period between 1987 and 2005.</p></speech>

These are probably often dropped out of explicit consideration because interest rates in the European single currency market are determined by European policy.  The interest rates were probably much more suited to Germany which was trying to come to terms with the reunification with East Germany and the economic problems created by that.  The rates were certainly inappropriate to an Irish economy facing in to a serious housing bubble.</p></speech>

I believe both are true.  On the one hand we had a set of social partnership agreements which were trading wage moderation for cuts in income tax.  I believe that resulted, along with our internationalisation strategy, in tax rates which were lower than they should have been.  They were certainly lower than comparable continental countries.  The Government was also making up for these low income tax rates by taxing the property bubble in various ways.  Taxing a property bubble is a way of narrowing the tax base because a property bubble cannot continue forever.</p></speech>

He says that the tax base was reduced from 60% to 48% and subsequently the marginal rate is now 40%.  Does he think we should go back to the 60% rate?

In <i>The Irish Times</i>this morning, Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance Minister, makes reference to Beckett's play, &quot;Happy Days&quot;.  If the question is posed on whether we wanted a derelict dockland or an Irish financial services centre one can certainly see the argument for establishing the IFSC.  </p>  <p>         The point I keep coming back to is that all of these things have their impact and work their impact out in a dynamic way over the course of time and that things which are initially positive in their impact can ultimately contribute to very serious negative outcomes as that dynamic works itself out.  </p> <p> The establishment of economic activity in the Dublin docklands was a very good thing.  The total lack of regulation of that economic activity, especially in light of its financial character, turned out to be not such a good thing and the impact of that on the remaining portion of that neighbourhood in the docklands now is substantially negative.</p> <p> As regards the tax question, I think that we can do with higher tax rates on upper income levels; we can do with taxing wealth in addition to income; we can do with a policy which raises the incomes of people at the lower end of the economic scale and which then provides an opportunity to increase taxation there as well.</p> <p> I am not a supporter of this process whereby more and more people are taken completely out of the tax net and are then no longer seen as contributing to the collective services which the society should be providing, primarily for people at the lower end of the scale.  I think we need to collect more taxes in general.</p></speech>

In general, I would have been quite sympathetic to a process of political unification across Europe but I would have always been supportive of basing that process of political unification, at the very minimum, on traditional European social democratic values.  I think that in the current period, especially in terms of the negotiations which have taken place between the Greek Government and the European Union institutions over the past two weeks, a line has been drawn under the traditional social Europe model.  What has developed in the era of monetary union is very difficult to defend not only philosophically, but also economically.</p>  <p>  Basically taking exchange rate policy out of the hands of local governments has proven to be extraordinarily damaging.  The separation of local governments from the ability to conduct their own monitoring policy has been extraordinarily damaging.  Setting governments in competition with one another within the EU around the questions of tax policy and expenditure, without creating a more federal capacity to spend and address problems when they arise, has been extraordinarily problematic.  I think a militantly independent central bank, insulated from democratic control, is not defensible.  </p>  <p>  Beyond that, the European Union has unfortunately participated in a general tendency to separate economic decision-making from democratic and representative bodies and rest that decision-making in what were initially faceless bureaucracies but they have now, more or less, acquired a bit of a face.  We can now talk about these personalities.  People know who Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble and Mario Draghi are but that is problematic in itself.  These people should not be as important as they are and I think that calls, as Michael Noonan would have said, the practice of the European-----</p></speech>

Ireland was very much in crisis in 1980, in 1985 and in the late 1970s.  I would not put the Irish crisis in the 1980s as the model for dealing with the Irish crisis in the 2000s.</p></speech>

As primarily an economic historian, my work has been involved with observing that the resolution to one crisis is often, as history unfolds, the basis for the outbreak of the next.  That is very much what happened in Ireland.  We resolved the 1980s crisis in a certain way and the way in which we resolved it formed the basis for continuing social change and continuing social struggle.  The upshot of those very institutions which resolved the crisis was ultimately, many years later, to set the stage for the crisis we face today.  That is one of the contradictions of history.</p></speech>

I am curious as to how he can reconcile that with his criticism of the social partnership agreements, which, many would argue, gave the labour movement far greater power and greater influence in the running of the country.  Can Professor McDonough reconcile those two points?</p></speech>

I suppose what we could do is contrast it, on the one hand, with the fact that Irish wages did not stagnate in the same way that they did in the United States.  On the other hand, if one looks at labour's share of national income, labour's share of national income around 1980 was about 71%, that is, of everything produced in Ireland, 71% of it went to the working class or those represented by the labour movement.  By 2002, that figure was down to around 45%.  While labour succeeded in preventing an outright stagnation of wages, labour's relative weight in the economy, especially in terms of its income, declined quite drastically.  If one looks at labour density, that is, what percentage of the workforce is represented by unions, that dropped rather precipitously.  It has been halved, essentially, over the course of social partnership.</p></speech>

On the 29th of September, 2008, in the dead of night, Ireland desperately tried to signal for help, but the canon broke loose and holed the ship of state below the waterline.</blockquote>  <p>Can he elaborate on what he means by &quot;Ireland desperately tried to signal for help&quot;?</p></speech>

The metaphor is appropriate in that the bank guarantee was intended to be a signal to the private financial markets that they could safely continue to invest in, lend to and capitalise the Irish banking system.  In that sense, basically, it was a call for private financial help.</p></speech>

If one were to go back to some earlier testimony, that of Professor John FitzGerald from the ESRI and Dr. Donal Donovan from the IMF, one would discover that it was not the lack of economists in the IMF which caused the failure to call the crisis in a sense in that there is no shortage of economists in the ESRI-----</p></speech>

I refer to the staff who were there all the time in the Department of Finance.

My contention is simply that the economics profession, as it is currently constituted, works with models of the economy which are closed, that is, they assume a closed system.  It is a bit like pouring water into a bowl.  What happens to the water in the bowl?  It reaches its own level and is, thereafter, calm.  If one disturbs it, it returns to its previous level.  It is not a very good basis for talking about the real world, which is an open system in which water is subject to tides, wind, waves and, occasionally, the mother of all storms.  If that is one's model, one will not predict a storm.</p></speech>

I would certainly have prevented it from all flowing into the housing market and at the cost of having it flow elsewhere.  Certainly, high levels of capital inflow that would have been invested in increasing productive capacity in the Irish economy would have been more than welcome.  High levels of capital inflow, that perhaps flowed back out again and could be to some extent taxed along the way, would have been, maybe, not to the benefit of our trading partners but could have been to the benefit of the Irish Exchequer.  High levels of capital inflow which then flowed into simply increasing the price of assets, most prominently, commercial and residential property, were not constructive.  </p>  <p>         I think we confused rising asset prices with rising health in the economy.</p></speech>

I think the lesson of the banking crisis is that the private banking system cannot be trusted with all that money.  My view would be that the financial system, the banking system, should be primarily publicly owned.

Again I would emphasise that Irish wages did not stagnate like they did in the United States and to a certain extent in Britain.  The wage moderation in exchange for eroding the tax base was a poor decision and it was a poor decision which I believe was reached collectively.  There were tripartite negotiations between the representatives of the employers associations, the main union federations, and the Government.  I think the Government, the employers, and the unions all participated in that decision and I think we have come to regret it.</p></speech>

This is very much a trend internationally.  We have been moving further and further away from democratic influence on economic decisions.  The model, in a certain sense, is the independence of the American Federal Reserve.  The American Federal Reserve has a double mandate.  Its mandate is, on the one hand, to control inflation, but also to address the problems of unemployment when they arise.  Our central bank, which is the ECB, is not mandated to address the problem of low levels of economic activity throwing people out of work.  It is explicitly left out of its charter.   It is solely responsible for maintaining stable prices.  In that sense I think we have an ultra-monetarist central bank, much more monetarist than one would find in the United States.</p></speech>

I think that if we were to democratise economic decision-making at that level, that is at the high level of central banking, we would need to reform our democratic institutions all the way down to make sure that what we were seeing was the expression of popular will rather than the interference by politicians or vested interests.  That said, I think that the performance of the Central Bank in the absence of political supervision has been extraordinarily poor.  There has just been quantitative easing in Ireland seven years after it was first engaged in rather successfully by the Federal Reserve Bank in the United States.</p></speech>

He gives his definitions of those.  He also refers to falling profitability from the 1960s onwards as a feature of international capitalism at that time.  Were these institutions, globalisation, neoliberalism, financialisation and reduction of labour power, instruments that were coincidental at this time or were they designed to restore the profitability of capital internationally?</p></speech>

In general, these kinds of institutional transformation come from the conflicts and initiatives which break out in the context of the previous crisis.  In this case we are talking about the stagflationary crisis which we had here in Ireland in spades but which was also evident across the globe.  I think that in a certain sense, and this is not always the case historically, what has to happen for this kind of crisis to be temporarily resolved is either some kind of class compromise, which is how one might characterise the New Deal system after the Second World War in the United States, or there has to be a victory by one side or the other.  I think the era of global neoliberalism could be characterised as a victory for capital, as a victory for business, and as a restoration of the profit level on the back of the repression of the other major candidate for income in society.</p></speech>

Why were there such significant levels of financialisation and such massive funds sloshing around the financial markets rather than those funds going into productive investment, infrastructure and job creation in a context of mass unemployment in many parts of the world?</p></speech>

The other factors have to be taken into account precisely to explain why all of this money has flowed into finance, as opposed to its traditional destination as investments in productive capacity.  That is substantially due to the other problems that have been manifest in the global neoliberal era, including the stagnation of demand due to repression of wages.  If people cannot buy what is produced, there will not be investment in production.  If businesses are not interested in buying investment goods because of excess capacity in global markets, people are not going to produce these goods and what are they going to do instead?  They are going to funnel their money into financial instruments and to the extent that the money funnels into financial instruments, the prices rise and it looks like a good deal.  Of course, it is not sustainable.</p></speech>

Do financial markets operate as a socially progressive factor, a factor that enhances democracy, a kind of economic dictatorship or one, more or none of the above?  He described market fundamentalism as a belief that important social decisions about production and income distribution are almost always and everywhere left to be determined in the markets.  Was the bailout of banks and bondholders as seen in Ireland consistent with neoliberalism and, if not, why not?</p></speech>

The decision was made that bondholders were not going to pay and that governments would pay.  Ultimately, the taxpayers paid and, as the Deputy pointed out, the majority of taxpayers are ordinary working men and women.  The decision on who was going to pay came down on one side of the question or the other.</p>  <p>  In regard to the dominance of financial markets, it is true that if one has a capitalist economy one has to start with money.  Capitalist profit making starts and ends with money.  One starts with a certain amount of money and ends up with more money.  The real question is where that additional money comes from.  Financial institutions provide the starting money.  The problem arises when the financial sector of the economy becomes so large that it interferes with the provision of resources for the real economy.  I would not characterise it as a dictatorship of the financial sector.  If we were to go back to the last financially dominated post-Second World War social order, we would find that different elite interests exercised influence in the political arena.</p></speech>

In my work I have identified what I think is a useful characterisation of the long-term dynamics, which is that we have periods of relative calm and relatively successful capitalist growth, during which recessions are shallow and the expansions are long, but we also have periods of capitalist crisis.  We can find the periodic arrival of these crises in the revolutions of 1848, the long depression of the late 19th century, the great depression of the 1930s, the great stagflation of the 1970s and, now, the great recession of the early 21st century.</p></speech>

I want to dig deeper into Professor McDonough's comments about the threat of Thatcherism being introduced in Ireland.

I think I was teaching economics in Buffalo, New York.  I remember, quite vividly, some friends of mine in an industrial union trying to leaflet a windscreen wiper plant in the city which was threatened with being moved to Mexico at the time of the maquiladora investment programme.  As they tried to hand out leaflets people ran from them as they did not want to be seen accepting the leaflets, believing they would be the ones to be laid off when the plant moved most of its operations to Mexico.  In this period there was a sharp decrease in the bargaining power of labour and that was expressed in the policy which the Thatcher Administration pursued.  This policy was watched extraordinarily closely here and there would have been a dereliction of duty had it not been.</p></speech>

I am a little hesitant to bring it up lest I be accused of, to use an American term, "Monday morning quarterbacking".  I suppose the closest Irish phrase is "hurling on the ditch".  The Government should have nationalised the good part of the banks and left the bad part of the banks in private hands.  It should have taken over the deposits, which are not assets but liabilities.  It should have taken a corresponding amount of assets, which would have included the buildings, office, equipment and general management structure of the banks, and left the bad loans to be worked out in a very capitalist and very private way.</p></speech>

He had said in a 2004 paper that, while policy making during a crisis may be of the seat-of-the-pants variety, the policy itself is informed by a political and economic struggle over who pays for the losses.  What is Professor McDonough's opinion of that statement?  Does he agree or disagree with his assessment of crisis policy making as a political and economic struggle?</p></speech>

The question facing policy makers here, working in the context of the European Union and other global institutions, is basically one of who is going to pay for the crisis.  The banking solution which I just proposed is simply one in which bondholders and lenders should have paid.  To the extent that they were not going to pay, the question should have been transferred to the people who had the money.  The people who had the money is the European Central Bank.</p></speech>

This strategy had been seen to be successful and it was the basis on which policy makers were thinking about economic policy in the future.  It was transferred directly to the financial sector with the push for the IFSC and then people asked what they could do to attract investment into this sector of the global economy in Ireland.  The basic thing to do was to offer them a free hand and that is what I think was done.</p></speech>

High levels of inequality and debt persist.  We have been very slow to take aggressive actions to reduce debt levels.  In this morning's newspaper the EU is reported as raising the issue, although it is somewhat ironic in that some of the debt is due to EU policy.  We have moved from a low-tax regime and have not been able to restore productive investment, rather than financial activity, in the Irish economy.</p></speech>

Clearly, there was a misunderstanding, and we need to ask why.  It goes to the basic world view shared by economists, Irish policy makers and many political parties and other influential people, that the world is such that markets are efficient.  The world is not that place.</p></speech>

In terms of addressing this economic situation, I would examine the origins of the problem and the solution that might be achievable.  In the short to medium term, we would need to replace stagnant wages with rising wages, sluggish private investment with increased public investment, a hollowed out neoliberal State with a more active State, and unregulated private finance with public banking.  The euro without a transfer union needs to be a euro with a transfer union or we need to find a way of mutually exiting this particular straitjacket.

Something similar would have had positive effects on the banking crisis.  The banking crisis was not felt uniformly across the world.  The South American nations with strong capital controls were relatively unscathed.  Nations with strong banking regulation, like Canada, experienced less of a problem.  Therefore, I think something like this would have been better than what we had.  If, for instance, we had a much larger public banking sector - as they have in North Dakota, for example, strangely enough - we would have been able to weather this a good deal better.</p></speech>

In practical terms, how could the Government of the time and the Central Bank have done that?  What impact would higher taxes have on employment growth?</p></speech>

We have forgotten that in the post-Second World War period, almost all countries had rather tight restrictions on capital flow.  This was one of the bases for the rapid growth in standards of living.  Controlling capital flows is not inconsistent with economic growth.  Regarding the impact of higher taxation on employment, it is not so much the level of taxation as the level of organisation, innovation, participation and democratic commitment to the productive activities in society that determine the level of employment growth.  Higher wages would lead to higher demand and more employment.</p></speech>

That is, we needed a wage-led regime.  It would have been better.  Public sector wages establish a benchmark, although I hesitate to use that word, for the private sector.  I do not think we should be benchmarking the public sector on the private sector, but we should be benchmarking the private sector on the traditional labour protections that public sector unions have been able to achieve for their members.</p></speech>

It was not with this committee, but with the social protection committee.  One of them was Professor John FitzGerald and the other was Dr. D&oacute;nal de Buitl&eacute;ir.  Professor FitzGerald said, "The overall impact of Government policy on expenditure and taxation of successive Governments has had a progressive impact."  Dr. D&oacute;nal de Buitl&eacute;ir stated, "The fact is that we have the most progressive tax and transfer system in the OECD both absolutely and proportionately."  Would Professor McDonough have a view on those two statements?</p></speech>

The use of the description is restricted in its geographical application and the purpose for which it can be used.  Use of the description is restricted to outside the State and for the following purposes: to market programmes of education and training provided by the authorised provider or research services of the authorised provider; and to enter into an arrangement with any person outside the State for the purpose of participating in a collaborative project relating to the provision of programmes of education, training or research services.</p><p>Section 3 provides for the review of the authorisation for use of the description by the Higher Education Authority, HEA, while section 4 provides for the withdrawal of the authorisation by the Minister on the grounds that it is not being used for its specified purposes or that the provider no longer fulfils the qualifying criteria for the application.  Section 5 provides for an appeals board to hear appeals relating to the Minister's decision to refuse a grant of authorisation or to withdraw an authorisation.</p><p>Following on from the discussion in the Seanad, amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, are being introduced to allow the Minister, when granting a university authorisation, to impose such additional conditions on the provider concerned as the Minister believes appropriate.  The provider will be required to comply with these conditions, although amendment No. 3 provides that the provider can appeal against the imposition of these conditions to the appeals board provided for under section 5.  Amendment No. 4 provides that a review carried out by an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s under section 3 of the Bill will include a review of the provider's compliance with any condition imposed by the Minister and provides that the Minister can direct a provider to comply with the conditions imposed by him or her.  Therefore, the amendments will allow the Minister to put in place additional safeguards to ensure any provider that receives university authorisation is operating to the highest standards.  We are honouring the commitment we gave during the debate in the Seanad to do this.</p></speech>

We drafted legislation on voluntary contributions.  Due to the rule on incurring costs to the Exchequer, we were, unfortunately, unable to publish it.  We have taken this opportunity to try to get the issue on the agenda.</p><p>I am sure that the Minister of State is well aware that the issue of voluntary contributions is financially off-putting for many parents.  They find it difficult to match voluntary contributions.  By their nature, the contributions are meant to be voluntary, but the reality is that the impression given by schools is that there is an onus on parents to pay them.  There are no accounting procedures for schools that take voluntary contributions.  Some schools in my constituency have 500 pupils, all of whose parents pay in excess of &euro;100, but no one knows whether the money is being used to pay bills, buy equipment or so on.  My amendments are meant to give some structure to the situation.  I know that the Minister of State will not accept them, but the Government must examine the issue.  If schools are taking voluntary contributions, it is important that the parents paying them have some idea what the money is being used for.</p></speech>

I understand what the Deputy is trying to achieve with his amendments, but we have concerns about how they would operate administratively as drafted.  With 4,000 schools in the system, a centralised analysis of the accounts of each school could become a large administrative burden for everyone involved.</p> <p>  While I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 5 and 6, I assure the Deputies that information for parents, including on the collection and use of voluntary contributions, is an issue that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, will examine in the context of the Department's work on developing plans for a parents and students charter.  The way the amendments are worded means that they would not be workable.  The aim in developing the charter is to strengthen the position of parents generally within our school system.  The charter is the appropriate place for such issues to be addressed rather than seeking to amend the Education Acts through this Bill.</p> <p>  In addition, the Deputies may be aware that the Government gave approval last March to the drafting of the education (admission to school) Bill.  The Bill is at an advanced stage of drafting and will be before the House shortly.  The aim in introducing proposals on school admissions is to improve admission policies and to ensure that the way schools decide on applications is structured, fair and transparent.  It is a concern that fees might be a factor in this regard.  The proposed legislation would prohibit the charging of any fee or contribution as part of a school's admissions process, which should go some way towards alleviating the Deputy's concerns.  Other issues will be dealt with in the charter.</p></speech>

When drafting legislation to give some structure to the situation, having it ruled out of order because it would be a cost to the Exchequer is frustrating.  By their nature, voluntary contributions are essential for many schools if they are to keep operating, given the cuts in capitation grants and elsewhere.  Many schools are struggling to meet their targets and balance the books.  However, there is significant pressure on parents to try to match those voluntary contributions.  In some schools I know, one has no access to a locker if a voluntary contribution is not paid.  I am sure this is replicated in many other schools outside my constituency.  While the contributions may be voluntary in theory, in practice many schools give the impression that they must be paid if a student is to receive the same level of service that others receive.  It is frustrating that we do not know how much schools are taking in in voluntary contributions or how that money is being spent.  There is no record-keeping in that regard.  I am sure that the money is somewhere in the overall financial records, but if parents are being asked to pay voluntary contributions towards the running of a school, safeguards need to be put in place in order that they can be assured that their contributions are being used for what they were intended.</p></speech>

She has also discussed it with the Deputy.  She wants to work on it and to bring more communication, engagement and transparency to it in order that everyone is treated fairly.  There will be opportunities to deal with this important issue in the charter and the upcoming Bill, and the Minister wants to stress that she is prepared to work with the Deputy on it.</p> <p>  Regarding the overall issue of funding for schools, most people will understand that budgets across the board have come through difficult times.  As people return to work and more taxes are collected, I hope that we will have an opportunity to address the budgetary concerns in education.  Given the demographics, just standing still has been a major task.  This alone was an achievement in light of the mess the public finances were in.  Those finances are improving bit by bit, giving us an opportunity to address these issues.  The pressures on parents at all levels of education is well recognised by the Minister and me.  We will try to address those as the country recovers.</p></speech>

It relates to the evidence of estrangement needed to access Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants.  SUSI has done a great deal of work since its first year when it took over the processing of grants.  To be honest, that was a disaster.  Our committee discussed the Accenture report yesterday.  Many improvements have been made, but estrangement is probably the most common issue in respect of which people visit our offices.  It is difficult for students to prove that they are estranged from their parents.  The level of documentation required by SUSI goes above and beyond what many students are able to provide adequately.  We know of cases in which students who have proof from the Department of Social Protection that they are in receipt of payments at addresses that are not their parents' are still being asked for further information.  It seems that there is only a limited number of documents that SUSI will accept.  The amendment tries to expand the options available to students to prove that they are estranged by including information that is provided by advocacy workers, student unions, general practitioners and welfare officers.</p></speech>

We have discussed this issue in the D&aacute;il a couple of times during Question Time and so on.  The amendment relates mainly to cases in which students may need to be assessed independently of their parents' income.  The Minister has spoken on this issue once or twice and I have taken a debate on it on her behalf.  She has stated that she is taking a strong interest in examining this matter.</p><p>The Deputy stated that he has encountered quite a number of genuine cases of estrangement, but they are relatively rare.  Although they have a significant impact on individual students, each student has unique circumstances.  In that context and having carefully considered the amendment, I do not propose to accept it for a number of reasons.</p><p>Subsections 16(3)(<i>a</i>) to (<i>g</i>), inclusive, of the Student Support Act 2011 provide for the Minister to specify a class of applicant or criterion that may be considered in determining whether an applicant is a student of a particular class.  For example, the student grant scheme under SI 201 of 2014 provides in Article 21(3) for a dependent student to be exempted from having parents' income taken into account where it is established to the satisfaction of the relevant awarding authority that he or she is irreconcilably estranged from both parents and neither parent furnishes financial support to him or her.</p><p>I accept that the Deputy is concerned about satisfying the grant awarding authority in terms of the documents needed, but we do not need amending legislation to address that issue.  It can be addressed by the Minister, who has said previously that she will look at it to see if further clarification is needed.  We do not need to do it by way of the amendment proposed.  </p><p> This provision allows the awarding authority to assess dependent students in genuine estrangement cases without reference to income or the address of their parents or guardians.  The provisions, as they stand, in the Student Support Act 2011 are sufficient to allow latitude in specifying additional classes of applicant and the criteria to be applied for such applicants, having regard to the resources available and subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance.  </p><p> The Minister for Education and Skills has said previously that she will look at this issue again and will work with the Deputy on it, but she does not believe an amendment is needed.  In effect, the proposed amendment would replicate a provision in section 16(3) of the Student Support Act 2011.  The option is already provided for in legislation.  It is up to the Deputy to decide what to do with his amendment, but we can address the issue without it.</p></speech>

With all due respect, while the Minister may have discretion to specify the criteria to be applied, she has failed to do so to date.  The criteria are very strict.  I do not accept the Minister of State's view that the amendment is unnecessary.  It would specify the criteria and list the groups or bodies which could provide independent verification of estrangement.  We consider the Minister has no intention of listing such bodies or expanding the criteria.  SUSI looks for evidence from a social worker employed by the HSE, but many students will not have access to a social worker and have no need for such.  If we have a situation where evidence from the Department of Social Protection does not satisfy SUSI on the issue of estrangement, we have a problem.  The Minister has failed to address this issue, which is why I will press the amendment.</p></speech>

The Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron has promised a referendum on this question if he is returned to power following a general election.  The committee decided to examine this issue now in view of the potential impact on this country and on the many Irish citizens living in the United Kingdom.  Our discussion will focus on the Lisbon treaty protocols and the future of Irish opt-outs in the context of a UK exit from the EU and also on criminal justice issues such as EU policing and judicial co-operation.  Today we will hear from Professor Imelda Maher and Mr. Eugene Regan, SC.  I welcome both expert witnesses.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I invite Professor Maher to address the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-26a.1253" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Imelda Maher" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015022600002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for affording me the opportunity to speak today.  I have been asked to speak about EU treaty protocols.  I sent the briefing notes to the clerk of the committee just before lunch.<br/><br/>I will briefly outline the most relevant protocols in respect of the relationship between Ireland and the UK.  The reason for doing this in the context of a discussion of BrExit is that they are primarily concerned with control of migration and borders.  Should the United Kingdom chose to leave the EU, the Northern Irish Border would become significant for the EU as it would become an external EU border.  This would then raise considerable challenges for the open borders policy between the United Kingdom and Ireland as articulated in the common travel area.  There are three protocols of note and another I will mention in passing.<br/><br/>First, Protocol 19 relates to the Schengen <i>acquis. </i>Schengen is an international convention designed to remove internal borders and establish a common external frontier.  This means it also establishes common visa, asylum and immigration policies.  Implementing measures known as the Schengen <i>acquis </i>were adopted on these policies and these were incorporated into the EU treaties and into EU law by the Amsterdam treaty, which is now part of EU law.  There are special rules for Ireland and the UK in regard to Schengen as the only two member states that have not signed the convention.  Others such as Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania have signed but are not fully incorporated into it.  The relationship between the UK and Ireland and the Schengen provisions is addressed mainly in Protocol 19.<br/><br/>Ireland and the United Kingdom - throughout my address I will refer to Ireland but members should read it as Ireland and the United Kingdom - may at any time request to take part in some or all of the Schengen <i>acquis.</i>The Council of Ministers decide on this request on the basis of unanimity of the Schengen member states and the requesting state.  The significance of this provision is that Ireland can only participate if the other member states agree to it unanimously.<br/><br/>Where Ireland has opted in to part of the Schengen <i>acquis</i>and a new proposal in that field is introduced, Ireland can give notice to the Council of Ministers that it will opt out but can withdraw that notice at any time up to the adoption of the measure.  This opt-out is tempered by a set of procedures in Article 5 described as &quot;fiendish&quot; by Stephen Peers, a leading authority in the field.  The purpose of the procedures is to protect the coherence of the Schengen <i>acquis. </i>The risk for Ireland is that the underlying Schengen <i>acquis</i>could be dis-applied to it and Ireland would have to bear any direct financial consequences of this should the decision be that Ireland's opt-out from the amending measure would cause too much incoherence for the system.  Should Ireland chose to opt from an amending measure, having opted into it, the stakes are very high. <br/><br/>Protocol 20 recognises the special travel arrangements in place between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  It first recognises that the UK can continue to exercise border controls and then that the United Kingdom and Ireland can have special arrangements for the movement of people between them.  As long as this common travel area exists, then according to the protocol Ireland can also have border controls.<br/><br/>There are two consequences to note from this.  First, as Protocol 20 states, the other member states can impose border checks on people coming from Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Members no doubt have experienced this when they travelled to the Schengen area.  Second, the exemption for Ireland to impose border controls only applies as long as the UK and Ireland maintain their common travel area.  This is important should the UK exit the EU.<br/><br/>Protocol 21, a protocol on freedom, security and justice, provides an opt-in for the UK and Ireland in regard to measures adopted under an EU court's rulings on Title V Part III of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, that is the measures adopted in regard to the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice, AFSJ, dealing with border checks, asylum, immigration, judicial co-operation in civil and criminal matters and police co-operation.  This is different from the Schengen Protocol, as the UK and Ireland have a right to opt-in.<br/><br/>Ireland notifies the President of the Council of Ministers in writing within three months of a proposal going to Council that it wants to take part.  Its participation cannot be vetoed.  Even if Ireland does not participate in the measure, it can subsequently opt-in with the Commission outlining to the Council what arrangements are necessary for Ireland to comply with the measure.  Note, a measure can be adopted after a reasonable time without Ireland or the UK, even if they have notified of their wish to opt in, if in practical terms it is not possible to adopt the measure with them taking part.<br/><br/>Where the UK or Ireland opt-out of a measure, then the Council holds a full discussion of the possible effects of such non-participation.  Any member state can ask the Commission to examine the situation on the basis of Article 116 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Under this provision if the Commission thinks a member state's laws, administrative practices or procedures are distorting competition in the internal market and that distortion needs to be eliminated then the Commission consults the member state.  If the consultation does not work, then directives or any other appropriate measures can be adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure.</p><p>What this means is that an opt-out decision, in what I believe would be fairly exceptional circumstances, may lead to legislation being adopted if the decision is deemed to distort competition in the internal market.  The reason for this opt-out for Ireland seems to have been driven by concerns about the integrity of the common law system and differences with the civil law traditions dominant in other member states and by the fact the UK was going to opt out.<br/><br/>In declaration 56, Ireland affirms its commitment to the AFSJ and indicates it will participate to the maximum extent.  Ireland can, at any time, notify the Council in writing that it no longer wishes to be covered by this protocol, and if it does so then the normal treaty provisions apply.  This protocol is not applicable to Ireland in regard to Article 75 on the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which sets down rules on freezing funds and financial assets in order to combat and prevent terrorism.<br/><br/>What is the relationship between these protocols?  The question of whether a measure is part of Schengen or the AFSJ is significant because, if the Schengen agreement applies, Ireland does not have a right to opt in, which it does have in regard to the AFSJ.  There is a substantive overlap, however, between the Schengen <i>acquis</i>and Title V, Part III, and this has been litigated before the European Court of Justice, by the UK in particular.  An example is case C-137/05 on Frontex.<br/><br/>If a measure is covered by the Schengen <i>acquis</i>, then it is governed by the Schengen protocol.  What has happened is that the court has interpreted this relatively broadly to include complementary measures, that is, any measure that &ldquo;builds on&rdquo; the <i>acquis</i>.  The term &ldquo;builds on&rdquo; is one that would give a lawyer nightmares because it is very fuzzy.  It means the precise nature of the relationship between the two protocols is not entirely clear.<br/><br/>Let us consider the UK opt-out protocol in passing.  Under Protocol 36, governing transitional provisions, the UK had the choice to opt out of pre-Treaty of Lisbon measures on police and judicial co-operation within five years.  As members are probably well aware, it did so and now has opted back in to a large number of measures, the most important of which for Ireland is the European arrest warrant.  Ireland did not have this opt-out in the treaty.<br/><br/>The next topic is Ireland and the protocols.  Laffan and O'Mahony suggest that Ireland and the UK have opted into measures on civil co-operation, asylum and irregular migration but to a limited extent on visas, border controls and legal migration.  They participate in almost all criminal and policing provisions of Schengen and in respect of irregular migration.  I have three thoughts on this.  First, as the common travel area is significant for relations between the UK and Ireland, it might be worth considering what Mr. Justice Hogan had to say about it in Pachero<i>v</i>. the Minister for Justice and Equality in 2011.  At one point, he referred to the &ldquo;legal archaeology&rdquo; required to get to the bottom of the common travel area:</p><blockquote>While in theory both Irish and British citizens are entitled to arrive here free from immigration control by virtue of the common travel area, increasingly in practice such passengers who arrive by air from the UK are required to produce their passports (or, at least, some other form of acceptable identity document) in order to prove to immigration officers that they are either Irish or British citizens who can avail of the common travel area. Whatever about anyone else, Joseph Heller [who, as members know, wrote <i>Catch-22</i>] certainly would have approved.</blockquote><p>This suggests greater clarity on the common travel area would be desirable.<br/><br/>Second, if the UK exits the EU, regard has to be given to a three-way dynamic: the relationship between Ireland and the EU, the relationship between Ireland and the UK, and the relationship between the UK and the EU.  It might be useful in this regard to consider the analogy, albeit imperfect, of the Nordic Passport Union and the Nordic Police Cooperation Agreement, whereby free movement is ensured for Norway and Iceland with the other Nordic countries although they are not in the EU.  However, they are in Schengen, which the UK is unlikely to join in an EU exit scenario.<br/><br/>Third, these two comments suggest a mini-Schengen may be the best way forward for the UK and Ireland should the UK leave the EU.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-26a.1256" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eugene Regan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015022600002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman.  It is very nice to be at the meeting.  It is much more comfortable sitting on the other side of the room, but here goes.<br/><br/>I have been asked to address the issue of the co-operation in policing and criminal matters in the context of a UK withdrawal from the EU and the consequences it might have for this area.  I do not believe the UK will withdraw from the EU.  Recent experience in this very area of policing and criminal law matters might serve as a guide to how the debate on UK withdrawal will crystallise.  The reality is that there was a furore in the UK regarding the European arrest warrant, other matters concerning policing and EU criminal law matters.  It centred on the European arrest warrant and the frailties in the framework decision adopted in 2002.  There was criticism of other aspects of that area.  When the UK Government chose to exercise the blackout option, provided in the Lisbon treaty and to which Professor Maher has referred, and thus withdrew from approximately 130 measures, it recognised the reality of the matter and the importance of the measures to policing and internal security in the UK.  It chose to opt back in to 35 of the key measures.  This demonstrates that, notwithstanding the reservations in the UK about the EU, it has the capacity and pragmatism to recognise that it is in its own interest to work within the EU framework.<br/><br/>Let me give a little historical background on the policing and criminal law area.  Historically, Ireland and the UK were on opposing sides.  The great debates of the early years of membership were mainly on the Common Agricultural Policy and disputes about green pounds and devaluations.  However, in the area of policing and criminal law matters, the two countries followed the same path, as we did in regard to asylum and immigration.  There is no area in which the two countries have co-operated as closely as in this area.  This co-operation dates back to 1972, the year of the Munich Olympics outrage.  The TREVI group was formed, and the UK and Ireland were involved in that when it was set up at the European Council meeting in Rome in 1975.  The European arrest warrant was introduced after the events of 11 September 2001.  The British Home Secretary suggested the idea of mutual recognition.<br/><br/>The UK contribution in this area has been very important.  We have worked alongside the UK because of the common law tradition and concerns about how development in this area would affect the common law system.  Bearing in mind the process involving the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Lisbon treaties, one notes it is only at the time of the production of the Lisbon treaty that this area was brought into the first pillar of the EU and made subject to the full involvement of all the institutions, that is, the Commission proposing legislation, parliamentary co-decision and, of course, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.  There was a delay in respect of the latter.  It was five years after the introduction of the Lisbon treaty that the European Court of Justice was to have full jurisdiction in this area.  Hence the move to qualified majority voting and the European Court of Justice jurisdiction.  This is why the UK chose to extend the Protocol 21 opt-out to the criminal law area.  Ireland followed suit.  Members will remember there was a debate in the Seanad and D&aacute;il on this when Ireland decided to follow the UK on this.  It was opposed by the Opposition but there was a compromise, which was that the opt-out would be reviewed after five years.  That review has taken place.<br/><br/>The UK opt-out is entirely different, however.  Protocol 36, a decision to opt out <i>en bloc</i>from all new measures, was exercised by the UK Government in 2013.</p><p>That was announced by the UK Government on 24 July 2013.  At the same time, it identified a number of key measures it wished to opt back into.  That was adopted last November and passed by the House of Commons.  However, what is fundamentally important in this is the Irish influence in that debate and the fact that it was highlighted by the Irish Government that the consequences of the UK exercising this opt-out and not opting back into the European arrest warrant, in particular, and into other measures would create fundamental difficulties for co-operation between the two countries, not only in the area fighting crime but, especially, the area of terrorism and in the context of Northern Ireland.  That had a very persuasive effect in ensuring that the House of Commons voted through the measures to opt back into the 35 measures, including the European arrest warrant.<br/><br/>There has always been a concern in Ireland - Professor Imelda Maher identified it - in regard to our common law system and this is why Ireland chose to apply protocol 21 to policing and criminal matters.  The reality is that since that extension, Ireland has opted into the vast majority of measures.  In terms of those into which we have not opted, it is not for reasons that go to our criminal law system, or our particular common law system, but it has more to do with organisation and administration.  After five years, it has become apparent that protocol 21 is not really necessary in terms of protecting the features of our criminal law system, which were initially of concern.<br/><br/>When I say that the United Kingdom has recognised the importance of the measures in policing and criminal law, there was a House of Lords report on the issue of the opt-out in 2004.  Many representations were made to the House of Lords, in particular in regard to the European arrest warrant but also on the whole range of measures.  The conclusion of that report was that opting out of policing and criminal justice measures would have significant adverse negative repercussions for the internal security of, and the administration of criminal justice in, the UK.There was a recognition in the UK of the importance of these measures and of the <i>acquis</i>, as it were, in all of this, and that it was important to the UK itself.<br/><br/>Professor John Spencer, who is an expert in this whole area, considered that if the opt-out and opting back in were to go ahead, which is the case, that would essentially be a purely paper exercise.  He suggested the opt-out would make no difference whatsoever because the key measures were included in the measures to which the United Kingdom was opting back into.  After 40 years of progress and treaty changes, which reflect the common concerns of member states in the area of organised crime, terrorism and the importance, at a European level, of co-operation in the detection, investigation and prosecution of crime, the UK recognised that for it to exit out of these areas was a leap in the dark and was not in its interests.  <br/><br/>In the event of a UK exit, which is theoretical question, and whether it is a real question will depend on the May general election, a void will not be created.  The fact is that Article 50 of the Treaty of European Union provides specifically for a mechanism for withdrawal of any member state.  It specifically states that the Union shall  negotiate and conclude an agreement with that state, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal and taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the European Union.  In addition,  the treaty shall cease to apply to that state in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal, so even in the extreme situation of a withdrawal, it would have to be an orderly one.  The UK is bound by the treaties until such time as such an exit would happen and to enter into an agreement providing for that procedure for withdrawal.<br/><br/>If there was a UK withdrawal it would not just affect the criminal law areas but it would also affect the civil law area, in particular there are specific regulations, for example, on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.  There are also the European accounts preservation orders.  All of these are very important measures in the civil law field but they fall into this rubric and chapter in regard to criminal law.<br/><br/>If there was not an orderly withdrawal, the question of the arrangements would arise.  Would individual member states, like Ireland, have to enter into bilateral treaties with the UK?  One would have to have serious doubts that would be possible because the EU now has a competence in this area of policing and criminal law matters and I do not think member states would be at liberty to enter into bilateral arrangements.  It would be a recipe for disaster if there were no orderly procedures for an exit in that unlikely event.<br/><br/>Prime Minister David Cameron is reported recently as saying that people would rather have a choice between staying in a reformed Europe or getting out rather than the false choice of today which is to stay in Europe with which they are not satisfied or to leave.  The issue and the agenda is more reform and renegotiation of certain terms of the existing treaties.  In terms of terms of the criminal law area, even though the EU arrest warrant has been a topical political potato in the United Kingdom, it is more to do with immigration and welfare tourism.  That is where the focus of any re-negotiation seems to be moving.  <br/><br/>Ireland's position has been made clear by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach that Ireland's interests lie in the UK remaining within the EU.  In the area of policing and criminal law matters, as common law countries, there is no doubt about the common interest we have in shaping EU policies in this area and working within the framework which has been created by the EU over the past 40 years.<br/><br/>In terms of reform, the criticisms of the European arrest warrant by the UK and in the political debates which have occurred are not entirely unjustified.  It was an instrument adopted rather hurriedly after 9/11.  It is not perfect legislation and it has created considerable problems in terms of excessive usage and the protection of persons who are extradited.  Even though it has worked effectively and efficiently, there is scope for revising and improvement of that instrument.  Those types of reforms might resolve many of the issues that might arise, and have arisen, in regard to the issue of UK withdrawal from the EU.  <br/><br/>I will leave it at that.  I hope I have not exceeded my time.</p></speech>

If there were a vote in the morning in the UK, it might decide to leave the EU.  There will be a long debate on the matter and the UK will seek a very much reformed EU.  However, if the UK decided it was not happy with the package being offered, what would be the consequences from the point of view of the Six Counties and the complications that would arise regarding them?  It would be difficult for us to handle the issue.</p> <p>  Issues arise in the important and changing area of patents.  The view is that the unified patent court will be based in the UK.  How will it be dealt with?  There are advantages from Ireland's perspective to the patent court being based there.  If it goes ahead, and then the UK decides it does not like the package on offer, where would it leave us if we have established a structure for all of Europe in the UK?</p></speech>

It is almost a fog, an if-and-but situation being repeated constantly.  Although some people have told us there will definitely be a referendum, we do not know if there will be because the Prime Minister, David Cameron, must get an overall majority.  We have been examining whether it is possible.  The politicians in Northern Ireland will have a role, particularly the Unionists, given that Sinn F&eacute;in, as eurosceptics, will presumably opt out of the debate.  Maybe Sinn F&eacute;in might opt in, for the first time, in addressing a very serious issue in the European context.  There is also a potential role for Scotland.  It is very difficult to address the implications of England opting out of Europe.  Is it possible to bring the UK out of Europe?  What, precisely, are the reforms?</p> <p>  The process would take years.  First, Mr. Cameron would have to win an overall majority in the election, after which some sort of negotiations could start.  Presumably, it would take years for the British Parliament to debate the exact reforms they are seeking.  Then, there would be a long debate in Europe on whether or not it is possible.  If the EU concedes, the unravelling or opting out would take years.  I do not want to be disrespectful to anybody.  We have regular representation from the British Embassy at these meetings.  The British ambassador might convey to Mr. Cameron that the committee had deliberated on the issue and that speaker after speaker after speaker had pointed out that the negative effects for Great Britain and Ireland would be so damning that Mr. Cameron should review his position.</p> <p>  Situations have evolved recently.  Ireland was way ahead of the British when we extended employment rights to citizens of Romania and Bulgaria, and the British went ballistic about these so-called "welfare tourists".  We saw what happened at the airports when they were all coming for work.  The Irish Government has just created 70,000 new Irish from 160 countries in the world.  It is widely accepted internationally that immigrants are incredibly productive and involved in seeking employment and that they do not come to sponge on the welfare system.  Switzerland recently held a referendum on immigration and passed a law to restrict immigration using quotas.  Since then, they have realised it is not operable.  Would it be worth reminding the British of this?</p> <p>  The Acting Chairman mentioned the House of Lords, for which I have great respect, and this provoked me into thinking that it does an extremely good job of analysing the EU process.  Maybe, at the end of the whole set of debates, we should engage with the House of Lords on the issue.  Of all the intellectuals and business people who have come here to discuss this, not one has predicted a positive outcome from what the UK intends to do.  I would like us to compile all our documentation and go to the House of Lords and engage with them, or invite them here to engage with us.  We must engage with them in order to achieve clarity at the end of this debate.</p></speech>

The word "Schengen" is tossed around a lot, and although I thought I understood it, having listened to Professor Maher, I realise I do not.  Professor Maher said the Schengen accord removes internal borders and establishes a common external frontier and, thus, common visa, asylum and immigration policies.  The reason the UK would not consider entering Schengen was the immigration aspect of it.  Given that I am not an expert in European law, protocol 21 is new to me.  From both presentations, it appears that it covers many of the areas that Schengen covers.  Both Ireland and the UK have a right to opt into it and the UK has opted into a number of the areas.  Immigration remains the area that seems to cause the UK the most difficulty.  Am I correct?</p></speech>

It is complex from a legal perspective.  I have a nerdy question.  In the section of her paper on opting in or opting out, Professor Maher said, "The reason for this opt-out for Ireland seems to have been driven by concerns about the integrity of the common law system and differences with the civil law traditions dominant in other member states and by the fact the UK was going to opt out".  Anybody listening to this on television would wonder what Professor Maher meant by it.  Both witnesses mentioned the issue of civil and common law jurisdictions and suggested that, given that both Ireland and the UK are common law countries, we should remain together in a common law bloc.  Did I understand this correctly?  Could the witnesses be more specific on why is it important?  Mr. Regan made a point that any change to the existing system would have implications for commercial law.  This would not have occurred to me.  Could he expand on it?</p> <p>  My final question relates to the changing security situation that Europe is facing, particularly from Islamic State.</p><p>Is it possible that the greater security challenge we are facing will have an impact on how Britain treats the negotiations on the common travel area and border control issues?</p></speech>

What would such an agreement look like, and would it affect measures such as the joint visa arrangements agreed between Ireland and the UK in 2014 to allow visitors from long haul markets such as China and India to move freely between the two jurisdictions?  In David Cameron's speech in January 2013, he discussed the possibility of a new treaty for Europe.  What kind of treaty could that be, taking account of what the UK wants?</p> <p>  My final question is not linked to British exit from the EU but I would like to hear witnesses' opinions on it none the less.  Some time ago I read an article outlining the potential for a British exit from the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR.

In regard to protocols, the people who drew them up in the first place did not intend to make it easy to either exit from or opt into them.  Opting out after opting in is obviously a very complicated process.  The area of policing and criminal law is hugely complicated and it could waste a considerable amount of European time.</p> <p>  A new European structure will emerge in the event of an exit.  It could change irrevocably the entire European architecture, based as it is on provisions made in the past, the expectations at the foundation of the European Union and, in particular, the expectations of the founding fathers of the European Union.  It would virtually impossible to reconstruct Europe if one country were to opt out, possibly followed by other countries.</p> <p>  Several members referred to the existence of euroscepticism.  The committee is examining that issue separately to understand the real reasons for it, and not simply the reasons that happen to be convenient at any particular time.  It remains to be seen how that issue can be addressed but, like other issues, it will have huge implications for the European Union.</p> <p>  Taking into account the protocols and the issue of policing and criminal law, the creation of a new border in the event of the UK opting out will have serious implications for trade and travel.  It has been suggested that Ireland could also opt out.  I shudder to think of some of the ideas that have been put forward as reasonable.  They are not reasonable.  Sadly, this debate is taking place against the backdrop of a serious economic downturn across Europe.  The discussions that take place in that sort of environment are not necessarily the best in terms of long-term planning.  Europe has a tragic history in that regard and all of us should do what we can to avoid reaping that whirlwind.</p></speech>

On the question of the Six Counties and the implications of having a border with the free trade area, a British exit would require provision to be made for a common travel area, but it might be a difficult task to maintain it in that new context.  In regard to the unified patent court and where its institutions are to be located, the best answer is that the European police training college was supposed to be located in the United Kingdom but I understand that is no longer being proposed.  That may a fallout from the furore that has emerged in the area of justice, policing and criminal law.</p> <p>  In regard to Deputy Byrne's comments on the general election in the UK, of course it is a theoretical question, and the issue will only crystallise after the election.  There is also a Scottish dimension.  There might be another referendum in Scotland should the United Kingdom exit the EU.  There is no clear indication as to what the UK Government wants, but David Cameron has at times indicated that out of the four freedoms, he wants to make changes in regard to the free movement of labour and people.  Other countries have a problem with such changes because the relevant provisions were embedded in the European Union from its outset.  It is also important for Ireland and Irish people living in the UK that there be no impediment to free movement.  The focus has turned to the notion of welfare tourism and the benefits attributed to workers when they move between member states.  Angela Merkel indicated that she was open to considering measures in that regard.  This type of response may help to defuse many of the issues that have arisen.</p> <p>  Schengen is a tricky area.  It was Tony Blair who decided that the UK should be seen to be more positive towards Europe at a particular point in time and, while not opting into Schengen, the UK opted into the policing and criminal law provisions of Schengen.  We followed suit.  Schengen was brought into the European Union under the Maastricht treaty, but there remains a set of Schengen measures in criminal law and policing - please do not ask me to list them - which we have opted into without also opting into other normal post-Lisbon treaty measures on criminal law.  It is a very complex area.  We have opted into that aspect of the Schengen Agreement but not into the free movement aspects.</p> <p>  In regard to the impact of changing security provisions on the debate about co-operation on criminal law, we have seen that time and again.</p><p>The Olympic Games massacre gave rise to the setting up by the member states of the TREVI group, which attempted to exchange information and have countries work together in this area. The 9-11 attacks resulted in the adoption of the European Arrest Warrant.  The warrant worked effectively in the more recent London bombings to extradite the responsible parties from Italy, and they were convicted in the UK.  Those types of thing do change.  Denmark is looking at the exercise of a protocol similar to Ireland, and the recent terrorist acts in the country may have an impact on that.  That always has an impact.  The criminal justice area and the EAW are not the real concern about the Union in the UK.  Some changes are needed and those concerns could be assuaged.  Free movement, immigration and what is termed "welfare tourism" are the kernel of the concern.</p><p> There was a question about the European Court of Human Rights.  In many ways, the issues that have given rise to concerns and adverse political comment in respect of Europe have concerned ECHR judgments in Strasbourg rather than the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-26a.1270" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Imelda Maher" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015022600002#G00200"><p>I read something Professor David Phinnemore, professor of European politics at Queens University, Belfast, wrote in anticipation of such a question.  He points out that 25% of Northern Ireland's non-UK trade is with Ireland.  We have been talking a great deal about people, but the customs question is also important.  He also notes the dividend from the peace agreements.  A total of &euro;150 million in grants will be given to Northern Ireland by the EU between 2014 and 2020.  I suspect, given the Deputy's comment about how long all this will take, that this money will be spent before the UK has left the EU, but it is still a sizeable sum.  There is also the issue of cross-Border workers.  Many people move between North and South and there is significant commercial activity around the Border.  Professor Phinnemore's concern is that there is not enough discussion about the Northern Irish dimension in the Great Britain debate because it is so small relative to the rest of the UK.  Nonetheless, that raises issues, particularly in Ireland.</p> <p>  The other context that ties into that is the negotiations around TTIP and CETA.  The free trade agreements with the US and Canada need to be factored into the trade and commercial aspect of this debate.</p> <p>  There will be a referendum, but there are two kinds of referendum on Europe in the UK context.  One is the political promise by the current Prime Minister to hold a referendum should he be elected following the next election, and that is what is focusing the mind.  That is the Brexit dimension, with which we are concerned.  However, there is also the EU Act from 2011, which guarantees a referendum in the event of substantial treaty change in the Union.  Mr. Cameron has been doing his best to avoid getting embroiled with that legislation, but that avoidance can only last for so long.  That is not particular to the current government; it would have to be dealt with by any government.  At some point, the UK will have to bite the bullet on that.  That legislation is complicated, with lists of items that have to be included in order to decide, but it will trigger a referendum at some point.  I hope that is clear enough.</p> <p>  With regard to the patent court, location can shift.  I hope that is not complicated.  I had not realised they were going to be there.</p> <p>  We are cognisant of the idea of the weakening of relations across the UK and the disintegrating union after the Scottish referendum, and this needs to be factored in, especially if Scotland votes "Yes".  Professor Sionaidh Douglas-Scott, a Scottish national based in Oxford, has written about this and reflected on it considerably.  It might be necessary to talk to the Scots as well as to the House of Lords.</p> <p>  The Deputy's point about this taking years is important, and my advice to the committee would be not to let it take years and years.  Ireland has a particular voice to present in the EU context should the UK vote to exit and one of the statements Ireland will want to make is that Article 50 should not drag on, so that the exit takes too long, because it  will pay a higher price for a delay than any other country.  That is a fair comment to make in this context.</p></speech>

It is twofold.  One is to create a framework within which decisions can be prepared for.  If there is a referendum, we will all know that there will be one in due course.  There is a fog, but the committee is attempting even within this context to clarify what are the parameters of the fog and how far it spreads.  We can, therefore, put a framework around the questions we need to address.  Certain preparatory work can be put in place to address that.  The paradox for law is that the other thing it must provide is flexibility, because there has to be a sense in which the framework is sufficient to lay down parameters but not so rigid and tight that there cannot be flexibility to respond to the concerns around uncertainty that will emerge, and that we cannot predict.</p></speech>

I do not know what those implications are.  The Union cannot ignore a democratic vote.  I am not sure how it will play out domestically in the Swiss context.  One would hope that the UK will learn from this.  The relationship is complex.  One cannot operate exclusively within a domestic context because we are interdependent, and that has to be factored in.  One of the dilemmas in the debate in the UK is the inability to embrace that interdependency beyond the UK.</p> <p>  The question of common law and civil law is one of the first things a common law student learns.  What I hear in the Deputy's question in part is a question about whether we, as common lawyers, are being precious.  I have sympathy for that view but, on the other hand, a basic example of how they differ is that judges in many civil law countries are civil servants and, therefore, their entire status and their relationship with the state is different from what it is in the common law system, under which there is no question that they are in any way integrated into the administrative structures of the state in that way.  That is a fundamental distinction, and that is why, as I understand it, Ireland did not sign up for the European Investigation Order - because it would have allowed for direct contact between judges, which would not be appropriate at all and which would be incoherent in a common law system.  We should not overplay the card, as my colleague suggested, but, none the less, there are moments at which the differences are profound, and we need to be mindful of that.</p> <p>  I was asked what a mini Schengen agreement would look like.  The MOU on the visa that has come in is a big step towards that.</p><p>The common travel area had no law at all for a while.  Sometimes it is a good thing to have no law and one does not always have to have rules.  Helpful guidelines that allow for great flexibility can be perfectly satisfactory.  However, the moment comes when these things have to be reviewed and politics dictate a need for greater certainty.  In respect of the CTA, that moment has arrived.</p><p> The ECHR is mentioned in the Good Friday Agreement.  If the UK walks away from the ECHR there is a very serious problem to be addressed.</p></speech>

The Professor has just touched on the implications for the Good Friday Agreement and another question is on the possibility of dual citizenship<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>Northern Ireland.</p><p>A couple of other things come to mind.  I remember being in Brussels at a meeting just before the economic downturn really hit.  Many economic and legal experts were there and there were predictions of doom and gloom all around the place.  As a nation, we were being blamed for a lot of the woes that had befallen the entire EU, though there were other people who blamed the European Union for all the woes that had fallen on Ireland.  Some things do not change.  It was pointed out that the real problem was the inflexibility of the European Central Bank <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>exchange rates in a context where no country could devalue.  There was a theory that the euro was overvalued, which it probably was at the time, but it was also said that each member state had no control.  This was not true because they could have introduced currency controls at any time they wanted.  The theory opposing that was based on the belief that to do so in a particular way would cause an implosion but that did not happen.  We have currency controls now, as well as a reduction in the value of the euro so all those issues should appear resolved.  </p><p>The fundamental problem for the future of the EU is the degree to which individual member states seem to look at themselves and see that the Union is no longer in accord with their views and ambitions.  The question then arises as to whether their ambitions are in accord with the Union.  The conclusion they come to is that a loose economic arrangement is the ideal scenario for the future.  However, they forget that such a thing existed before the EU and it was deemed not to have worked.</p><p>No matter which way we look at this situation it is not a good place to be.  There are serious implications for Ireland, for Britain and for the EU.  It behoves all of us to apply ourselves to identify how the issues that are causing the concern can best be resolved.  The founding fathers of the EU had a different vision altogether and they were clear as to what they wanted.  They had history close to their elbow when they made their decisions and that was a very convincing factor for people at the time.  Perhaps Professor Maher would address that.</p></speech>

The EU is often compared to a bicycle as it has to keep going or it will fall over.  I dislike this analogy as it suggests it is more fragile than it really is.  The EU is a more robust organisation than it is given credit for.  That does not mean it cannot change and, as the Chairman has said, it has changed radically.</p> <p>  I note the Chairman's reference to the founding fathers.  They wanted a European political community but they failed to get it as they could not get it past the French.  Instead they ended up with the European Economic Community.  The EEC was a compromise at the time but we now see it as a success and often the compromises we have to make are an indicator of success, especially so in the context of so many member states having to work together.</p></speech>

I will not go into too much detail on this, but some examples include the admissibility of evidence; availability of bail, which is an important matter in connection with the European arrest warrant with the UK; and administrative penalties.  There is an administrative court system in many member states but we generally have criminal penalties instead of administrative penalties.  We also do not have prosecuting judges here.  All of these things were considered fundamental problems but the reality is that where we have not opted into a measure we are likely to opt into after the event.  Such problems can be resolved and the Commission has usually found a way to accommodate the common law system.  That is why I consider the opt-out is not really necessary.</p> <p>  Since our entry in 1973, Europe has displayed a remarkable ability to resolve what appear to be intractable problems.  The most obvious one recently, and I accept that it has not yet been fully resolved, is the euro crisis, where progress is being made.  There have been many debates in Europe on a lot of difficult issues but the outcomes have demonstrated that different interests can work together.  The cohesion of the European Union is remarkable and I suspect it will find an imaginative solution to the issue of the threatened UK withdrawal.  In my opinion, the matter will be resolved with a solution that stops short of the withdrawal of Britain from the European Union.</p></speech>

As we have done in the past, at the invitation of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, this committee held a meeting on rare diseases which was a good and successful venture.  We feel it is important that the committee marks national rare disease day with a meeting to discuss the subject.  Last year, the committee discussed the launch of the national rare disease plan for Ireland.  A year on, the committee wishes to take stock of progress made with the implementation of the national rare disease plan and to discuss the next steps to take with the key stakeholders that are responsible for its implementation.  </p><p>I welcome the following: Dr. John Devlin, chair of the national steering group on rare diseases; Mr. Liam McCormack, Department of Health; Ms Helen Byrne, assistant national director, acute hospital services, HSE; Dr. Colm Henry, national clinical adviser and group leader for acute hospitals, HSE; Mr. Tony Heffernan, founder of the Saoirse Foundation; Ms Avril Daly, chair, Genetic and Rare Disorders Organisation; Ms Eibhlin Mulroe, CEO, Irish Platform for Patients' Organisations, Science and Industry; and Dr. Avril Kennan, member of the rare diseases task force.  Apologies have been received from Mr. Philip Watt, CEO, Cystic Fibrosis Ireland, who has been a key player with us on this committee.  He was to attend today but unfortunately he cannot do so for personal reasons.  I am sure many of the speakers will cover the points that he might have wished to raise.  </p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If, however, they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Dr. Devlin to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

We have tried to keep these issues at the centre of our plan.</p> <p>  Ireland is no different from many other countries when it comes to rare diseases.  The original European Council Decision 2009/C15/02 on rare diseases recommended that countries like Ireland should develop national plans and estimated that there were between 5,000 and 8,000 rare diseases.  That meant there was often a limited number of patients with a specific disease and, probably more importantly, a scarcity of relevant knowledge and expertise.  We know that rare diseases, when added together are relatively common and affect between 6% and 8% of the population.  We also know that many of these conditions are complex, severe and debilitating.</p> <p>  In terms of developing a national plan, we held two national conferences as well as online public consultation to discuss what might feed into the development of a plan.  It proved helpful to us and highlighted issues we were not particularly aware of at the time.  For example, the role of carers who play a vital part in the overall care provided.  I thank the patient organisations for all of their help, not just in their contributions they made but also in helping us to plan these days and for the feedback they provided.</p> <p>  I am chair of the national steering group set up by the Department to develop the plan.  I wish to acknowledge the help and input from the patient groups that are members of the national steering group.  Many of them are here today and will talk later.  </p> <p>  The plan was published in July 2014 and we have made copies available for the joint committee.  The plan is meant to operate over five years and will define our priority actions.  In all, there are 48 recommendations and I shall outline some of them and the progress we are making to the committee.</p> <p>  The relevant areas include the identification of centres of expertise, access to medication and technology, research and access to clinical trials and the empowerment of patient organisations.  In European terms, Ireland is a relatively small country.  We have significant capacity and a good number of treatment reference centres.  We will also have to co-ordinate with other countries as there are up to 8,000 conditions of which many are very uncommon.  At EU level, work has started on developing European reference networks and countries like Ireland are playing a key role in this work already.  Countries will have to nominate their references centre which will form part of these ERNs.  If it is clinically needed, patient care could be shared across reference centres so patients or expertise may travel. </p> <p>  This work does not happen in a vacuum.  We need to develop care pathways, greater use of protocols, better access to new technologies and, most importantly and what the initiative will deliver, better outcomes for patients and families.  Access to clinical trials is also very important as is the need for a supportive environment for research and to promote clinical trials in Ireland.  Our report also acknowledges the key role of information and disease registers.</p> <p>  The plan has also recommended the development of a national office for rare diseases.  Its purpose would be to facilitate the co-ordination and timely access to centres of expertise for rare diseases, both nationally and internationally.  The office will also act as a national point of reference on services, diagnostics, care pathways and on information regarding rare diseases.  The HSE has commenced work on establishing the office.  Half-year funding for 2015 of &euro;100,000 with &euro;200,000, on a recurring basis in 2016, has been provided with a &euro;2,000 once-off start-up non-pay cost.  Staffing will include an information scientist, genetic counsellor and administrative support.</p> <p>  As the committee will know, the HSE has also established a national clinical programme for rare diseases.  The programme aims to improve and standardise patient care for individuals affected with rare diseases in Ireland, by increasing detection and prevention, facilitating early timely diagnosis, co-ordination of care and providing better information and support.</p> <p>  The report also acknowledges the key role of patient organisations and what we need to do more of to empower patients and their families.  As I said earlier, there is also a big EU dimension to this work.  Recently, the EU rare disease committee has been reconstituted.  It is setting new priorities for best practice guidelines, information, research and the establishment of the ERNs.  All of this has a bearing on Irish centres of expertise and we are happy to talk about this later.</p> <p>  We also have a good working relationship with our colleagues in Northern Ireland.  Prior to the publication of the plan, and subsequently, we have met our colleagues from Northern Ireland on a number of occasions, to discuss practical ways to provide  better care and the sharing of information and promotion of research.</p> <p>  The launch of the plan completes this stage of our work and the HSE is now working towards its implementation.  There is a lot more we need to do over the next five years.  We are happy to answer any questions the committee has on our work.</p></speech>

It a national charity which focuses on proactive advocacy, is an investor in Batten's disease and rare disease research and focuses on delivering positive practical supports for those affected by rare conditions.</p> <p>  The Saoirse Foundation is also actively involved in the development of Liam's Lodge which is a national respite and palliative care facility for children affected by rare, genetic and life limiting conditions.  In addition, the foundation provides specialised transportation services for children via its BUMBLEance service which provides an ambulance that has been specifically designed for children.  It is a service that is accessed weekly by children affected by rare and life limiting conditions.</p> <p>  During my time as the patient support and empowerment representative on the previous Minister for Health's national steering group for rare disease, I was also chairperson of the patient and support subgroup.  The subgroup worked with the additional steering group and task force members on the development of our first plan which was launched in July 2014.</p> <p>  Personally, my wife Mary and I know the full impact a rare disorder can have on a family.</p><p>As the parents of two children, Saoirse and Liam, both of whom were diagnosed with Batten disease, an ultra-rare genetic neurological condition, we know only too well the challenges of going through the system with a rare disorder in the family.  The costs to us, personally, have been immense and cannot be measured, as we laid Saoirse to rest in January 2011 at the age of five and our boy, Liam, joined his sister in May last year when he was also five.</p><p> The national rare disease plan for Ireland will only ever be as good as its implementation.  Each year, we celebrate international rare disease day on the last day of February, and this day should and will also need to focus on the community affected here in Ireland and in bringing more public and more state awareness on rare disease.  As has been mentioned, this affects between 6% and 8% of the population during their lifetime.  Such a significant number of the population has not received the appropriate acknowledgement and focused attention it deserves within the health service, social care and education systems of this country.  Individually each rare condition is, by definition, rare but, collectively, it is very common to have a rare condition.</p><p> As my colleagues from the rare disease task force will acknowledge, it is important to have a co-ordinated approach and strategy into developing research, technologies, therapies and collaboration for rare disorders.  However, we must not forget the practical elements which need to improve and support those living with the conditions right now.  Timely prevention and diagnosis of rare disorders is essential.  Without accurate diagnosis, appropriate screening programmes and targeting of diagnostic tests, patients and families cannot access effective treatment and therapy or manage the condition and symptoms appropriately.  That would give such people empowerment.</p><p> Even with the better-known conditions, there is a serious impact on the quality of life on the family unit, with increased stress, anxiety and financial burdens imposed just because a loved one has a rare disorder.  This has serious implications for a person's life expectancy and quality of life and often results in an inefficient use of HSE resources.  We need early diagnosis, with critical eyes from GPs and other care providers.  We also need awareness of guidelines with regard to genetic conditions; more genetic counselling; empathetic diagnosis and follow-on support for the family unit that is currently lacking; automatic provision of information on conditions and symptoms, with specific referrals for rare disease support groups if available; access to information about treatments, research, therapy and third-party support, which may include clinical trials; and acknowledgement of the patient&rsquo;s and carer&rsquo;s expertise, which deserves respect and recognition from professionals.</p><p> The psychological issues encountered by those with a rare disorder range from the need for early assessment or educational assessment, as well as psychological interventions at different points in life.  People and families with a rare condition can often feel isolated.  Mental health issues can arise, affecting the patient, the family and carers.  There are strong arguments to initiate an automatic procedure for access to a psychologist for the family and the person when a rare disorder is diagnosed.  More effective use of the Internet is required, with the development of a credible source of information specifically needed.  Online support groups or phone contacts can also be essential for those who experience social isolation due to lack of transport or carers, and for those who do not have a specific rare disorder support group.  Our research with Trinity College, Dublin, indicates that the Internet offers people with the same rare disorder, for which there may not be a representative patient organisation, the possibility of accessing credible information and in establishing online support networks.  However, this process needs to be managed correctly, with good oversight and governance.</p><p> Some ultra-rare conditions do not have access to any specialist centre or specific support group so the difficulties of lack of information, expertise and support are heightened.  Overall, there is a lack of support for rare disorder patients with their medical and non-medical issues.  Additionally, patient support services will need to have the ability to react urgently for some rare diseases, such as life-limiting, progressive degenerative and neurological conditions, which can cause drastic changes in the patient&rsquo;s well-being and care needs.  I witnessed this twice with my two children, and the system does not react fast enough.  Specialised social and support services for many sectors of society affected by more common health conditions have proven to be very successful and beneficial in improving the quality of life for those affected.  Within the rare disease community, the overall availability of such services is severely limited, with less than a handful of the more common rare conditions receiving a similar level service.  Cystic fibrosis is an example.</p><p> The national rare disease plan identifies the need for the development of specialised social support services on a national and community level for those affected by rare conditions, which includes patients, family members and carers.  However, the strategy on how to deliver these services is not known at present.  Residential respite care facilities are currently limited in capacity and under enormous pressure, and there is a significant urgency in invest in new strategically located infrastructure across Ireland to provide respite care, appropriate long-term care and, where necessary, palliative care services.  One of the most important and critical purposes of respite care services is to give family members time and temporary relief from the stress they experience while providing extra care for a family member affected by a rare disorder.</p><p> Therapeutic recreational programmes encourage social and personal development.  In some instances the combination of a number of therapeutic programmes with respite programmes can bring added benefit for the patient and the family.  Many rare disorders are life-limiting, as we have mentioned, and can lead to many young patients not making it to adulthood.  Approximately 80% of all rare disorders are of a genetic nature, with 60% of those affected by rare disorders having a significantly reduced life expectancy.  The majority of those affected by rare disorders are children, and 30% of children do not reach past the age of five years.  When palliative care services are required for children, it is already and emotional time for the family and carers alike, and additional support services should be provided during this time.  The development of procedures and policies, consistent with best practices, should be improved for children affected by rare disorders.  I urge the committee, the Government and the State agencies to support the development of new initiatives, such as our own Liam's Lodge facility in Kerry, which will serve Munster and the mid-west, and be a national centre for respite.</p><p> For those affected by rare disorders, particularly those who have the possibility of longer life, social integration, including educational development, should seamlessly integrate into the patient&rsquo;s daily life and support their psychological and educational development.  The systems must revolve around the patient and not the other way around.  Those diagnosed with a rare disorder, their parents, carers and relatives are very frequently left in difficult positions with regard to employment and financial security.  This is primarily down to no legal framework protecting the rights of those individuals to maintain employment or benefits due to delays in access or availability of services and support from the State.  Some social frameworks exist around educational and early intervention services but access to these services is severely limited for persons with rare disorders, and particularly within the educational system.  I acknowledge that this is outside the primary focus of this committee but it is members' responsibility and that of their colleagues that proactive steps are taken, as the correct result will have a positive impact on the health of the patients and family members.</p><p> The first national plan for rare disease for Ireland is an important step in the right direction.  The successful implementation of the plan will require a well-structured strategy and a set of integrated, comprehensive policy actions to be developed, so as to reach the objectives and 48 recommendations outlined.  It will also require a clear focus on best practice guidelines when considering clearly defined policies and protocols; a well-declared timeframe, with declared objectives and goals; new and effective changes to legislation; defined stakeholders and responsibilities; and constant monitoring and evaluation of the implementation process.  I suggest this should be supervised by an oversight committee.  There should also be allocation of appropriate instruments and resources; identification of opportunities and appropriate European or international partners in development, collaboration and co-operation with respect to cross-border responses to some rare disorders; and the creation of centres of expertise.</p><p> A clearly defined management of change process is highly recommended and thorough analysis is also required to identify present resources and existing shortfalls.  The services of the State should be benchmarked with our European counterparts.  It is also of the utmost importance to ensure that those rare disorder patients currently receiving care, services and support are provided for during the transition from where we are now to where we must be before the second plan is published in 2019.  As Dr. Devlin indicated, it is a five-year plan.  The stakeholders of the oversight committee must include the previous members of the steering group at a minimum.</p></speech>

I am also a person living with a rare form of sight loss.  Today I also represent the National Rare Disease Task Force.  This voluntary forum was formed in 2011 by patient groups to support their representatives on the steering group.  I will present to members the vision and underlying principles of The National Plan for Rare Diseases 2014-2018.</p><p> The recognition of the complexities of rare diseases, the provision of information to allow for developments in research leading to improved, efficient and prompt services and better outcomes for patients were critical areas of concern when we commenced our work on the steering group.  As we have heard earlier, there are over 6,000 rare diseases that we know of, with more being continuously described.  This means there is greater need for a dedicated facility to co-ordinate the information flow, the provision of expertise locally, regionally and internationally through a national co-ordinating centre.  This centre or office will be responsible for developing appropriate pathways of care and would undertake epidemiological work, be equipped with the appropriate IT infrastructures and co-ordinated information systems to allow for the development of registers that will enable better planning of services and facilitate the development of research infrastructures.</p><p> The research dimension in this field is an area of concern for patients and other stakeholders as funding dedicated to research on rare diseases remains limited.  However, the value of fundamental rare disease research cannot be underestimated on moral, scientific and economic arguments.  Rare diseases represent a huge burden on the individual, the community and the State, resulting in an unacceptable unmet clinical need for thousands of Irish patients.  Scientifically, rare diseases often serve as models for more common diseases and the complexity of rare disease often requires multidisciplinary approaches.  Basic, fundamental research is the engine of discovery; it generates new knowledge, drives innovation, and underlies all past and future breakthroughs.</p><p> The establishment of the Orphan Drug Acts in both the United States and Europe has generated incentives for the translation of basic research towards product development, and led directly to the growth of the biotech industry as we know it today.  Put simply, the medicine of tomorrow depends on sustained investment in basic research today.  We are concerned that in an environment where the State prioritises research leading to immediate economic impact we neglect the development of our pipeline for future discovery.  This impacts not only the provision of better medical care in the years to come but on our position as leading educators and our place in global innovation.</p><p> An area that requires more structure and sustained support is the development of rare disease registries, which are crucial building blocks for sound policy on rare disease.  Where well-implemented registries exist, there is better understanding of prevalence, impact and the likelihood of developing a treatment for the rare disease in question is increased.</p><p> Furthermore, the collection of patient data creates better standards of care and dramatically improves patient outcomes and life expectancy.  The development of an all-Ireland network of rare disease registries covering the island of Ireland should be developed to meet this objective, but it must be resourced correctly.  This network will enhance and standardise rare disease registries in line with the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, draft guidelines, data protection legislation and international best practice, facilitating the interoperability and harmonisation between international rare disease patient registries.  This function needs to be supported by the new national office for rare diseases.</p><p> Such infrastructure will enable more Irish success in European research grants and more involvement with international networks such as E-Rare, and facilitate engagement in the rare diseases aspects of BBMRI-ERIC and the ECRIN-ERIC.  Systems must be put in place to enhance the utility of data held in relevant health service-based information systems, including hospital records, laboratory cytogenetic and molecular genetics data.</p><p> We believe that the development of any future information systems must provide for a rare disease code in a patient record so that all people with rare diseases may be easily identified.  This was singled out as a patient priority in the consultation on the national plan.  The development of a rare disease ID card linked to a person&rsquo;s PPSN should be explored once the provisions of the proposed information Bill have been enacted and promulgated.</p><p> With respect to pregnancy, where family members are known to be at risk of being carriers of genes for rare diseases they have appropriate access to pre-conception genetic testing and counselling, which can inform them about the risks involved in becoming pregnant.  The Health Service Executive Governance Committee/Group on Newborn Screening within the integrated services directorate needs to consider the population benefits of newborn screening, including whether programmes need to be expanded or modified, and the need for carrier screening.  The Department of Health needs to also provide a policy framework for population-based screening programmes.</p><p> Patients are currently very concerned about the governance and clinical guidelines for send out tests, which should be audited yearly on the quality and diagnostic yield of tests sent out from non-hospital sources in order to minimise wastage.  We are also concerned that Ireland no longer has a national centre for medical genetics.</p><p> The national clinical programme for rare diseases, through the soon to be opened national office for rare diseases, must be supported in the development of the clinical and organisational governance framework that will underpin care pathways and access to treatment for rare disease patients, particularly in the context of the transition from paediatric care to adult care.  It is important to remember that some children do not grow out of conditions; they grow with them.</p><p> National centres of expertise in Ireland need to be identified for groupings of rare conditions, based on clinical need and built on foundations already established.  It is also important that broader clinical guidelines take account of the requirements of rare diseases.  The potential for co-operation on an all-Ireland basis must be realised.  Centres of expertise must be integrated into national funding planning, with provision for adequate staffing for multidisciplinary care, as well as sustainable research infrastructure for clinical investigation in addition to competitive research.</p><p> The role of the designated centre of expertise in Ireland should include research relevant to rare disease, in particular with regard to registries, as already mentioned, health service and translational research.  The capacity of Ireland&rsquo;s five clinical research facilities to engage in rare disease research nationally or in collaboration with international collaborative research must be enhanced.  </p><p> As a steering group we recommend that guidelines, monitored by HIQA, be developed on coding and recording of rare diseases within relevant Irish health data systems that are consistent with European and global recommendations.  The implementation of the Health identifiers Act is urgent, and the forthcoming health information Bill is vital to that.</p><p> Centres of expertise should be supported in seeking recognition as EU designated centres of expertise or associated national centres in European reference networks for rare diseases, RDERNs, according to the timeframe, framework and standards currently being developed at European level through the complementary work of the European Union Committee of Experts on Rare Diseases, EUCERD, and the EU cross-border healthcare directive.</p><p> Guidelines need to be developed in palliative care provision to address the complex and multi-systemic nature of many rare life-limiting conditions, and account must be taken of the particular needs of children with rare disease in this ongoing programme of work.  In order to improve and understand rare diseases among the next generation of medical professionals, appropriate modules relating to rare diseases need to feature within all undergraduate and postgraduate programmes.  This could also be addressed through professional bodies with the support of all stakeholder groups, including patients and their families.</p><p> We are concerned about the lack of  development of strategies concerning the provision of high technology and orphan therapies.  The HSE has committed to the development a working group to bring forward appropriate decision criteria for the reimbursement of orphan medicines and technologies, but this has not yet been enacted.</p><p> We recommend the preliminary economic evaluation of current activity and costs for orphan medicines and technologies for rare disease patients across all hospitals settings.  The approach should include an assessment system similar to that for cancer therapies established under the national cancer control programme and link with the clinical added value of orphan medicinal products, CAVOMP, at European level.  Applications for the use of orphan medicines and technologies in hospitals should be dealt with in the context of a national budget, rather than through individual hospital budgets.</p><p> An annual report documenting the use of both existing and new-to-market orphan medicines and technologies in Ireland and a summary of applications received and decisions relating to those applications should be made publicly available.</p><p>The existing horizon scanning between pharmaceutical companies and the HSE, including clinical value assessment authorities, should be enhanced to improve information available regarding orphan medicines in the pipeline and the future needs for these medicines. </p><p> We ask that the HSE applies a set of guidelines on the prescribing of orphan medicines and technologies in Ireland and evaluate clinical outcomes regarding use of orphan medicines.  We recommend that early dialogue between the HSE and companies running clinical trials in Ireland with Irish patients where licence approval is imminent.  Sponsors could be offered an incentive to run trials in Ireland, increasing access to innovation for Irish patients.</p><p> The principles of patients' empowerment are integral to all aspects of the national rare disease plan for Ireland, both now and in the future, in recognition of the fact those patients and their carers require significant clinical and non-clinical support.  We are calling for an oversight implementation group of relevant stakeholders, including patients groups, led by the HSE to be established to oversee and monitor implementation of the national rare disease plan's recommendations and associated key outputs.  The HSE will report to the Department of Health using key performance indicators on a periodic basis in accordance with reporting requirements under the national plan.  The European Union has mandated EUCERD's KPIs and that Ireland must report on these by the end of this year.  There needs to be an overall review of the national rare disease plan prior to development of the next plan in 2019.</p><p> As patients and representatives of patients, we welcome the recent commitment to the establishment of a NRDO.  This will facilitate the coordination and timely access to centres of expertise nationally and internationally, and will provide information regarding new treatments and management options for patients and medical professionals.  The information outlined highlights how the office will be a cornerstone in the facilitation of many elements of this plan but it must be sustained and built on into the future. </p><p> We remain in a time of economic constraint.  We are aware of this, but strongly believe that the name "rare" should not be understood to mean few.  Investment in this plan will lead to considerable savings for Exchequer and not just in the long term but today and tomorrow.  Patients on the diagnostic Odyssey are as we speak being moved from department to department in hospitals or between hospitals and between counties.  They are lying on trollies, helpless and untreated.  These are the people who will benefit from the implantation of the published plan.</p><p> EU structural and investment funds are instruments used to support economic social and territorial disparities that exist across the Union.  They are designed to promote greater cohesion in its regions.  They, therefore, form the basis of the EU cohesion policy, providing the investment framework to deliver the Europe 2020 objective of "smart sustainable and inclusive growth".  A key area of highlighted in this instrument is "social inclusion".  The amount to be invested between 2014 and 2020 is &euro;352 billion, which represents one third of the total EU budget for the next seven years.  Each member state is allocated a portion of the global amount.   Why could these funds not be considered for a programme of this nature?  The focus of this plan is to bring those patients and their families living with rare disease out of the shadows and margins of society by enabling them to become active citizens who will contribute, day by day, hand in hand, to a more inclusive, cohesive and productive society.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Colm Henry, national clinical advisor and group lead for acute hospitals.  The Department of Health&rsquo;s first national rare disease plan, A Rare Disease Plan for Ireland 2014-2018, was published in July 2014 in line with European Council recommendations.  The National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases, NCPRD, in Ireland was initiated in December 2013 under the national clinical strategy and programmes division of the HSE in collaboration with the Royal College of Physicians Ireland with a view to improving and standardising the quality of care for patients with rare diseases in Ireland.  Professor Eileen Tracey, clinical lead, and a programme manager were appointed for the programme.  The key initial priorities for the clinical programme are to assist with the identification and designation of national centres of expertise, with a view to having the option to join European reference networks, to facilitate the development of a NRDO in line with the European information portal for rare diseases, Orphanet, and the development of care pathways for the more common rare diseases.</p> <p>  The NCPRD developed a business model for a NRDO in 2014, and applied for entry to the EC rare diseases joint action.  Funding for 2015 has been allocated for the following staff for the office: a full-time information scientist, half of which will be funded by EU for three years; a full-time genetic counsellor; a consultant geneticist, 0.3 whole-time equivalent; and administrative support, 0.5 whole-time equivalent.  Recruitment is under way for the information scientist.  The four main functions of the NRDO include building information on the availability of expertise in Ireland for rare diseases and making this information available on the Orphanet web site as a resource for both patients and clinicians; a helpline for patients with access to a genetic counsellor; supporting the HSE in the mapping and validation of centres of expertise in Ireland; and in the long term, a role in rare diseases surveillance.</p> <p>  The NRDO will be based in the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital pending the establishment of the new national children&rsquo;s hospital.  It is hoped to launch the opening of the office in late in the second quarter of 2015.  The core benefit to the population and the State of the establishment of a central rare diseases office will be the streamlining of access to diagnosis for patients and appropriate quality treatments with increased efficiencies in the delivery of care.  Professor Eileen Tracey, clinical lead, is the designated co-ordinator for the island of Ireland and the designated person to participate in the EC Joint Action on Rare Diseases.  Her work will include establishing and validating the Orphanet information and function in Ireland through the NRDO and the dissemination of information nationally for rare diseases.  Her participation in this project is due to commence in May 2015.</p> <p>   The HSE NCPRD-acute hospitals division is currently embarking on an exercise to identify and designate existing centres of expertise for diagnosis, multidisciplinary care, clinical research and training in rare diseases according to accepted European criteria.  The initial sites to be reviewed for the three major services being considered for 2015 and early 2016 are clinical genetics in Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin; inherited metabolic disorders in Children&rsquo;s University Hospital, Temple Street; and hereditary coagulation disorders in St. James Hospital and Our Lady&rsquo;s Children Hospital, Crumlin.  This work will also inform the identification of centres of expertise abroad for patients whose disorders cannot be fully served in Ireland in collaboration with European reference networks and the development of processes for patients to access this expertise for timely diagnosis and care.</p> <p>  As a member state, we have obligations under EC Directive 2011/24/EU, application of patients' rights in cross border health care.  This directive is of particular relevance to patients with rare and ultra-rare diseases.  This directive on the application of patients&rsquo; rights in cross-border health care will strengthen co-operation between highly specialised healthcare providers across the Union by the establishment of a system of European reference networks.  Establishing such networks of highly specialised healthcare providers will help to provide affordable, high-quality and cost-effective healthcare to Irish patients requiring a particular concentration of resources or expertise which may be available in Europe but not specifically in Ireland.  European reference networks for rare diseases should serve as research and knowledge centres, treat patients from other EC countries and ensure the availability of subsequent treatment facilities where necessary.  The HSE has established a national contact point to facilitate information regarding the treatment abroad scheme and the cross-border care directive.  Further information is available on the HSE website.</p><p>It is hoped that the national rare disease office will, in time, also assist with and facilitate the national contact point for queries involving rare disease patients.  </p><p> A recommendation of the national rare disease plan was for the national clinical programme for rare diseases through a national office for rare diseases develop the clinical and organisational governance framework that will underpin care pathways and access to treatment for rare disease patients, particularly in the context of the transition from paediatric care to adult care.  The national clinical programme for rare diseases has now assembled a sub-group to develop a model of care for this work.</p><p> This concludes my opening statement and together with my colleague we will endeavour to answer any questions Members may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-26a.1297" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015022600002#H00300"><p>On foot of reading the rare diseases report it is evident we have a lot to do as we are starting from a very low base.  What is needed is a commitment that it should be done and resourcing of same to ensure it is done.  That in itself will be a huge undertaking but it should not deter us from doing what we need to do and what is right.  A few issues arise from the report and the presentations.  We talk about rare diseases.  They may be rare but, collectively, they are substantial in number.  This is evident across the European Union also.  I often wonder why there is not more transnational collaboration between national bodies and research institutes.  Ireland has a population of less than 1% of the European population.  Will we have enough critical mass to do our own research and the necessary support and capacity?  I wonder if we are slow and reluctant as a nation to collaborate in a meaningful planned way through national governments and national agencies on a one to one basis.  There is a great deal of work that could and should be done.  That is not only in the context of also in the area of treatment and providing supports.  Certainly the national rare diseases offices and its equivalents across Europe must come together in a more defined targeted way.</p> <p>  Research is scattered.  However, there must be some way of pooling it together between industry, hospitals and universities coming together in a more collaborative way.  We all understand that research is secretive in nature initially but there should be a better pooling of resources.</p> <p>  I spoke in the House last week on the national centre for medical genetics.  I am still unclear about it.  What has happened to it?  Why has it gone?  I would have assumed at this stage that we would have understood its importance, through the advances in medical science, embryology, stem cell research and so on and the assessment of genetics and chromosomes, and that we would be trying to enhance our national genetics office, not trying to undermine it.  What is happening?  When I raised it in the House, to be truthful I got a very poor answer.  If we are serious and if there is a commitment to a national rare diseases office one of the singular largest elements of rare diseases is the whole issue of genetics.  Therefore, genetics and genetics testing should be a central focal point.  I would greatly appreciate answers on that issue.</p> <p>  I have been looking at the list of rare diseases.  The vast majority of them, 80%, are genetic.  I would appreciate some information on the reason the national rare diseases office has disappeared, was undermined or chastised.  Something has happened to it as a centre and we should address it.</p> <p>   Many Deputies and Senators would have been on the journey with families from time to time where a family gets a diagnosis of a rare disease and the system is unable to say exactly what it is.  There may have been some time before the diagnosis but when it comes the system cannot support them well initially and the family is left very much on its own, other than goodwill support.  Often they trawl through the Internet and reams of research data to try to find answers.  It is a cling to hope and it can be a very difficult journey.  In that context while we have a proposal for a national rare diseases office, is there any way in which to humanise the bureaucracy through the system?  I appreciate it is difficult to humanise bureaucracy.  It can be harsh at times, not intentionally, because of its bureaucratic nature, particularly with families and individuals with rare diseases in practical areas, such as the kiting out of houses, and the willingness of a bureaucracy or the HSE to help the local general practitioner get that extra training to assist a patient who may be the only one he or she will have with that rare disease.  We should look at the issue from the top down but also assist general practitioners and nurse specialists in communities from time to time when one patient or one family has a specific illness or disease.  If that were done it might help alleviate some of the pressures on families from time to time. </p></speech>

It was a wonderful idea to dedicate a day in the year to international rare diseases because it has allowed us to have hook on which to hang this focus.  The focus might not happen only but for it.  I thank all my colleagues on the committee for the support annually in this address.</p> <p>   In her presentation - I am not making a distinction one from the other as they were all very informative - Ms Avril Daly talks about a dedicated facility.  When she talks about a dedicated facility she describes a facility to co-ordinate the information flow, the provision of expertise locally, regionally and internationally to a national co-ordinating centre.  The centre or office will be responsible for developing appropriate pathways of care and would undertake epidemiological work, be equipped with appropriate IT infrastructures and co-ordinated information systems, to allow for the development of registers that will enable better planning of services and facilitate the development of research infrastructures.  </p> <p>  Does that equate with the national office for rare diseases?  It should but I do not know from the outline.  I ask Mr. John Devlin and Ms Helen Byrne as I am not certain that what Ms Avril Daly has said, and that I believe is needed, is what is actually in the plan.  We received correspondence here and my colleague Senator Colm Burke referred to it a week ago that the national office is getting ready.  It cannot happen soon enough.  </p> <p>  The staff for the office would be one wholetime equivalent information scientist, one wholetime equivalent genetic counsellor, 0.3 wholetime equivalent consultant geneticist and 0.5 wholetime equivalent administrative support - I wonder what half of it would be?  Given what is outlined here I hope Mr. John Devlin will be able to advise that this is just the initial commitment because it does not equate with what I believe - and what I believe all who are interested in a real and serious focus on rare diseases know - is required.  I hope that what Ms Avril Daly has described is where we are going to get to.  I would appreciate if he would advise what is the real plan relating to the national office because there are so many aspects of what is needed that are not signalled at this point.</p><p> The registries are vital.  I strongly concur with an all-island approach given that I have spent my lifetime 4 miles from the Border.  The people I know within my catchment area all bear the same names, face the same problems and are part of the same genetic make up as each and every one of us.  Many of the representative organisations are structured on an all-island basis and it is very important that this co-operation is there or we will not get the full picture.  We need to get an all-island picture.  Will the national office help to develop these registries?  I would expect that some of that work would require more than the scientist and the counsellor.  The administrative staff would be taking on a lot of this work in respect of the IT requirements.  This database is a vital part of everything that is needed.  </p><p> We no longer have a national centre for medical genetics.  I understand that Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin has downgraded the national centre for medical genetics to a department within the hospital.  Is this the case?  Can we get information about its status?  Given the fact that the greater number of rare diseases are genetically based, why are we seeing the downgrading, if not the elimination, of the only medical genetics department we have had up to now at a time when we are seeking to seriously address the deficiencies relating to rare diseases through the establishment of a national office? </p><p> There seems to be no oversight relating to the national rare disease plan for Ireland.  There is no oversight committee.  Is this under consideration?  Will it be introduced?  With all of the attention, why was there almost no referencing to national rare diseases, let alone the office in the HSE service plan for 2015?  This baffles me and I am still at a loss as to why it would not have been a critical part of it if this was a serious attempt to address the issues surrounding rare diseases.  </p><p> I thank Mr. Heffernan in respect of all the work that is being done.  As a parent with direct experience, his testimony today is very important and striking.  There are many points I would like to explore with him but there is one he referred to that is particular to him.  It relates to what the diagnosis of a rare disease within a family means in so many ways.  It is not only the terrible tragedy of the onset of that news but, as Mr. Heffernan says, the consequential difficulties that present relating to employment and financial security for him, his wife and his family.  This area needs to be addressed and we need a joined-up response to situations of particular difficulty and hardship that occur when a rare disease presents in a family.  I thank Mr. Heffernan for drawing attention to that this morning.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-26a.1300" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015022600002#J00200"><p>I welcome all the witnesses.  The fact that we have a day each year to focus gives this committee an opportunity to focus on the issue, although we have other encounters during the year.  In preparing for today, I looked back at the meeting of 15 January when the Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland appeared before us and raised some very important issues, as the witnesses today have done.  Ms Daly's words about how rare does not mean few rang true.  When one looks at the figures, one sees that they are significant and that it is a significant health issue.  When I see the number of children who are directly affected due to the prevalence in childhood and the number of children who die before their fifth birthday, it makes me wonder where we should be going.  This is where I come to Mr. Heffernan's presentation.  I am a bit like him in the sense that I want to see implementation and action.  It reminds me of the last time Ireland was before the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child.  The committee said we were very good on paper but had issues about implementation.  This is where I would like to focus.  The Children's Rights Alliance produced a report at the time called From Rhetoric to Rights that dealt with how we ensure these rights are realised.</p> <p>  Mr. Heffernan raised a point about the oversight committee and said that the committee must include the previous members of the steering group as a minimum.  Why is there a question over that?  Perhaps there could be an explanation as to what is happening in the process of the oversight implementation group.  It is very important that it would bring together the expertise so I would be interested in knowing more about that.  In reading the plan, I assumed the implementation group was there because we need to move to the implementation phase.  I would like to know what is happening because it is very important.</p> <p>  I raised the issue of genetics with the Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland.  Is a genetics unit planned within the new national children's hospital.  My understanding is that there should be but I would like to know whether organisations individually or the HSE have been involved in the scoping relating to rare diseases and the needs assessment for the national children's hospital relating to rare diseases.  This is not just in the location because I understand based on a visit by the committee to the hospital that it will have satellite and services linked to the hospital.  I am looking at the wider remit of the national children's hospital and the co-ordinated supports it will provide rather than just the physical premises.  Have organisations been involved in any scoping or needs assessment?  It is critical that they are involved at this stage.  </p> <p>  Another issue that was raised with me was the need for a credible source of information.  What developments are happening on that side?  We all turn to the Internet even though we know that we will not get a diagnosis but sometimes it is the only place where one may get answers.  I know that when we visit medical services and medical services try to convey information to us, we do not always take in all the information so we go home and try to research and find out more.  Rare diseases by their nature are rare so how do people find that information in a co-ordinated way?  The witnesses have raised those issues.  What steps are there for Irish parents because I see the pressures on the support groups and NGOs?  We get testimony after testimony about the important work that is being done by advocates working in the area, usually parents who have been through the process and are, therefore, able to translate and understand what this parent or individual is going through.  </p> <p>  Mr. Heffernan spoke about Liam's Lodge which is to be applauded.  Has there been any State involvement or interest in what the Saoirse Foundation is trying to do in developing Liam's Lodge?  Anybody I know sings the praises of BUMBLEance.  We must all strive harder to provide this environment at what is potentially such a scary time for a child.  We have raised with the national children's hospital the fact that it is an issue for children throughout their childhood.</p><p>We are not just dealing with very young children.  Teenagers will also have rare diseases.</p></speech>

When I first came across this issue three and a half years ago, it was a case of everyone fighting for his or her own corner.  It is important that we work together to help families coping with a rare disease.</p> <p>  Has the 2011 EU directive on cross-border health care been transposed?  I understand it has not been transposed but I am open to correction.  If it has not been transposed, is there any indication of when this will happen?  In some cases treatment abroad presents no problems and it works out very well, but in others it can involve battles lasting for two or three months which leave families traumatised.  The experience varies among HSE areas and from one medical condition to another.  Have any measures been put in place to make the process more efficient and less time-consuming?  Something needs to be done because the last thing a family in this situation needs is indecision.  They have already come through a traumatic experience and it is important they get a decision on accessing care abroad.</p> <p>  Are Mr. Heffernan and Ms Daly happy with the availability of respite care based on their experience of dealing with families or can more be done to improve the availability of care?  I have come across a number of families who are providing care on a 24-7 basis find they cannot access the supports they need.  This is why respite care is fundamental to families.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-26a.1303" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015022600002#K00300"><p>I welcome the witnesses and beg their indulgence if I sound tired and cranky.  It recently dawned on me that I am well into my 22nd year of being back in Ireland and I am still trying to grapple with the issues arising in regard to the common disease of cancer.  We are not doing very well with the common diseases and, while that does not mean we should not try to deal with the rare diseases, I caution the witnesses on a certain issue of prioritisation.  What made the difference in cancer care in Ireland was not the bureaucracy called the national cancer control programme but the now Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who said in his first speech as Minister for Health in 1995 that if one of his relatives had cancer he would not allow him or her to go to certain hospitals in this country.  I gently remind him this was an ever so slight plagiarism of something I had said the previous year but I was honoured to be plagiarised in that manner.  He also spoke about appointing cancer specialists.  That is what made the difference.  Cancer mortality rates started to improve, particularly in breast cancer, which was probably the area that was most deficient in terms of treatments not being made available in Ireland.  The national cancer control programme had nothing to do with these improvements.  It streamlined certain procedures but it did not materially affect their outcome.</p><p>I do not want the witnesses to take this the wrong way but somebody coming away from this meeting might get the message that the country with the smallest number of paediatricians, adult and paediatric neurologists or adult and paediatric dermatologists, nearly non-existent paediatric endocrinologists, despite our obesity epidemic, and very few adult endocrinologists needs to prioritise the management of uncommon diseases by setting up a new bureaucracy and a registry.  We may need them but we are not going to fix the problem until we grapple with the fundamental structural problems of Irish health care, which are no closer to being fixed than when I first started to point them out more than two decades ago.</p><p>I have not formally studied which places are most successful in dealing with individual rare diseases.  Typically in the case of cancer, a leading medical school-based centre develops an interest in a programme and has sufficient resources and personnel to allow sub-specialisation to develop.  This is unlike the situation in Ireland, where we expect paediatricians to look after asthma in children and then provide a specialist service to those with uncommon or rare diseases.  We must also grapple with the fundamentally irrational nature of having six medical schools in a small population.  That is twice the European average and approximately two and a half times that of the United States on a <i>per capita</i>basis.  None of them is remotely excellent.  I can highlight individual cases of people who did brilliant jobs in difficult circumstances in terms of building internationally recognised units, but we do not approach the issue systematically.</p><p>I have to say something about the national centre for medical genetics because I have a dog in this fight.  We use genetics services, primarily historic, for breast cancer patients where we notice a suspicious family history and want to find out if the patient has a genetic syndrome which would be relevant to the her health as well as to other members of her family in terms of early diagnosis or prevention of cancer.  The reality is that we did not stop having a national genetics centre; we never had one.  We had a very good academic centre that Professor Andrew Green, to his extraordinary credit, built mainly on the basis of research funding.  It attracted very limited statutory funding.  He and I had a gentle historical disagreement because we both applied for a research grant which ended up getting his unit up and running on a large scale.  However, he has been providing a genetics service on a national basis without the kind of structure or ring-fenced budget that a national centre should have.  When Crumlin was in its most recent paroxysm of financial turmoil, it re-examined the centre's catchment area.  This has happened to me in St. Vincent's.  I have been told over the years that I should not take patients from Galway because St. Vincent's was not a national centre for any of their cancers and they could instead go to their local hospitals.  When I pointed out that the local hospital did not have an oncologist, the response I received was &quot;tough&quot;.  Doctors behaving ethically have had to overcome very unethical administrative impediments to providing services to patients.  While there is much to be said for proper registration procedures and connecting to international networks to tap into expertise, it is also necessary to advocate for the reform of services, including the number of doctors and structures of medical schools.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-26a.1304" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/981" speakername="Sandra McLellan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015022600002#K00400"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their comprehensive presentations and for sharing their personal experiences.  With regard to staffing at the rare diseases office, an administrator on 0.3 of a whole-time equivalent is only working 13 hours per week.  That is not even sufficient time to open e-mails or letters.  Given that there are between 6,000 and 8,000 rare diseases, it is shocking.</p> <p>  The witnesses clearly outlined what needs to be done.</p><p>It all sounds very simple and extremely logical.  We just need to get to that point.  I was very interested and grateful to hear about the life-changing implications for families and how these situations can affect people financially.  There is a major lack of understanding as to how rare diseases can impact a family, which has implications for how that impact is assessed.</p><p> According to the national rare disease plan, between one in four and one in five rare disease patients wait more than a year for assessment by an appropriate specialist in rare diseases.  Respondents, not surprisingly, felt an appointment with a specialist should follow within three months, which is quite logical.  For people with rare diseases, the trauma of not knowing what is wrong with them is made much worse by having to wait a year to see a specialist.  That is not in any way acceptable.</p><p> I have a number of questions regarding cystic fibrosis treatment which I am hoping one of the delegates might be able to answer.  How many children in Ireland are being treated under the trials of the ground-breaking drug, Kalydeco?  We know this medication can lead to significant improvements for patients with a particular mutation of CF.  Can any of the delegates provide an update on the trial participants' progress?  Have there, for example, been any side effects?  Are there any plans to extend the provision of the drug to other CF sufferers?  When are the trials scheduled to continue and does length of time of treatment vary from child to child or from age group to age group?  How will it be determined when a person should be taken off Kalydeco?  I am not sure whether the delegates can answer those questions, but I would be delighted if any of them can.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-26a.1306" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John Devlin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015022600002#L00200"><p>A great number of issues have been raised.  I agree completely with the sentiment that rare diseases are, in fact, common.  That is very much part of our thinking.  I likewise agree with what Senator Crown said regarding clinical focus.  It struck us very early on that there was a lack of clinical focus with regard to rare diseases.  In the case of cancers, a number of very prominent cancer specialists like Senator Crown were able to take the initiative and from that we got a cancer programme.  We had the setting up of things like the clinical research network, iCore, and so on.  That type of focus was lacking when it came to rare diseases.  This was clear to us very early on, as I said, and we did not really want to wait to publish a plan.  We decided one of the first things we had to do was to establish a clinical programme on rare diseases, and that led to the appointment of Professor Eileen Treacy.  We talked to the then clinical director of the Health Service Executive, Dr. Barry White, and he agreed to do it.  It was very important to achieve that clinical focus which was lacking.  It was not that patients were not being treated, but no common themes were emerging and what was being done was happening in isolation in hospitals and so on.  We did not consider that a good thing.</p> <p>  In terms of how we moved things on from there, we can talk about structures and all the rest of it, but our key priority initially was to start making things happen.  While we did not have an oversight committee, we did have a number of meetings with the HSE, particularly around the establishment of the office.  We considered this a priority to get us going.  To do that, we needed to take several actions.  First, we needed to secure and tie down the funding from the EU and then match it.  That was the basis for the proposal Ms Byrne has outlined today, and it sets out the requirement for further staff and so on.</p> <p>  Deputy Kelleher asked about collaboration.  That is very relevant because this is a pan-European issue.  Mr. McCormack and I are members of the European Union Committee of Experts on Rare Diseases, EUCERD, where all these issues are debated.  They are very practical issues around the development of the European reference networks, how we will tie into them, what the quality criteria for our centres of expertise will be and so on.  That work has been a little slower to progress than we expected, but we should be in a position by the end of the year where countries like Ireland will be able to start designating centres.  That is reflected in the work Ms Byrne has outlined regarding the three national centres for medical genetics, inherited metabolic diseases and hereditary haemochromatosis.  We may be in a position to designate them into Europe.</p> <p>  Regarding training and medical schools, that is dealt with in some detail in our report.  It is not that these conditions are not part of the medical curriculum, because they are, but we need to do a bit more.  We need more information on rare diseases.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to registers.  Our report lists 40 different sources of information we had to reference to in order to build up a compendium of cases of rare diseases.  Within that, there are some ten or 12 registers.  Some of them are familiar resources which operate under a particular code of governance and standards, such as the National Cancer Registry and the Cystic Fibrosis Registry of Ireland, while other registers are less developed.  We also have a very strong congenital anomaly registry, EUROCAT, in this country.  We had a discussion among our group about the best thing to do in terms of bringing all these sources together, whether by establishing a single national register or something else.  We concluded that it was probably more important, in the first instance, to develop a network of registers in order that we can apply common standards of governance and ways of working across those registers rather than simply moving straight into a national register for rare diseases without having all those standards agreed.</p> <p>  That is very much part of our thinking and it is one of the functions of the office.  Of course, our staff are not the only ones who will contribute to this.  Behind the other registers are other personnel and we fully expect they will contribute to the work, including National Cancer Registry staff, EUROCAT staff and so on.  It will also require the support of the patient organisations, which have also developed registers.  Legislation is important too, and some of it has been enacted or will soon be enacted.  The Health Identifiers Act 2014, for instance, will help us out.  Even more important will be the health information Bill, which is intended to provide an opportunity for registers to be prescribed.  Once that happens, the registers can operate in accordance with common operating procedures and standards, which will make things much easier.</p> <p>  The delegates from the HSE might be better able to answer the question about the national centre for medical genetics.  When we are talking about designating national centres, the work that is happening, the mapping of care pathways through the national clinical programme and so on, will bring us to a better understanding of what we need, what that particular centre might look like and how it will operate within a European context.  My colleagues from the HSE might wish to say more about that.</p> <p>  I am sorry to tell Deputy McLellan that we do not have the information she requested regarding cystic fibrosis medication.  We will see if we can secure it for her.</p> <p>  I will conclude by referring to research.  A good amount of money is going into rare disease research.  Indeed, approximately &euro;6.8 million came from the Health Research Board, HRB, alone from 2010 to 2014.  The research covers a variety of different rare diseases.  Last November the Minister for Health announced  a further &euro;1.9 million in funding for rare disease research through the HRB in co-operation with non-governmental organisations.  That is very welcome, but there is more to do in this space.  Ireland will not be able to solve the problem of rare disease research on its own.  It is very much about being part of those larger European networks like the European Clinical Research Infrastructures Network, ECRIN, the European Research Infrastructure Consortium, ERIC, and collaborating on bio-banking.  The very nature of these rare diseases, with some of them being ultra rare, means there is a requirement for pan-European research.  Once the centres of expertise are designated and the clinicians can take a lead on this, we would be very much supportive of their coming together, forming a network and making applications as part of a broader European network infrastructure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-26a.1307" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Heffernan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015022600002#L00300"><p>Members asked about people's actual experience of seeking respite and other support and care services.  My personal experience was that we were offered respite in an acute hospital full of infection for two children who were prone to infection.  For any child with multi-systematic breakdowns of their immune system and other functions, this is not, in my opinion or that of some of the doctors who cared for our children, the best place to put them.  However, the practice continues.</p><p>Access to respite care is exceptionally limited, if there is any.  We are self-funding and without State support, but we are transporting children from across Ireland, from Donegal to Kerry, with the LauraLynn children's hospice as one of the principal places.  Typically, kids go there for one or two nights' rest after travelling for five hours on a BUMBLEance.  We only have one BUMBLEance, with a second on the way.  </p><p> On the opportunities to access respite care, we should not look at the opportunities but at the benefits.  There is a cost saving, on which subject questions have been raised in the D&aacute;il.  The amount of money spent by the Health Service Executive on community nursing and similar facilities, including agency nurses, in providing respite and support care is phenomenal.  On foot of a question asked more than one year ago, I believe the figure is approximately &euro;78 million.  The co-ordination of several areas and the provision of infrastructure such as respite care facilities such as Liam's Lodge will streamline accessibility to respite care for any family to a journey of one and a half to two hours.</p><p> Access to respite care will give them head space, which we never had.  Speaking personally, we did not receive genetic counselling.  One child was already dead and the other one was nearly gone and that was in a five-year period.  We received a pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, PGD, and other stuff; frankly, we received information that was not aligned to what it should have been.  While the actual personal experiences are strong, we are trying to be proactive.  There must be greater emphasis on the patient's needs and those of the parents who are the 24-7 carers.  One hears figures of which I seek a correction - one hears there are more home care packages, more home helps and other things.  However, it should be quantified in hours and actual time provided to support families, not how many families are receiving home helps and other such services because the inputs and outputs are not the same.  This must be improved drastically.</p><p> While I agree with all of my colleagues about collaboration, respite care, research and everything else, practical stuff can happen now, as many people are affected.  The national office for rare diseases has been identified, which is welcome and a good start to a certain degree.  However, if one considers the whole-time equivalents in the budgets and compares them with the volume of people employed, the investment amounts to approximately &euro;1 per head in year one.  Although this affects 6% to 8% of the population during their lifetimes, that is, 275,000 to 330,000 people, the initial budget is &euro;1 per head.  We need to prioritise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-26a.1309" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eibhlin Mulroe" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015022600002#M00200"><p>I am from the Irish Platform for Patients' Organisations, Science and Industry, IPPOSI.  I wish to revert to the comment made by Deputy Sandra McLellan on cystic fibrosis and clinical trials.  The product ivacaftor was used in clinical trials but is now on the market.  Patients in Ireland had access to the clinical trials.  This goes back to the comments made by Senator John Crown in the context of registries.  We are in a position in Ireland to attract research on cancer and cystic fibrosis because we have a registry of patients.  We have information on patients, both clinical and personal information, that is necessary to access trials.  Registries are important in the context of research.  I revert to the point made by Senator John Crown on specialist care and he is correct.  The European Organisation for Rare Diseases, EURORDIS, recently conducted a survey of patients in Europe who were experiencing difficulty.  A total of 2,000 patients responded to the survey, of whom 90 were Irish.  They had the highest rate of issues in respect of access to specialist care.  The issues did not pertain to access to treatment or drugs but access to specialist care.  We have an issue in Ireland in that context.</p> <p>  I am thinking of people who have rare conditions, that is, the people I know and with whom I interact, as do Ms Avril Daly and Mr. Tony Heffernan.  It is really difficult when one lives in a country in which one does not have health information and one does not have unique identifiers within the hospital system.  A person with a rare condition who visits a hospital but then has to vist another the following week because he or she happens to be elsewhere is in trouble.  While this is not a rare disease issue, the health information Bill is really important.  Its implementation is even more important, that is, the adoption of unique identifiers to ensure all citizens will have their health information collected somewhere.  While this is probably a discussion for another day, in the context of rare conditions, it matters.</p> <p>  Another issue that is missing is that of health economics in respect of orphan drugs, of which there are only 72 under the orphan drugs regulations.  There are not that many of them, as treatments are not available for every rare condition.  There are only a few treatments and where they are available, particularly ultra-orphans where one is talking about perhaps one in 50,000 people, such treatments costs are high.  There are fewer people with such conditions, but the cost of developing the drug is the same.  In these situations the system of assessment of these drugs is the same as for any other drug.  It happens within the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics and I acknowledge its process is transparent.  We can see it and what happened with the health technology assessment, HTA, analysis.  The problem is with what happens after this, namely, the decision.  What was really good about the cystic fibrosis case was that the people involved communicated with the patient organisation.  However, as has been seen within the past six months, a patient who is one of only two or three in the country has nowhere to go to talk to those who make the decisions.  The people sitting around this table from both the Department of Health and the HSE have been working with us on how to involve the patient within that process because what then happens is such patients go public and to the media.  While they are entitled to do this, we should have a process in place as this issue will come up repeatedly in a country in which budgets matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-26a.1310" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Avril Kennan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015022600002#M00300"><p>I wish to pick up on Deputy Billy Kelleher's point about research and whether any progress has been made in collaboration.  I was a researcher on the genetics of rare diseases for many years.  I now work with the patient advocacy organisation DEBRA Ireland.  My worry about research is that it will be perceived as a luxury in the context of the national plan.  Within the current constraints, it is easy to focus on the more immediate aspects, which are so important.  However, to perceive research as a stand-alone item is to perceive it in the wrong way because it is integral to every single aspect of the plan.  Obviously, the developments made in understanding the genetics underlying rare conditions have been an absolutely essential element in making progress towards a diagnosis, but there are still many rare diseases of which the underlying causes are not known.  There still are people who never receive a diagnosis.  Consequently, there is a great deal of work to be done from that perspective.</p> <p>  It also relates to looking at current supports for patients.  The best way to do this is to have an evidence-based way in which one analyses carefully how patients are interacting with health services, as well as the quality-of-life issues for them.  Then, of course, there is the one thing about which we all think, namely, a cure and therapies, which are essential.  We have made great progress for some, but for others, we still are a very long way off.  However, in the case of those conditions where we are a long way off, we cannot underestimate the hope factor.  I always think it must be such a dark place for anybody living with a rare disease to know that there is nobody who is interested in his or her condition or in doing something to try to progress treatments.  We still have a long way to go in terms of collaboration.  Some progress has been made recently and there is a strong centre in UCD, for instance.  However, we must take a number of steps to improve matters, one of the main ones being facilitating research within the health service, but we have not been very good at this in Ireland.  As Dr. John Devlin mentioned, we need to conduct research within the centres of expertise because, apart from anything else, this has been shown to improve patient care.</p> <p>  One recommendation made in the national plan is to establish a network of rare disease researchers, to which consideration must be given.  As everyone has noted, the national office will not have the capability to do this in the short term, yet forming networks would open the door to European Union funding.  There are actually reasonable amounts of European Union funding available for research into rare diseases, but we must ensure our researchers are ready to take advantage of it.  In addition, we must ensure that under the new strategy for science, technology and innovation, our funding agencies will have the capacity to fund research into rare diseases because in recent times it has been very challenging to obtain funding for research at the more basic end of the spectrum.  I would greatly like to see a research representative on the proposed implementation plan oversight committee for the national plan.</p></speech>

Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in remarked on how it was not mentioned in the service plan.</p><p>In developing the service plan for 2015 the HSE was working with a limited budget and lots of requests for resources, as the committee can appreciate.  We were not in a position to make money available for the office, but subsequent to publishing the service plan, we were able to allocate money.  It was not mentioned in the service plan because there was no funding specifically available at the time.  The HSE, however, recognised the need and sourced the funding which it made available in 2015 on a half-year basis, with a view to providing funding for the office for a full year in 2016.  I acknowledge that it probably seems to be a small number of staff.  We were working from a low base where there was nothing in place - there was no central registry or information available centrally.  For the HSE to plan and deliver services on an ongoing basis we need information.  Having the office is not what it is all about; we need to be able to provide the specialist services required, but in order to ensure this we need to have the registry in place and the information needed.  It is a start, although it is not from where we want to start.  </p><p> On the national centre for genetics, I know that the issue has been brought up by Senator John Crown and Deputy Billy Kelleher.  There are going to be genetic services available in the children's hospital.  There have been numerous international benchmarking activities.  We have considered whether the full service should be located in the children's hospital.  The committee has to appreciate that the ratio in genetic services between adults and children is 60%:40%.  There has to be consideration given to whether the service should be placed on the site of the new children's hospital.</p></speech>

I will receive confirmation on whether there was consultation.  </p> <p>  On having it part of the service in Crumlin versus locating it in the national centre, a review has been undertaken of the services being delivered by the genetics service in Crumlin.  Senator John Crown made a very good point that it was considered as part of the funding for Crumlin hospital and when budgets were cut, that budget was cut also.  A steering committee has been set up with some international expertise to advise on what the genetics service should look like and it is to report to the HSE within the next six months.</p></speech>

There is a matching funding process through the medical research charities group and the Health Research Board.  It is important to mention that we have not received that funding this year.  We are I hope going to receive it next year, but that means that &euro;1 million has not been put the research into rare diseases this year.</p> <p>  In the context of the relationship between common diseases and rare diseases, a lot of common diseases, particularly in the case of cancer and heart disease, are being broken down into rare conditions because we are beginning to understand and characterise them better.  We need to understand better that what we are talking about is how we are going to provide care to meet future needs.  What we now consider to be rare conditions are going to have an impact on how we provide care in treating more common diseases.</p></speech>

What is to happen in the interim?  Can the delegates anticipate that we will at least see an interim facility up and running pending the commissioning of the new national paediatrics centre?</p> <p>  Dr. Devlin glossed over my point a little about oversight and an oversight committee.  There were 48 recommendations made in the context of the national plan.  Will there be an oversight committee?  Will the steering committee carry out this function in the interim?  How inclusive will the oversight committee be?  I happen to believe it needs to be more representative of many of the groupings involved.  There is a need for more direct involvement and the oversight requires to be very focused and an intimate relationship where the people most directly affected will have an opportunity to ensure what is proposed will actually be delivered at the earliest opportunity.</p></speech>

It was a very relevant question.  Our focus initially was on engaging with the HSE on a number of key issues around the programme, the office, access to orphan drugs and so on.  The national steering committee is due to meet in the next couple of weeks to discuss this issue and is representative, as the Deputy knows.  Mr. Heffernan has expressed a view in that regard.  We are open to considering what works best.  We did not actually have a meeting of the oversight committee as such because a lot of changes were taking place at the time, but we wanted to continue to do business with the HSE.  The question of whether it should be the steering committee or something different that takes on this role is less significant, as long as it does the right things and we monitor the plan and everything else.  Let us not forget that we will be reporting on a pile of key indicators in relation to the rare diseases plan.  There are about 20 or 30 indicators on which we are going to report and which will very much form part of the information we will be making available to everybody.</p></speech>

The symptoms of many of those affected by rare diseases are common and similar to those affected by common conditions; therefore, they can be managed in the same way.  We must consider what is happening now.  The State relies on families and carers to look after all those affected and most of them receive no financial benefits.  The least the State could do is give them a break, by means of respite care and additional support.  This would them give them a better future in terms of their mental health and also support the families directly.  We have to take a proactive approach to supporting them while all of the other work is continuing.</p></speech>

The treatments and care pathways for many of the diseases are well defined.  It is currently run largely by public health consultants.  The director of acute hospitals, Liam Woods, recently met the director of the well-being division, because there is recognition that the public health consultants need more specialist support in arbitrating on treatments, especially for rarer conditions.  Our division is working with the well-being division to decide how we can give them access to timely, specialist support for conditions that are not protocol-driven, for which answers are required in a much more timely way.</p></speech>

This is where the problem is arising.  People are left in mid-air for a quite a long time, not knowing whether they will be able to get the required support for that treatment abroad.  I have come across a number of cases where it went around in circles for three or four months, which is unfair to the families and to the patient concerned.</p></speech>

That arises where for some reason the treatment abroad scheme refuses or does not allow the application to proceed.  In the majority of cases the treatment is approved, and in most cases there is a protocol that allows people to sign off on whatever treatment is required.  The system must be streamlined.  Quicker access to specialist opinion is required for those rarer conditions that are not protocol-driven.</p></speech>

It is completely different from the treatment abroad scheme.  I know Senator Burke is familiar with this, because we had an event dealing with this last year when the representatives of the Commission were over to try to get Ireland to transpose the cross-border directive.  It makes a great deal of sense, from what we have talked about this morning.  We have to work outside Ireland to get treatment for conditions that only one person in the country has.  That person must be able to travel.  We are seeing, more and more, that patients with rare conditions who need to travel, even to London, are finding it very difficult.  They are waiting longer than three months.  They are waiting years to get access.  We would urge that rare diseases be treated in a slightly different way.  The political theorist Rawls used to say that in democracies, where people are discriminated against, we need to positively discriminate in their favour.  I am stealing that from Professor David Smith, who quoted it at a meeting of ours this week.  We need to look at that within the context of rare diseases, within the treatment abroad scheme, and within access to treatment and care.</p></speech>

We might ask that the patient groups involved in the rare disease task force might update the briefing to include the fact that the HSE has made funding available, as Ms Byrne commented, although it is not mentioned in the service plan - just to be fair in terms of outlining both the positives and the negatives.  I thank the group for its excellent presentation and research.  I thank everyone for coming.
