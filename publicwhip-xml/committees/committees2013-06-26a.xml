    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-26a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013062600003#B00200"><p>At the meeting of 2 May 2013, I outlined the financial difficulties of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority in 2010, which was the first year in respect of which my office carried out an audit of the authority's financial statements.  A key factor contributing to the authority's financial position was the ongoing impact of its participation in a joint venture with private developers to buy and develop the Irish Glass Bottle site.</p><p>  In October 2006, the authority and its partners in a joint venture company, called Becbay Limited, agreed to bid &euro;412 million to acquire the Irish Glass Bottle site in Poolbeg.  Other related expenses brought the total acquisition cost to &euro;431 million, of which &euro;291 million was borrowed.  The authority provided equity and loan funding for the joint venture upfront, as well as guaranteeing the repayment of a share of the Becbay Limited loans, which were initially provided by Anglo Irish Bank.  Following a deal done with the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, on 27 July 2011, the final cost to the authority of its involvement in the Irish Glass Bottle site venture was around &euro;52 million.  Further substantial costs were incurred by the State when losses on the bank loans were realised.</p><p>  In October 2006, the authority's management presented to the executive board an assessment of the level of investment, benefits and risks of the Irish Glass Bottle site project.  There is no evidence, however, that a detailed analysis of those factors, commensurate with the scale of the proposed investment, was carried out.  Management advised the board that the property market in 2006 was overheated but nevertheless recommended the investment for strategic reasons.</p><p>  The information submitted on 12 October 2006 to support the authority's application to the Department of the Environment. Community and Local Government to increase its borrowing capacity stated the value of the site was approximately &euro;220 million.  It appears the authority did not update the Department when it decided to bid almost double that amount.  Consequently, consent by both the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for increased borrowing and for the authority's participation in the joint venture was evidently given on the understanding that an investment to the value of around &euro;220 million was being contemplated.</p><p>  The authority did not obtain its own independent valuation when it was deciding on the bid that Becbay Limited should make for the site.  In the course of the examination, my office reviewed the management by the executive board of conflicts of interest around the decision to invest in the joint venture.  In the case of the decision to purchase the Irish Glass Bottle site, a number of board members disclosed their connections as directors of banks that were providing project finance.  The authority took steps to assure itself that its decision-making in the provision of finance was in accordance with its code of conduct.  The executive board minutes do not record disclosure by board members of any other personal, professional or business interests that could represent a conflict of interest with the decision to acquire the Irish Glass Bottle site.</p><p>  Apart from its involvement in development activity, the authority has important planning functions in its geographic area of operation.  Certain aspects of this function were also examined, and are reported on in chapter 4 of the special report.  Difficulties arose with the development of a planning scheme for the Poolbeg area, where the Irish Glass Bottle site is located.  Such planning schemes provide the framework within which fast-lane applications for planning approval are decided.  These are referred to as section 25 applications.</p><p>  The Minister granted an order in June 2007 specifying an area in Poolbeg for which the authority could prepare a planning scheme.  Drafting of the scheme was completed in December 2008.  The authority subsequently commissioned a review of the scheme prior to submitting it to the Minister for final approval.  The review found the preparation of the scheme had not been carried out in a fair, equitable and transparent manner consistent with best practice and that the scheme was not robust enough to be submitted to the Minister.  The planning scheme for the area has not subsequently been finalised.</p><p>  The context in which the review of the draft Poolbeg planning scheme was commissioned was the findings of the High Court in October 2008 in a case taken against the authority on a section 25 application in the North Lotts area.  The section 25 application in question related to a development company called North Quay Investments Limited and was submitted to the authority in May 2007.  The executive board approved the issuing of a section 25 certificate to the company in July 2007.  The basis of the adverse High Court finding was that an agreement entered into in May 2007 by the authority with North Quay Investments Limited was <i>ultra vires</i>, in that the authority should not have entered it in advance of determining the application for the section 25 certificate.  Furthermore, the agreement could also be construed as either the authority or its executives committing that the executives would make a particular recommendation to the board.  The proposed North Quay Investments Limited development was inconsistent with the North Lotts planning scheme.  Non-compliant applications cannot be made compliant by the authority imposing conditions requiring modifications, which it had purported to do.  The procedures employed by the authority were unfair as they did not allow adjacent landowners an opportunity to make submissions prior to the section 25 application decision being reached.</p><p>  The authority's section 25 process was amended following the 2008 court decision.  A subsequent review of the revised process found that it was satisfactory.  However, the special report indicates that the level of section 25 applications since 2008 had been negligible.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-26a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Lar Bradshaw" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013062600003#B00400"><p>I thank the committee for its invitation to come before the committee.  This is the first time that I have spoken publicly about my time in the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and the purchase of the Irish Glass Bottle site.</p><p>  From previous minutes of this committee, I noted references to "the absence of others being willing to come here to discuss what happened".  I wish to put on record that I agreed to come here immediately following receipt of the invitation from the committee.</p><p>  Moreover, as members may or may not be aware, I have spent the past three years working intensively with the lawyers of the authority as one of the key witnesses in its defence of the case brought against it by Mr. Bernard McNamara and Donatex.  This included producing a comprehensive and detailed witness statement.</p><p>  In the committee&rsquo;s last meeting on this topic on May 2, Mr. John Tierney, outgoing chairman of the authority, announced that this case was recently dropped by the plaintiffs, removing a potential &euro;100 million exposure for the State.  The plaintiff dropped the suit shortly after receiving the key witness statements, including mine.  The committee may also know that, at the request of the authority, discussion of these matters by the committee was effectively deferred until the legal case with Donatex was over.  As I was a key witness for the authority, it obviously would have been inappropriate for me to speak publicly until that case had been resolved.</p><p>  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for his clarification of one point, a clarification which he made at the two previous committee meetings, and he has done so again today, when he stated "while management advised the board that the property market in 2006 was overheated, it nevertheless recommended the investment for strategic reasons".  This is an important clarification for the committee because, as you know, the actual report which is in the public domain states, both in the overview and again in the body of the report:  "The executive advised the board of the authority that the joint venture bid for the Irish Glass Bottle site would be made in an over-heated commercial property market" - full stop.</p></speech>

As members are aware, CHDDA was in charge of 25 acres and involved physical redevelopment whereas we had 1,300 acres and our remit involved social and economic redevelopment as well as physical redevelopment.  In my first year I spent roughly half my time getting a management team together.</p></speech>

I attended monthly board meetings and prepared for that.  I spent time with the chief executive before all board meetings.  We had six council meetings a year and I prepared for them.

We would shape the agenda and include all the items we wanted to put on it.  If I felt work needed to be done to carry out the proper analysis behind options, we would discuss all of that.  That was the key meeting before the board meeting.  I might be needed for other meetings but it would have been the equivalent of no more than a couple of days a month.</p></speech>

The particular sequence of meetings I wish to examine are the meetings of the board that began with the sub-committee board meeting on 5 October 2005, and the three subsequent full board meetings that took place on 3, 20 and 24 October.  I will base my questions on the minutes that were supplied to us and to any reference made by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report.</p><p>  First, at the board sub-committee meeting on 5 October, 2005 it is my understanding that Mr. Bradshaw, Mr. Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick, Ms Mary Moylan were listed as being present and Mr. Paul Maloney and Mr. Neil Mulcahy were listed as being in attendance.

I do not have the date because I am working off exactly the same material Deputy Donohoe has.  I asked the secretariat to provide me with everything members have so we are working off the same data.  In late summer 2005 Paul Coulson rang me in the authority and he explained to me that all trust had broken down between South Wharf and the Dublin Port Company.</p></speech>

Paul Coulson was the chairman of Ardagh, a company involved in glass manufacturing.  At some point &ndash; do not ask me when, but I am sure people can check it &ndash; the company was split into two companies; one a glass company and the other effectively a company called South Wharf and all it had was this asset, its tenancy in this asset.</p><p>  He rang me in late summer 2005 and said to me that all trust had broken down between South Wharf and the Dublin Port &amp;amp; Docks Board.  He asked me, as chairman of the authority and someone who would clearly have a desire that the impasse would be broken between the two parties and the land would be developed, if I would mediate between both parties as the chairman of the authority.  During the telephone call he also informed me of the legal loophole.  Is everyone familiar with it?</p></speech>

He informed me of that and that he could effectively set up a subsidiary company &ndash; I think he had already done that &ndash; to buy out the freehold, in other words what the Dublin Port Company owned, for a multiple of what effectively was a peppercorn rent that the Dublin Port Company was charging at the time.  I assume it was charging that peppercorn rent when South Wharf had hundreds of employees down there producing glass.</p><p>  He also told me during the call that as long as he produced three bottles a day he would not be in breach of his lease and therefore he could buy the freehold.  When he asked whether I would be prepared to mediate I responded that I would be happy to help if both sides wanted me to do it, but that I did not believe it was right for him to do it.  I think the expression I used to him on the call was something like &ndash; please do not take it literally, I was speaking metaphorically &ndash; that he effectively had a bullet in a gun and he was pointing it at the State, that is, the threat that he could exercise this legal loophole.  I told him that I did not think it was right for him to do that, and what was more, that I felt that my view would be shared by the business community at large.  I said that I would be prepared to mediate but only if he put the gun down, metaphorically speaking of course.</p><p>  He replied that he had a duty to his shareholders to maximise the value of South Wharf.  I replied that I would not be willing to mediate unless he desisted from the threat because I really did not believe he would exercise that threat.  The conversation ended.  I cannot swear to it but I think there was a board meeting because for some reason I have it in my head that he actually rang me on my telephone number in the docklands.  At the earliest opportunity I informed the board fully of the phone call.  Sometime later &ndash; I think it was maybe about a month later &ndash; I received another call from Paul Coulson.  This time he had a different suggestion.  He proposed that the authority should purchase the Dublin Port &amp;amp; Docks Board interest in the site and then we could sit down together and negotiate a deal because trust had broken down.</p></speech>

I cut him off and told him that I was a busy guy with a full-time day job, a pretty busy part-time job and two small children and a wife, who I did not see very often.  I asked him why would I put the authority in a position in which we would buy out the port for the interest - for obviously a significant amount of money - and then were sitting with the gun pointing at us.  I did not want anyone to tell me how I thought about it as that is how I thought about it and so the conversation ended.  As is my wont, I reported that conversation to the board at the very first opportunity.  I do not have the minutes of those meetings but I am sure the authority can get those minutes and I am sure that when all the rest of the board members appear before the committee, they will be able to confirm this.  I did not expect that we would have any change of mind on that but in the second conversation with the board, the board actually said that perhaps there is a role for the authority and perhaps there are some options for the authority that could be in the interests of the authority in terms of its remit.  Deputy, this is the genesis of-----</p></speech>

A sentence in the middle of section 3 of the notes of that meeting states that "following a full discussion, it was agreed that the Authority should offer itself as an arbitrator/negotiator to broker a deal between the two parties".  The two parties to which the minutes refer are Dublin Port and the company that was run by Mr. Coulson.</p></speech>

The sentence then goes on to state one "would see the development potential being unlocked for development by PC [that is Mr. Coulson] with the Port either receiving a capital payment or a percentage of the profits representing the value of its interest".</p></speech>

The minutes go on to state, "it would be better if it could be orchestrated so that the Port requested the Authority to undertake this role".  Mr. Bradshaw should explain what that sentence means.</p></speech>

The minutes were written by Neil Mulcahy.  I also am racking my brains to remember exactly what that meant but I think what was important to us was that we were not foisting ourselves on anyone.  It was important that both South Wharf and Dublin Port would request us to mediate.  I had no interest in any mediation for anyone who did not want to be mediated.  Consequently, I think what it is referring to is that given South Wharf had earlier indicated it would like us to do it, that the port should do the same thing</p></speech>

Is that correct?</p></speech>

It was the board in discussion, as some people were saying there could be, so when the Deputy says "Mr. Bradshaw", I think he is referring to the board and the authority.</p></speech>

Thereafter, in this meeting, which took place after the fractious discussion to which Mr. Bradshaw referred, on 5 October, in the second sentence of section 2 it states "the potential development profit varied from &euro;358 million to &euro;1.1 billion."  For whom was that profit?</p></speech>

It would have been for the owners of the site.  As far as I was concerned, I thought the Dublin Port Company should own it all because it had the freehold.  However, we are all aware of what happened with hindsight, in that South Wharf ended up with two thirds of it and the Dublin Port Company with one third.  They were the two stakeholders, to use that word, of the site.  We were there thinking about whether we could mediate and part of that was trying to figure out if there was going to be room for a mediation.</p></speech>

In other words, if the two parties suddenly made up and, in a hypothetical situation, developed it together, based on whatever estimates the chief executive had made on looking at various assumptions, this was what they could have expected according to the chief executive's analysis at the time, ranging between those two figures.  I think that higher figure was something that Enda Connellan had suggested and I think it goes on to state that independent valuation might suggest that the lower figure was closer to the mark.</p></speech>

Its origin is on a sheet that was circulated by Mr. Paul Maloney, who was the chief executive of the authority at that time, entitled, Issues and Options.  Can Mr. Bradshaw confirm to whom that profit figure on the sheet referred?</p></speech>

However, my understanding is Paul Maloney is suggesting that were the current owners to go ahead and develop the site, based on certain assumptions regarding plot density and the mix between commercial and residential and what price everything would sell for in the end-use market, the development profit would be somewhere between those numbers.</p></speech>

I will move on to a meeting in the following year on Tuesday, 3 October 2006.  It was the 139th meeting and took place in San Sebastian.  Can Mr. Bradshaw indicate to me what happened in the interim?  As a year had elapsed, he should inform the committee what had happened during that period.</p></speech>

Obviously, we set up a sub-committee and met to discuss.  My recollection, which the committee can confirm if and when the chief executive appears or Neil Mulcahy or whoever, is that Paul Maloney and I met Enda - I think at the end of a council meeting.</p></speech>

My recollection is that we had a meeting with him to discuss whether the port would be interested, where were they at, what was the situation and would they be interested in us mediating.  The other thing that is clear from this is we gave up any hope of ever buying the site, given this discussion here, and we felt the key role we could play at this point was to mediate.</p></speech>

I do not think I said I never met him.  I met him once physically at an Anglo Irish Bank annual golf outing.  I think it was in the summer of 2005 but I do not know.  I was introduced to him and he sat at the same table.  There were maybe 200 people at it.  I do not know.  I had just joined the board of Anglo Irish Bank and he was at the same table.  That is the one time I met him in a social situation.  It is the only time I physically met him.</p><p>  I then refer to the two phone calls about which I have told the Deputy.  Looking at the same notes the Deputy has, I think I rang him as a follow-up because that is one of the next steps here and if I was asked to do it, I would do it.  He was not available but he suggested we meet his advisers, which we did.  I want to put on the table that mention has been made of the fact I had a business relationship with Paul Coulson.  I did not.  I was an investor in a syndicate put together by CBRE and Anglo Irish Bank in a property investment.  This was a passive investment.  There were many investors in it.  I have tried to discover whether by the time the IGB purchase came up, I actually knew that he was one of the investors.  I cannot say with certainty but I would like the committee to assume I did.  I think that investment was originally made around May 2005.</p></speech>

I am not sure and cannot honestly say that I knew at that time but I want to take the worst case scenario and for the committee to assume that I did know.  At the time when we get on to the October meetings and the purchase of the IGB site a year later, I would like the committee to assume that.  Am I confusing members?</p></speech>

I just cannot say with certainty that I knew at that time.  I clearly know now and could have read it in the newspapers or maybe I did know.  Let us all assume that I knew.</p><p>  I was a passive investor in that investment.  This was a property syndicate, I was one of the investors and it turns out he was one as well.  It was a passive investment.  Once a year, CBRE would send us an update on what was happening.  I never met Mr. Coulson, never discussed it with him and had absolutely no role in it.  I assume he had no role in it.</p><p>  When we come to the IGB purchase, with all due respect, if anyone would like to suggest that I had a conflict of interest because of that passive investment, my view - members are all welcome to their views - is that I most certainly did not have a conflict of interest.  I had nothing to gain by any actions I took around the purchase of the IGB site.  I hope it is pretty clear from the two conversations I have described to the committee exactly what my position was.</p></speech>

Deputy Donohoe asked a question about what happened.  My recollection is that Paul Maloney and I met the chief executive of Dublin Port Company, Enda Connellan, and also met the advisers to South Wharf.  The upshot of those two conversations was nothing.  I will be perfectly honest with the committee.  I was not too excited about this because I had quite a fractious discussion with Mr. Coulson and subsequently heard from a number of different sources that he found me very difficult to deal with.  I was not particularly excited about spending my time trying to mediate unless people wanted to be mediated.  My feeling was that the minute we suggested the discussion and mediation with the Dublin Port Company, Enda Connellan as CEO said, and I can understand why he would do so, that this was worth a huge amount of money.  When we met Mr. Coulson's advisers, they were very friendly but did not seem particularly interested so that was the end of it.  That is why there was only one meeting of that sub-committee.  It went nowhere.</p></speech>

The first is that I think there was an announcement in June 2006 that Dublin Port Company and South Wharf had reached an agreement whereby it turned out that South Wharf would have two thirds of any consideration and would sell this asset.  I am sure people have the record of all of this.  I have done a good deal of research in preparation for this meeting since I was invited to it.  I think it is in the public domain that there was an agreement that it would sell it provided it exceeded a reserve price of &euro;250 million.  That is the first thing that happened.  We now knew the site was up for sale.  A council meeting was then held in July when this topic came up for discussion and it was agreed that the executive should explore options for whether we should participate in some way in the purchase of the site.  My personal view was that it would be a really good idea if the authority could get into some ownership.  We clearly were not going to be able to afford it on our own.  We can get into all the reasons why we might have wanted to participate but one of the things that really mattered to me was that we had been the underbidder to the Fabrizia site next door to it in 1997 or 1998.  It was a ten-acre site with the AIB sports complex and was next door to the IGB site.  In 1997 or 1998, we had been the underbidder on that site and it had been purchased by a developer around the same time as we purchased the Bord G&aacute;is site, which is the site on Sir John Rogerson's Quay.  Ten years later, which brings us to July 2006, it was fairly clear what had been achieved on the Bord G&aacute;is site we purchased but nothing had happened on the site for which we had been the underbidder in 1997 or 1998.</p></speech>

Just to explain the reality, it is a relatively short period of time from 3 October to whatever.  I think the deadline for the bid or to put in the tender was 25 October.  One has to start somewhere.  One could ask after all this time, should we not have gone and got public procurement advice, but if we had started hiring lawyers to give us that advice and we were spending money, found it was okay and then went and found out that no one was interested in being a joint venture partner with us, we would have just spent more money with lawyers to find out something that was irrelevant.  One has to sequence things somewhere and I think it is, frankly, quite logical that one might say, "Let's see if this is even going to be in the realms of the doable", before one would start going and getting legal advice.

A year had elapsed between the sub-committee meeting and this meeting.  The sequence is as we just discussed.  The chief executive, Mr. Maloney, walked in and referred to a single bidder and the board subsequently got advice on procurement policy.  Should it not be the other way around?</p></speech>

I think in a kind of a practical way one is there saying: "God, it'd be great if we could have some involvement in this site."  I can get into all the reasons having ownership is a good idea.  One is saying: "But how realistic is that going to be?  Are we going to be able to have joint venture partners?"  So one has to start somewhere.  I hear the Deputy's criticism.  Personally, I think it was a pretty pragmatic approach to say: "Let's find out if this is even going to be doable before we get legal advice."  We had not committed ourselves to anything.  The Deputy can say we should have done it the other way and should have paid for legal advice.  I respect his view but I do not agree with it.  I think the way we went at it was a pretty pragmatic approach, to be honest.  The other point about it is there were a lot of developers and there were a few developers whom I think the authority would have been comfortable trying to enter into a joint venture with around something like this.  There were some developers whom I do not think we would have been comfortable with.</p></speech>

The Deputy can come to a view that says that was an inappropriate approach and we should have spent the money on legal advice, even if after spending the money on the legal advice - and as the Deputy now knows there were no public procurement issues - we then found that no one wanted to be a joint venture partner.

I would definitely have known.  I do not believe that Mr. Maloney would have done that without telling me that Mr. Sean Mulryan was no longer interested and proposing a move.  He would not have done that without checking with me.  I would have said that it sounded good.  I cannot remember whether I communicated that individually to the board members.  Therefore, I cannot say whether they all knew before.  We did not have a board meeting between 3 and 20 October.</p></speech>

Consider the minutes of the board meeting on 3 October where a paper was presented.  I do not have the minutes in front of me, but I have noted some of the key points.  I believe I am right in saying that, according to the paper, a 2005 valuation suggested a value of more than &euro;300 million on a 3:1 plot ratio, but that prices would have increased substantially in the year and a bit since then.  Based on recent transactions, the paper suggested a probable value of more than &euro;350 million.  According to a sentence in the paper, advice had been given informally suggesting that tenders would reach &euro;400 million.  All of this happened before 20 October.  These statements were made in the paper to the board on 3 October.  These were the numbers that were floating around.</p></speech>

I can only be honest - we probably assumed that there was going to be one.  Valuation is down to the assumptions that one makes.  There are approximately five key assumptions when one values a site, those being, density and plot ratio, the split between commercial and residential, end use prices, that is, the amount that someone will pay for a house, construction costs and preferred profit margins on the development.  Many valuations were flying around.</p></speech>

Reverting to the paper on 3 October, we had received informal advice to the effect that the tenders would exceed &euro;400 million.

I want to knit together earlier testimony to the committee, including that of Ms Mary Moylan, regarding the nature of the relationship between the board and the then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  A letter supplied to the committee by Ms Moylan at one of our previous meetings is dated 12 October 2012.  It is from Mr. Paul Maloney to Ms Moylan.  Could we provide Mr. Bradshaw with a copy of the letter?</p><p>  In the section on the proposed bid, found on the second page, the first sentence states that the extent of the capital commitment necessary to be paid by the authority and its development partner in the event of a bid being made for the joint site was estimated to be in the region of &euro;220 million.  The chief executive wrote to the Department on 12 October and cited a figure of &euro;220 million, but reference was made to &euro;375 million at a meeting on 20 October, a variance of &euro;155 million.  Will Mr. Bradshaw explain the gap?</p></speech>

By 3 October, it should be clear from the paper to the board that the numbers under discussion were substantially higher than &euro;220 million.  I hear the Deputy's question, but I do not know why the chief executive wrote the letter like that.  I do not doubt that Mr. Maloney will be able to explain to the committee why he wrote it that way.  I do not think that was a correct approach.  He should have said that, for the avoidance of doubt, the number under discussion was considerably higher.  My personal view is that the letter should not have included the number, as we were in a sealed tender bid situation, but that sentence in the letter is misleading.</p></speech>

This was reported to the Board on 20 October 2006 as being based on an assumed plot ratio of 2:1.  Two internal appraisals were carried out by the Authority in 2005 and 2006, which valued the site at &euro;303 million (based on a plot ratio of 3:1) and &euro;264 million (based on a ratio of 2.5:1) respectively.  However, the Authority did not obtain any further independent valuations of the site prior to the bid being placed...</blockquote>This goes to Mr. Bradshaw's point on the plot ratio being critical to the valuation.  The values at ratios of 2:1, 2.5:1 and 3:1 are fairly consistent.  One can see the impact that varying the assumption makes on the values.</p></speech>

As the Comptroller and Auditor General has elaborated, a number of internal valuations placed the site's value at approximately &euro;300 million.  However, a communication to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government cited a figure of &euro;220 million.  Even though the letter is named from Mr. Maloney, he mentioned what was necessary to be bade by the authority.  According to him, the authority was asking that the enclosed be taken to represent official notification to the Minister under the code so that the authority could proceed.  Mr. Bradshaw was chairman of the authority.</p></speech>

She is a person of the highest integrity and the highest capability.  She was sitting at the board table on 3 October when we were discussing a higher number than was mentioned in the letter.  That letter is poorly phrased, but you will have to ask the chief executive.  You may say I should have seen it before it went.  I have to be frank: I do not think it is my responsibility to edit a letter from the CEO to another member of the board in his or her capacity in the Department.  If there had been any issues between Ms Mary Moylan and Mr. Paul Maloney I would be confident that one or other of them would have brought it to my attention.</p></speech>

Ms Moylan explained this in great detail when the committee asked her about this at the last meeting at which this was discussed.  The letter was sent.  I am saying to you honestly that I do not think that letter is well phrased.  I think what it should have said is that the capital outlay would be significantly higher than the valuation we had done a year ago at &euro;240 million or whatever.  That is what I think should have been in the letter.  I did not see the letter before it went.  I think - I am extrapolating a little bit, so help me with this - that at the board meeting on the 20th, as can be seen near the end of the minutes - I do not have them in front of me - there was a reference to the letter and to the number.  There was a discussion about the fact that the plot ratio was different.  Do you see that under the 20th?  I think what happened is that the letter was sent and it was included in our pack.  It went on 12 October from Mr. Paul Maloney to Ms Mary Moylan.  On 20 October, in the board pack that we received, there would have been-----</p></speech>

Section 8.2 of the minutes of the meeting of 24 October states:<blockquote><br />The Board noted that Ministerial sanction to increase borrowing and to the acquisition of shares in a company was expected to be received during the day.  In relation to the book valuation of some &euro;250m which had been included in the Authority's submission to the Minister, it was noted that this figure was based on a plot ratio of 2:1 [not 2.5:1 or 3:1, as the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out] and on the basis that the authority would be acquiring some 49% of the shareholding of the company (as opposed to the 26% in the current transaction).</blockquote>Let me explain what I think happened, based on that.

This means that somebody on the board said, correctly, "Hang on - in our board pack is the submission that we made on the 12th, and the number it refers to is lower than what we are talking about."  That is exactly your point.  A discussion obviously took place, because the minutes say that it was noted that this figure, the &euro;250 million, was based on a lower plot ratio than we were then contemplating, which was going to lead to a higher bid price, and second - more importantly - it was on the basis that we were now talking about procuring only a 26% share rather than a 49% share.  The significance of both of those statements is that the exposure for the authority was not going to change because, as everybody around this table will know, 26% of the big number - &euro;400 million - is more or less the same as 49% of &euro;220 million.</p><p>  I absolutely am going to suggest that when the committee brings in all the board members and the executive, it will be able to clarify this matter.  However, what I think happened is that somebody said that we had sent a letter to the Department - by the way, Ms Mary Moylan was sitting at the table, which I shall come back to in a moment - and asked whether there was a danger that somebody could be misled.  The discussion ensued with Ms Mary Moylan at the table and she was comfortable that she did not need to go back because the approval that we needed from the Minister was an approval that constrained or limited, if you like, our exposure.  Our exposure would not have changed if we were purchasing 26% of something that cost &euro;375 million - in fact, it would be less - instead of 49% of something that cost &euro;220 million.  I apologise for the numbers, but this is the real world.</p></speech>

The committee discussed all of this with Ms Moylan last month and she explained that the key issue for the Department had been to limit the downside exposure, which is clear on the basis of the discussion.</p></speech>

Now here is an interesting question as we proceed with that.  The report states that there was no documentation on audit to suggest that the authority formally notified the Department of its intention to bid a number that was twice that.  That is a true statement.  However, here is another true statement - the No. 2 in the Department was fully aware from 3 October of exactly what the intentions of the authority were.  With the greatest respect, I think it is reasonable of a board to assume that the Department knows when the representative from the Department - the No. 2 in the Department - is fully aware of everything it intends to do.</p><p>  To put it another way, a week later when everybody knew exactly what it was that we bid and what percentage we got, I do not think there is any formal evidence that the Minister for the Environment or the Minister for Finance, or the Department of the Environment or the Department of Finance - there is no documentation - that they formally or informally came back to the authority to say it had misled them because a week later, that information would have been available.  </p><p>  With the greatest respect - the Comptroller and Auditor General's report which I think is a very fair one and that all of these are concerns which absolutely need to be discussed - I have to say that I think as a summary of this discussion a sentence which says, "There is no documentary evidence that the authority formally notified the Department", is a true statement, but it is an incomplete statement of the full events.  I think there should have been two other statements in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The second one should have been, "There is a tonne of documentary evidence that the No. 2 in the Department was fully aware from the beginning of absolutely all our intentions."  There should also be a statement that, "A week later when everybody knew what we had bid, there is no evidence that anybody had any issue."</p></speech>

That is what I mean by politicised.</p></speech>

So it was vulnerable and it had been politicised and the Comptroller and Auditor General went in to do a report and the problem with the one sentence which is in it versus the three sentences which should be in there is that it creates the impression - it is why the Deputy is pressing this the way he is, which I fully accept - that there was some attempt on the part of at least the executive, if not the authority, to conceal some information from the Department of the Environment.  That, unfortunately, is an incorrect conclusion to draw from this.  If the three sentences were in there, we would have a much more complete picture in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and I think this committee might have gone off on a slightly different tack in understanding the probity.  The only issue which matters here - there are other issues, which we will get on to - is the probity and integrity of the authority.</p></speech>

I want to be really clear that I am not saying anything on which Ms Moylan would need to defend herself.  I am saying that Ms Moylan is a woman of the highest integrity and the highest capability but that I do not think it is unreasonable of the board to have assumed the Department knew what it needed to know.  I know the committee had a full discussion on conflicts of interest for Ms Moylan.  My view, in a practical sense, is - and the way it worked in reality - I assumed anything the Department needed to know, it knew-----</p></speech>

Let me be very careful what I say.  I did not assume that after every board meeting Ms Moylan reported everything back to the Department but my ongoing assumption was that if there were things that needed to be discussed or known by the Department about what the authority was doing, she was the Department's representative on our board.  That had been the custom and practice from the very beginning and that if there were things that needed to be discussed or the Department needed to know, she would tell it.</p></speech>

How high does one need to go in the Department before the Department knows?

The issue was that we were having multiple board meetings in a short space of time because we were working to a deadline, 25 October, when the bid had to be in.

We met and the purpose of the meeting, and this became very important in the court case, was to agree the final bid.  On 20 October, we had discussed that our upper limit, which was what the executive recommended, should not go beyond &euro;375 million.  That was the information in my head and we were now to meet to discuss the final bid.</p></speech>

At the meeting on 20 October, the board agreed an upper limit of &euro;375 million.  This was now 23 October and I am referring to the meeting with Bernard McNamara.  I went along to the meeting to agree with Bernard McNamara, the majority shareholder, with 74% of shares.  It was to agree the final bid because we had to have the same number.  That was the purpose of that meeting.  During that meeting, it was not a very long meeting, but the two most significant things I recall are we got Bernard McNamara to agree.  He was of the view that it would take more than &euro;400 million to succeed.  We are all worried about the company next door who bought the other site and there is marriage value so he could maybe bid more.  Bernard McNamara was of the view that it would take more than &euro;400 million and we pointed out that we were not mandated to go beyond &euro;375 million.  There was a discussion of that where Bernard McNamara agreed that any amount north of &euro;375 million we bid would be for his account and at his risk only and that our shareholding would not dilute.  That is a very significant negotiation point for us to have secured.  In fairness to Mr. McNamara, it was not that we were brilliant negotiators, he reasonably readily agreed to that.  We discussed a bid of &euro;411 million.</p><p>  That was one item that was discussed that night.  The other item that was discussed was that at one point Mr. McNamara told us he was switching horses.  We were under the impression, and it was the case, that Royal Bank of Scotland, ie Ulster Bank, was the bank he was talking to.  Ulster Bank was becoming much more active in funding significant property and development deals.  He told us he had switched horses to Anglo Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland.  That was news to me and I was a little surprised.</p></speech>

I am on the board of Anglo Irish Bank so now I have a perceived conflict.  The following morning at the start of the meeting I declared I had a perceived conflict.  I am going to say something that will probably drive you all mad but the truth of the matter is that I did not feel, and to this day I do not feel, that I had any actual conflict.  A conflict of interest is where your judgment can be affected, that you come to the wrong conclusion because you have two different objectives.  The truth of the matter, and I know you must get inside my head to figure what was going on, and I cannot prove that, but it is a statement that is 100% true, there is no way I would ever do anything to influence a decision in the authority because I had either some other interest or some other involvement.  I just would not do it.  I accept absolutely, however, that there was a perception and I announced that conflict because I am on the board of Anglo Irish Bank.  I am non-executive director of the bank, there are eight meetings a year and I would never, nor did any board member, get involved in individual decisions.  I did not pay any attention to who the clients of the bank were, that was not my role as a non-executive director.  That is not what it was about but I declared it.  The way I thought about it, and I can only tell you the way I thought about it, we had a big discussion about it.</p><p>  There were three issues in that meeting.  As I thought about the potential perception of a conflict of interest, the first issue was would we do a joint venture and would we bid for this site.  The second issue was what the final bid price would be that we would agree to.  The third issue was how we would fund it, the bank that would fund it, the terms, the margin, the duration and the security and so.  Those are the three issues.</p><p>  On the first issue, we had already decided we were going to pursue this joint venture for many good reasons you are very familiar with.  That decision had already been made.</p> <p>On the third issue, the bank that will fund it, I would obviously exclude myself from any such discussion.</p><p> That leaves the other issue, the final bid price that all will agree to.  We had held that discussion on the 20th and had agreed that we would go to &euro;375 million but we needed to revisit it and make ourselves comfortable with it.  We than had a conversation with Bernard McNamara on the 23rd and he agreed that anything over &euro;375 would be at his risk, which was fantastic to have achieved on our part, with no dilution of our 26% shareholding.  Then I started thinking whether we would raise our bid price, leave it as it is or how we would feel about it.  My view was that for a big decision - which I know with hindsight we got wrong - for the authority it would not be right for three board members to leave that to the other board members.  I never shirk from taking decisions and I felt it would be a dereliction of duty.</p></speech>

I opened the meeting by saying that we found out some information the previous night from Bernard McNamara, which was that Anglo Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland were in the frame.  That created a situation for three members of the authority.  We discussed that issue.  We were not going to discuss funding or financing at that meeting.  There was only one item on the agenda, whether we were happy with the figure of &euro;375 million that we had agreed.  We discussed whether it was appropriate or not for us to stay in the room for that discussion.</p></speech>

We discussed that and it was agreed that it was okay and if anybody ever asked - I do not think we ever imagined a situation like this - we would just have to explain the facts that it was a big decision and there could be a perception of a conflict around - how could it be that we could make a decision around the bid price that would create for me a material conflict of interest.</p></speech>

I have been very careful and the Chairman has been very generous in allowing me lattiude but I am trying to establish the flow of meetings.  Let me put it to Mr. Bradshaw that he owned shares in this bank.  He had on the telephone line two other gentlemen who had shares in the bank, and shares in two different banks.</p></speech>

Let me restate the question.  Mr. Bradshaw had shares in one bank that was involved in funding this deal.  There were two other individuals involved in it, one of whom was the chief executive of the other bank, Anglo Irish Bank.  No, not at that stage.  He was the chairman of the bank, excuse me.  Each of the three individuals were closely involved with the two banks that were funding this acquisition.</p></speech>

Up until that point, we thought it was Ulster Bank or Royal Bank of Scotland who were funding it.  Let us be real about this conversation.</p></speech>

We were well down the road to a transaction that I believed in my heart was absolutely the right thing for the authority in delivering the metrics that I wanted us to be measured against.  They are out there for everybody to see.  We were well down the line on that.  As it happened we did not change our exposure in the meeting.  Literally, the night before we were due to finalise, we discovered that Anglo Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland were in the frame.  Now the question was what should we do?  I know members will not suggest that we should say we should not do this transaction because of a piece of information we discovered the night before.  The only issue was should I have said that I should leave this meeting for this discussion on the final bid price we were committing to.  That is the only issue.  We discussed that at length and concluded that it is a tricky one but if we ever had to discuss it, we would tell people what was going through our heads.  Members will be aware that we subsequently got legal advice to see whether that was right or wrong.  The legal advise was that not alone had we acted prudently but we erred on the side of caution.  My belief was that we did not act on the side of caution, we had got it just right.</p><p>  I am explaining to members what was going through our heads.  As it happened, we did not change our position on the authority's exposure.  I know there has been much discussion about this - I have seen it in previous minutes of a PAC meeting that we delegated the final decision - and I know that Ms Loretta Lambkin has read out at a meeting that in recognising Bernard McNamara's expertise we would delegate a decision up to &euro;430 million.  Let us be clear, it was not difficult for us to do that when Bernard McNamara had accepted that anything over &euro;375 million would be at his risk.  In my opinion that was not some dereliction of duty on our behalf.</p></speech>

To return to the latter part of the discussion, on the tender bid, the line in the minutes states that the board agreed that the tender bid should be in the sum of &euro;411 million.  We have gone from approximately &euro;300 million up to &euro;375 million and now up to &euro;411 million, but the board has delegated the authority to Mr. McNamara to bid up to &euro;437 million.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

That was a pretty good situation to arrive at for the authority.  That is what allowed us say that Mr. McNamara could go higher, because it was at his sole risk as the 76% shareholder and not at the risk of the authority.</p></speech>

Members will recall that I mentioned in my opening statement that there were a few issues that needed to be sorted out.  The first issue, and my immediate response at the time was, "That sounds like a fantastic project but I cannot do it because I have got a conflict of interest."  They asked what it was.  I said that I had two minor shareholdings in two property syndicates in the docklands, a 4% interest and an 8% interest.  I said I had clearly got a perception of a conflict so I could not do this.  The Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, said, "No, that is not the way it works."  He said that to get the people of the right calibre, willing to do a project like this, it would be a case that there would be lots of conflicts for lots of people and that the thing to do was just manage them in a transparent way.</p><p>  I have to say I was very impressed with both Ministers, for a very particular reason, not alone for the way they set out the vision of what they were trying to achieve but that they also said they were not interested in making appointments based on political affiliation.  One of the reasons they were talking to me was that I was completely apolitical.  There had been much talk down through the years of how appointments were made to boards such as this.  I was impressed with the integrity of the way they spoke about how they saw the vision of the area and what they were trying to achieve with the social and economic situation.  I took both Ministers at their word and that the issue was to manage everything in a transparent fashion.</p><p>  I went along to the first board meeting in 1997 and told that story and announced my conflict of interest.  I wanted it written into the record.  If one goes back and gets the minutes of the first board meeting one will see it as it is there for all to see.  I expected everybody else to behave in exactly the same way.  We worked hard at how to deal with conflicts of interest.  Many years later, in 2009, one can imagine my shock when I read an article by a journalist, Nick Webb, who said he had discovered this secret that I had these two interests, as if it was some poorly kept secret.  I was completely shocked.  I had announced it at my first board meeting.  I was doing exactly what the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, and the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Brendan Howlin, had suggested I do.  We spent much time over the years talking, discussing, getting advice as to how to manage conflicts of interest, upgrading our advice and thinking it through in great detail.

The point Mr. Bradshaw made is that the State did not lose money as a result of the DDDA's purchase of the Irish Glass Bottle site, in fact it made money.  The point he referred to here is that the Dublin Docklands Development Authority did lose money but on the other side of the ledger is the money the Dublin Port Company made.  Based on that, he is concluding that the State did make money out of it.</p></speech>

I am here today as the former chairman of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  Is the Deputy suggesting that the board of the authority in 2006 should be held accountable for decisions made by privately owned banks then and for the following two or three years and the decisions of Government and Ministers for Finance both in 2008 and 2009?  Is the Deputy suggesting that the board of the authority is responsible or should be held accountable?  Would he recognise that at the point at which the authority was making this decision it had an expectation in foresight that the bank that was lending the money was a privately-held institution?  This is such an important point because people have said - and have confused this issue - that the taxpayer has lost money.  All I want to do is assure the taxpayer, based on the behaviour of the board of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, not decisions that were made in latter years, the State and the taxpayer did not lose money.  In fact the State made a gain as I have described it.  That is really important to me.</p><p>  I acknowledge that the authority lost money.  I am happy to hold my hand up and say I was the chairman of a board that made a decision that at this moment in time I cannot escape from the fact that the authority lost money.  I am absolutely willing to accept that and I would like to discuss that at some point and how I feel about that.  Please, I do not think it is fair of anybody on this committee to suggest that the board of the authority should be held responsible for decisions by banks and Ministers for Finance in years afterwards.</p></speech>

I am saying that at the moment when the authority made a decision, as a joint venture partner, to agree to a bid, albeit we are limited at 375 million, but &euro;412 million, on the exact opposite side of that transaction, it is precisely because we were paying so much that the State made so much.

This is really important.  Based on the decision made by the board of the authority in 2006, when that transaction had been completed with everything that we knew at that time, even acknowledging the &euro;52 million that the authority's loss crystallised at, the State had made money because the Dublin Port Company had received &euro;138 million, the taxpayer did not lose money.</p></speech>

However, in 1998 we took a very significant risk because no matter what analysis was made, we could not understand the cost of contamination.  We could not get to the bottom of that matter.  So much so, that at the time many commentators and critics &ndash; it is easy to be a critic - said we had exposed the State to unlimited liability.

As I said in my opening remarks, I am trying to achieve a balance.  The decision was made with all of the facts and imperfect information we had available in 1998, as I said in my opening statement and as is stated in the appendix to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The benefit of the decision was that we spent &euro;70 million and made &euro;200 million.  As a result, we were ahead economically, which is what stated is on pages 62 and 63 of the report.  We were up by &euro;130 million, not taking into account all of the other things done that mattered most to me and delivered our metrics.  When the committee comes to its conclusions about how to describe what we did in those ten years, including the loss of &euro;52 million which I acknowledge, I ask it to try to put it in a broader context.  I am not trying to say we did something once and that, therefore, we did it again.  I ask the committee to have a balanced view of the overall performance of the authority.  In the real world one has to make decisions, often with imperfect information.  There are a number of criticisms made in the report.  Could we have done more?  Yes, we could have.  Should we have sought a formal valuation and paid &euro;50,000 for it?  Yes, we should have.  However, one has to make decisions with imperfect information and one lives or dies on the basis of them.  I ask the committee to take all of the decisions made over the ten years into account.</p></speech>

I suspect some people in this room bought property in 2006 and obtained formal valuations.  I presume that in 2006 the OPW obtained formal valuations and explained it had spent &euro;43 million for land that is now worth &euro;500,000.  Many purchases were made on the backs of valuations from banks which funded developments not too far from this site in Ballsbridge, which are now worth 10% of their former value.  These valuations were made by professional, independent valuers who, I presume, were well paid.  I accept the Deputy's point - we should have obtained formal valuations but there is an inconvenient truth about this if we had got that formal valuation and the number we would have got.   Guess what, Mr. McNamara obtained a formal valuation, albeit after the bid had been made, and it was &euro;412 million.</p></speech>

The valuation made was more like &euro;240 million. </p><p>  I want to finish my point.  We know the valuations were made professionally on sites now worth 10% of their former valuation.  I am not trying to excuse what happened.  I acknowledge that we should have obtained a formal valuation.  I have no doubt an independent valuation from the same people who had informally told us the value would be in the region of &euro;400 million would have indicated the same thing.  Does the Deputy suggest that if we had obtained a formal valuation, it would have come in at &euro;200 million or at a much lower number?  Does the Deputy honestly believe this?</p></speech>

I do not want to get into that.  I would be very surprised if Declan McCourt, who was on the board of Bank of Ireland, knew.  You will have to ask him, Chairman.

To be honest, I had anticipated that members would ask me certain questions.  All the questions were very fair.  I was concerned that conclusions would be drawn too early, but that is clearly not the case.  I assumed members would ask me whether I have any regrets.  I just want to say that I do.  I have a regret that the authority lost money on this.  To make that real for me, the biggest regret I have is that there are schools in the docklands that we were going to subsidise by giving land and &euro;6 million to the Department of Education to have them built.  That was a primary school for girls and a primary school for boys.  That is my deepest regret that the project is not going ahead.  That is the real damage of the fact that the authority lost money.</p><p>  I know this is probably quite naive but a little bit of me hoped that maybe the beneficiaries of that transaction would step into the breach.  What we now know with hindsight is that, as has been mentioned, this site is now apparently valued at &euro;45 million, and that meant the Dublin Port Company&rsquo;s stake, had it held onto it, would be &euro;15 million, and it got a cheque for &euro;138 million.  It made a windfall gain of &euro;120 million and a little bit of me had hoped &ndash; I know this is naive but I am still going to say it &ndash; that it might have seen its way to stepping into the breach to provide the &euro;6 million, which would be only a very small percentage of that gain, and that it would step in to allow the schools to proceed, or that the other beneficiaries, the South Wharf shareholders, might do something.  I know that is naive but it needs to be said because the thing that is most difficult about this is that there are children in the docklands who are not getting the educational establishment they should, and that is deeply disappointing to me.  I know the reason that has happened is because we made a decision in 2006 that has backfired.  That is a fact.</p><p>  There is one other clarification I wish to make before getting to my concluding statement.  I have been told by a number of my oldest friends that they believe from their conversations that the public think that I was a full-time chairman of the authority and that I earned large sums from the State for doing this job.  I am grateful that the position has been clarified following questions.  I wish to set the record straight on that.  When I was asked by the Ministers to do this - this is one of the other issues I had at the start - I explained that I had a full-time job as a director of McKinsey globally and I was a managing partner of McKinsey Ireland.  I had two very young children aged two and one at the time and I was genuinely worried that if I took this on, I would not have the wherewithal or the time to devote to it.</p></speech>

In respect of the reference to the need to correct the report on the matter of the recommendation of the executive to the board about proceeding, the phrase I used in my opening statement was that while it pointed to an overheated market, it recommended that the project should proceed for strategic reasons.  That is a summarisation of the way the recommendation was presented when it was presented to the board.  In paragraph 3.14, we quote exactly what the recommendation was, namely, that "the Executive recommended that the Authority should, if possible, get involved with a partner or partners to develop the site if the DDDA was to achieve its objectives under the Master Plan for the Poolbeg area".  That is the way it was phrased in the minutes.  I interpreted that in my opening statement as recommending that it go ahead for strategic reasons even though it was in an overheated market.  I think that is an accurate representation of the recommendation so I do not feel I need to correct the report in that regard.  I do not want to be particularly combative about it but I would like to make that point.  </p><p>  Another point related to my estimation of a 17% loss to Dublin Port.  That is the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's view.  My predecessor and I do not take the view that it was a 17% loss.  The failure to close the loophole in the law meant that property the State had full ownership of was sold and the State in the person of Dublin Port only received one third of that value.  It is a two thirds loss rather than a 17% loss.  </p><p>  Ms Moylan and the situation in which she found herself was discussed at a previous meeting.  We do refer to the situation she was in where she had fiduciary duties to the board and there was the potential for conflict where she had information as a board member which she was not at liberty to transmit back to the Department.  That is something that needs to be addressed.  The Department has addressed it in an practical way by separating the representational aspect for the Department from the line responsibilities so that should not arise in the future.  </p><p>  The next point probably touches on some of the points made by Mr. Bradshaw at the end.  Overall, we had a very significant concern around the quality of the analysis of a very substantial investment.  The expectation would be that a public body would not just keep within the control parameters set in terms of borrowing limits but would ensure that there is a very thorough business case commensurate with the scale of the investment.  Reference was made earlier to trying to tease out the sequence of events in 2005 and into 2006.  Overall, there is a problem with the quality of the records relating to this joint venture.  I take the point that individuals can be interviewed but the public record must be comprehensive.  It should include everything.  It should include complete records of who met who and what decisions were taken and there should be no scope for dispute around them.  I realise that this is in an ideal world.  Records will be fallible but we must certainly strive for a good quality of record to be kept of all matters pertaining to investment decisions.</p></speech>

We are meeting this afternoon to consider the Revised Estimates for Public Services at the Department of Social Protection, Vote 37.  As Members will have seen the 2013 Revised Estimate was presented to the D&aacute;il in a new programme-based format.  This means that the Estimate, as presented, contains the following information for each programme: how the money allocated to the programme is proposed to be spent and the previous year's outturn in each case; the number of staff assigned to work in connection with the programme and how that compares with the previous year; and performance-related information, which is departmental outputs with the corresponding information for previous years and what are termed performance and impact indicators with the previous year's information also.</p><p>  Administrative expenditure for the Vote as a whole is summarised in more detail than previously.  The Revised Estimate gives us an opportunity to review whether the target set out and the distribution of money across the Vote are appropriate in all the circumstances and demonstrate the best use of resources.  It also gives us an opportunity to explore the issues facing the Minister in terms of the 2014 allocation for her Department.</p><p>  The timetable for today's meeting has been circulated and agreed.  It allows for a brief opening statement by the Minister and then a discussion of each programme involving questions from members.</p><p>  The Minister is accompanied by Ms Niamh O'Donoghue, Secretary General, Mr. John Conlon, assistant secretary, Mr. Denis Moynihan, principal officer, Mr. Tony Crean, assistant principal, Mr. Vincent Kennedy, assistant principal, and Ms Clare Conway, assistant principal.  I invite the Minister to make her opening remarks.  We would like her to remain within the allotted five minutes.  I will inform her when the five minutes is up so that she can begin to conclude.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-26a.394" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22013062600003#B00400"><p>I thank the Chairperson and members for the invitation to discuss the 2013 Revised Estimates for my Department.  I will try to keep my opening statement as brief as possible.</p><p>  The Department has supplied material for the use of the committee in the changed format designed to better reflect the new performance budgeting approach to the Estimates process.  My officials will continue to work with the committee and Oireachtas officials to refine this approach.  Since becoming Minister, I have overseen a programme of policy and organisational change unprecedented in the history of the Department.  As part of this, the Department has successfully completed one of the most significant mergers in the history of the Irish public service, while at the same time reducing expenditure and meeting increased demand for benefits.  The merger involved the transfer of more than 1,700 posts and a variety of schemes and services from other Departments to the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>  The Department has smoothly implemented the transfer while dealing with the three fundamental forces transforming its operations.  These include reduced budgets and greater demand for schemes arising from the economic crisis; moving from the passive benefits provider of old to a public employment service that is actively assisting people back to work, training or education; and the reality of demographic change that is increasing the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people year-on-year.  In 2013, I had to make provision for an additional &euro;190 million for the increasing number of pensioners.  I have had to seek additional funds every year since I became Minister.  Since 2009, the Department has implemented cost-saving measures which have cumulatively reduced expenditure by more than &euro;3 billion.  At the same time, the number of people in receipt of a weekly welfare payment has increased from 1.209 million people at the end of 2008 to 1.476 million people at the end of May this year &ndash; an increase of approximately 267,000 people.  Therefore, it can be fairly said that the Department has risen to the challenge of implementing unprecedented structural reform while contributing significantly to the necessary consolidation in the public finances and, most importantly, offering a safety net to those who need it.</p><p>  In 2013, the Department will spend &euro;20.243 billion on a wide range of schemes, services and administration.  At the end of May, 1,476,000 persons were in receipt of a weekly payment in respect of 2,283,000 beneficiaries, as well as a further 614,000 families in receipt of a monthly child benefit payment for approximately 1.2 million children.  The scale of these numbers alone means that our payments and services impact on the lives of almost everybody in the State.  The immediate impact of the social transfers we make has an impact on poverty levels.  Social transfers reduce the at-risk-of-poverty levels in the State by more than 60% - the most effective performance in the EU.  The second impact of our expenditure, which is sometimes forgotten, is the contribution it is making to the country&rsquo;s economic recovery.  The spend of my Department puts money in the tills of almost every business and shop in the State in a very immediate way as our customers spend their benefits and pensions each week, thereby maintaining domestic employment and economic activity.</p></speech>

I refer members to the departmental brief on page 7 of the circulated document and the briefing material from the committee secretariat on page 5.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-26a.397" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1059" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22013062600004#C00300"><p>I thank the Minister for her presentation.  To clarify, she mentioned an increase in the number of social welfare recipients since 2008.  Will she give us the figures again?</p><p>  During the debate on the Social Welfare Bill we went through the various proposed cost-saving measures, to which the Minister has referred in her opening statement, including the reductions in the respite care grant, back to school clothing and footwear allowance, household benefits scheme and so on.  The calculation at the time, working on the Minister for Finance's figures, was that the total savings, excluding the changes to child benefit, would be in the order of &euro;178 million.  We pointed out that in a reply we had received to a parliamentary question the Minister for Finance had indicated that an increase of 3% in the universal social charge applicable on the portion of incomes above &euro;100,000 would yield &euro;200 million.  Introducing that change, we argued, would eliminate the need for these cuts to the social protection budget.  That proposal was, apparently, discussed but ultimately jettisoned in favour of a mansion tax, which I understand will this year yield the massive sum of &euro;600,000.  Will the Minister comment on this?</p><p>  The departmental briefing material indicates that the expenditure ceiling for 2013 was &euro;20.243 billion, which amounts to a decrease of &euro;483 million, or 2.3%, on the provisional outturn for 2012.  There is no indication, however, of the actual outturn for last year.  The Minister will recall that just before the budget last year, this committee sanctioned a Supplementary Estimate of more than &euro;600 million.  How does that additional allocation factor into the outturn figures?</p><p>  In regard to the projections for 2014, the Minister has indicated that an additional &euro;440 million in savings are targeted.  I agree with her view that social welfare expenditure contributes enormously to sustaining the domestic economy.  I note, too, her recent public statement that an additional &euro;440 million reduction in her budget in the next round of expenditure cuts would be a bridge too far and her indication of an intention to reduce that level of savings.  What is her current position in this regard?  Will she comment on the suggestions from certain quarters that the pressure on the public finances has eased in the wake of the agreement on the promissory note and other matters and that the dividend arising therefrom might be used to reduce projected cuts in social protection spending?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-26a.398" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22013062600004#C00400"><p>The Deputy asked about the increase in the number of social welfare recipients.  The figure for 2008 was 1,208,883, or 1,799,875 million if beneficiaries are included.  By 2012, that figure had risen to 1,469,202, or 2,259,807 including beneficiaries.  I have made the point before that we have very happy demographics in this country at both ends of the life cycle.  Almost every year, without particularly drawing attention to it, we pay out an additional &euro;190 million to &euro;200 million to cater for people reaching retirement age.  It is a happy fact that retired people in this country are living much longer than was the case in the past.  At the other end of the scale, our birth statistics and child population demographics are the envy of countries such as Germany.  The reality, however, is that these fortunate demographics come at a cost.  Our significant population of children and young people is costly in terms of payments such as child benefit and in the provision of services such as education and health, just as increased life expectancy carries a cost in terms of State provision for older people.</p><p>  On the Deputy's question about the universal social charge, without wishing to get political about this, I recall a discussion I had with the late Deputy Brian Lenihan prior to its introduction.  We shared the same constituency and had that discussion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-26a.400" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22013062600005#D00200"><p>The Minister mentioned the social welfare and social transfer contribution to local economies.  Any cut or change in the amounts given, taking into account the figures given here, of &euro;484 million less in terms of social welfare payments or supports and &euro;190 million the previous year, makes a combined sum of over &euro;670 million which is no longer in the local economy.  While it has always been recognised that the social transfer supports attempt to eradicate poverty and contribute to the local economy, removing that much from the local economy has a detrimental effect which can also add to the numbers dependent on social welfare or State supports.  That is something to be borne in mind, especially given that the indications, based on these figures, are of a further cut of &euro;300 million or &euro;400 million next year, depending on the number of people going into employment.  There are other factors but I think &euro;440 million is the figure.  It could be higher or lower.  We have seen estimates vary.</p><p>  The Minister said that we do not highlight the increase in the pension.  An extra &euro;190 million is contributed.  That may be a case of not being able to manage our own figures.  The census could give a closer indication of how many people should be on that payment alone.  It is not an exact science but &euro;190 million is a large number to be out by every year.  Each year the revised estimate has to come up with another &euro;190 million because we have underestimated the number of people dependent on non-contributory pensions.  That shows the urgency and importance of getting our figures right.  Is &euro;440 million the figure?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-26a.401" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22013062600005#D00300"><p>Those of us who are privileged to work in the field of social protection see the human side of what can be rather dry figures for other Departments, which engaged in overall financial management.</p><p>  On the point about retired people and pensioners, the Department has absorbed between an extra &euro;190 million to &euro;200 million of additional costs every year.  We have never made a big issue about it partly because in this and previous governments it has always been accepted that we provide for our pensioners.  Socially, that is the absolutely correct thing to do but because the Deputies are experts in the field it is important that they be aware of it.  We simply bear it.  It is not an issue that is in any way a cause of contention in this Government or as I understand it, in the previous Administration because people accept that we are lucky to live in a country where there are older people who are living longer.  It is a significant burden nonetheless.  The risk of poverty rate for older people in 2010 was 9.6%.  That was a big decline on the 2004 rate which was 27.1%.  The significant increases in the rate of retirement pension contributed largely to that decline in those years.  That is a very significant social achievement which we would all, across party lines, stand over and seek to protect and defend.</p><p>  The indicative demands which are set out for next year and subsequent years are very significant.  The critical point to understand is that the Department is demand-led.  We respond to valid requests from people for income support.  The numbers of people benefiting from the Department's schemes, compared with the end of 2008 has gone up from 1.2 to approximately 1.5 million  That has put a huge pressure on expenditure.  The Department has taken cuts but we must take three things into account: the demographics factors, population changes and demand.  The biggest increased level of demand is from people who lost their jobs after the bank crash and I suppose one does not hear on the Anglo Irish Bank tapes that after the crash this country lost 350,000 jobs.  We fell off a cliff in the following three years.  That had an enormous impact on social welfare costs and the Social Insurance Fund.  As people return to work some of those pressures ease.  I remind members that of the fund in the actuarial review, the shortfall in 2011 was &euro;1.5 billion, on expenditure of &euro;9 billion.</p></speech>

The spend on all employment supports has increased by &euro;100 million, or by 10.7%.  The Deputy will recall that in the budget we expanded the number of placements in areas such as the community employment, T&uacute;s and JobBridge programme and the new local authority social employment scheme by 10,000.  We are putting intense resources into the activation model, the new Intreo.  We have opened offices in various parts of the country and hope to open more.  We will come to all of this in the context of each programme heading.</p></speech>

In an effort to be helpful to her, I draw attention to my question to which she did not respond.  I take it that she is determined to persist with her efforts to minimise the impact on the Department of Social Protection when the next Government Estimates are agreed.  I will strongly support her in that regard.</p></speech>

The detailed discussions on the budget have not yet commenced.  The Department and I are involved in intense training for the anticipated detailed discussions.  The Department has a really important role to play in helping the country to get back on its feet.  That is why we have a three point mission, namely, to pay people their entitlements, to help people to get back to work through education and training and to limit and reduce fraud and abuse in the system.  If we can get these three points working effectively, that will send a very positive message to the people who pay tax and PRSI and who are happy to support a good welfare structure and state.  I am convinced that there is a lot of public support for this, if it is efficient, targeted and helps people to get back to work.</p></speech>

The Minister will have noticed, from the figures available to her within the Department, that the risk of poverty among this segment of the population has grown since 2010.  The basic rates of social welfare have remained untouched.  Nevertheless, if one takes into account the fact that provision for social welfare is decreasing and that inflation, although not the problem it once was, is still a factor, it is likely that the figures will get worse during the course of the year.  Does the Minister have any idea of what the relevant figures will be at the end of 2012 and 2013?  Are there comparative statistics from other OECD or EU countries for the percentage of people in that age cohort at risk of poverty?</p><p>  I refer to output targets.  The Department sets its own targets and marks itself on whether it achieves them.  I am not sure what the targets are.  There is a reference to processing times of pension applications.  Can somebody tell me what they are?  Were they changed recently?  Are they subject to regular review?  Are they published anywhere?  What is the current position on the Department achieving its targets?</p><p>  In regard to control measures, the 2013 target indicates that the average saving per review is &euro;4,750.  In 2012 the amount achieved per review was &euro;3,500.  This will result in a very considerable shortfall.  I understand there is a shortfall of &euro;40 million against this target.  Are we assuming that in 2013 we will reach the &euro;4,750 target and at the same time have fewer reviews?  Perhaps the Minister might clarify the position.</p></speech>

The Department of Social Protection has carried out an analysis of the social impact of budget 2013 which we have published and is on the Department's website.  It shows that the at risk of poverty rate is likely to be unchanged as a result of the welfare and direct income tax measures in the budget. </p><p>  Reducing the level of poverty is a process which takes time, which is reflected in the design of the ten year national action plan for social inclusion.  The Europe 2020 target is based on a ten year timeframe from 2010 to 2020.  In addition, there can be short-term variations in poverty trends from year to year.  It is important to focus on the long-term pattern. </p><p>  We prioritise the population living in consistent property as a group which experiences the worst effects of poverty.  This includes persons who might not be able to afford a hot meal every other day, warm clothes and so on.  There are indicators of which we know which indicate someone is quite poor.  A lot of factors influence the national social targets for poverty reduction and the key factor is employment, that is, earning enough money to be able to sustain a reasonably decent standard of living.</p></speech>

I have no issue with the &euro;190 million extra that must be paid.  I am not seeking to make an issue of it.  However, it is a substantial amount of money, the equivalent of 15,000 additional pensioners coming out of nowhere.  That means there is something wrong with the forecasting or the interrogation of censuses and so forth.  Where do an additional 15,000 pensioners appear from to claim the payments?  That means somebody is getting the figures wrong.  Obviously the State must step in and cover them, but it is a huge figure, especially if it is additional each year, as appears to be the case.  There is a new figure each year.  There might be a way of explaining that.</p></speech>

We do not make an issue of it; we just do it, and absorb it into the Estimates.  That was done in previous Administrations.  It is the correct thing to do.  An alternative system of government accounting in other jurisdictions, which I am not advocating, could involve cash limits on the total spend in a particular area.  If there are more people that cake is still there but as there are more people eating the cake, one must cut.  Instead, we do what I consider to be the correct thing - that is, to absorb it into the Estimates.  However, many people and commentators do not notice it.  In general conversations about pensioners they know that at present there are 5.3 people working for every one of our retired people and that by 2050 that will have decreased to only two people at work for every retired person.  That is one of the reasons I encourage people to build up pension savings additional to their retirement pensions - because it provides them with a stronger income in retirement and, as a consequence, a more comfortable lifestyle.</p></speech>

My problem is not with that.  In planning for next year the Department will prepare an estimate of what needs to be spent on pensions.  Somebody will calculate the current number of pensioners, the number that will die and the number that will come on stream.  The problem is that when that figure is calculated there is a difference of approximately 15,000 additional people who appear to come on stream out of nowhere.  The issue is the figure, not whether we should absorb it.</p></speech>

We know about it and we factor it into the base.  In other words, to use the Deputy's example, if we are catering this year for 400,000 pensions and we know there will be an increase to 415,000 pensioners, we factor that into the baseline Estimates of the Department.  However - this is the issue to which the Deputy is referring - the consequence of that is that there is an automatic driver, as the increase in the numbers increases the expenditure.  If somebody looked only at the expenditure, he or she would notice that the expenditure on pensions is going up a great deal, but the driver of that is that the number of people qualifying to claim a pension is increasing and, quite correctly, we factor that into the Department's base.  We probably do not get as much credit for absorbing this as we ought to get when people are debating the social welfare system, but it is important that we absorb it so that somebody coming to retirement age can be confident that he or she will get his or her retirement pension.</p></speech>

However, we are making the wrong assumptions if we are missing 15,000 people in our projections.  If the Department projects that the expenditure will be a certain amount, but by the middle of the year it decides it is an extra &euro;190 million, that is the equivalent of 15,000 pensioners.  However, I will leave it at that.</p><p>  The other issue is control savings.  As this is the first section, it relates to most areas.  Every year the control savings - that so much can be gained or is unspent - are a major focus of the media.  It is a saving because it is money that is not spent for the rest of the year.  In the pensions area saving for this year due to control reviews is &euro;157 million.  Again, as modernisation takes place and various sections within the Department work together, I presume that figure should decrease, given that more accurate records will be kept.</p></speech>

The savings target for 2013 is &euro;710 million.  As he said, the ambition is higher than it was last year by &euro;40 million.  In other words, there is an increase of &euro;40 million on what was achieved in 2012.</p><p>  Every year we have increased the number of reviews with a consequent prevention of further expenditure.  Unfortunately, from the point of view of social welfare, as Deputy O'Dea and, in particular, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh will know, it does not mean that savings sorts us out with the Department of Finance because it is the prevention of further expenditure that would have happened had we not carried out the reviews.  However, it does mean that spending is much more targeted at the people who are entitled to the money.  </p><p>  Control reviews relate to the perceived risk of fraud, error or other loss and are generally reviewed regularly for effectiveness.  Scheme managers across the Department adjust the number of reviews undertaken throughout the year and depend on a number of factors, including the return from different projects.  If a project is started and shows a significant return then we might extend that particular examination countrywide.  If a project starts in Carlow-Kilkenny then we will extend it countrywide.</p><p>  Most savings on pensions result from a review of estates.  After a pensioner has died his or her estate, if he or she has one, will be reviewed.  Often people will have continued to claim a non-contributory pension, for example, but his or her estate's details will show that he or she did not continue to have an entitlement.  I shall outline what happens when a pensioner or retired individual applies for a means tested old age pension.  At the time he or she applies for a pension he or she might have a particular set of financial circumstances.  Some years later his or her financial circumstances might have changed.  Perhaps a sibling or family member died and left him or her their savings.  Circumstances might have changed and, therefore, a person's qualification for a full non-contributory pension would be changed.  The Department conducts a control check of estates and matches data.  Obviously the Revenue Commissioners and the estates and probate offices have a great deal of data which the Department will examine.  If it appears that a person has claimed an entitlement that he or she no longer had then we will seek to recover that money from the estate.  Overall, that accounts for about 11% of the overpayment cases from which we seek recovery. </p></speech>

I know that the Minister mentioned it as I joined the meeting.</p><p>  How significant is that measure in the Department?  Does it drive policy?  Is it measured first and then the Department tries to rationalise it?  Does the Department carry out an internal assessment on the potential impact budgets might have on a measure?</p></speech>

They work in conjunction with the European organisations on European data.  Of course the major analysis and collection of the data is normally done by the CSO and the Survey of Income and Living Conditions in Ireland, SILC.  This is a specialist area which was once done by Combat Poverty but during the last Administration the agency was abolished.  The people in the combat poverty field who remained as civil servants now work in my Department and constitute the core of the social inclusion division.</p><p>  The Government has a set of consistent poverty targets that must be taken into account when formulating budgets.  A couple of months ago we published the social impact assessment, as it is now called and to use the terminology that is evolving in the EU.  We published it on the Department's website.  It shows the impact the budget had on different categories of people and the impact in terms of consistent poverty.  The assessment constitutes a basket of achievements and people who are deemed to suffer consistent poverty are unable to achieve a number of them.  International statisticians compile the assessment to reflect a modest but minimum standard of income such as having warm food and clothes and being able to buy shoes or heat a home properly.</p><p>  We also have the European Union targets for 2020.  The targets were set in 2010 and aim to lift 20 million people in the European Union out of poverty by 2020.  Since the financial crisis in the European Union the target has gone way off and that distresses me.  The biggest factor in reducing the achievement of poverty reduction is unemployment. </p></speech>

I welcome the Minister's warning that people should not rely on the State pension.  When I was self-employed I paid into a pension for nearly 17 years but I received my first statement only since the Government took office.  I was taken aback by it and did not know what the statement was for.  For 16 years I did not know what had happened to my pension.  Thankfully, the Government has introduced rules and regulations for pension schemes, and firms must give statements.</p><p>  Unfortunately, we are in the terrible situation that many people cannot afford a private pension and we will face serious problems ahead.

The OECD has an expertise in the area and has long advised us on systems for education, health and social protection, how we compare with the most developed countries in the world and how we might improve our different systems.  We commissioned the OECD report which stated that Ireland has done well with its State retirement pension in all categories.</p><p>  Deputy Butler referred to a sustainable pension system in the light of population changes and investment challenges.  However, I do not have the time to go into great detail about the OECD report.  Perhaps the committee could arrange a public meeting on the matter or it could meet my officials at the Department for a direct briefing on the OECD report.  I am happy with whichever the committee chooses.</p><p>   The OECD recommended two options if we want adequate pension levels, as Deputy Butler mentioned, to provide a decent standard of living in retirement: either a mandatory supplementary pension that would be organised by the State, or an auto-enrolment structure.  The latter would mean that once a person commences work he or she would be automatically enrolled in a supplementary pension scheme, above and beyond the social welfare pension.  However, we could only adopt either option when the economy picks up.  We know that people are very tight with their money and face a lot of challenges related to debt and so on.  As the country recovers Ireland should opt for auto-enrolment, and I have said that publicly before.  It would mean that a person would be automatically enrolled in a pension scheme under his or her own name.  I want people to be secure in the knowledge that if they put their money away a future government cannot take it, as happened with the National Pensions Reserve Fund after the bank collapse.  Such a scheme would take an amount of work but it would provide adequacy.  We then need to modernise the system.  We need to provide clear information on charges and to give reports to people regularly, and we need transparency.  The current social welfare legislation will introduce additional changes to facilitate such a pension scheme.  I will also establish a pensions council which will advise me, as Minister, on what is in the best interest of consumers and the people who will pay into the pension funds, and on how their needs will best be served.  </p><p>  The pensions industry in Ireland employs many thousands of people.  We want reasonable charges, good investment policies and to know how a fund is doing.  We also need to provide equity across the system.  Only 50% of people have signed up for a supplementary or private pension.  Many women and younger people move in and out of employment so tend not to have a supplementary pension.  Many women may be dependents of retired people when they reach pension age themselves.  Pensions are a very big social issue for Irish society.  It would be great if we could set up systems over the next couple of years and thus provide for people in 20, 30 and 40 years' time. </p></speech>

I hope the economy will pick up before we introduce the scheme.  I welcome the initiative.  A person who contributes to a pension is entitled to information on the scheme.  Unfortunately, under the old system no information was provided and transactions were conducted behind closed doors.  Even if a person contributed to a pension he or she would need a crystal ball to know its value and the commission charged.</p></speech>

The target is 90% within six weeks.  In 2012, 76% was achieved.  In 2013, we are on 82%.  One of the significant reasons for the improvement is the new system in the Intreo offices which is being rolled out.  I do not know if the Deputy has had an opportunity to visit an Intreo office yet.  I extended an invitation to the committee and I think some people went to King's Inn Street or to another office to look at it but I repeat the invitation to any Deputy who has not taken the opportunity to visit an office.  The target for jobseeker's benefit is 90% in three weeks.  In 2012, it was 83% and in 2013, it remains at 83%.</p><p>  The Intreo offices are basically allowing us, through reception, to give people the correct application forms when they arrive in.  From that, we can give them a fairly rapid appointment in jobseekers' offices.  Sometimes it is on the same day but it is certainly within a week.  They then have a specific appointment to discuss their application and establish their entitlement.</p><p>  In terms of jobseeker's benefit appeals, in 2012, it took 42 weeks - that is in regard to means testing - and in regard to jobseeker's allowance appeals, it took 36 weeks.  As of Monday, 24 June, the number of appeals on hand is 16,000.  That is down from more than 20,000 at the start of the year.</p><p>  I spoke to Deputies before about the changes in Intreo.  Additionally, we went through a system of changing the IT in regard to applications for a range of areas.  I will not go into those headings because presumably we will come to them later in the discussion but the effect of Intreo and the changes in Longford and Letterkenny have enabled us to deal with applications much faster, even though we have had higher numbers in quite a number of areas, and to give people a much faster service.  That is also very much down to the staff in the Department, even though they are going through a huge transformation process, being committed to very high standards of services to customers.</p></speech>

Obviously, the number on the long-term list is not dropping fast enough.  There has been a drop in the number of long-term unemployed but that is not reflected.  If the trend this year continues, there would be additional savings.</p><p>  I heard the Minister speak about the minimum wage, doubling the pension and so on.  Is there any proposal to increase the amount young people under 25 and under 21 years of age get, given the discriminatory way they are dealt with under the code in that they only get &euro;100?  The context for this question is the EU's youth guarantee.  I presume it is not just a guarantee for jobs but for equal treatment.  </p><p>  The control figures seem to be higher than expected.  For the same number of control reviews, there seems to be an expectation that &euro;30 million more will be achieved than in 2012.  It is a substantial amount given that, in some cases, one is talking about a small amount of money being recovered from individuals.  In the overall scheme, &euro;30 million is not huge but it could come back to haunt the Minister.  </p><p>  The Minister mentioned the Intreo offices and I thank her for the invitation.  I will get to one but I spend my time visiting Ballyfermot dole office.  The sooner that changes into an Intreo office, the better.  However, it has substantially changed since I signed on in Ballyfermot Garda station-----</p></speech>

I get a quicker response than when I had to attend in person.  The service is changing.  Most of the business is carried out in quite a congenial manner, bar one or two characters which one finds everywhere.  People are distraught and in crisis but changes are taking place.  I praise the Department officials with whom I have dealt over the past number of years.</p><p>  The target is &euro;33 million for this year.

The community welfare offices were closed in rural areas.  I would like to know what savings were made on the closure of these offices.  In Summerhill, County Meath, Age Action Ireland was providing an office free of charge to the community welfare officer to meet the people from the area.  That was pulled overnight.  I heard that community welfare officers were stopped from holding clinics in rural areas.  I was told the service was stopped because of the mileage payments to the officials and cutbacks by the Department.  What savings were made?  In certain cases it should not have been done because it was costing the State very little.  We were giving a service.  Many people who are on social welfare do not have fancy cars or the extra money to go on the bus to visit town centres.  We put many people under more pressure, yet in my view no savings were achieved.</p></speech>

We took roughly 1,000 staff who had formerly worked in the HSE, either as community welfare officers or as staff assisting community welfare officers.  When that happened we took over approximately 700 locations from which they provided community welfare services, often for one or two hours a week in 700 different sites around the country.  We want to modernise the service.  First, all these officials would have been linked to a general principal office, maybe in a neighbouring large town or a regional headquarters.  Down the years, if a large number of people were out on the road a lot of the time, it was difficult to contact them, as Deputies know.  Officials were showing up in relatively small villages or at crossroads or in old doctors' dispensaries.  I believe this practice dates back to the days of what were once called relieving officers, 40, 50 or 60 years ago, even back to the time of British rule.  We are bringing them to the large villages and towns but all the time ensuring that people's distance from a significant service is maintained.  It must be within a reasonable distance, the kind of distance people might travel for their pension.  We have to do this for two reasons: first, it allows us to give more service hours to more people because more of the clients are concentrated in large villages and towns; and second, those officials are available for a longer period.  Normally when we make these changes we make a huge effort to advise all public representatives and we advise the local community and put up notices.</p><p>  If resources permitted I have no doubt people would prefer the old system, but one community officer travelling a round trip of 40 miles to spend one hour at a centre where one person shows up represents a lot of resources.  If we could move that meeting place to the nearest large village or town it would enable more people to be seen.  Due to the numbers employed, the restrictions about which I spoke and the reductions in the Department's budget, this is an area in which we can try to achieve greater efficiency.  That is why we are doing this, and we will continue that process until we can get a more efficient and better service.  The second issue is that we are then in a position, as we develop the Intreo offices, to have, for instance, a community welfare officer - we have not reached this level yet - available on-site to deal, for instance, with rent allowance and rent supplement, because approximately 86,000 receive rent supplement and they deal with a community welfare officer.  We are trying to improve the quality of services and make the best use of scarce resources.</p><p>  Deputy O'Dea asked how many staff had been transferred.  I can get him the exact figures, but approximately 1,000 staff transferred from the HSE - they were community welfare officers - and approximately 700 staff came from the old F&Aacute;S employment services.  With them we took the community employment schemes.  These schemes employ almost 1,400 supervisors or assistant supervisors.  We also created several new schemes, JobBridge and T&uacute;s being the best known, and we are creating a social employment service for people through the local authorities, which is making progress.  The county councils are getting ready to go ahead with that service.  Approximately 1,700 civil servants have come directly into the Department and the local employment service, LES, is also coming under the employment service wing.  That is a large number of extra people and services in which more people are engaged indirectly and funded by the Department.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-26a.474" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22013062600013#M00200"><p>Approximately 3,000 staff have now been deployed to do the ordinary, day-to-day work.  This figure includes the additional 1,700 staff to whom I referred.  As Deputy Willie O'Dea may be aware from conversations with people in Limerick, we have decided to integrate the F&Aacute;S service in order that it is no longer a stand-alone service run by former F&Aacute;S personnel.  Similarly, the community welfare service is no longer a stand-alone service.  One of the consequences of this process of integration is that we can draw on people with different experiences, which allows us to provide a much better service in the new Intreo offices.  Under the old system, somebody who was unable to sort out a claim for jobseeker's benefit or allowance in the local social welfare office was sent to a community welfare officer in a different office to be put on an assistance payment while the claim was being processed.  In the new Intreo offices the claims will be processed relatively quickly in order that for many applicants there will no longer be a need to claim supplementary welfare assistance.  That is why we have been able to bring community welfare officers into the general activities of the Department, including activation measures.  Community welfare officers are particularly skilled at interviewing.</p></speech>

The unemployment statistics indicate these individuals are mostly men who worked hard in construction jobs and made good money when times were good.  It is a major challenge to find them satisfying and interesting work to which they can relate.  There are several builders in my own family and they want to work in construction.  However, that trade has fallen on hard times.  If individuals in their 30s or 40s are offered courses they do not consider appropriate, do we accept that they should remain locked out of work until the construction industry picks up again?  Such individuals could instead become excellent contributors to community employment schemes if given the opportunity to put something back into the community.  I hope the local authority social employment services schemes that we will launch this year will be attractive to these individuals.  Having put them back on that track, they may ultimately find employment.  They might not work at technical bricklaying, but they would be able to use their skills to make a contribution in an area of interest.</p></speech>

We now have 7,000 people on T&uacute;s schemes.  To qualify for a placement on a scheme, one must have been unemployed for one year.  I have had the pleasure of meeting a range of people on T&uacute;s schemes and the local development networks have been very helpful in getting schemes off the ground in local communities.  I regularly meet former construction workers who are delighted with their schemes.  Their specific skills may not be in demand, but they get the opportunity to work on local projects such as looking after walls or general improvement works in towns.  I hope local authorities will be able to develop satisfying projects which will allow participants to get involved in a network.  An individual's skills may be suited to his or her local GAA club or other sports organisation.  The sad fact is that we simply cannot provide employment opportunities for all of the people who worked so hard in construction.</p><p>  We now allow claims for jobseeker's allowance to be suspended for eight weeks and are hoping to extend that period further with the Intreo offices.  This means that a person who gets a job with a local builder for, perhaps, three weeks, will not lose his or her claim status when the work is over.  It will not be necessary to start the process afresh.  This reform has been very successful because there has been a pick-up in small scale extensions and improvement works.</p><p>  We have set up an employers division because a considerable number of small builders have reported difficulties in finding people with the skills possessed by Deputy Brendan Ryan's constituent.  One of my ambitions for the division is that we can start to focus on providing services for more than the larger employers.  For example, we filled all of the temporary posts in the Passport Office in Balbriggan from the live register.  Eishtec, an expanding Irish company based in Waterford, has recruited and filled most of its vacancies from the live register.  It is important that employers inform us when they have vacancies in order that we can profile the people they need.</p><p>  Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh asked about young people and the fact that we paid a lower rate to people aged under 25 years.  We have discussed this issue previously.  I am on record as supporting that change when it was introduced by the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  If the individuals concerned engage in training or education, they can earn significantly more money.  My ambition is to ensure those aged 18 or 19 years never go on the live register because they will instead be able to access education or training.</p><p>  That brings me to the subject of the youth guarantee which is to be implemented in 2014.  We held an EPSCO meeting in Luxembourg last week and every country has been asked to present proposals by the end of the year for implementing the guarantee.  Officials in my Department and, I hope, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation are working hard on these proposals.  We need to set out ambitious targets for every Department to offer opportunities to young people to take part in employment, education and training.  The Department of Education and Skills is rolling out SOLAS and the education and training boards which will bring together the VECs and the old F&Aacute;S training centres.</p> <p>It is really important for us that they produce relevant courses for our unemployed clients and customers that will give them the skills they need to get back to the labour market.</p></speech>

More savings are expected because we have better analytical tools.   I gave an example of the man with the three photos.  That is really helpful.  If the inspectors talk to that individual, we get much more information because they ask why they are being picked on when other people are doing it.  There is often a substantially increased flow of information from such cases.</p><p>  We have taken advice from the Comptroller and Auditor General on auditing, and we now carry out full-size randomised surveys of the different social welfare expenditure headings.  We carry out a generalised survey of 1,000 jobseeker's allowances.  Based on that, we can see the failure rate or the control rate of fraud and abuse.  If we then target the people who are deemed to be at risk of abusing the system, by using analytics we can double the analysis of cases where the risk is quite high.  We also carry out matching exercises, which are now part of the analytics.  For instance, we do work with the Commission for Taxi Regulation and with a series of different statistics.  We now get the PPS number of everybody sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  The prison services now supply us with that information on a weekly basis.  Before I came into office, that data was supplied every six months to a year.  There is no reason that should not be provided weekly, as is the case now.</p><p>  As we improve our IT systems, our capacity to target, to increase the number of reviews and to carry out proper random surveys of 1,000 people receiving a particular benefit will broadly tell us where the problems exist.  If we identify a new issue, we may then extend what we have learned to a nationwide trawl of people who may have the same profile as that thrown up by surveys.  That is how it is done.   The general public provided us with 28,000 tip-off phone calls last year.  Due to the pressure on social welfare, the general public are very anxious to see abuses of the system investigated, and we now do a great deal of that from Carrick-on-Shannon, which is very helpful.</p></speech>

There is a reference on page 34 to a number of schemes the Department is running to "reduce barriers to the labour market for people with disabilities."  Do we have a percentage figure for the level of unemployment among disabled people?  If that figure is not available, perhaps the Minister could provide the figure for the percentage of disabled people who are in the workforce.</p></speech>

I do not have those particular figures.  That would be a matter for CSO, but I will ask the staff to obtain those figures for the Deputy.  There is a proportion of people in that situation in public services and in companies.</p><p>  People on the different disability payments face enormous barriers in the current employment market.  We now have three principal schemes to assist them, and that is referenced on page 34.  With the transfer of the F&Aacute;S staff, we took over what is now known as the employability service, which is a dedicated service in about 19 offices around the country.  We have a wage subsidy scheme which basically aims to subsidise, for the employer, the additional costs that might be associated with employing somebody with a disability.  The supported employment programme is a very interesting programme.  There are a range of supports available to work both with the person with the disability who is seeking employment and with the prospective employer, including information about the requirements of the individual who is seeking employment, such as whether he or she needs special access ramps, a wider desk, adapted toilet facilities or anything else.  We give small grants to assist in adapting facilities to allow the person to take up employment.  If the individual has an intellectual disability,  additional coaching might be required for the world of work.  In many cases, we would talking about part-time employment.</p><p>  I have had an opportunity to meet with representatives of several of these services.  We had eight information sessions last year for employers on these new services.  Wherever I made the presentation, I told employers about employment supports such as the wage subsidy and the small-scale adaptation grants, as well as the coaching information services available for employers and their HR departments and the specific coaching services we could provide.  These services will continue after the person has taken up employment.  The Irish Association of Supported Employment participated in the job shadow days.  I have been heavily involved in supporting that.  The Taoiseach has also supported it by taking on a job shadow.  Generally, this is for people with intellectual or other disability issues.  Many employers find that if they do that, their customers are happy to see that this employer is somebody who offers opportunities to people with disabilities.  There are young people with a disability who are happily mainstreamed in our education system.  A number of them are now going on to third level at Trinity College and Blanchardstown.  That is a great achievement and the next stage is to provide additional opportunities for them to go to work.  As Minister, I am very keen to see this.</p><p>  The partial capacity benefit was formally launched in 2011.</p></speech>

This year we expect to spend &euro;10.85 million.  That is an increase of approximately &euro;284,000 on last year.  The overall expenditure on the supported employment service has gone up again from &euro;8.104 million to what we anticipate spending this year, a further &euro;8.8 million, which represents an increase of approximately 9.1%.  We hope to build up the service on partial capacity benefit claims.  There are more than 1,000 of these claims in payment, 866 of which are in respect of a moderate level of disability, 147 in respect of a severe level of disability and 13 in respect of a profound level of disability.  Everybody would agree that we should try to expand this area.  It is a priority for me as Minister to improve opportunities because if it is hard for somebody who is able-bodied to get a job at the moment, full- or part-time, it is even tougher for people with disabilities, and particularly for young people with disabilities.  My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for people with disabilities, has done a great deal of work in this area.  We hope at the Department of Social Protection to expand these services as well as income support as we go along.</p></speech>

It will help many people who have found themselves in dire straits because they must change jobs or update their skills mid-stream in their working lives.  It also helps young people who emerge from school or college with an expectation of work that is not there by making training available to them.  We had some discussion about young people and the Minister said that she expects or hopes that 18 or 19 year olds would not be on the live register.</p></speech>

One of the problems is that even with the reduced social welfare payment to those young people some of them do not qualify for opportunities such as community employment immediately, while in some cases people on the Youthreach scheme, which starts before people leave school, can have a greater income than those who are on the live register and who are in search of employment and not able to access it.  Can that anomaly be addressed?  There is a huge increase in the number of people in casual work, the under-employed in Irish society.  Many of those people take up work just to remain close to the workplace or to have a few extra bob, but in many cases they also need access to the training and opportunities available to those who are full-time unemployed.  What mechanisms can we put in place to capture those people?  While there might be full-time schemes available, such schemes would force them out of their casual or part-time employment.  There are a range of issues arising from CE and Youthreach, but the estimate is positive because the number of people who are in some type of training is increasing.  The more spaces are available, the more people are not d&iacute;omhaoin or idle.  They are at least taking a step towards reconnection with the jobs market, if only the jobs were there.</p></speech>

Can someone on unemployment benefit work for eight weeks without having to de-register?  I was not aware of that and it is a superb initiative.  It is important that all of us as public representatives disseminate that kind of information to our constituents because this issue has arisen several times.</p><p>  Where there is no Intreo office, how can an employer assess the profile of people in an area?  Is there any facility to make up for the lack of Intreo offices, for example, in west Cork?  I welcome the fact that the Minister is spending 5% of her overall budget on supporting people in returning to work.  Two of the schemes that are long awaited are Jobstart, the local authority scheme, and JobsPlus, which is for the long-term unemployed.  They will be significant developments.  What I call the bar-counter politicians have looked for these for many years.  These are people who talk over the bar counter and ask why those who are unemployed cannot help the local authorities.  That will be a superb initiative and I congratulate the Minister and her officials on the work they have done on it to date.  I welcome JobsPlus initiative, under which, rather than giving people money to sit at home, we give an employer money to give them and the employer adds to it.  This lets people have the dignity of working.</p><p>  I have two questions on these initiatives.  The Minister mentioned a sum of &euro;13 million for the first year, rising to &euro;34 million for a full year, and said there would be 3,000 places.  That works out at &euro;11,000 per place, so I imagine there is something wrong there.</p></speech>

As we increase the numbers, the additional cost represents the extra cost plus the extra administration cost and so on.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is providing funding to county councils from the dormant accounts fund for this scheme.</p><p>  I will take this opportunity to ask public representatives to please encourage the county managers or senior officials in their local county councils to examine this scheme because in the 1980s social employment schemes such as this were a significant help to people in keeping them connected and close to the jobs market.  If, for instance, people did some work with the local authorities - I have discussed this with many of the managers - eventually, as local authorities begin to recruit again, these people will be ideally placed, as they were in the past, to take up and compete for additional local authority vacancies when they arise.  It is a pathway back to work and it has helped people on previous occasions.</p><p>  I look forward to Jobstart.  It has taken some time to get under way.  Local authorities had many discussions about the Haddington Road agreement.</p></speech>

JobStart figures show an element of double accounting.  If JobStart costs &euro;34.3 million in a full year, with 3,000 participants, that gives a figure of &euro;11,400.  Is there an element of double accounting-----</p></speech>

It could be the case that some of the people concerned have gone back to work.  For instance, it was the pattern that many JobBridge interns were offered jobs after three months in the internship.  They then leave the live register completely.  In some cases, once people are given a start, a percentage of them will find some employment.  For example, in the public service a maternity leave vacancy might arise which means six or nine months work.  There is a turnover of job vacancies as a result of people leaving for various reasons or taking leave.  This may provide opportunities for others to be employed, even though, technically, in the public service there may not be vacancies, but from time to time there are.</p></speech>

The key points are that if an employer takes on a person who has been unemployed for more than one year, he or she receives a cash payment of &euro;7,500 over a two year period on a monthly basis; in the case of a person on the live register who has been unemployed for two years or more, the employer will receive a cash payment of &euro;10,000 over a two year period, paid monthly.  That is a significant incentive, particularly for jobs at starter level or for those wishing to return to work where the initial earnings might not be that significantly high.  The scheme is a big assistance and I hope employers will see it as such.</p></speech>

A number of county councils are highly successful in this regard.

Self-employed persons pay the S class stamp at the rate of 4%.  Such businesses may not be doing as well as they were during the Celtic tiger era and there has been a slowing down in the domestic economy.  I have a self-employment background and know that a self-employed person pays income tax when in profit and if he or she is merely breaking even and making drawings, he or she pays tax on these drawings.  I would prefer to put 1.5% into a stamp payment which would entitle me, as a self-employed person, to illness and disability benefit.  I see all sides of the argument, but this would be the first time in the history of the State that self-employed persons would be recognised in the social protection system.  If this is not possible now, I ask when can it be done because it is very important.  The Minister has been excellent in her attitude to the self-employed and has held up the banner very well.  She has lowered the bar in order that self-employed persons can get help during a business crash when they have nothing and have to care for young families and have mortgages to pay.  However, I await the report in order that we can take it from there.</p></speech>

During the boom many involved in the construction and other industries who traditionally worked as employees found themselves working as contractors and subcontractors.  In many cases, they did not want to be self-employed contractors, but this was necessary in order to take up the available opportunities.  The expert group's report on the issue has been recently received by the Department and we are examining it.  An issue arises from the review of the actuarial fund.  Self-employed persons pay at a rate of 4%, for which they receive retirement pension and widow's-widower's or partner's pensions and retirement payments.  That represents very good value.  Extending this to include other benefits will require a contribution sufficient to cover the cost over time.  I am glad that the Deputy has acknowledged that a great many people who lost their self-employment status qualify after a period of time for social welfare payments.  As he said, it is very important assistance to the individuals concerned.  They are usually in the 38 to 52 year age group and homeowners and their children are young; therefore, they have many commitments.  We want to help them to keep the roof over their heads.</p><p>  The chairperson of the advisory group briefed the Cabinet sub-committee on economic recovery on how the Department was assisting many former self-employed persons to access benefits, depending on how precarious their situation was.  The chairperson stated she was surprised at the number in that position.</p></speech>

In the case of the actuarial review, for example, there was actually some criticism from the media because the sub-committee had received it first.</p></speech>

It went to the sub-committee first.</p><p>  The Mangan committee indicated that 85% of formerly self-employed persons who had submitted claims did obtain access to social welfare supports.  The outcome of such claims depends in large part on the production of information by claimants, something which has also become apparent in the case, for instance, of the farm assist scheme.  For self-employed persons generally, the information basis is the previous year's accounts.  However, the enhanced capacity of the Department means that we can now take into account substantial changes in circumstances, an issue I have discussed with the Irish Farmers Association recently.  Until recently the system was much more rigid, it being a case of last year's accounts or nothing.  Now officials can take account of circumstances where a self-employed person or farmer has experienced a catastrophic loss of income and is in financial dire straits.  If such persons provide us with up-to-date information, we are able to help them much more quickly.</p></speech>

The Government is due to award several large public sector construction contracts in the near future, including, for example, the contract to rebuild Cork Prison.  The contract for construction of a road under Newlands Cross in south County Dublin has already been granted to BAM Constructors.  I understand it will be a fly-under rather than a flyover.</p></speech>

All such contracts should include an incentive that would encourage the successful companies to take construction workers and others off the live register.  We have seen in recent years how European-based companies tend to arrive here lock, stock and barrel, with little or no employment opportunities for local people.  That is a source of frustration for the unemployed construction workers who have not yet left the country.  I urge the Minister to raise this issue at the Cabinet.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-26a.521" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22013062600017#Q01200"><p>I assure the Deputy that I raise this issue at Cabinet almost every week and the message is getting through.  In the case of small-scale construction contracts involving schools, for instance, many other Deputies and I are concerned that several were won by companies outside the jurisdiction.  As part of our broader control and anti-fraud efforts, a joint project is under way between the control and special investigations unit of my Department and the Department of Education and Skills to ensure staff employed on these sites are properly registered for PRSI, tax and insurance.  That is extremely important.</p><p>  The Deputy raises the important question of how we can encourage Irish employers to give people who have been on the live register a chance.  Many of them worked successfully for ten, 15  or 20 years only for their employer to go bust in the crash.  They find themselves in a situation, through no fault of their own, where one year on the dole becomes two, three and so on.  Research from the United States shows that an employer will choose a person who has just left school or college and has little or no experience in preference to a candidate who has a one, two or three year gap on his or her CV.  Such gaps tend, unfortunately, to make a person unattractive from an employment point of view.  That is why we are focused on the stepping stones that will assist people to return to the labour market.  Some 25,000 are participating in the back to education allowance scheme, for instance, with significant numbers also engaged in JobBridge, community employment schemes, T&uacute;s and now the local authority scheme.  These are critical because for people who participate in such schemes, even if they do not provide exactly the type of job they want, their chances of getting back to work, either in a new field or their original field, are hugely enhanced.  That is why, despite the pressures on the Department's budget, we have increased the amounts we are devoting to employment supports.  In the case of F&Aacute;S, SOLAS and the VEC area, I agree with Deputies Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh and Brendan Ryan that we must find courses that are relevant.</p><p>  On the youth employment guarantee-----</p></speech>

We must conclude at 3.45 p.m. because another meeting is due to take place.  I suggest we cover the final four headings in the time remaining and ask the Minister to get back to the sub-committee on any question she does not have time to answer today.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

Under the heading dealing with supports for children, there is an indication that &euro;123 million was saved as a result of the changes to the one-parent family payment.  The amended provision for after-school child care, school meals and so on adds up to &euro;18.5 million.  Will we see an increase in the proportion of that &euro;123 million going to some of these projects?</p><p>  We have dealt with the issue of rent allowance.  While the increases in the thresholds are welcome, they are still not high enough in a context where rents in this city and elsewhere continue to rise.  Is the recent change reflected in the Revised Estimate?</p></speech>

Those in receipt of the benefit, who in many cases continue to be certified by departmental medical practitioners, have been advised that at the end of the two-year period they should consider applying for the invalidity pension.  Receipt of the latter payment depends on whether one is likely to be ill for over a year or is permanently incapable of work.  These are the conditions of the scheme.  However, applicants are told their applications are refused because it is considered that they are not permanently incapable of work.  Reference is not made at all to whether one is likely to be ill for a year or more.  Could the Minister comment on this?  Of those who apply for the invalidity pension when their illness benefit payments end, what percentage are refused?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-26a.535" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22013062600018#R00400"><p>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked about children and after-school services.  We are rolling out the 6,000 after-school places.  Some were rolled out on a pilot basis towards the end of April.  We hope to have all of them rolled out by the start of the new school year in September.  We will be concentrating on and emphasising parents' going back to work, be they lone parents or part of a couple.  There is an area-based approach to child poverty modelled on developments that have taken place in areas such as Ballymun and Tallaght.  I am anxious to see this initiative rolled out.  As the Deputy knows, a jobless household with a number of children could have specific problems and issues such as children not being connected well in school.  Families could be in contact with a variety of services.  The area-based approach would mean that all service providers in the area would come together so there would not be different social workers knocking on the door about different issues.  There would be a holistic approach to the child and family.  In other countries, that is the kind of service that provides the best outcomes, and this is what we need.  What I propose is an ambition of mine, but we are just at the beginning of the development phase.  It has much potential.</p><p>  With regard to rent allowances, I said the cost was approximately an extra &euro;7 million.  This is not in the Estimate.  We will have to meet the cost within the context of our overall budget.  With regard to the housing assistance payment, which we hope will result in a happy outcome, the Government agreed in principle in March 2012 to transfer responsibility for rent assistance for people with a long-term housing need to housing authorities, using the new housing assistance payment.  The rent supplement will be used for its original intention - that is, to serve as a short-term income support once the housing assistance payment becomes fully operational.  The piloting of the housing assistance payment is subject to the necessary legislative arrangements.  This is being advanced by our colleagues at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, namely, the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, and the Minister of State Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan.</p><p>  It has been agreed that by the middle of July a memorandum will be presented to the Government by the Department of Social Protection and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government outlining the heads of a Bill to support the housing assistance payment and detailing the economic assessment, including an interim report on the business planning process.  This will provide an update on the legal position regarding the principle of deducting rents from social welfare payments by agreement in regard to the rent contribution.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has been very keen to achieve that, for obvious reasons.  However, the Deputy knows from his local authority the number of different types of applicant and types of housing.  There are 66 separate schemes and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is working on a unified one.</p><p>  I will forward Deputy Ryan the detailed statistic he requires.  With regard to invalidity pension applications, 17,800 have been decided on.  Of these, 64% have been refused.  In other words, 36% have been accepted.  Of the 11,000 refusals, 4,765 have been subject to appeal.  Fewer than half of applicants refused actually appealed.  Approximately half of those who appealed were rewarded the invalidity pension.  Quite a small number were allowed a partial allowance.  Approximately 21% appeals were disallowed and 2.6% were withdrawn.  In the Longford office, we have achieved a great turnaround in dealing with the applications.  The Deputy should remember that the limitation on illness benefit was introduced in 2009.  Therefore, there are now a considerable number of people emerging from the illness benefit period and perhaps seeking an invalidity pension or, in some cases, returning to jobseeker's payments.  Circumstances differ.  With the new IT infrastructure circumstances are improving, but we certainly have more work to do.</p></speech>

With regard to the amendments, I made the point on Second Stage and the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, responded and we know what his response was.  I will not labour the point, except to state I understand there is expenditure of approximately &euro;50 billion each year, of which approximately &euro;40 billion goes through the Departments' Estimates process and is voted expenditure, which is right.  However, there is no reason all of the taxpayers' money spent each year should not go through the Estimates procedure.</p><p>  I have listed a number of items and taken the headings from the 2013 Estimates for receipt and expenditure.  I understand payments for the Judiciary and constitutional officeholders should not be voted on by Members of the Oireachtas each year, if there is meant to be a separation of powers and independence.  I would not like payments such as the salary of the President to become a bone of contention in the Oireachtas.  Most of the other payments are ones which need to be made each year, but various pieces of legislation have been drafted during the years to exclude certain items from the Estimates procedure.  It is still taxpayers' money which must be paid, but because it is not included in the annual Estimates procedure, by and large, it escapes annual scrutiny.  I am not saying there is no mechanism in place, but some of these items are caught in wider debates on various departmental Estimates such as contributions to the European Union.  I am sure the Common Agriculture Policy is discussed, but the total contribution to the European Union of &euro;1.444 billion - we may be a net contributor rather than a recipient - is not debated.</p></speech>

He understands the position I will present as well.</p><p>  Following the establishment of my Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2011, I was given responsibility to oversee public sector policy and the management of overall departmental expenditure.  That is the remit of my Department.  With regard to this Bill, there are responsibilities that I now hold which were previously vested in an integrated Department of Finance, including the management of the annual Estimates and general sanctioning powers relating to public expenditure.  The Minister for Finance, under the Ministers and Secretaries Bill enacted in 2011, retained responsibility for non-voted expenditure that Deputy Fleming now instances.  They are not my responsibility but rather that of the Minister for Finance, who also controls broader fiscal policies.</p><p>  Non-voted expenditure represents expenditure - as correctly noted by the Deputy - which is voted by the Oireachtas under specific statute law to be paid from the Central Fund without annual reference in the Estimates.  These items are a permanent charge on the State, representing services payable out of the Central Fund by the continuing authority of law.  They are not, therefore, part of the normal Estimates process, either in negotiation with line Departments or in anything else.</p><p>  Central Fund activity is regulated and reported through the monthly Exchequer statement.  Additionally, the Department of Finance publishes detailed annual accounts of the Central Fund for the previous year, known as the finance accounts, and these are prepared under section 4 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993.  They contain detailed analysis and classifications of receipts, issues of the Central Fund and details of the national debt, which as the Deputy correctly noted is the largest component of non-voted expenditure.  These reports must be laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann not later than 30 September each year.  In addition, planned Central Fund expenditure is set out for the following year as part of the stability programme update and as part of the budget documentation.</p><p>  The Bill before us does not deal with debt servicing or any other charges coming from the Central Fund and I do not propose to change the Bill to encompass those.  I do not intend to change the long-standing practice on non-voted expenditure.  Such practices are in accordance with the Constitution, and as I noted earlier, the expenditure does not come within my purview as it is under the direct control of the Minister for Finance.</p><p>  I will deal specifically with some of the points made by Deputy Fleming.  The largest item of non-voted expenditure is the servicing of the national debt, and any initiative to move debt repayment away from the current Central Fund payment scheme and into an annual debated Vote would have implications for the NTMA in raising money to fund the debt.  Currently, offering circulars issued by the NTMA contain the following term: "The principal and interest of the bond which is issued under the National Treasury Management Agency Act 1990 and other statutes will be charged on the Central Fund".  When we borrow money we give a commitment that we will pay on the agreed terms in an unconditional and irrevocable way, and that is why we get money at affordable rates.  I hope that will happen in future.  I am advised by the people who raise the money that any move away from such a process or conditionality would have implications for us.</p><p>  The second-largest item of expenditure under the Central Fund is the EU budget, which arises because of a treaty obligation, voted on by the people of Ireland by way of referenda.  It is not that we can debate an Estimate before amending or rejecting it.  We have signed up solemnly to those treaty obligations.</p></speech>

It has become very complex.  I just wanted to express my thanks for that very useful meeting.</p><p>  On Deputy Fleming's point - I will speak on the section in a moment - I agree that conditional repayment of debt would be risk-adjusted.  It would cost more, but that does not mean we should not do it.  We should accept that if we allow the D&aacute;il to vote on it, a cost would be associated with it.  Deputy Fleming would probably agree with me in that regard.  That does not mean it is the wrong thing to do.  Many of the useful democratic checks and balances that take place in here probably have a cost associated with them.  There is an issue here, however.  My understanding - the Minister can correct me if I am wrong - is that the D&aacute;il does not get a say in how much is borrowed.  I know that over the long term, one borrows for the gap.  Obviously, the National Treasury Management Agency makes decisions on borrowing all the time.  The D&aacute;il is constitutionally responsible for all spending.  As I have said, the Minister can correct me if I am wrong.  My understanding is that the D&aacute;il basically-----</p></speech>

The Minister for Finance makes the overarching presentation, which covers the taxation side, on the same day.  The total financial parameters, including the State's borrowing requirement, are part of the budgetary arithmetic that is formally voted on and accepted.  On the day, a number of Financial Resolutions are voted on.  Then there is a residual financial resolution - the overarching one, which encompasses the level of borrowing and everything else.</p></speech>

I could labour this point forever.  The Minister referred to the EU treaty obligations.  I call that what I expect to be told.  That figure - the figure we paid last year and the figure we are paying next year - is not in the EU treaty.  It is a calculated figure based on the principles in the treaty.</p></speech>

If it is part of the budgetary arithmetic, as the Minister has suggested, why not put it into the voted expenditure?  The point I am making is that its being an EU treaty obligation does not mean it cannot be in the voted expenditure.  Do other countries have a separate central fund?  Perhaps the Minister does not know the answer to that question.  The voted expenditure in the D&aacute;il is 80% of Government expenditure.  The other 20% of it goes through a non-voted mechanism.  Are other parliaments side-stepped to the same extent as the Irish Parliament?  Does the Minister have any knowledge of that?  If he does not, it is okay.  I can ask somebody to find that out for me.  It is kind of strange.  The amount of non-voted expenditure that is paid out of the Central Fund without any reference to the D&aacute;il each year, which is approximately 20% at present, could be as low as 10% if we are not paying the national debt, while it could be as high as 35% in another period, depending on levels of debt and EU commitments.  There is something wrong if up to a third of total taxpayer expenditure can be voted through in that manner under this mechanism.  It did not happen this year or last year, but it could easily happen.  If the Minister knows what the practice is in other countries, that is well and good.  If not, we will find it out separately.</p><p>  I will conclude by speaking about the Department of Finance.  Obviously, I did not get the advantage of the briefing that Deputy Donnelly received.</p></speech>

There is no reason that cannot be estimated, provision made for it and a debate held on it.  I could go through several other examples.  Amendment No. 5 refers to payments to political parties.  People should know what next year's contribution to the EU budget will be before this year is out.  The figure in question is based on GNP, a percentage of VAT and everything else.</p></speech>

I have in mind specific criticism made by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, who expressed the view that Ministers from what she described as some of the big spending Departments had been excluded from budgetary discussions and decisions.  This sentiment was echoed by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, who made the following comment: &quot;I do not like the fact that I was not more involved in the build-up to some of the decisions&quot;.  His words were a further indication that there had been an unsatisfactory level of engagement, at least at some stages of the budgetary process. </p><p>  The Economic Management Council, which consists of four men, of which the Minister is one, occupies the central position in discussions on all matters economic, not least budgetary decisions.  This is a bad state of affairs.  I say this as someone on the outside who is looking into Cabinet.  As the Minister will be aware, I am a supporter of the concept of multi-annual frameworks and budgeting because they make sense and I acknowledge that this legislation constitutes a good and solid step forward in this regard.  However, it would not be good practice if a small number of Cabinet members were able to make the call on key budgetary decisions to which the principle of collective Cabinet responsibility applies.  If such an approach has taken hold, it should be weeded out.  </p><p>  Having said that, amendments Nos. 14 and 17 simply propose to insert after the word &quot;Government&quot; on line 34 of page 3 the words &quot;to include all cabinet members&quot;.  When making decisions in the areas of education, health or social protection, line Ministers, who are responsible for delivering on their respective budgets, must be part and parcel of the decision making process.  This requirement should be stated in legislation.</p></speech>

All government decisions are taken on a collective basis and are the responsibility of every member of the Government.  To introduce a provision stating that the Government includes all Cabinet Ministers would be tautological.</p><p>  On the specific point made by the Deputy, I assure her that every member of the Cabinet was actively involved in all budgets produced since the formation of the Government.  Moreover, every individual issue was formally tabled at Cabinet, all decisions have been taken on a collective basis and responsibility for decisions lies with every member of Cabinet. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-26a.624" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22013062600005#D00800"><p>The concept of collective Cabinet responsibility, which I fully understand, is not at issue here, nor is the status of the decisions taken at Cabinet.  The issue is the process by which decisions are arrived at.  As the Minister is aware, some of his Cabinet colleagues have been publicly critical of this process.  I cited statements made by the Ministers for Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine, from the Labour Party and Fine Gael Party, respectively, in which they indicated they were on the margins at certain stages when key budgetary decisions were being made.  It does not make sense that line Ministers are required to observe the discipline of budgetary ceilings when it is not made explicitly clear that they are centrally involved in the process of arriving at decisions, drawing up frameworks or setting limits.  I do not view this amendment as a tautology but as an important clarification which gives firmer definition to the fact that the Government collectively means all Cabinet Ministers.  I would have specifically referred to the big spending Departments in the amendment but for the need to ensure that Ministers in smaller spending Departments are also part and parcel of the process at arriving at collective and binding Cabinet decisions.</p></speech>

While there is a very open debate on these matters in Cabinet, I am not in a position to give the Deputy chapter and verse because to do so would be unconstitutional.  However, I can give her the assurance she seeks.  The process is that my Department will write to each line Minister, as we have done already in the context of this year's budget, and the Departments will then propose measures for general consideration.  In welding the entire budget together, there is a collective discussion at Cabinet at which priorities may be changed or new and separate priorities set.  This is done on a collective basis with every member of the Government involved.</p></speech>

She accused the four members of the Economic Management Council of excluding big spending Government Departments from key budgetary discussions.  She made this statement on the record, not in a hushed tone or in private, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, expressed a similar concern.  This is an issue in terms of the process of decision making, although I have no doubt both Ministers are well able to stand their ground and fight their corners.  The issue is not one of individual personalities, however.  In light of the decision to establish the Economic Management Council, a sort of inner sanctum of Cabinet and Government, it is important that the legislation state that all Cabinet Ministers are involved in the decision making process.</p></speech>

I support this commitment and I am pleased the Government entered into it.  However, I also want it to be delivered and if the Government is serious about doing so, it must be written into the legislation and become part and parcel of good practice when setting out expenditure frameworks and targets.  Each of the amendments proposes to insert the same formula, namely, the words &quot;with due regard for equality and human rights obligations&quot;.</p></speech>

The policy issues raised in the amendments are different from the subject matter of the Bill.  At its core, the Bill concerns technical rules for limiting a budget that is drawn up on a multi-annual basis.  The introduction in preparations of ministerial ceilings of assessments that would be required in relation to equality would introduce a subjective element to a technical process.  Providing in legislation for such subjective matters would create significant difficulties.  While the proposed amendments are not appropriate for inclusion in this Bill, considerations of equality form an important component of all budgetary discussions.  The Deputy correctly cited the programme of Government commitment in that regard.</p></speech>

I accept that they may, however, be honoured more in the breach in this jurisdiction.  There is nothing subjective in respect of these issues.</p><p>  The difficulty which has arisen in respect of any number of budgetary decisions is that they have not taken cognisance of equality impacts.  I will provide an example.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, thought it was a good idea, and made a policy decision, to take the scalpel to DEIS schools.  In fairness, he subsequently rowed back on his decision because what was being done was manifestly unfair.  The analysis carried out in respect of lone parents clearly indicates how disproportionately they and their families have been affected over a number of budgets.  We do not have a rigorous assessment of equality impacts and outcomes in respect of budgetary decisions.  Such an assessment simply does not exist.  I did not table these amendments because they would facilitate the completion of the framework for equality budgeting - for which I am an advocate and which I support - I did so because this Administration cannot legitimately exclude itself or the critical process relating to the budget, which involves decisions on spending in crucial areas which affect people's lives, from the commitment it gave in its programme for Government in respect of requiring all public bodies to take due note of equality and human rights in carrying out their functions.  Such an approach does not make any sense and, in those circumstances, I do not accept the Minister's response.  I can only infer from his general demeanour that he is somewhat defensive about this matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-26a.635" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22013062600006#E00500"><p>No, I am not defensive.  The Deputy is well aware that since we entered office there has been an obligation on us to try to work towards balancing the books.  We are in our third year in office and we are still borrowing &euro;1 billion per month.  The people who loan us the money to spend in order to maintain the social infrastructure we regard as essential have attached conditions in respect of that money.  In that regard, we must work towards reducing expenditure.  The Deputy is correct that we are making subjective choices within the parameters which obtain.  As a member of the Opposition, the Deputy will always focus - it is perfectly understandable and legitimate that she would do so - on referring not to the things we protect, but those which we cannot protect to the extent we would like.  None of us wants to reduce spending in any area where such a reduction would have an adverse impact on the elderly, those who depend on health services, those in the disability sector, children, etc.  We would prefer not to be obliged to touch any of these areas and, by and large, we have been very successful in protecting them.</p><p>  One of the areas which has recently been the cause of some debate is that which relates to special education and to those in integrated education who have special needs.  At the height of the boom in 2007, when Mary Harney and others were saying that we were awash with money, the State was spending &euro;840 million on special needs education.  Now we are spending &euro;1.3 billion on it.  We have maintained this level of expenditure because this is an important area.  We have made a subjective choice in respect of the matter.  We have also not reduced the number of special needs assistants.  That number was ring-fenced during the latter days of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  It is very difficult to retain special needs assistants because they are expensive.  However, that is the choice we have made.</p><p>  These choices are subjective.  One could make a policy decision which might, for example, impact adversely on the elderly.  It could be stated that we should exclude the elderly from being touched at all.  In the most recent budget, however, we reduced the threshold relating to the maintenance of medical cards for the over 70s.  It was still a high figure but we did not grant automatic entitlement in respect of such cards because we were of the view that reducing the threshold was a fairer approach to take in the struggle to work towards a balanced budget.  Human rights, equality and fairness must comprise the prism through which we view all budgetary decisions.  However, it is not appropriate to make provision in that regard in this legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-26a.636" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22013062600006#E00600"><p>I do not accept that.  It is not good enough to refer to a prism of which equality is one of the facets and then state that this will not be underwritten in the legislative framework relating to making the type of decisions to which the Minister refers.  This makes a nonsense of the commitment in the programme for Government to take due note of equality and human rights.  These are the benchmarks and standards which those in government set for themselves and I am of the view that they are the right ones.  It is a case then of their talking the talk, but ultimately not making a difference by including the commitment to which I refer in the legislative framework.  If all decisions are viewed through a prism of equality and human rights, then the Minister should have no difficulty in this being stated within the legislation.  He initially indicated that equality and human rights are subjective in nature when it is clear they are not.  In his most recent response, he conceded that the policy decisions the Government takes are subjective to some degree.  I see the logic in that because they involve judgment calls.  I am not challenging him in that regard.  However, equality and human rights are not subjective in nature.  They are measurable and they represent the standards which should apply in the decisions we make in respect of expenditure.  In that context, the amendments I have tabled should have a place in the legislation.</p></speech>

If that was the April figure, one would expect in the budget that the proposed sum would be &euro;10 billion.  My concern is that the Government is going to set these figures and inform the D&aacute;il that they are the ceilings.  In fact, they are the targets.  Does the Minister consider that the D&aacute;il loses any of its budgetary oversight ability, limited as it is, in this mechanism?  It is not a leading question.  I am not convinced that is the case.  I am genuinely curious to know if the D&aacute;il is losing anything.  I acknowledge that the D&aacute;il is gaining a great deal in terms of oversight in this but is it potentially losing something?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-26a.693" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22013062600008#G00400"><p>No.  As the Deputy rightly says, the D&aacute;il is gaining.  I do not see how it could lose anything.  Oversight as it was done over the last 20 years was not particularly strong.  As Deputy Fleming has repeatedly and strongly made the case, it was post-fact consideration of expenditure.  The money was spent.  The construction of a budget each year was entirely an Executive function.  One might say that is still largely the case, but I would like it not to be.  In less challenging times, when we have money to spend in an expansive way, it will be easier for Opposition Members to engage in the budgetary process.  I recognise that it is difficult for Members of the Opposition to table budgetary cuts and to express a preference for one cut over another.  The whole idea of a multi-annual framework and comprehensive view of expenditure so that most options - not necessarily all - are on the table.  That would facilitate engagement with line Departments in the committee system and explore the options.  For example, in the area of social protection, a committee could consider the sum of money spent on child benefit and ask, realisitically, if the correct approach is being taken.  Should there be a different balance and should the money be spent on service rather than provided directly?  The money we spend on the elderly could be considered.  In the context of the debate we have just had, there is an enormous quantum of money spent on the disabilities sector if one looks at departmental expenditure.  The Department of Education and Skills spends &euro;1.3 billion on special education.  Approximately &euro;1.5 billion is spent on disabilities by the Department of Health.  Approximately &euro;3 billion is spent on disabilities by the Department of Social Protection.  If one looks at the Department of Transport and others, an enormous quantum of money is spent.  In a structured Parliament, we should be asking if that is the best way to support our citizens with disabilities.  I hope the budgetary and committee process would, on a whole-year basis, get its teeth into that.  It would not be about asking if someone spent the money they were supposed to in the proper way but about outcomes and appropriate approaches.  It would break down the silo attitude of Departments.  If money is transferred from one Department to another to better effect, it should be welcomed.</p></speech>

The Minister's example of disability spending is a very good one.  It speaks to an issue I have raised before.  Hopefully, the sub-committee and the broader finance committee have a reasonable interest and experience of expenditure.  We only look at the expenditure within the Minister's Department, however.  I accept fully that the committee should not second guess the Minister for Health and the committee dealing with health issues.  However, there are two areas in which the sub-committee could usefully debate issues.  One is the spread of spending, which is not necessarily about what is contained within the health budget.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has a remit across all Departments which means the sub-committee to which he answers should usefully do the same exercise.  We would not look at what is spent, for example, on acute medicine versus community-based care, but it would be useful for the sub-committee to ask what the total quantum of spending is and to determine if it is rising or falling.  We have discussed this before and the Minister was not hugely amenable to the idea.  However, there is nowhere else that the D&aacute;&iacute;l looks at these things.  If that is the Minister's remit, it is properly the remit of the sub-committee remit.  The second area involves the example the Minister just gave of the disabilities sector.  The Minister has just listed four or five huge pots of money.  There is nowhere that they are all tied together.  Arguably, this is the only committee which could do so.  It is an issue for the chairman also.</p></speech>

It will be a rounding-up at the end of the year.  For example, in the discussion I had with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, on the schools, we debated what was the best way to proceed.  I opened the discussion by asking if I had &euro;50 million to allocate to the Department of Education and Skills, what is the best way, in terms of stimulus, that I could get capital works going.  I did not know whether it would be a new summer works scheme, the construction of individual schools, refurbishment of all schools, a broadband scheme for schools - whatever he wanted to do.  The Minister came back and said there were X number of schools ready to go to tender if he had the funding and, although the cost of this would be &euro;90 million, if I provided him with &euro;50 million he would re-jig his capital budget to find the other &euro;40 million because this is a good thing to do.  We will present that in a balanced way at the end of the year.</p></speech>

This is a permissive section to allow public service bodies supply the necessary aggregate information to my Department to enable me, as Minister, and the Department to properly monitor and operate expenditure ceilings that are set out in this Bill.  Personal information, as defined by the Data Protection Acts, would not form part of that requirement.</p><p>  At present, many Departments and offices gather information, for example, on details of their grant spend.  Where my Department has sought information to enable a better estimate of expenditure to be made over the medium term, it has been our experience that a lack of a specific power to overcome legal obstacles has in the past caused delays in providing information due to the lack of clarity regarding the legal position.  In this context, it was felt that, without such a section being provided, the ongoing operation of ministerial ceilings could become more difficult or challenging.  It is, therefore, sensible and proper to provide in the Bill for a clear permissive section to allow Departments, offices and public service bodies to pass on such information as is necessary to set multi-annual ceilings at the appropriate level.</p></speech>

Will it give the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform more power in finding out what is happening in a Department than the line Minister?  In theory, the Minister concerned has the line responsibility.  Could the Minister get that and give it to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform?  Deputy Howlin states there are potentially some impediments in the system and he has not been able to access it directly.  Can the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform sidestep the Ministers if he wants to know what is happening in a programme, for example, in the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Education of Skills or the Department of Health?  Has Deputy Howlin, as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the power and they shall provide it to him, not even to the line Minister?</p></speech>

The assignment of this endorsement role is a requirement under the two pack regulations.  To clarify, the endorsement required is that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council endorse the macroeconomic forecasts on which the budget and stability programme will be based.  This means that the council will endorse the macroeconomic forecasts on which budgetary proposals will be prepared and on which the Government will then decide.  In the interests of independence, the council cannot be required to endorse.  Instead, it is required to fulfil the endorsement function and could, should it find it appropriate to so decide, announce that it will not endorse the forecasts.  That sounds a little more convoluted than it is.  We are obliged under the two pack regulations to have an independent agency.  The Government has determined it should be the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Minister for Finance has asked me to provide for this in statute.  This is the statutory vehicle available to do this.</p><p>  Amendments Nos. 24 and 25 are technical amendments, consequential on the acceptance of the amendment to permit the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council to take on the endorsement role envisaged under EU rules.  Amendment No. 26 is also a technical change.  As the Bill now contains a section which is amending the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 to add to the role of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, it is necessary to amend the Long Title and this is proposed in amendment No. 26.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-26a.759" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22013062600010#J00400"><p>Why is this amendment being made in this Bill?  It is an amendment to the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 which was the responsibility of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  It is strange to introduce this amendment in this Bill.  If the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, is minded to alter section 8 of that legislation, he should do so.</p><p>  Second, on the particulars of the change being proposed, paragraph (<i>a</i>) is the new part, as paragraphs (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) remain as in the legislation.  The Minister is introducing an obligation on the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  The council &quot;shall endorse, as it considers appropriate, the macroeconomic forecasts prepared by the Department of Finance on which the Budget and stability programme will be based&quot;.  I did not catch the Minister's explanation for its role in the endorsement procedures.  Will he repeat it?  The purpose of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is to be independent; therefore, the Minister must square the circle for us.  On the one hand, there is the independent status of the council and, on the other, there is an obligation to endorse the Department of Finance's forecasts.  If one were a cynic, one might wonder if this was in some way related to the fact that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council had been critical of the Government, perversely because it believed the Government was not dishing out enough austerity.  That reflects the particular composition of the council.  There were certainly no radically different views introduced to it, but that is another day's work.  Will the Minister square the circle of independence, on the one hand, and the endorsement role, on the other?  Will he also explain why this amendment to the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 has found its way into this Bill?  It should more properly be introduced as an amendment to legislation from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.</p></speech>

A number of changes to our budgetary process are being introduced and the Bill, as amended, should complete all the necessary changes required before next year's budget.  On the Deputy's question, this is the legislative vehicle we have before the end of this parliamentary term and we want to complete it in advance of the budget.  We will not have another chance.  There is no other finance legislation before the D&aacute;il.</p><p>  Under the two pack regulation, "National medium-term fiscal plans and draft budgets referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be based on independent macroeconomic forecasts, and shall indicate whether the budgetary forecasts have been produced or endorsed by an independent body.  Those forecasts shall be made public together with the national medium-term fiscal plans and the draft budgets that they underpin".  We are required to do this.  </p><p>  On the question of what body would be appropriate one to undertake the macroeconomic endorsement, we have determined that it should be the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  Notwithstanding its criticisms, that is the body we believe is the best fit for this task.  The form of wording in the amendment is in the positive, but the council is perfectly entitled not to endorse.  That is understood.  The council will make a judgment call, either to endorse or to refuse to endorse the macroeconomic framework on which the budget is proposed to be constructed.</p></speech>

The wording is that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council "shall endorse", while the requirement from the troika concerns whether the forecasts have been endorsed.  The council can either endorse or not endorse.  Perhaps the wording should be "shall endorse or not endorse, as appropriate".</p></speech>

This is the area of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, whose advisers state there are two processes that are allowed under the European treaties.  Ours involves the Government, or Department of Finance in this instance, preparing an economic forecast to be validated, or not, by an independent counsel.  It is permissible under the treaty for an independent forecast to be made by an independent body, and that has been done by some countries.</p></speech>

I may be wrong but recollect discussing with the Fiscal Advisory Council a compliance issue in respect of which I gathered it was the body designated to produce the independent forecast.  It has already approached the finance committee with its view on the Department of Finance, for example.  It largely thought the work was pretty good.  I understood that the council was to produce its own report and that this was part of compliance requirements.  Did we not have a discussion with the Fiscal Advisory Council on the types of models it would use and the funding and expertise needed to produce the macroeconomic forecasts?</p></speech>

What I am addressing is our treaty obligations under the new two-pack and how Ireland will fulfil that obligation.  I have set that out.  If the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council wishes to prepare its own reports, documentation or forecasts, there is no impediment.  However, it would not legally fulfil our treaty obligation.  If we send the Deputy a copy of the memorandum of understanding between the Fiscal Advisory Council and the Department of Finance, it may be helpful.  I am advised it will be a public document once this legislation is enacted.  It is useful to see the memorandum of understanding between the council and the Department.</p></speech>

What is the basis of the assessment?  What methodology does it use in arriving at the assessment?  There is tension or a difference in objectives in respect of the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact and the independent assessment, by whatever methods, of the Fiscal Advisory Council in determining whether the fiscal stance is conducive to prudent economic and budgetary management for Ireland.

In the event of the council failing to endorse the forecast, the resulting steps would be considered by the Government.

I would like to extend a warm welcome to the Minister of State and his officials to today's meeting.  He was a very important member of this committee at one stage.</p><p>  The new policy was developed following a review, which took place last year, of the White Paper on Irish Aid.  This review, which was led by the Minister of State, with independent oversight by the Irish Aid expert group, chaired by Ms Nora Owen, was extensive in that it met with more than 1,000 people in both Ireland and the partner countries.  It received 165 written submissions.  While Ireland's aid programme is one of the best in the world, there is a clear need to recognise that in an ever-changing world, there is often a need to refocus our aims in order to ensure that the countries with which we work and support graduate to a position in which they are no longer dependent on aid.  To that aim, the new policy has three goals, namely, reduced hunger and stronger resilience, sustainable development and inclusive economic growth, and better governance, human rights and accountability.  In addition, six priority areas for action are identified: global hunger, fragile states, climate change and development, trade and economic growth, essential services, human rights and accountability.</p><p>  This committee was involved in the review in a number of ways.  First, the review was discussed before the joint committee on a number of occasions in 2011 and 2012.  Second, the committee made a written submission to the review.  Finally, individual members and political parties also made written submissions.  The development meeting in May covered a number of very important issues.  It adopted conclusions on EU overseas development assistance, resilience, and the 11th European development fund on food and nutritional security.  It also endorsed conclusions on the post-2015 development framework in advance of the special event which Ireland is facilitating in September at the UN to review the millennium development goals.  Final conclusions, which include both developmental and environmental elements post-2015, were adopted at the General Affairs Council yesterday and these have been circulated to the committee.  In its EU work programme for 2013, the committee selected the post-2015 development framework as a priority.</p><p>  I welcome this opportunity to hear from the Minister of State about the conclusions adopted in this area and about the special event that is being organised for September 2013.  I invite the Minister of State to make his comments.</p></speech>

There has been a very strong focus during the course of the Presidency on development and world hunger.  The conference organised by the Department in Dublin Castle, which was attended by Ms Mary Robinson, was very successful.  The upcoming  IAPA conference will continue the strong focus in this area.  Our ongoing commitment in this area, both nationally and on the EU and international stage, is in line with our good reputation.</p></speech>

We have a larger role to play in this regard.  As a small country, our contribution, while significant to us, is less substantial in the overall global scenario.  It is important, however, that we leverage that contribution to encourage other countries to follow our example.  There is an obligation on all contributing countries to continue moving towards the UN target of 0.7% of GDP as quickly as possible.  We have found in the past that certain countries have allowed their provision to slip back.  In fact, the largest portion of overseas aid provision is concentrated among countries in the European Union.  We should be looking to Asia and the United States, for example, to do a little more.  Likewise, certain countries in the Middle East might be in a position to make a greater contribution.  That must be part of our efforts to maximise resources to tackle the problems faced by developing nations.</p><p>  We have spoken about efforts to ensure a greater focus on mutual trade.  That is a move in the right direction because it is about building sustainable economies rather than just addressing emergencies.  As the Minister of State said, this is vital for the future sustainability of recipient countries.  He also referred to measures to develop the private sector in those countries.  What strategies have been devised to achieve that particular goal?  On the other side of the coin, developing opportunities for trade provides benefits for Ireland, which is an important element in garnering public support for what we are trying to achieve.  This emphasis on mutual benefit should be part of our focus.  Have any periodic evaluations been undertaken in this regard and are there specific targets for achievement?  Our embassies abroad play a very constructive role in that regard and have embraced the commercial culture which was inducted ten or 15 years ago.  I am sure Mr. Cotter will have comments to make in that regard.</p><p>  I congratulate the Minister of State on his recent signing of the Arms Trade Treaty, ATT, in New York.  We should not underestimate the contribution this agreement can potentially make to reducing conflict in certain areas, conflict which can in itself be a huge contributor to deprivation, hunger and death.  Ireland should do its utmost to ensure the treaty is implemented to its maximum potential.</p><p>  Members of the committee have travelled to Lebanon and more recently to Palestine and the Middle East where we observed the conditions in which Palestinians have been living, for decades in some cases.  The trip included a visit to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, camp at Za'atari, which was set up last July and is now home to 120,000 refugees living in portakabins and tents and with access to basic infrastructure.  It is important that we leverage our influence on the political stage to seek a resolution of some of these long-standing conflicts.  People living in these areas are enduring great suffering.  We must do our best to ensure they can begin to look forward to a better future for themselves and their families.</p><p>  In regard to the analysis of bilateral ODA by sector, I am reminded that we in this country would trace much of our more recent economic success back to the decision by Donogh O'Malley to introduce free secondary education in the 1960s.  The concentration of resources since then on education, both secondary and tertiary, has been a significant driver of our economic growth.  In that context, I notice that only some 9% of the EU's allocation for development aid goes towards education.  A greater proportional focus on this area might be helpful in achieving the sustainability we seek.  This seems particularly relevant in the context of our visit to Jordan.  I understand too that only 2% of moneys go towards water and sanitation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-26a.848" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013062600006#E00200"><p>As with others, I welcome the policy paper and the consultation process, in addition to the fact that the Minister of State said he would not only like to hear the views of this committee's members but also the views of others.  He is still open to submissions.</p><p>  Let me concentrate on my concerns about the paper in order to be supportive and helpful.  With regard to hunger, the Government's policy focuses on what needs to change in developing countries but does little to acknowledge the many areas where change needs to happen in richer countries, as in respect of climate change, over-consumption and food wastage, for example.  The policy paper does not focus enough on the major drivers of hunger around the world.  Two pertinent issues are land grabbing and bio-fuels.  An Oxfam survey implies that 58% of global land acquisitions in recent years are for bio-fuel production.  Its research concludes that land used to produce bio-fuels for the European Union alone in 2008 could have been used to produce wheat and maize that could have fed 127 million people in that year.  This, in itself, is telling.  One fifth of the land in Senegal, Syria, Sierra Leone, one third of that in Liberia and over half of that in Cambodia has been acquired by companies.  It is no coincidence that this is happening at the same time as impoverishment and hunger among millions around the world.  The countries in question are producing the bio-fuels to fuel cars and maintain certain lifestyles while others starve.  The document should focus much more on this.  I am conscious that Irish people are aware of the Great Irish Famine and hunger.  It will be positive if we move in this regard.</p><p>  The policy document states Irish Aid spends 20% of its money on targeting hunger.  What qualifies as hunger expenditure?  Reference is made to building confidence but if people knew exactly where the money was spent, it would be useful.  Just as people talk about investing in the local hospital, for example, they need to know exactly where the aid money is going.  How does Irish Aid define and calculate hunger expenditure?</p><p>  A previous submission referred to aid being motivated by economic and trading interests.  This raises concerns, including among many NGOs.  Untied aid has always been an issue in Ireland.  There is now concern that there will be changes in this regard owing to the shift of focus to trade.  Comhl&aacute;mh and various NGOs have raised this, particularly in respect of the African strategy.  While there should be emphasis on promoting companies and trade, it ought to be separated from aid; it cannot just be a driver on its own.  Although reference is made to confidence, the Irish are concerned about poverty and inequality around the world and want to see aid going to the affected regions.  Trade is helpful to Ireland but it should not be the main point of focus.  This view was expressed by many but it does not seem to be reflected in the new policy document.  Why has it not been included?</p><p>  Sierra Leone has been included as the new key partner.  I welcome the selection but note that East Timor has been dropped as a key partner.  I do not know why.  What criteria were used to select Sierra Leone as a new key partner and to drop East Timor?</p><p>  The Minister of State talked about the post-2015 development framework.  The European Union should be leading by suggesting what richer countries should be doing to change their economic, trade and financial practices.  There was never much focus on this kind of development.  Perhaps the Irish Government should do so.  It is necessary to focus on income inequality.  I asked earlier about what was happening in Brazil, one of the world's economic drivers.  In regard to Brazil, the questions of inequality, poverty and slums arise.  The Minister of State can understand why people are rising up in that country.  Such uprisings, including the Arab spring, are the result of discrimination, inequality and people's aspirations not being met.  We need to respond to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-26a.849" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013062600006#E00300"><p>An interesting transition has taken place in that this committee used to focus on foreign affairs, and almost exclusively on aid, while it now focuses on trade and trade links.  We are now speaking increasingly about development aid.  I welcome the challenges and new direction, which direction has been taken in conjunction with the African ambassadors, headed by the Kenyan ambassador, who is spokesperson for approximately seven African countries.  They argue very strongly that benefits can be gleaned for their countries and ours from an improvement in the areas of trade and development.</p><p>  Am I correct in my summary of the current thinking of the Irish Government?  We praise ourselves a lot, quite rightly, over aid we extend to the poorer regions.  Increasingly, I am beginning to come to terms with the fact that our aid, by comparison with that of other countries and regions, is tiny, although that is not to say it is not important.  We acknowledge the millennium development goals and we are engaged in the process of determining what happens next.  We note the European Union's development contribution and we hear about the role of the United Nations in aid and development.  A large number of charities are pumping billions of euro, presumably, into this area.</p><p>  The Minister of State said we are now engaged with EU joint programming.  That sounds very positive because, at the Irish Aid function with Mary Robinson, we met people for the very first time who are campaigning on matters that we did not really address, such as the concerns of pastoralists.  The Masai tribespeople are pastoralists and are encountering many problems owing to game reserves and land that has been developed that is not in their ownership.  Fishermen around Lake Victoria are facing a diminishing water supply.  Major projects must and should be completed that will offer greater returns than those accruing from the investment of small sums of money.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-26a.851" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1026" speakername="Olivia Mitchell" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013062600007#F00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for ensuring that the traditional Irish commitment to aid was maintained in the budget in so far as this was possible in our current straitened circumstances.  Although the overseas aid budget has been reduced in recent years it has not decreased as rapidly as many other programmes, in recognition of the fact that many people around the world are worse off than us.</p><p>  Deputy Crowe raised the issue of trade.  While I do not think the shift in emphasis should give rise to conflict, concerns have been expressed about EU policies such as the raw materials initiative and economic partnership agreements.  It has been suggested that agreements like these, to which we are party as EU members, are designed to meet the needs of Europe rather the countries with which we sign partnerships.  We should be conscious that we do not work to opposing purposes by offering aid on the one hand while signing agreements that are not to partner countries' advantage on the other.</p><p>  At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I ask the Minister about the emphasis on maternal health and population issues in our aid programme.  I have heard several people complain that our One World document has not received sufficient attention in our goals but it is mentioned in the important part of the document, namely, essential services.  As that is a less aspirational aspect it might produce the goods at the end of the day.  It is mentioned twice, in the context of the Cairo agreement on reproductive health care and access to contraceptive services, respectively.  The next step is to ensure the implementation programme sets out concrete actions.  I rely on the Minister of State to ensure that will be the case.  I made representations to him in advance of the Council meeting to ensure that the positive Cairo agreement language on maternal health was included and I was pleased to see that it was.</p><p>  The section on the rapid response initiative refers to fragile states and the continued deployment of highly skilled personnel and emergency supplies.  I remind the Minister of State that, for women in conflict situations, emergency supplies often include contraceptives.  This is particularly important now that rape appears to have become a common weapon of war.  We must work with NGOs to ensure they appreciate the importance of contraceptives.  I recognise that food, water and shelter are primary considerations but the availability of contraceptives is also important to many women because the normal supply chains disappear in conflict situations.  </p><p>  I ask for clarification on the implementation document.  I thought the Minister of State referred to a 36 page document but he went on to say he was about to begin the consultation phase.  I must have gotten mixed up.  </p></speech>

Having travelled to Sierra Leone, I am glad to see it listed as a new partner country.  Our visit was a learning experience and I was struck by the magnitude of the task of rebuilding given the lack of essential urban services such as basic public lighting, sanitary services and footpaths.  This was in stark contrast to the level of investment in the mining industry.  The degree to which the lid can be kept on that level of social inequality is questionable.  In the course of our new partnership with Sierra Leone, I hope Ireland and the international community address this issue.  The Minister of State has also visited Sierra Leone and has seen the tremendous work being done by Sr. Mary in her schools.  I also pay tribute to the work done by NGOs over many years.  Our emphasis must now be on the extent to which the international community is prepared to focus on the problems of inequality in countries like Sierra Leone.  We cannot allow that situation to continue unchecked for a prolonged period.</p><p>  Land ownership is a serious problem on the continent of Africa.  A particular problem is the way in which families are encouraged to sign over property which may contain valuable resources without adequate compensation.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-26a.854" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1159" speakername="Mark Daly" time="17:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013062600008#G00200"><p>I raised the issue of the overseas aid budget with the Minister of State when he was in the Seanad previously.  The annual report indicates that &euro;206 million is provided in multilateral aid, including &euro;128 million for EU development co-operation.  Of the latter amount, &euro;109 million in taxpayers' money, or money we borrowed from the EU itself, is being given back to EU institutions.  The report gives a breakdown of every cent provided in bilateral funding, including &euro;3,000 for a group in Sligo.  Can we get the same level of detail on how the EU spends its money?  We have given &euro;18 million to the World Bank.  I am not sure if that is money we have already borrowed from the World Bank.  Will we get credit on the interest we are paying?  Given the size of our contributions in multilateral aid, I am concerned that the money is getting tied up in institutions and bureaucracies rather than reaching the ground.</p><p>  This committee is occasionally asked to approve five-year rolling funds for EU programmes, involving sums of money that can amount to millions of euro.  Ireland has committed to making a proportionate contribution to the EU budget and, as our funding for overseas shrinks, our commitment to the EU stays at the same percentage.  The amount of money provided to the headline bilateral programmes with partner countries must shrink because of our commitments to EU institutions.</p><p>  I join Deputy Crowe in asking the Minister of State to explain how we select or deselect partner countries.  Our involvement with Sierra Leone started through a great initiative by an Irish citizen and Dublin Bus employee who pushed the Government to do the right thing for a country with which we had no strategic or economic interest.  Few countries in Europe would do the right thing for a country located so far away.  We have since started a partnership with another country that clearly needs our assistance.</p></speech>

In the aftermath of the fraud discovered in Uganda, senior officials from the Department and the director of Irish Aid gave a full presentation to this committee on the progress that had been made in that country.  At a time when every household in Ireland is facing challenges it is difficult for the Government to maintain the overseas aid budget at an acceptable level.  It would be useful to communicate to the public the benefits that have accrued to the most deprived of people from programmes that Irish Aid funded in Uganda and elsewhere.  In respect of Uganda, we learned about the great progress that has been made in educational attainment and retention at primary level and in the development of health facilities.  Awareness of these successes would help to maintain public support for Irish Aid programmes and the NGOs which are currently finding it difficult to raise funds.</p><p>  Much of the support provided by the United States and other major powers is in the form of tied aid.  Have any proposals been made at European Union level on weaning countries off tied aid?  Untied aid is clearly more beneficial to recipient countries.</p></speech>

I will address as many of them as I can.</p><p>  We have been doing our best to stabilise the overseas development aid budget, which decreased more than 30% from its high of 0.5% of GDP in 2008.  In 2012 we were at 0.48% and the figures for 2013 will depend on the performance of the economy.  We intend to maintain expenditure at close to the 0.5% level and the programme for Government commits us to reaching 0.7% if economic circumstances permit.  We have done extraordinarily well considering our economic difficulties.  We are encouraging other countries to maintain or increase their expenditure.  Some have done so but others have slid backwards due to economic pressures.  The United Kingdom, which is under considerable economic pressure, has increased its spending from 0.56% of GDP in 2012 to more than 0.7% this year.  That is a most welcome development.  The UK is considering a statutory requirement to increase overseas development assistance to 1%, which would be significantly higher than the United Nations target.  That is an interesting development given that the UK's governing Conservative Party is under considerable pressure in regard to expenditure.</p><p>  Our efforts to maintain our ODA levels are seen by many as a good example and have given us valuable credibility during our Presidency.  The fact that we are regarded as being serious about our expenditure allows us to exert leadership as a small country even though we cannot draw on a massive amount of resources.  Proportionately, we are seen as very generous both in terms of official ODA and individual donations to overseas development initiatives.  We are still No. 1 in the world in our generosity to collections for developing countries and global disasters.</p><p>  Opinions on trade differ.  We have come to the firm conclusion that trade must be part of the equation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-26a.862" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/974" speakername="Pat Breen" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013062600012#L00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive presentation and replies to the members' questions.  The questions were very varied and the Minister will see that members have a huge interest in this area.  It is very much part of our work programme.  Obviously, there is huge potential in forging closer relationships with the countries the Minister mentioned.  He outlined the framework for how Ireland will move forward in the future.  The committee members have seen some of that work during some of the visits that have taken place.  An example is Ethiopia, which we visited two years ago.  It has transformed itself into a very successful economy now, after the poverty and hunger it went through a number of years ago.  Last year, the committee visited Sierra Leone, a country that has been through civil war.  We saw some of the work Irish Aid and the NGOs are doing there.  As it is a partner country now, there will be more focus on the priority areas the Minister mentioned.  Obviously, the business and trade element is important.  When I first visited Africa I saw for myself how green it is.  The Minister mentioned the millions of acres of land in Mozambique and we saw some of the projects Irish Aid is doing there in helping farmers to help themselves and to grow more food.  All of these projects are small but they can be made bigger.  It is like a seed growing.</p><p>  I sincerely thank the Minister.  The committee will have a different focus now from the previous visits.  We will be visiting Ghana, which the Minister visited last year, to look at the potential for trade for Ireland.  That will be an interesting visit for the committee in September.  There is a different focus but it is part of the way things are going forward.  One World, One Future is a very important document and I am delighted that the Minister intends to retrace his footsteps back to the roots of where this document originated in terms of the views of the many people who attended those meetings.  It will be valuable for the Minister to get the views of these people on the document.  Many of the NGOs are delighted with what is included in the document.</p><p>  I also thank the Minister of State's team including Mr. Vincent O'Neill, with whom we have been working closely over the last number of years, and Mr. Tony Cotter, a fellow Clare man.  Tony has spent much time in Africa as well.  The questions were wide ranging and the discussion was interesting.  We look forward to more discussions with the Minister and his team in the future.  Well done to him and the T&aacute;naiste on the work they did during the EU Presidency and we hope it reaps rewards.</p></speech>

On Vote 35, the appropriations-in-aid figure shows a net decrease of 12%.  Any decrease is welcome but how did that come about?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-26a.876" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2013062600003#B00400"><p>In the context of the appropriations-in-aid figure, the out-turn in 2012 was &euro;5.940 million and it is estimated in 2013 we will be spending &euro;6 million.  That is a slight increase.  The subhead essentially provides receipts by way of appropriations-in-aid to the Army pension fund under the following headings: contributions to spouses' and children's pensions scheme by officers, NCOs and privates, contributions to the Defence Forces contributory main pension scheme, recoveries of overpayments, payments received in respect of transfer of services.  Contributions to pension schemes account for both the receipts under this subhead.  The differentiation was a small decrease on the numbers in receipt of pensions that effected the savings the Deputy mentioned.</p></speech>

It is impossible to predict who might pass away in any one year, which might impact on the figures.  The Estimate is frequently higher in some instances than the out-turn.  This year, the out-turn will be higher than the Estimate and that is where we must supplement from within the Department of Defence Vote for any additional expenditure that might have to be incurred.  Effectively we are half way through the year and we do not have an insight into who might retire.  This happens in both the Defence Forces and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There are individuals who may reach a point where they will get all or the substantial part of their pensions but they enjoy the job and stay on while others retire unexpectedly for health or family reasons.  It is an inexact science trying to predict the number of retirements in any one year.</p></speech>

I understand the out-turns and the Estimates but it is hard to predict the increases or decreases at this stage.  It is no reflection on the Minister but it is not an exact science.  It cannot be accurate at this stage.</p></speech>

To date this year, some 60 personnel have retired on a  pension.  This is below the expected level.</p></speech>

The number is affected by the number who may retire but at the appropriate moment we engage in recruitment and there will be recruitment this year, most likely in the second half of the year, to maintain strength.  By the time we get through September, we will have a clear idea what the likely numbers will be at the end of the year.  There are still three or four months left that are unpredictable but we have a fairly clear idea because of advance notice that people must give.</p></speech>

Has there been a spike in retirements due to the reorganisation?  The 60 retiring this year appears to be a small number when we consider the number in 2012.  I am new to this process but I do not understand why civil servants working in the Defence Forces have pensions charged to the Department of Defence Vote rather than the Army pension Vote.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-26a.886" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2013062600004#C00600"><p>There are historical reasons for that, it has been going on for some years.</p><p>  Numbers are difficult.  Some people retired in anticipation of budgetary decisions that might have affected their pension had they retired at a lesser stage.  Under the financial framework in place, there is a 14 month leeway period before anyone will be impacted.  In 2008 there were 276 retirements on pension, 425 in 2009, 427 in 2010, 498 in 2011, the period immediately after the 2010 budget, and in 2012 there were 597 retirements.  That was a high figure and gives an insight into why only 60 people have retired so far this year.  Some individuals who may have been due to retire in 2013 could have had some concerns because of constant speculation about the budget in 2012.  Those people might have decided to retire because of that.</p><p>  My view, and I may be proved wrong by the end of the year, is that is why there was a spike last year and a reduced number this year.  People often make decisions in the second half of the year.  That is why September and October will give us a better insight.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the manner in which the Defence Forces have adapted over more than a decade to the changing circumstances.  Their continuing dedication to reform is admirable.</p><p>  The Minister has signalled his intention when he publishes the Green Paper to move to a two brigade structure.  What sort of savings will arise from that reorganisation?  We can go back ten or 15 years when the Defence Forces had very poor equipment.  One of the achievements of the 14 years the Minister loves to refer to was the substantial improvements in the quality and range of equipment available to the Defence Forces.  Given we are now operating internationally in a completely different environment, are we still replacing equipment as required?  Are we getting better value for money from the equipment?</p><p>  It is quite frightening how regularly the explosive ordnance disposal unit is being called out.  Can the Minister estimate the cost to the taxpayer of that increased number of call-outs?</p><p>  I welcome the announcement of the date for the publication of the Green Paper.  We all look forward to engaging with the Minister on it.</p><p>  On the question of civilian employees in the Department of Defence, in the time I have had available to me, I have not been able to identify the levels of retirement among the civilian employees.  What is the trend and what costs are there?  In future, to what extent will civilians be employed to work along side Defence Forces personnel?</p></speech>

In 2008, there were 409, in 2009 there were 375, in 2010 there were 353 and in 2011 there were 247.  The number now stands at 349.  That is a small number for an entire Department that administers a pay scheme for the Defence Forces and deals with all levels of policy issues, administrative matters and D&aacute;il questions.  It is an area that is not as visible as it should be because the media is not interested in it although it has a substantial engagement internationally and gives me great back-up in those areas.  We have had a substantial engagement in defence matters since my appointment and that was heightened during the EU Presidency, not only in the informal meeting and the related arrangements in Dublin Castle, but also at relevant meetings of the External Action Service dealing with defence issues in Europe and meetings of the European Defence Agency.  We held four separate international conferences on a series of issues during the Presidency.  We had a top-level conference last Thursday in Brussels that brought together for the first time in the European Union both the justice and defence sides in the field of cybersecurity.  Unfortunately that gets no media attention despite the importance of the issue.  It gets substantial attention from departmental officials.</p><p>  I have great admiration for all of my staff in the Department of Defence.  They work long hours beyond the call of duty, frequently for no additional financial benefit.  They carry an enormous policy agenda which means we are addressing all of the domestic issues with substantial work done, for example, in preparing the Green Paper.  We are dealing with all the EU issues relating to the common security and defence policy.</p></speech>

We were mightily impressed with his vision and ambition for the Naval Service.  One of the areas that was particularly impressive was that of innovation, where the Naval Service is working with academia and indigenous Irish companies to develop products, using its practical experience in areas like diving and training.  I ask the Minister to comment on whether there is potential for profits to be made in that area which could be invested back into the Naval Service.  It is a really good news story that we need to champion whenever we get the opportunity.  We were mightily impressed with Commodore Mellett.</p><p>  I wish to ask about the Reserve Defence Forces.  The representative association of the RDF made a presentation to our committee in which it demonstrated some practical ways to save money.  It has significant concerns about the future.  The Minister has made the point previously that people within various organisations are afraid of change and that is a valid point.  However, the points made by the representatives of the RDF were legitimate and we asked that the transcript of their presentation be sent on to the Minister for his consideration.  If he has not done so already, will the Minister give an undertaking to meet them in a constructive way and to listen to them?  Decisions have already been made on foot of the value-for-money report.  The Minister has accepted the recommendations of that report and is initiating change but there may be a possibility of finding a mid-way point on the issues with which they are concerned.  Opportunities could exist in that regard and I ask for the Minister's thoughts on that matter.</p></speech>

Will the Minister give an update on when that is expected to be delivered?  I also note that the outturn for this year is &euro;31 million compared to &euro;33 million last year.  I understand that takes into account the purchase of marine fuel and equipment but I am not sure whether it takes into account the purchase of vessels or whether it includes a provision for the contract for two new off-shore patrol vessels.  There is one vessel due shortly and another one due some time thereafter.</p><p>  I also concur with Deputy Mac Lochlainn's comments regarding what we saw at the Naval College and how impressed we all were on that visit.</p></speech>

I agree that what is going on in Haulbowline is fantastic.  Commodore Mellett is doing a superb job down there.  I visited the college very shortly after my appointment as Minister and spoke with many of the individuals involved in SMEs.  It is something that I have particularly encouraged.  We established something that did not exist when I came into office.  We have now involved Enterprise Ireland with the Defence Forces to look at ways in which the Defence Forces can be of assistance in the development of particular industries or can engage in research and development projects.  Ultimately, the aim is to develop products that will be of benefit to our Defence Forces and those of other countries and to create jobs.  I am giving that every encouragement.  The engagement with Enterprise Ireland is proving very fruitful and beneficial.  The innovation project has the capacity to create a number of jobs as well as to generate savings.  It creates the possibility of equipment that we trial being made freely available to our Defence Forces.  Once the equipment has been trialled by the Defence Forces - bearing in mind the importance of safety issues - and it proves valuable, small Irish companies will be producing a product with added validity, enabling it to be sold outside the State, thus creating jobs.  Basically, what we get is increased personnel and capability development at no cost, which is of great value.  The collaboration with academic and industrial partners by both the National Maritime College of Ireland, NMCI and the Irish Maritime and Energy Resources Cluster is of great value.  The growth of IMERC resulted in the creation of 30 civilian jobs in 2012.  This is a very exciting project and a very good news story.  It has huge potential.</p><p>  Some of the projects currently being supported include hazard prediction analysis of chemical and biological warfare agents in a dense urban environment, blast overpressure from current improvised explosive devices, IEDs, and blast wave interactions in an urban environment and the development of lightweight armour systems for first responders with Carlow Institute of Technology.  This is all part of the engagement that is taking place.  Work is also being done on explosive and chemical testing sensors and a project on developing procedures, practices and guidelines for forensic aspects of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear, CBRN defences  with the Tyndall National Institute.  There are a number of areas of development and I see this as something that can grow.  Enterprise Ireland's engagement in this process is very important because this may attract investment from abroad in areas where we can develop niche industries and in which there are niche markets.  This will be to the benefit of the Defence Forces and will save public money, as well as having the capacity to create something very valuable in the long term which could create a substantially larger number of jobs than heretofore.  I have spoken to some of the Irish entrepreneurs involved in this who are very happy with the level of engagement by the Defence Forces.  I know that at committee meetings such as this one does not normally refer to individual members of the Defence Forces but Commodore Mark Mellett has been a leading figure, along with others in the college, in developing this very important and worthwhile project.  I was very pleased to hear that the committee had visited the college.</p><p>  On the question of the new naval ships, the good news is that the first ship is coming along extremely well.  We anticipate that it will be undergoing its sea trials in the autumn and that it will be commissioned early next year.  The second ship is expected in 2015.  We are being very careful financially in this regard.  The construction of the ships involve staged payments which have been included within the Department's Estimates over the last number of years.  There is no difficulty with us meeting our obligations.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-26a.909" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2013062600007#F00900"><p>Let me give the committee the update on that. One of the key initiatives in 2012 is to cater for the relocation of some 50 military personnel from Col&aacute;iste Caoimh&iacute;n in Dublin to Newbridge.  There are great benefits to be achieved by greater integration between the military and civil sides so there is greater connectivity.  A spatial audit in Newbridge has been undertaken.  Space has been identified to accommodate Defence Forces personnel in the human resources area.  The target date for relocation is September 2013 and the initiative involves the relocation of a number of departmental staff on the civil side. </p><p>  Assessments by OPW architects and what are described as furniture specialists - I am not sure whether all of us could qualify as furniture specialists - are underway.  It requires some structural works to be undertaken.  They have been identified and obviously if this move is to be achieved by the end of September they will have to be commenced shortly.  That is basically where things are. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the decentralisation project was only partially completed.  We had the property decentralisation of the civil side to Newbridge and the second part of this which envisaged a new building for the Defence Forces did not and could not occur in the financial circumstances.  I do not mean to upset Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l.  I do believe the last Government made a mistake in transferring an entire Department to Newbridge.  I know it is of benefit to people in Newbridge that people are there.  It produced a very dramatic change of personnel within the Department, and we have very good personal in the Department, but it is the only main Government Department whose main Department is outside Dublin.  What that has bequeathed to the Department is that where senior officials, such as Secretaries General, have to engage with other Secretaries General - there is a meeting every Wednesday morning between Secretaries General in different Departments - the Secretaries General of every other Department are in Dublin and the Secretary General of the Department of Defence has to travel from Newbridge to Dublin and Dublin to Newbridge.</p></speech>

When one is talking about connected, integrated government and the myriad other meetings which officials have to attend, including the Secretary General, I think the last Government thought it had discovered a manner of governing which the Romans discovered was a major error when they tried to disperse government around their empire, which subsequently collapsed.  It was a mistake.  </p><p>  One cannot have senior officials in Departments at a distance from each other to such an extent that people have to spend an hour on the road travelling one way and an hour on the road travelling another.  It is a waste of time and is not in the public interest.  I see it in the context of myriad different meetings which take place of officials in different Cabinet sub-committees where officials attend with particular areas of specialties across different Departments. </p><p>  There is a very good case for certain Government services being decentralised.  For example, the move to Galway on the financial side was a very workable proposition.  Senior officials need to be in the centre where they can interact easily with colleagues.  Business can be conducted by telephone and other ways, but where there is a need for meetings and for people to sit around a table collectively it means an unnecessary amount of time is wasted by people travelling backwards and forwards.</p></speech>

I will not delay the meeting by going through the list.  It includes the naval base and Casement Aerodrome in Baldonnel.  In addition, a number of smaller properties are used by the RDF. </p><p>  The reorganisation of the RDF has resulted in number of properties becoming vacant.  It is the same as in regard to barracks.  For example, a lot of work is being done on barracks which have been made vacant and where arrangements can be made to effect sales of all or part of them.</p></speech>

Petition No. P00061/12 from Ms Patricia O'Neill calls for a media campaign, similar to the anti-drink driving campaign, to increase public awareness of suicide.  As we have already discussed this matter with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, I propose that we convey the transcript of the meeting and the opening statements to Ms O'Neill and thereby close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  Petition No. P00043/12 from Mr. Thomas Kevin Walshe relates to the eligibility criteria for the back to education allowance scheme.  As we have had the petitioner before the committee to discuss the issue, I propose that we convey the transcript of the meeting and the opening statements to him and thereby close the petition.

In fact, several speakers referred to similar cases in their own area.  I propose that we go with recommendations Nos. 2 and 3 from the secretariat, namely, to refer the matter to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government for his consideration, and seek the comments of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the relevant local authority.</p></speech>

That is a concoction, which is not covered by the legislation.  In the interests of equity, therefore, we should write to the Minister asking for the issue to be revisited in order to achieve a fairer outcome.</p></speech>

Agreed.</p><p>  We will now take decisions on Schedule A items.  COM (2013) 195 is a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and Council amending directive 96/53/EC of 25 July 1996 laying down for certain road vehicles circulating within the Community the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international traffic.  It is suggested that this proposal warrants further scrutiny.  It is proposed to identify the relevant stakeholders and meet them at a later date.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  COM (2013) 296 is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and Council establishing a framework on market access to port services and the financial transparency of ports.  It is suggested that this proposal warrants further scrutiny.  It is proposed to request that officials from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport attend a meeting with the joint committee to give a full explanation of this proposal and its impact to assist the committee in its scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p><p>  As there is no other business, I propose to adjourn the meeting. </p></speech>
