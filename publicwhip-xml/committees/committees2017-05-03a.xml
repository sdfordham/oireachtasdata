The petitioner is seeking an appeals mechanism to appeal decisions of the Minister for Justice and Equality on the determination of the level of disablement under the Garda Pensions Order 1925.  He also claims the Pensions Ombudsman does not have the same powers as his counterpart in the United Kingdom when examining decisions of the Minister in relation to the awarding of this pension.  The Pensions Ombudsman cannot ensure that the level of disablement assessment carried out by the Department of Justice and Equality is conducted in a proper and fair manner.  Also, the Pensions Ombudsman cannot determine if the medical practitioner was given incorrect information or if the medical practitioner erred in conducting the assessment.  It is proposed that we correspond once again with the Department to seek clarification on whether the Minister has responsibility for approving all applications to the scheme, or only cases where the initial decision has been appealed.  That is the first recommendation.</p> <p>  The next recommendation is that we ask the Department to correspond with the petitioner, outlining the policy elements as opposed to the personal elements of the issue at hand.  Third, we will correspond with the Pensions Ombudsman to ascertain his view on an appeals mechanism to appeal decisions to the Minister for Justice and Equality on the determination of the level of disablement under the Garda Pensions Order 1925.  We will also seek to examine the procedures followed by the Defence Forces when processing applications for a special pension where the applicant was injured in the line of duty.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next petition for consideration is petition No. P00002/17, from Mr. Thomas Geraghty, entitled, Civil rights for Civil Servants.  This petition has been resubmitted by the general secretary of the Public Service Executive Union on behalf of the PSEU.  It is in regard to the restrictions placed on civil servants in relation to running for election to public office and membership of a political party.  Governed by circular 9/2009 and in particular paragraph 14, civil servants, other than those in the exempted categories in paragraph 13 must not speak in public on matters of local or national political controversy or express views on such matters in the media, including electronic media and the press, or in books, academic papers, articles or leaflets.</p><p>In effect, certain categories of civil servants are restricted from making comments on matters whether or not such matters have relevance or not to their jobs.  The petitioners agree that there needs to be some restrictions, but this should not involve the removal of basic civil rights for all civil servants.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform responded to the previous Administration confirming that it had no intention of amending the current terms and conditions of employment for civil servants.  The committee considered responses from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Department.  It is proposed to correspond with the Department to ascertain the following: first, its views on amending the Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour, to provide an explanation as to the political activity that is prohibited under the code, and the disciplinary action that is applicable when civil servants take part in political activity; and second, whether the Department would consider the drafting of legislation to deal with this.  It is further proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to the petitioner and the petition will remain open.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> The next petition for consideration is No. P00005/17 from Ms Christine Cullen, entitled, Make Co-operation with Trump Administration Conditional on Human Rights.  We have previously gone through the outline of the petition.  I propose to forward the response from the Department of Foreign Affairs, along with a copy of the Taoiseach's speech, to the petitioner and close the petition.  The Taoiseach stated: "The European Union is, above all else, a community of nations built on shared values &ndash; these values include human dignity, freedom and democracy, equality, and the rule of law.  Values that I know are shared on this side of the Atlantic."   Is the recommendation agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> The next petition for consideration is No. P00016/17, from Mr. Norman Wilson, entitled, The Cost of Irish Passports.  I do not propose to go into the petition in greater detail and I suggest that we forward a copy of the response received from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the petitioner and close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I begin by welcoming Ms Oonagh Fleming, Childcare Committees Ireland, CCI, chair and manager of Kerry County Childcare Committee, Ms Karen McCarthy, CCI national representative and manager of Clare County Childcare Committee, and Ms Karen O'Sullivan, CCI representative and manager of the Cork County Childcare Committee and thank them for making themselves available this morning and appearing before the committee.</p><p>Before we commence, in accordance with procedure I am required to draw their attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode, as they interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters to report the meeting, as well as adversely affecting television and web streaming.  I advise the witnesses that any submissions or opening statements made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  I understand the witnesses will make a short presentation, which will be followed by questions from members of the committee.</p><p>I invite Ms Fleming to make her opening statement.  We will then take opening statements from her colleagues.</p></speech>

I am joined this morning by my colleagues, Karen McCarthy and Karen O'Sullivan.  We are here to represent our national network of 30 city and county child care committees and we welcome the opportunity to discuss our work.</p> <p>  The city and county child care committees were assigned by the National Childcare Strategy in 2000 as the key local component in the development of a co-ordinated approach to quality child care.</p> <p>  The child care committees are funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, DCYA, to act as its local agent in the delivery of the national early education and child care programmes and the implementation of Government policy at child care committee level.  We are positioned as the first port of call for both parents and early years providers when trying to access many of today's early years care and education initiatives.  Having a local focus and knowledge ensures that child care committees are well positioned to support the development and future sustainability of early years services that cater for the needs of local parents and children.</p> <p>  The functions and roles of the child care committees are aligned to support the implementation of national policy at local level.  In addition, we play a key co-ordinating role and are still actively involved in various co-ordinating bodies which support the delivery of supports to children and families.  As the established local delivery structure for the early years, child care committees play a crucial role in supporting the ongoing development of the early years sector in each child care committee area, identifying local needs, and developing and implementing plans to address these.  This has been one of our core functions since our establishment in 2001.</p> <p>  Between 2000 to 2010, the Government, initially in partnership with the EU, invested &euro;425 million capital funding to create child care places throughout Ireland.  The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, EOCP, and the National Childcare Investment Programme, NCIP, provided capital funding, staffing grants and quality programmes.  The child care committees were key to the success of these programmes which led to the creation of over 65,000 child care places in the early years sector.</p> <p>  Our role has continued to expand and it is our national reach and our unique relationship with the early years providers that makes possible the effective and efficient implementation of national policy to more than 4,500 early years services.</p><p>As well as the ongoing work of supporting the capacity of the sector, CCCs have been tasked with the local management of the processes required to deliver the various national funded programmes.  The work of the CCCs has been independently evaluated and the last published report showed that 95% of services reported a high satisfaction rating from early years services regarding the supports provided to them by CCCs.  As the local delivery agent and business partner of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the CCCs are a key component of the development of early years provision nationally.  Local delivery by the CCCs is effective and provides value for money.  Of the circa &euro;260 million investment into the sector, the funding of the CCCs accounts for only 4% of this budget.  This national delivery structure has been further strengthened through our national network, Childcare Committees Ireland, CCI, which provides a coherent structure for various bodies to plan and implement its policy brief.  As the national network, CCI works closely with a range of other Government Departments, agencies and organisations to ensure our systems are strong and effective.  Not only have the CCCs remained very focused on responding to local need, they have been equally responsive to the implementation of a range of national programmes and their work supports the realisation of the objectives and targets of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  This will be further enhanced in 2017 with additional supports being developed and delivered by CCCs to all early years services to support new initiatives and the new regulatory regime.  I will now hand over to my colleague, Ms Karen McCarthy, who will outline the role of the CCCs in supporting the delivery of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the Government's national policy framework for children and young people.  Our work is aligned with the five national outcomes.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-03a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Karen McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017050300002#B00200"><p>Outcome one of the policy framework is that children are active and healthy.  The CCCs support early years services to promote children's health and well-being using the national curriculum framework, Aistear.  This is achieved through a partnership approach with the early years service providers and other stakeholders.  CCCs also support early years services settings to deliver experiences to children that build on development protective factors, such as emotional resilience, a sense of self-esteem and good social networks.  In addition the CCCs deliver the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion, EDI, training courses under the Access and Inclusion model.  These courses commenced in November 2016.  The CCCs will have delivered 80 courses to nearly 1,000 providers in the first half of 2017.</p> <p>  Outcome two is about children achieving full potential in all areas of learning and development.  CCCs work with early years services to ensure that the quality of the educational experience delivered supports very young children to achieve the best foundation in learning and development.  This includes supporting the implementation of S&iacute;olta, the National Quality Framework, through our S&iacute;olta mentor supports and participation currently in an Aistear pilot which is running in many CCC areas.  During 2016, 56 of our staff completed a S&iacute;olta Training of Trainers and are now actively implementing S&iacute;olta with early years services across the country.  The introduction of the ECCE programme better known as the free preschool year in 2009 was a milestone and represented an important step in the provision of universal early childhood care and education to children aged between three and six years.  We support the administration of this programme.  In 2015-2016, 4,178 early years services were contracted to offer the ECCE programme nationally.  Approximately 95% of eligible children participate in ECCE and have done so from the outset.  2016 saw the launch of the access and inclusion model which provides a range of supports designed to ensure that children with disabilities can access the ECCE programme.  We play a crucial role in this model in respect of information and supports to both parents and early years services.</p> <p>  Outcome three is that children are safe and protected from harm.  The Government commitment to Children First has been evidenced over recent years with focus on the implementation of sectoral plans.  The CCCs have been at the forefront of this for the early years sector.  We have responsibility for the roll-out of the Always Children First child protection and welfare training programme to early years settings with a stated aim of ensuring that relevant staff from every service throughout the country receive accredited child protection and welfare training.  The roll-out of this training is co-ordinated and delivered by CCCs with over 14,000 early years practitioners have completed the training to date.  </p> <p>  Outcome four is that children have economic security and opportunity.  The CCCs work with early years services to support access for children whose emotional, social and intellectual development may be challenged through experiences of poverty and social exclusion.  This is achieved through the implementation of the community child care subvention schemes in early years services who provide for our most vulnerable children and families.  In addition, the CCCs promote and administer a suite of supports that enable parents to avail of subsidised child care to facilitate their labour market participation and education and training opportunities.  The CCCs further support the community providers regarding sustainable service provision, including financial advice and individualised plans for their delivery of service.  The CCCs have well-established systems in place to provide this type of support, for example, the ongoing work with community services to address the issues of reliance on community employment, CE, participants.  This work involves intensive one-to-one supports for those services identified with this issue.  This has involved CCC staff teams conducting indepth business analysis reviews to support the service to work towards sustainability and operation of their businesses without having to rely on CE participants to meet their regulatory requirements of staff-child ratios and qualification requirements.  A total of &euro;1 million in funding has been allocated by the Government to support these services and to date, 47 services have received funding under for recruitment and human resources supports and are now working with their CCCs to submit for once-off transitional funding.  </p> <p>  Outcome five is about children being connected, respected and contributing.  CCCs support this outcome through their work supporting equality, diversity and inclusion with the delivery of the access and inclusion model. The activities being delivered by CCCs under this model go a long way to support this national outcome and include the delivery of the EDI training noted earlier and supports to develop inclusion polices within each early years services.</p> <p>  The CCCs acknowledge the Government's continued investment in the early years sector and have welcomed the opportunity to be part of its fast and expanding evolution.  It is also important to acknowledge cross-party support where party manifestos recognise the need for early years investment to support working parents and the positive effect that quality early years experiences can have on a child's development.  Research has stated that the early years of a child's life has an impact on their lifelong learning and development.  It is a time when rapid growth and development occur.  This sector is the first rung on the education ladder and it is, therefore, critical that investment continues to grow in supporting children and their families.  This investment provides quality foundations for children with the hope of reducing interventions in later years.  With our success to date, we also welcome the opportunity to have a continued role as the local delivery mechanism for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the opportunity to maintain and build on the important relationships that we have established over the last 16 years.  We thank members for their attention and welcome any questions you may have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-03a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1266" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017050300002#B00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  I have tied in with our local CCC and was on its board years ago.  I was the ICTU representative about ten years in Kilkenny so I know a lot about the work done by the CCCs.  My first question is about resources and might be difficult to answer.  Do the witnesses feel the CCCs are adequately resourced given that there have been so many new schemes like the ECCE scheme and CCS and that the CCCs will now be taking on the affordable child care scheme?  The amount of assistance the CCCs must give providers will be huge.  It will be a really significant increase.  Do the witnesses feel that resources match that or are the CCCs expected to deliver the same service when more and more is added to it each year?</p> <p>  I also wonder about engagement with providers.  My own experience is that most providers do engage very well but have the witnesses ever experienced a situation where some early years facilities do not engage as well as others?  My other point concerns staff.  I welcome the fact that &euro;1 million has been provided for human resources.</p><p>Many facilities are under pressure and find it difficult if someone is out sick or if there is a day when it does not meet the child to worker ratio.  I realise this is a resource issue, but I am keen to hear the opinions of the city and county child care committee representatives.  Is there any possibility of the committees drawing on a panel for relief staff?  It could take a great deal of pressure off some facilities if those responsible knew that there was a panel of Garda-vetted and qualified staff.  It might be looked at in future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-03a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017050300002#C00200"><p>I wish to acknowledge the work of the child care committees.  We all know our own committees best.  The Limerick area committee is the committee I know best.  Deputy Funchion made a point in respect of funding.  She said only 4% of the total funding goes towards the child care committees.  In that regard, the committees do a great job.  We should acknowledge that.</p> <p>  I am keen to follow on with some questions that relate to the points Deputy Funchion has raised.  The first point relates to the transition from dependence on community employment.  This was referenced by Ms McCarthy in her contribution.  This has been raised with all of us in respect of community child care facilities in particular.  Reference was made to 47 services receiving funding and to how the committees are working with others to receive the funding under strand B.  Can the deputation elaborate on that as well as in respect of whether the committees are succeeding?  This is an issue for community services in particular.</p> <p>  My next question relates to community services.  I know Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has raised issues around the new scheme and how it will affect community services.  We have a delay now.  The committees are probably under pressure when it comes to dealing with the interim arrangements.  Can the deputation comment on that point and how it is affecting services?</p> <p>  Another question relates to the new programme and the whole issue of capacity.  This has been raised with us by service providers.  Obviously, the committees are in contact with parents and service providers on a regular basis.  Will there be a capacity problem when it comes to dealing with extra demand in the new system because of the second free preschool year?</p> <p>  My final question is about the access and inclusion model programme.  How well is it working for parents?  The committees run the programmes.  Approximately 1,000 providers have taken courses.  My question is really around whether parents believe it is working for them, especially in cases of parents of children with special needs.  Were they expecting something similar to what is in the primary schools in terms of one-to-one support?  How is that working for parents?  Are there issues that we need to raise in the context of the ongoing consideration of that scheme?</p></speech>

I want to declare that I was a providers' representative on a city and county child care board.  Therefore, I have a good understanding of how the committees work.  I compliment all the good work done throughout the country.</p> <p>  My questions are somewhat along the lines of everything that has gone before.  I am keen to know what contributions the city and county committees have made to national policy, as opposed to the committees being directed by national policy.  What contributions have the committees made to government?  When I refer to Government, I mean the Department of Finance and the question of private providers and commercial rates.  I am keen to know what contributions the committees have made in respect of the new affordable child care scheme.  It is now universal and it looks after private and community operations.  What recommendations have the committees made to the Department?  The committees represent the main voice for 95% of the people.  What have the committees been hearing?</p> <p>  What do the committees see as the three biggest issues affecting child care providers?</p> <p>  What new policies have the committees implemented?  Previously, myself and another child care provider wrote a policy for Government in respect of accidents and emergencies in 2011 and 2012.  What new policies are the committees bringing along?  Child care is so new in this country.  At the same time the committees are providing policy support.  Is there a standard throughout the country?  Is one city and county child care committee similar to all others?  Are the committees assessed?  Is there a standard baseline in respect of what providers should expect?  Are the committees metered or quality controlled?  What way is it done?  Is the committee in Dublin similar to the committee in Galway and Limerick?  Is there standardisation of the services that the committees provide in order that there is no dip for providers, regardless of where they set up?</p></speech>

They provide an important link between the Department and Government generally as well as a diverse range of services, large and small, urban and rural.</p> <p>  One element of the commentary at the start of the announcement of the affordable child care scheme made the point that this was the form of child care that was the most suitable for many families.  It was the form that best meets their needs.  However, there are only a small number of registered child minders.  Deputy Funchion has regularly raised the issue.  A child-minding advisory service was provided previously by the county and city child care committees.  Should that be re-introduced?  Are there other actions that need to be taken to ensure the number of registered child minders can increase and such that the capacity of that side of child care can be enhanced?  Naturally, it is right and correct that any subsidy towards child care or child minding has regard to regulation and standards.  However, we would like to see as many as possible brought into the system such that they could avail of it.</p> <p>  Another question has been touched on by Deputy O'Sullivan, Deputy Funchion and Deputy Rabbitte.  It relates to the sustainability of the community services.  I have been raising this issue for some time.  The Minister's statements in recent months have been about the sustainability.  Several packages are going to be provided under phase 1 and phase 2.  I understand phase 1.  Ms O'Sullivan, who operates in Cork, will be aware that considerable attention was paid to this.  That first stream of funding has now been received by the services.  However, this is the first time that I have seen phase 2 referred to as a once-off.  I have some concerns about this.  Much of the discussion has referred to the transition from the previous situation.  In my view, the cost base has increased.  I believe the cost base is relevant.  Even a second once-off intervention will not be adequate to ensure the ongoing sustainability of community facilities that, more than likely, are dealing with far more complex needs than many of the private providers.  There is a case for an enhanced subvention for those community facilities, especially where they are operating in disadvantaged areas.</p> <p>  Can the deputation give a general outline of how the second intervention will operate to ensure sustainability and some detail on what it might involve?</p></speech>

I am new to the area of children.  The members of the deputation will forgive me if I ask questions that they have answered 2,000 years ago.</p> <p>  My question relates to the courses workshops and training that the committees are running.  My area of interest is in mental health.  How do the committees measure the success of their work?  Usually in research we measure before and after scenarios.  Have the committees done that?  What measuring technique is used?  When will outcomes be seen?</p></speech>

I watched the presentation on the television monitor in my office.</p> <p>  I wish to declare my interests.  I am a non-executive director of a small not-for-profit child care facility in County Limerick.  My questions follow on from what Deputy Rabbitte has said.  Does the Department take on board suggestions made by the child care committees?  I have consistently raised the issue of how owner-operated rural child care facilities are affected by the changes in training regulation.  Such people must now return to education and undertake training courses even though they have a medical background, strong qualifications and a great amount of experience.  Taking time out to study or retrain and employ more people puts a huge pressure on an owner-operated businesses.  I want people to employ people but often the option is unsustainable in small rural areas.  I would like to hear the thoughts of the delegation on the matter.</p></speech>

We will do our best to answer the questions as succinctly as possible.  Ms O'Sullivan will commence by answering the questions on sustaining the sector in rural and urban areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-03a.29" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Karen O'Sullivan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017050300002#D00400"><p>Sustainability varies and depends on whether a facility is located in a suburb or a rural area and whether the area is disadvantaged or is a very small rural area that has a small number of families.  We support financial and governance sustainability.  Sustainability is dependent on a well-run service.  We are very involved in working with community services through their directors and management.</p> <p>  The reliance on community employment, CE, came from a study conducted by the city and county child care committees, CCCs.  There were murmurs of an over-reliance on CE schemes and people said there was an over-reliance on CE throughout the country.  All the committees reviewed every service in their area to assess that reliance.  The services that were identified were then put forward for in-depth and intensive supports, which included many services in Cork city, some of my services and services located throughout the country.</p> <p>  In terms of providing enough funding to employ staff immediately to replace CE participants, the reason CE staff must be replaced is because they are not qualified and child care staff must now have attained a minimum child care qualification.  Therefore, CE workers could no longer be considered part of the adult-child ratio.  Services were initially given funding to employ staff to replace CE workers directly.  We worked closely with the services to assess how much money they needed to tide them over for the next year, which involved the phase 2 transition funding.  Where things go from there is another matter.  We are still working with the Department.  We are still adding to how the Department considers CE reliance and supports community services.  A sum of &euro;1 million has been identified as enough to cover the cost of transition funding for the year.  We are hopeful we can influence what happens next, particularly in terms of the affordable child care scheme.  The rates for children and families who are more vulnerable and disadvantaged have been adjusted and increased.  We hope the initiative will support the sustainable services that work, in particular with vulnerable families.</p> <p>  Deputy Neville mentioned the sustainability of services with older owners who do not have the requisite qualifications.  The Department introduced a grandfather clause or, more appropriately, a  grandparenting declaration.  It means that people who have been involved in the sector for a long time, who were possibly in the latter part of their career and who could not take the time to pursue a formal qualification are allowed to work in the sector until 2020-2021 without a requirement to take on the qualification.  Their years of skills and experience have been recognised.  The provision was put in place to facilitate anyone who was not in a position to upskill.  I believe I have covered all the sustainability questions.  Please correct me if I have missed any question.</p></speech>

If someone in Castletownbere telephones me to report that he or she has a desperate emergency due to a member of staff calling in sick, County Cork is a large county, and by the time a person has travelled from my office to Castletownbere, the session will have ended.  The necessity to cover great distances makes providing a relief panel quite difficult.  There are agencies and organisations that are working towards providing something akin to a nursing agency model.  I mean a panel of relief staff that can be called upon to fill gaps in a service.  I agree with the Deputy that staffing is a problem because the service provider has a legal obligation to ensure the correct number of staff are available at all times.  There is no easy answer to providing relief staff.</p></speech>

A Deputy mentioned the single affordable child care scheme, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan mentioned community services and Deputy Rabbitte asked whether the CCCs have influenced Government policy.</p> <p>  We indicated at the previous committee meeting we attended that the affordable child care scheme, as then designed, could leave some vulnerable children and families disadvantaged.  Since the postponement, the Minister has announced that the system would not be ready.  Instead of having something that was not going to work, the Department has enhanced what already exists, thus making it easier for everybody to work with it in the interim.  The rate has also been substantially increased, which we anticipate will alleviate many of the sustainability issues for all services.</p> <p>  Sustainability in all its forms is important.  The tools we use to measure financial sustainability are robust and consistent.  It supports the services in assessing the bottom line and identifying ways to make ends meet.  Income helps to alleviate costs.  The more finance provided by a Government subvention, the lesser the need to ask parents for a contribution.  We envisage that the enhanced community child care subvention that has replaced the affordable child care payment this year will provide relief to the sector, in particular community services.</p></speech>

We evaluate our training on an ongoing basis.  We must start with the teams that have undertaken early childhood environment rating skills, ECERS, and infant toddler environment rating skills, ITERS, training, which are recognised evaluation tools.  Mentor support also forms part of the training.  We take a baseline measure of quite a number of areas through ECERS, which is for older children, and ITERS, which is for infants, and we measure it again at intervals.</p> <p>  In terms of AIM, Deputy O'Sullivan asked about parents.  There has been a change in mindset.  The national schools are taking the same path.  The school is assigned a support worker and the principal then decides which children would benefit most from their allocation.</p><p>We are delivering a number of workshops around the country whereby we target parents' groups with which we are familiar in order to give them more information about the schemes.  We are not even at the end of year one with the new model.  We provide information on access to supports and making an application.  The length of time for decisions in early November and December was unduly long but we have really caught up now and decisions are being made quite quickly.  The difficulty is getting information to people.  We had a meeting with parents last Thursday night who have children starting in September.  We are using a process with them whereby they can make their AIM applications at the moment although they still cannot register for the ECCE programme.  At least we are getting the ball rolling and hopefully that will make the waiting time for decisions shorter and allow supports to be put in place for the services as well and make the budgets available to them immediately in order that provision can be made for staff resources.  It is a change of thinking and we make sure we give that message.  Currently, we have regional co-ordinators available to us.  The teams come with us when we do presentations and we try to answer all of the questions or find the answers if we do not have the information to make sure parents have an understanding of the model.  We have not had much negativity.</p></speech>

Was it not a sellotape effect when we accepted CE workers at that time and that an issue arose then with sustainability and the issue still exists?

Ms Karen O'Sullivan said some of the funding was in order to replace CE workers with qualified child care workers.  Many of the CE workers love working in child care and would love to upskill and become child care workers.

Deputy Rabbitte asked if linking CE schemes and community child care was akin to putting on sellotape.  I suppose one must put things into the cultural context at the time.  Community employment schemes provided placements for people in order for them to get a genuine employment experience, whatever that was, such as building walls or being a caretaker.  It was not exclusive to child care.  We have certain pockets of the country where CE schemes were more prevalent than others and the way they were implemented is not the same everywhere.  In some places CE participants were never included in the adult to child ratios in early years services whereas in other areas they were.  What we discovered is that although there were high numbers of CE workers in lots of services they were not always required to meet the ratios.  They were there in a support fashion and that is still the case but they still have gainful participation in the community child care setting.</p> <p>  The Department of Social Protection specifically changed the scheme for child care just over three years ago to create a three-year scheme which allows CE workers to advance their career.  I am not sure whether it was Senator Devine or Senator Freeman who expressed concern in that regard.  Participants have two years to get their child care qualification and a further year to enhance their employability by getting a full year's placement within a child care service.  The first three-year scheme is complete and now there should be some roll-over whereby there are some fully qualified CE participants in a worthwhile placement in a child care setting meeting the requirements while others are in training.  That is the way it is at the moment.  I do not think it was a case of sellotape but providing placements for CE participants.</p></speech>

If one is in or around the suburbs of Cork one is paying much higher rates and higher rents than someone in a rural area.  Baseline costs and their variability have an impact.</p> <p>  The second is reliance on funding schemes.  We have to be honest.  The funding schemes are keeping everyone open.  One has to adapt one's model to suit the funding.  The third issue is the rapid pace of change.  Sometimes I think our providers would just like us to stop, take a breath, review and then move forward.  We, as child care committees, would welcome that opportunity as well.</p></speech>

There is an eligible qualification list available through the Department and people have the opportunity to apply there to have a qualification recognised.  These are not all child care related.

There is an opportunity for a person to look for recognition from the Department to get a qualification added to that list to make the person eligible under the regulations on qualifications.</p> <p>  Not all of the qualifications are there.

They would not need a child care related qualification.  If it was a nursing qualification or sign language, whatever the qualification, there is a small tweak in the legislation to allow that they are not required to have a child care qualification.  It allows more applicants, particularly the special needs assistants who would have been the primary person who would have supported children in services up until now and would not have a specific early years only qualification.</p></speech>

It is looking at comparable jurisdictions, such as Wales and Scotland, and the North, and how they have gone about registering childminders.  There is a working group, including Childminding Ireland and other organisations, which is looking at that.  As the Deputy mentioned, we are looking for registered childminders for Government funding to go into but we recognise that the registration and the regulations must be proportionate to a person minding a small number of children in the person's home and that the current regulations on larger child care services are not directly applicable.  The group is looking at how we can manage that process to suit everyone to allow persons to choose registered regulated childminders but to allow childminders to continue the valuable work that they do in their own homes.</p> <p>  We were asked about asylum seekers and refugees by Senator Devine.  The child care committees have been very involved.  Certainly, with the recent resettlement of Syrian refugees, we negotiated with the DCYA to ensure that there was funding made available for the provision of child care for young children coming in so that their parents could access English language classes.  We have worked closely with the Department to try to ensure that the refugees coming in to be resettled are supported in every way and that the children are supported with their integration, including bringing the younger children who would be at school-age level to after-school, camps, etc.  We have been working with the Department of Justice and Equality and other agencies on that.</p> <p>  With the asylum seekers and those in reception centres, we ensure that either there is child care provision on site or the children have access to the ECCE services, that is, the free preschool year, when they are qualified off-site as far as possible.  There are several specific child care funding programmes for refugee resettlement children.  Also, we now have a new one for transitional funding for children who are experiencing homelessness.  We have a new funding scheme specifically so that those children can get the opportunity to be out of bed and breakfast accommodation or hotels and having a better experience during the day, and also giving the parents the time to do what they need to do.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleagues Mary Dunnion, director of regulation and chief inspector of social services; and Finbarr Colfer, deputy chief inspector of social services.</p>  <p>  We were invited to the committee to discuss the regulation of services for adults and children with disabilities.  HIQA commenced the regulation of this sector in 2013 and has since carried out thousands of inspections and spoken to tens of thousands of residents, patients and staff.  The knowledge and experience gathered through this work means we are well placed to offer some insights into the systemic issues facing our health and social care services.</p>  <p>  The Health Act 2007, which established HIQA, sets out the definition of a &lsquo;designated centre&rsquo; and provides the basis for the regulation of such centres.  The Health Act also established the distinct role of the Office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services, which has a statutory responsibility for monitoring and inspecting designated centres against the national regulations and standards.  The post holder is employed by HIQA but is directly accountable to the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  The chief inspector is responsible for the registration of designated centres for people with disabilities.  Services are only allowed to operate if they are registered by HIQA.  Registration includes inspection activity whereby the standard of care in a service and the levels of compliance with the national regulations are assessed.  This process entails speaking to residents and staff, observing care practices and evaluating the fitness of the service provider to deliver the service. </p>  <p>  As I mentioned earlier, HIQA commenced regulation of designated centres for people with disabilities in 2013 with a view to all services being registered by 2016.  It soon became clear to us that a significant number of disability services were not sufficiently prepared for the introduction of regulation.  It was apparent that not all services would achieve registration by 2016 and thus by order of the Minister for Health the deadline was extended to 2018. </p>  <p>  At present, there are just over 1,100 designated centres for people with disabilities providing approximately 9,000 beds.  Some 26% of these designated centres remain to be registered, 209 of which are governed and provided by non-statutory providers, while 71 centres are run by the HSE.</p> <p>There are various reasons certain designated centres for people with disabilities fail to achieve the required level of compliance to allow for them to be registered.  These include inadequate safeguarding measures, poor governance arrangements, institutionalised and outdated staff practices, inappropriate placement of people and poor physical infrastructure and living environments. </p> <p> Some of these issues can be resolved by ensuring that the registered provider and managerial staff are competent, by reorganising and or enhancing current resources and by safely transitioning residents from congregated or institutional-style settings.  In fact, our inspectors have witnessed substantial improvements in the quality of people&rsquo;s lives once good management and oversight arrangements have been put in place and when residents have moved into the community.  However, the recurring issues of poor governance, inadequate safeguarding measures and institutional staff practices are more difficult to overcome and require courage, strong leadership and a commitment to changing the culture of an organisation. </p> <p> Notwithstanding these challenges, there is much good work being done.  We have seen a gradual improvement over the past few years and most providers have a positive attitude to regulation.  As is the experience in nursing homes, I would expect that good providers of disability services will now seek to move beyond basic compliance with the regulations and improve their services to meet the national standards as mandated by the Minister of Health in 2013. </p> <p> HIQA&rsquo;s overview report on the regulation of social care and health care services in 2016, published yesterday, highlights ongoing challenges faced in these sectors but also emphasises that many people are receiving a good quality of service.  This is reflected in the positive feedback we receive on inspection, in our own inspection reports and in the move towards increased compliance in certain areas.  Without a doubt, regulation has improved the lives of people with disabilities living under the care of the State.  Deirdre Carroll, former chief executive of Inclusion Ireland, recently pointed out that while some people criticise HIQA&rsquo;s inspections of residential centres, they have been one of the most important contributors to improvements in services.</p> <p> In terms of safeguarding, it is quite apparent that some services must take this issue more seriously, particularly by ensuring that Garda vetting is in place for all staff and volunteers.  Legislation introduced in 2016 strengthened the requirements for service providers to ensure that their staff members are appropriately vetted.  Some services, however, are neglecting to do so and are thereby failing in their legal responsibility to safeguard residents. </p> <p> HIQA frequently reflects on how we as the State&rsquo;s health and social care regulator can ensure that services are safer and better for all.  Regulation of services provides a level of protection by the obliging of providers to maintain compliance with regulations and standards and through the use of periodic inspection.  However, we believe the area of safeguarding needs to be further strengthened through the introduction of legislation.  This would enshrine adult safeguarding in law and acknowledge the State&rsquo;s responsibility to protect those who may be at risk.  HIQA strongly supports the Adult Safeguarding Bill that was introduced to the Seanad last month. </p> <p> In terms of accountability, while providers are ultimately accountable for the quality of the service they provide, funders of services also bear responsibility and must ensure that public funds are spent to the benefit of the people in receipt of care services.  The State distributes large sums of money to various organisations in exchange for the provision of services.  However, there is often insufficient oversight of how this money is used or the outcomes it achieves.  The introduction of an oversight regime in Ireland has the potential to deliver a range of benefits, including better experiences for those using services, improved service planning, greater accountability, better value for money and greater efficiency.  HIQA is working collaboratively with the HSE to develop such a framework. </p> <p> Government policy has directed regulation of services into areas where vulnerable people are in receipt of health and social care services.  These include residential services for children, older people and people with a disability.  These people are in the care of the State because they are deemed at risk of harm or abuse.  During the course of our work, we continue to identify other service types where we believe similar vulnerabilities exist.  We cannot ignore the fact that there are many people in Irish society, such as the homeless, prisoners, migrants or asylum seekers in direct provision who have an entitlement to safe care and to be protected from abuse.  HIQA does not yet have a legal mandate to engage in these services, yet we firmly believe that all vulnerable people in our society have a right to access high-quality and safe health and social care services.  The continued absence of assurance in respect of the rights and needs of these vulnerable groups has the potential to create new hidden populations in our country. </p> <p> I now wish to take this opportunity to talk to the committee about some of our thinking on the future direction of regulation in social care.  To be effective, regulation must respond to people&rsquo;s needs.  It must also adapt to changing circumstances or risk becoming defunct and meaningless.  HIQA constantly seeks to improve regulatory practice and explores how care could potentially be regulated into the future.  As such, we recently developed a series of discussion papers exploring the regulation of health and social care services.  The paper on disability services, which was shared with the committee in advance of today&rsquo;s meeting, considers the current care and support models for people with disabilities and looks at future potential models of regulation.   The paper looks at the current legal definition of a designated centre for people with disabilities in Ireland, as set out in the Health Act.  As I stated earlier, this definition relates to the physical location where care and support is provided.  It is also based on a model that delivers care and accommodation, primarily in a long-term residential setting. </p> <p> Increasingly, HIQA inspectors are finding that some emerging models of care, particularly in respect of people with disabilities, do not fall under the definition of a designated centre and are therefore unregulated.  One example of this is where people are moved out of a congregated setting to services that have no regulatory oversight.  Other examples include home care, sheltered housing, assisted living, convalescence or step-down care and personal assistants.  Again, as these services do not come under the definition of a designated centre, they are not subject to regulation.  It is important to note that service users in these unregulated sectors may be just as vulnerable as those being cared for in designated centres.  They have the same right to high-quality care and as such, there is a need to review and expand regulation to have oversight and provide public assurance on the different models of care and service delivery. </p> <p> Ireland is behind the curve internationally and must evaluate the current approach to regulation in order to protect and promote the rights of all people assessing health and social care services.  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 must be passed to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Similarly, resources must be made available to allow for the full commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which will strengthen the rights of vulnerable people to live lives free from abuse. </p> <p> Today I have provided an overview of designated centres for people with disabilities and have outlined some of the challenges facing the sector.  The experience in residential services for people with disabilities is somewhat mixed.  While many are receiving a good service and enjoying a good standard of living, a significant number of people are experiencing a quality of life that is well below that which would be expected in modern Ireland.  In some cases HIQA has assessed the care being provided as unsafe. </p> <p> In addition, we need to think about how care for people with disabilities could potentially be regulated in the future.  New models of nursing and social care are evolving that are currently not subject to independent regulatory oversight.  We must consider what services should be regulated to ensure that the rights of vulnerable people are respected and that they are provided with care that is safe and of the highest quality.  This discussion should form part of a broader discussion on how we, as a nation, plan and deliver services to meet the needs of the population. </p> <p> I thank the committee for inviting us here this afternoon.  We are happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

What is HIQA's response to the concerns many people have about the policy of decongregating?</p> <p>All members of the committee have received anguished correspondence from relatives of people who are being moved out of residential care.  Many of those who are being moved seem to be very happy where they are and their families are very worried that their relatives may not be able to cope with another situation.  They are also concerned about the upheaval involved in the move and that people might find it traumatic and detrimental to their well-being.  Many of these individuals have been in residential care for a very long time and some of their family members think they may not be able to cope.  We must remember that this has been their home for a very long time.  Do the HIQA representatives believe that it might be legitimate for somebody to object to a move from a regulated, congregated setting to another so-called decongregated setting that is not regulated?</p> <p> Of the 1,100 designated centres for people with disabilities, how many have been inspected?  How many have been inspected more than once, with return visits when things have been discovered to be not in compliance? Are there many centres that have not improved on HIQA's second visit?  Mr. Quinn said that services are failing to ensure that staff are appropriately vetted.  Perhaps the witnesses will provide a percentage.  Is it 1% or 10%?  Will they give a rough estimate please?</p> <p> On the issue of an oversight regime for those who spend public money, will HIQA tell the committee what countries are role models in this regard? When is the work on a framework with the HSE expected to be completed?</p></speech>

I have one or two questions.  The witness spoke of the 1,100 designated centres.  I know that he has given a breakdown of the centres that remain to be registered as 26%.  Of the 1,100, is there a breakdown of the number of centres that are not under the management of the HSE and those operated by various voluntary organisations?  It would be interesting to see that figure.  Mr. Quinn has said that 71 centres that are run by the HSE are not registered.  I presume that HIQA has had communications with the HSE and that there is some kind of deadline in place regarding those centres.  Will Mr. Quinn also provide an outline of the timeline regarding the 209 centres that are governed by the non-statutory providers.</p>  <p>  The second issue I want to raise is a problem I have come up across very recently with a number of people, especially in the Cork area.  I received a detailed reply from the Minister about it.  I refer to the situation where respite care is not available when a person reaches the age of 18 .  One of the reasons given is that facilities that were providing respite care for people over the age of 18 were no longer available as a result of standards not being met in HIQA inspections.  When HIQA identified a problem with a facility, it appears that, rather than dealing with it, the service was withdrawn.  I am not too sure which centres we are talking about, but this is the argument now given as to why respite care is not available.  I have come across situations where parents had the benefit of the respite care for their children up to the age of 18 and then suddenly that care was no longer available.  The argument provided by the Department and the HSE was that some facilities did not meet HIQA standards.  When facilities do not meet standards, what timescale is provided in order to allow them to reach those standards?  Is it three, six or 12 months?  Do we need to take into account that if they do not make the standards, there is a risk that the service will be withdrawn completely?</p>  <p>  My third point is also on the issue of providing facilities for people with disabilities.  There is a huge number of people who attend day care and whose parents are aging.  I am very concerned about this and I raised it at an earlier meeting.  There is a big concern that adequate facilities will not be available for these people when their parents are no longer able to look after them.  Has an analysis been done in this regard?  I may be wrong on the figures but it is my understanding that there are 18,000 people currently being cared for by their parents in the home.  Many of these people attend day facilities, some do not.  We are talking about 18,000 people.  Have we any kind of idea, or is there any discussion between HIQA and the HSE, about long-term planning in that whole area?  A huge number of those people will require some kind of residential care, be it respite care or long-term residential care, and I wonder where we stand in that regard.</p></speech>

I will then pass over to my colleague, Ms Dunnion, who is the chief inspector of social services.  We would have daily contact with a number of the issues raised by the members.</p>  <p>  There are two elements that could be banded together.  One relates to the individual and population needs assessment, and for future planning for people as they age - as Senator Colm Burke discussed - and as individuals require a different service profile.  This also comes into the accountability framework.  We perceive that the whole area of needs assessment, planning for services, holding services to account, providing money for services and assessing value for money in the delivery of services falls under a form of commissioning model.  I appreciate that commissioning, as it is seen in other jurisdictions, is sometimes perceived very much as a money-saving exercise.  There is a clear emphasis on issues such as the expense of services and how they are purchased.  HIQA, however, wants to see a model based around individual need and population need.  The sort of work that we are beginning to engage in with the HSE revolves around the various populations and service types, but this has not yet been absolutely tied down.  One of the groups we are looking at under an accountability framework with the HSE is that which relates to disability services.  There is potential to explore, within those discussions with the HSE, what future planning and future service configuration would look like.  As well as the provision of long-term residential care, this would also include other models of care that can be provided in a safe, effective and high-quality way.  As the HSE is the national procurer of services, it would want to ensure that it is getting value for money within any service or model of delivery.</p>  <p>  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony asked about other countries.  There are a number of models across Europe.  We have invited a former Government Minister from the Basque country, Rafael Bengoa, as a guest lecturer next week.  He will talk about this sort of accountability framework in the context of vertical integrated care.  In some ways, HIQA is continually trying to look into international circumstances to see how those models would best fit into the Irish context.</p>  <p>  I will now hand over to my colleague, Ms Mary Dunnion, who can answer some of the other questions that were raised.</p></speech>

I will cover some of the points raised and will share answers with my colleague, Mr. Finbarr Colfer.</p>  <p>  I shall begin on the policy of decongregation.  I totally accept that families can be very concerned about it.  I also accept that, in the context of inspecting centres, that these facilities have been home to the people involved for 20, 30 or 40 years.</p> <p>On the other side, however, we have seen the huge benefits of people transitioning into community services and residents there have told us how much better those services are for them.  We support the national policy of transferring people from congregated settings to community settings but we think there is now an opportunity.  While decongregation is happening, and it is very positive, it has had some unintended consequences.  For example, an elderly person may not be suited to a move to a community.  It just might not be the right setting for them.  In addition, as Mr. Quinn said, some of these services are unregulated, which is a concern to residents.  In this context, we have prepared the discussion paper, which poses the question as to whether the type of model of regulation is the right one for the future.  We firmly believe that the policy of regulation should be aligned to social and health care policy, which is not how it is currently structured in the Health Act.  To answer Deputy Murphy O'Mahony's question, we believe decongregation is a positive.  However, we feel it has some unintended consequences, particularly for very vulnerable people.  We propose in our paper that a different model needs to be considered, which looks at different service types for people such as day care services, ambulatory care and residential services.  Furthermore, some people in disability services may require nursing home services.  There are many different models that need to be considered and now is the time to do so.  The policy of decongregation has probably highlighted these issues.</p> <p> The issue of Garda vetting took us by surprise when we made discoveries in that regard because it was beyond our understanding as to why one would employ someone who did not have Garda vetting.  As the committee will be aware, provisions in this regard were enacted in legislation in April 2016.  It is not possible for me to quantify the numbers because we found areas on inspection where Garda vetting had not been done.  I can happily report now that there has been a sea change in this regard.  This happened in 2016 but it is seen in 2017 that people are now making sure that Garda vetting is in place.  I assure the committee that when we come across instances of Garda vetting not being in place, we ensure that the staff member is not on the roster to look after vulnerable people until the Garda vetting is in place.</p> <p> The chief executive officer has talked about the accountability framework.  This is very important in the context of services and our job in HIQA is to work to see the quality and safety of services are there.  We are only one player in this regard; the chief groups responsible are those that deliver the services.  However, I believe as regulators we have a very important part to play in the quality and safety of services.  One of the aspects we have seen - we mention it in our paper and have brought it to the attention of other committees - is that where someone purchases a service, be it the HSE or any other body, there should be an arrangement in the contract which ensures that the service being delivered is of a high quality and there should be checks and balances to make sure that is happening.  I strongly feel that if those arrangements were in place, we would not be finding some of the issues we are now finding because they are not being monitored.  Therefore, we very much welcome the early work the HSE has begun on commissioning, which I see as accountability.  I know "commissioning" is sometimes not the greatest descriptor but it is accountability.  We in HIQA are very pleased to become involved in that, particularly in service delivery, where public funds are being paid for the care of very vulnerable people.</p> <p> I will hand over to my colleague to discuss respite care and day care services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-03a.92" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Finbarr Colfer" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017050300007#H00200"><p>I thank members for their questions.  One question concerned the number of centres we have inspected to date.  Since commencement in November 2013, we have undertaken 2,551 inspections.  As of April last year, we had inspected every service and every designated centre, so all centres have had an inspection.  The purpose of the inspection is to examine the quality of the service being provided, what it is like for the people who live in those centres to live there and how the governance arrangements for those centres are effecting a good service for people living there.</p>  <p>  Regarding the respite service, there is a variety of different respite formats or types of service in existence, including dedicated respite services, dedicated children's respite and dedicated adult respite.  Some services alternate their service between children and adults but there is not a consistency across the country in how those services are delivered.  I think what Senator Colm Burke was referring to is the fact that there are difficulties surrounding places where there is a resident in a service for most of the week and when a resident is absent, somebody else avails of respite.  One difficulty that has come up for us in that regard is that when we talk to residents themselves, when we observe what is happening in those kinds of centres, some of the issues that have come up have concerned the people visiting the centre for short periods.  They are in the other person's personal space and there are inadequate measures in many cases regarding the personal property of the people normally resident in the centre.  Residents themselves have described situations in which their personal items have been damaged, family photographs have been torn up and other visiting residents have used their personal property.  For us, this is not an issue for the person coming to visit the centre, but rather an issue of how that service is managed and how the provider is ensuring that the dignity and privacy of the resident who is there normally are maintained.  Residents have mentioned other issues to us.  On one inspection, I was told by a resident that when they returned from a holiday away, their mattress smelled very foul even though they had clean sheets on it.  There are issues surrounding the sharing of rooms and people entering rooms.  If these issues are not being managed correctly, we require providers either to put measures in place to manage them correctly or to consider whether it is an appropriate way of using the person's room.</p>  <p>  One question Senator Burke asked concerned how providers are facilitated to address these issues.  When we find non-compliance, we identify it very clearly to the provider, usually on the inspection, and follow up with a report afterwards in writing.  The provider is offered an opportunity to correct anything we may have got wrong at that point.  Where that is an issue, the provider then considers what measures need to be taken and we ask the provider to come back to us and tell us what they will do to take care of both residents and the timeframe within which they will do so.  If the situation is critical and risk is involved, we will be more assertive in requesting timeframes.  However, if it is not a situation of risk, we ask the providers to tell us what they intend to do and we will then go out afterwards and verify whether that has been effective in dealing with the issues.  In many cases, the actions taken by providers are effective but sometimes providers choose to cease the arrangement because they are not satisfied themselves that they can address the issues that are arising from that respite service.</p>  <p>  We are very conscious that many people are availing of day care services which are unregulated but also that people have future needs.  As our CEO mentioned earlier, our focus is on inspection, whether assessments have been conducted of people's future needs and whether there is planning in place in that regard.  Regarding actual delivery on those, we ask the providers how they are engaging with the HSE to secure the future planning for people.  At present, however, our inspectors do not have any authority to assess or examine day care services or the needs of people within those services because they fall out of the scheme of regulation.</p></speech>

The relevant numbers are 71 by the HSE and 209 by the voluntary sector.  As I said in the opening statement, we have brought in an extension to the registration period until October 2018.  Specifically, the deadline for registration of any service is October 2018.  However, we are keen to see progress towards registration well in advance of that date in order that we are not approaching an impending crisis at the last minute.  Through the whole programme or policy of moving people into community or integrated community-based settings, the idea is that we would anticipate a continued rise in the number of designated centres as larger institutions become depopulated.  Over the course of the next 18 months, the numbers will not only be 71 and 209.  We expect fresh registration of new services as well.</p></speech>

Mr. Quinn referred to the knowledge and experience gained through the work and how it meant that HIQA was well placed to offer some insights into the systemic issues facing our health and social care services.  Will Mr. Quinn elaborate on that?</p>  <p>  I suggest there is a strong emphasis in the work that HIQA does on the care of people.  Care is a core component of people being able to lead a decent life, but it is not the beginning and end of their lives, nor should it be.  That is a pointer or hint in terms of what I am suggesting.</p>  <p>  Mr. Quinn referred to how HIQA commenced the regulation of the designation of centres in 2013 with a view to all services being registered by 2016.  Then he referred to how it soon became clear to HIQA that a significant number were not and so on.  Where was the decision made that it could be done by 2016?  Who made that decision?</p>  <p>  Mr. Quinn referred to issues of poor governance, inadequate safeguarding measures, institutional staff practices having to be overcome and the need for courage, strong leadership and a commitment to changing the culture of an organisation.  What things might be needed to shift the culture, given some of the points raised about institutional staff practices etc.?</p>  <p>  We heard some input from Mr. Colfer about what I would describe as a hot bed system.  Someone has a space and someone else is lodging there at times.  I have no other way of describing it.  I want to take that as an example and relate it to the issue of poor governance.  How do I do that?  I will refer to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  One of the articles refers in plain English to the right to a home of one's own and to choose with whom one lives.  The convention does not go so far as to say that a person can choose who is in bed with him or her or who is in the bed when the person in question is not in the bed.  The HIQA representatives know where I am going with this.  To what extent does the spirit of the convention inform or become part of the narrative for HIQA in discussions with the service provider?</p>  <p>  The HIQA opening statement went on to refer to the importance of the overview report published yesterday.  Reference was made to how it highlights ongoing challenges faced in these sectors.  The opening statement also emphasised that many people are receiving a good quality of service.  The good quality of service relates to their care to a great extent.  However, does the service lead to their having something of a dignified life?  To what extent does the whole residential package make it difficult for someone to break out and get into life in some way or other?</p>  <p>  I note the issue of respite for those over 18 years of age.  I note several other points that have recently come to us in this State as evidence.  In the past year or so we know that approximately 1,100 people under the age of 65 years are in nursing homes.  HIQA representatives go into nursing homes wearing a different hat.  What is the HIQA view of encountering people there who have disabilities and are under the age of 65 years?  I put it to the HIQA deputation that if there had been a decent battery of services for these people when they were living in the community, the great majority of them would not now be in nursing homes.  The members of the HIQA deputation know better than I do that many nursing homes are in sylvan settings rather than where someone can go out onto the high street.</p>  <p>  The CSO has told us that poverty rates for disabled people have been shooting up in recent years.  Thankfully, they are getting better for the general population.  The recent social housing report shows that the figure has gone from fewer than 4,000 people on the social housing waiting list four years ago to a figure shy of 6,000 now.  The recent report from the ESRI on employment is relevant as well.  These are strong indicators suggesting that things are very wrong in the community.</p>  <p>  It is like the fair deal scheme.  If there is a statutory provision in one place, it has a tendency to suck resources and drive a bias one way rather than another.  I know people and others know of people who had a fair deal application form shoved under their noses.  These were young people with families.  This happened because it could be resourced.  However, what they really needed was to stay with their families, but that was not resourced.</p>  <p>  The HIQA deputation referred to how continued absence of assurance in respect of the rights and needs of vulnerable groups had the potential to create new hidden populations in our country.  I am keen to pick under that, as it were.</p>  <p>  I will finish with one final point, since I am offending the tolerance of the Chairman.  A member of the HIQA deputation referred to value for money.  What are the three or four key areas of a service that HIQA has to examine to determine whether it is value for money, apart from the obvious cheap and cheerful areas?  What else makes up value for money when organisations are providing a public service?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-03a.99" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017050300008#J00700"><p>I thank our guests for attending the committee meeting and for their dissertation.</p>  <p>  Several points are emerging.  The first is the question of de-congregation.  I have deep suspicions about decongregation.  I have had the same suspicions since the first time I heard the message, because I saw things happening then.  Things were conveniently available on the basis that decongregation was an issue in the background.</p> <p>For example, I can see it in St. Raphael's special school in Celbridge where there was a proposal to decongregate and create a town centre on the location.  The more important, appropriate, sensitive and urgent issue was how to cater for the children and young adults with special needs who were dependent on the facilities which were there for many years.</p> <p> I was a member of the Eastern Health Board when decongregation took place in the mental health services and the major mental hospitals.  We were reassured at the time that everything would be all right on the night.  It did not happen that way.  We see the legacy of that practice to this day.  I strongly urge very careful consideration before going too far down that route.  Where the congregation was concentrated, there was a tendency to ensure that a well-equipped, competent staff was available at all times.  By virtue of the multiplicity of people involved in the provision of the care, there was a greater tendency to achieve higher standards.  When the number of people associated with the patient, the child or the resident is reduced, the danger will always be that standards may shift dramatically over a short period.  It is not always the case but, human nature being what it is, that is the tendency.  That has been proven repeatedly in institutions here, in the UK, across Europe and in other countries.  I register my concern in that regard.</p> <p> I am also concerned for the family members of people with disabilities because they are scared at the moment.  The word "decongregation" scares the hell out of them.  In many cases, if there are two family members available to cater for the person with the disability or special needs, it is not too bad.  If there is only one carer, the burden is wholly on them.  If that person happens to be the mother, daughter, aunt or whoever, that person may find himself or herself confined to that situation for most of his or her life.  If a woman of 20 takes over care of a child, young adult or whoever, by the age of 40 that woman will have spent half of her life in that business.  It can be depressing.  It can create a sense of isolation and despair and does so in many situations.  All the relevant authorities should concentrate on that.</p> <p> While men are also affected, women are significantly affected in the sense that they may have had a career of their own which they may have wanted to pursue.  The possibility of them getting any assistance towards accommodation, day services or residential care for the dependant during the week while spending weekends at home is very important.  The carers do not mind that because it is the respite they look forward to.  It is the break in the tedium and the monotony of the burden that has been placed upon them.  We do not fully appreciate the extent to which those carers have been committed by forces outside their control to continuing to provide the degree and quality of service they do.  They will do it to the death.  It is not fair to them.  Very often, the danger of allowing that situation to drift is that an aversion to their charge can develop in reaction to the situation in which they have found themselves.  That does not happen in most cases but it can happen.  Human nature will enlighten us that it can and that the great dedication and love they have for the relative or other dependant may be strained over time.</p> <p> Others have made the point in regard to when a person is no longer able to care for their relative or provide the quality of services that person has enjoyed.  As everybody in the room is aware, there are women who have spent their whole lives lifting a relative in and out of bed, sitting them into a wheelchair, bringing them to day care treatment and then bringing them home for the evening and so on.  The carer ends up a physical wreck by virtue of the degree to which she has been called upon to provide services in the home.  Everyone requires the patient, be they a dependent child with a disability or otherwise, to be in the home and their own environment as much as possible.  However, it does not work well in all situations.  It needs to be carefully looked at as a matter of some urgency.</p> <p> I cannot understand why it would not be possible to get an accelerated form of Garda vetting to ensure those working with vulnerable people are vetted at an earlier stage.  Bureaucracy in this country has gone as far as it can.  Everything is a waiting list.  No matter what one wants to do, there is a waiting list.  That is unnecessary.  Certain things can happen fairly quickly.  Other countries can do it and I cannot understand why it cannot be done here or we do not have the facilities to do it here.  Accelerated Garda vetting would not cost money.  It is just there and can be done.</p> <p> Locating vulnerable people in outreach situations for respite or whatever other reason requires the severest form of vetting.  In the event of there being a complaint, and we have had situations like this, there should only be one complaint before action is taken.  There is no need for any more.  There is no need to refer the unfortunate kids back to the same situation or allow them to be sent back to the same situation ever again.  If somebody felt it necessary to express their concerns about how a person with special needs was treated in a particular environment, the person with special needs should never be sent back to that environment.  We need to do whatever it takes to ensure that is regulated properly.  It only requires a stroke of a pen to do it.  We do not have to have a report or have a big song and dance about it.  It can be done by simply issuing an order.</p></speech>

I agree with him in regard to people who have been placed in vulnerable circumstances or circumstances where they may have been subject to abuse or exploitation.  For that reason, we have sought to have safeguarding legislation put on a statutory footing.  It is at that point that one would have not layers of bureaucracy but rather the power to act.  A safeguarding authority would have the power to act without having to go through multiple layers of bureaucracy.  Admittedly, due process has to be followed, but to achieve the protection of a vulnerable individual or vulnerable individuals within a particular circumstance, safeguarding legislation would allow for that circumstance to be dealt with.</p>  <p>  Senator Dolan asked about the claim in our opening statement that we are well placed to comment on the systemic nature of services.  Over the past four years HIQA has identified a number of critical systemic issues, particularly in the area of residential disability services.  Some of them are listed.  Lack of accountability manifests itself through the regulation and standards framework.  The framework is in place to provide a governance framework for providers of services.  As Ms Dunnion has said, there has to be some form of linked accountability for those funding services on behalf of the State.</p> <p>What are the millions provided by State paying for and how is that being monitored?</p> <p> The other major systemic issue we have identified is safeguarding.  While I fully appreciate the points raised by Deputy Durkan about congregated settings, there have been instances where we have seen institutionalised practices within large congregated settings that have placed at risk people who are citizens of this State.  We need to be sensitive to the way in which people transition from one service to another and we need to allay the fears of their relatives.  We need to work in partnership with their relatives around the transition.</p> <p> The very heart of the Deputy's point is that it is not all about care, and I agree with him.  It is about rights.  It is about people who live in the State having their basic human rights met.  It is for that reason we have endeavoured to engender human rights principles within our inspection workforce, particularly the principles of privacy, dignity, respect, fairness and autonomy.  Once we see the State ratifying the UN Convention on the Rights of People with a Disability, the language of that convention needs to make its way into the interactions we have with service providers and into our reports as well.  It is about more than care, but the current construct of designated centres and the way in which services are provided tend to focus on care when we should be talking about integration of people into the community, equality and their ability to be treated fairly like all other citizens.  That is where we need to transition to.  It is about an assessment of people who may be vulnerable and their being treated as equal citizens.  That is where we would ultimately like to go.  We also need to see the human rights principles not just coming from the regulator but also transcending through service providers as well.</p> <p> I will ask my colleagues Ms Mary Dunnion and Mr. Finbarr Colfer to answer some of the other questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-03a.104" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Dunnion" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017050300010#L00200"><p>I thank the members.  I will share the questions with Mr. Colfer.</p>  <p>  Garda vetting only takes two weeks now, so the system has improved since the Garda vetting bureau was commenced.  It would have been quite a long process before these efficiencies were put in place.  That is the reason it was of grave concern to us that providers of services were not availing of Garda vetting in certain centres and, more worryingly, did not see the importance aligned to Garda vetting in the context of looking after vulnerable people.</p>  <p>  In response to Senator Dolan, the registration cycle is determined by the Health Act which sets out the registration cycle.  It requires a ministerial instrument to change that to five years for disability services.  Once we achieve the five years in 2018, we revert to three years again because that is what the Health Act determines.</p>  <p>  In the discussion paper we have presented, we make the proposal that the registration cycle should be eliminated.  It does not mean that we do not inspect to ensure standards are being met, but we do not see the three year cycle as a cost benefit.  It is an expensive process.  We do not see that it is required and we believe there are different regulatory approaches that can be taken that would drive improvement much more efficiently than renewing registration as an inspection process.  That is determined by the Health Act.  It is not in the control of HIQA.  Our proposal would be that the system would be looked at.</p>  <p>  On the issue of institutionalised practices, it would be foolish for me even to suggest that it is an easy thing to address.  The institutionalised practices are by those delivering the service and by those living in the service.  We have seen centres where it has been addressed.  The two key catalysts for change were that it was led by example in that the person in charge did not accept and did not concur with that type of practice, and that the person in charge had the courage to address poor behaviour in staff.  While the two examples sound simple, I would not underestimate what it takes, and we would have the evidence in our inspections to support leading by example, good management, good governance, taking ownership of being in charge and the accountability that is assigned to it, showing what behaviours are not acceptable, and over time bringing about change.  I am confident that we would have very good examples of centres that have reached compliance, where the staff have taken the ball and gone with it and changed the system for very vulnerable people.  It was a good example of how regulation contributed to that change.</p>  <p>  We regulate more than 600 nursing homes.  I agree there is a model of care in nursing homes which is determined by the regulations which are set out by Government and we measure compliance against that standard.  It is a very limiting model.  I do not think it will be able to respond to the cares of ageing people with disabilities who will need more medical and nursing care than social care services.  Members will be worn out from me talking about the HIQA paper, but I believe there is an opportunity to look at the model of regulation that Ireland is offering now.  I do not believe the regulation of a facility and care within a building is a model that is in keeping with social direction and care policy.</p>  <p>  We would hope that this paper would become a discussion document to begin to work towards.  Regulation as a model is not suited to the emerging needs or indeed national policy of people being maintained at home and staying in their own home and being cared for by family and other carers.  There is an opportunity to look at that.  It will require a change in primary legislation and we hope that this would be considered by the Oireachtas in its consideration of the future of health care.</p>  <p>  I can only agree with the points made by Deputy Durkan.  We would concur completely.  It is a very difficult situation and it is a major challenge for people emotionally, financially and socially to look after their family and carers at home.</p>  <p>  The reason we think the overview report is important is that it gives a lens of health care, older person's disability and children's disability.  While our lens does not cover all services, it shows there is an opportunity to integrate these services more.  We can see the integration is not there and there are opportunities for it.  That is why I believe it is a good lens, although we accept we are not looking at everything, just the areas that we have mentioned.  I could not but agree with Deputy Durkan and I hope that, in future, health and social policy will begin to reflect the concerns he identified.  HIQA personnel would be more than delighted to be part of that direction because it is essential.</p>  <p>  I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Finbarr Colfer, on the issue from the viewpoint of human rights and how, from an assessment approach, we look at them currently, accepting that legislative changes are required.</p></speech>

It certainly rang true and it has been part of the discussions I have been engaged in of late, that is, looking at whether focusing on residential services stymies a person's opportunity to develop a full life.  The provider community recognises that increasingly and we are certainly having discussions with providers who are coming up with quite innovative approaches and proposals to meet the needs of people as opposed to placing them in the traditional residential service.  The concerns are about the current requirements around regulation.  Some providers are very cautious about having services outside of regulation because they are concerned that people will not have the protection of regulation.  Some of the innovative services are being developed as residential services.  Other providers are anxious because they are worried they are moving people out of the regulatory process and the protections that affords people.</p> <p>That goes back to the paper we submitted, looking at services as opposed to buildings, and what is happening within buildings.  I am sure the providers will be able to talk further about that themselves when they appear before the committee.</p> <p> As regards Deputy Durkan's comments, having engaged with families both prior to and in my current role, I completely understand the point about family anxieties arising from moving people from congregated settings.  There is a concern that people will no longer receive adequate care and support and will not have access if they move into a smaller setting.  There is a challenge to services, as they are provided in the community, to ensure that arrangements are in place for people to receive services based on their assessed needs.</p> <p> While I acknowledge the concerns of families and those who are moving out of those services, the other aspect is that in the vast majority of congregated settings we have inspected we have found startling issues including the safeguarding of residents, their quality of life, and ongoing institutionalised practices that are based on organisational needs as opposed to the needs of people in those services.</p> <p> We have also had to require providers to take immediate measures to keep people safe in historically accepted situations whereby residents cause injury to other residents, which are not responded to appropriately.  Some of the more significant findings we have made in the last three to four years have been in congregated settings.  </p> <p> Our discussions with providers and the HSE have increasingly been about acknowledging the concerns of people who are proposed to be moved to other services, as well as the concerns of families.  That process needs to happen in a managed way that engages with people and involves them in the process.  We have seen good examples of where that has happened, but we have also seen poor examples where that engagement has not been effective and it has caused further anxiety to families.</p> <p> As regards people's rights, Senator Dolan referred to respite and the examples I gave.  Currently our discussions are based on requirements in the regulations and reaching compliance with them.  The provider is required to demonstrate a high level of evidence that it is looking after the needs of people.</p> <p> The Senator is correct to say that it does not assert the rights of people in their own home.  We have discussions with providers on that, but we do not currently have a regulation we can enforce.  However, the introduction of those measures will allow us to ratify the UN convention, along with a review of regulations in that light.  It would certainly be helpful to inspectors in that review of regulations if those rights were to be asserted more clearly in our regulatory requirements.  That is for discussion as we move forward.  Meanwhile, we are focusing on issues like dignity, respect and how the person is supported in that environment to live a good quality of life.</p></speech>

That would be the experience of health regulators even in other jurisdictions.  I agreed with Deputy Durkan that, at times, the nature of the vulnerability changes from the larger institution to a smaller one.  However, it is a question of trying to ensure that the focus is not necessarily always on the care or support, but on the rights of individuals living within those services.</p>  <p>  The current assessment regime is based on current regulations, which sometimes do not always match our desire to ensure that the rights of individuals are being met.  The Deputy is right in that there can be instances where there are non-compliance issues in smaller settings as well. </p>  <p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of carers, which can be forgotten.  In the work we are proposing to do with the HSE in assessment and accountability frameworks, carers' assessment probably needs to be front and centre.  The needs of an individual have to be at the centre of what those assessment and accountability arrangements will provide.  Part of that package, however, has to be about a carer assessment and the ability of a service commissioner to take account of the needs of informal carers.</p></speech>

I came across a case recently where a child reached 18 years of age and the cost of providing two weekends' respite per year came to &euro;154,000, which seemed an extraordinary amount of money for just one client.  Therefore, is there a system of assessing value for money?</p></speech>

There would be no requirement under the current legislative or regulatory framework for us to look at value for money issues.  Primarily, however, in looking at value for money one of the critical issues is whether or not the service being provided is addressing the client or client group's needs.</p>  <p>  We must also look at whether or not the service is achieving the outcomes it was purchased to achieve.  In addition, we must examine the balance of costs and whether or not there is some comparator cost that can be used within that model.</p></speech>

The advocacy side of it, in the Citizens Information Act 2007, has not been triggered.

The National Federation of Voluntary Bodies Providing Services to People with Intellectual Disability welcomes this opportunity to meet with the committee today and wishes to be of assistance to the committee in any way that we can in consideration of this very important matter.  The reason for the invitation is to allow us to respond to recent media reports about organisations that run residential facilities for people with disabilities that are not in compliance with the regulations in accordance with the Health Act 2007.  However, at the outset it is important for me to point out that the member organisations of the federation are incorporated companies limited by guarantee with their own independent boards of directors, chairs, CEOs and management teams and, as such, we are not legally authorised to speak on their behalf.  The specific details of cases and reasons for non-compliance in any instance would not be known to us but any questions the committee has relating to the reports can either be addressed directly to the organisations themselves or I will be happy to address them with the organisations concerned.</p>  <p>  I wish to inform the committee of the actions we as a national federation have taken to promote equality standards in our member organisations.  To provide a little bit of background, our federation is the national umbrella organisation for voluntary agencies that provide in excess of 85% of this country's direct support services to people with intellectual disability and autism.  These support services are provided on a service arrangement basis under sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004 on behalf of the HSE, which has statutory provision for the provision of services, and include the provision of education and training opportunities, therapeutic supports and residential, respite and day services.</p>  <p>  Our mission is to provide the leadership and support that will enable voluntary organisations to adapt to a radically changing operating environment with the ultimate aim of ensuring that the people whom our member organisations support benefit from best quality service according to their needs.  In pursuing our mission we adopt the guiding principles that people with an intellectual disability have the right to be supported, to live a life of their choosing and to be included in all decisions that affect their lives.</p>  <p>  Considerable work has been undertaken by the national federation in recent years aimed at supporting policy and legislative development and the continued reconfiguration and development of services that seek to embrace the principles of person centredness, access, accountability and quality.  This work has included the organisation of conferences, seminars, shared learning events, high quality training programmes and important project work.</p>  <p>  I will mention two conferences in particular, the first of which was the Immersion event, which was a landmark one for the federation.  Its title was Immersion Transformation Programme - Towards a Good Life.  It was a five-day immersive learning event, which was organised by the federation in April 2013.  The event focused on providing leadership and practical support in the implementation of the new national disability policy developments.  Critically, Immersion was led by international experts who provided an in-depth introduction to important themes in the area of supported self-directed living to more than 300 attendees, including staff from our member organisations, statutory providers, families and people with intellectual disabilities themselves.  It was a truly landmark event and there was huge learning out of it in terms of providing leadership and practical support in the implementation of national disability policy.</p> <p>The federation, in collaboration with an organisation called Genio, has developed a four-week training programme called Enabling Excellence on the key components of social role valorisation theory.  The programme was provided to staff members from 30 of our member organisations along with staff from a range of other service providers, including statutory providers.<br/><br/>I wish to make reference to a major project we have under way called the Next Steps project.  The purpose is to support our member organisations as they progress with the development of individualised supports for people who use our services.  The overall aim of the work is to ensure that people with intellectual disabilities are supported to live a life of their choosing.  In all, we have 25 member organisations participating in the project.  Effectively, it is a community of learning.  We take a case study approach to share learning in the development of individualised supports.<br/><br/>The National Standards for Residential Services for Children and Adults with Disabilities document was published in January 2013 by HIQA.  In preparation for the introduction of the regulations in November 2013, the federation supported its members in a number of ways.  Primarily, the support was around information sharing, which is critical.  Since the introduction of the regulations there has been ongoing inter-agency sharing of information and experience leading to problem resolution throughout the services.  For example, there could be information sharing where the regulator has identified a deficiency in some policy in respect of some aspect of care in one organisation.  We facilitate cross-sharing with other organisations with robust policies that have passed the test.  This is an ongoing process.  As one might expect in a federation such as ours, we facilitate information sharing in terms of policy but we also facilitate study visits for organisations in respect of which compliance remains a challenge to organisations that are fully compliant.<br/><br/>The role of our quality and standards sub-committee has been expanded to include a central focus on the implementation of the regulations.  Our submission goes into some detail on the matter.  As a national federation of service providers, we have been in the vanguard of promoting quality for many decades, as one might expect.  Our quality committee carried out major international research during the 1990s.  This culminated in the publication of a report that was effectively a critique of seven different quality systems applying globally in services for people with intellectual disability.  The report was published by the quality committee and made available to organisations embarking on achieving accreditation in quality.  We have kept the committee in place.  Earlier, I pointed out that the brief was expanded in 2012 to include a central focus on the implementation of the regulations.<br/><br/>The federation has a strategic plan covering the period 2016-19.  One of the strategic priorities identified in the plan is a commitment to continuous quality improvement and innovation.  A range of actions are identified in the plan aimed at achieving this strategic priority.  The federation website is <i>www.fedvol.ie</i>.  A resource point was developed by us to facilitate the sharing of HIQA-related policies and documentation and is accessible on the website.<br/><br/>We are represented on the HIQA provider forum.  We have ongoing engagement with HIQA.  As the regulatory process took hold and began to progress, issues began to emerge around the regulatory process that we, as providers, brought to the attention of HIQA.  It was agreed between us that there would be merit in establishing a forum.  In fairness to HIQA, it has been responsive to providers.  The forum was established to facilitate direct communication between the authority and representative organisations of service providers with regard to issues pertaining to the regulatory framework for services to people with disabilities.  The forum meets on a quarterly basis.  It provides an opportunity to raise issues relating to the overall HIQA registration and inspection process as well as agree actions on how these issues can best be addressed.<br/><br/>We have contributed to the review of the implementation of the regulations and inspections of residential services for people with disabilities carried out by the National Disability Authority in 2015.  More recently, we participated in a discussion on the regulation of designated centres hosted by HIQA.  I will say more about that later.  Specifically, the NDA review confirmed that of the 18 outcomes HIQA inspect against, approximately two thirds of outcomes were found to be compliant or substantially compliant.  The NDA review focused on 192 HIQA reports that were selected for detailed analysis.  This sample covered the first year of regulation.  An earlier contribution by HIQA representatives referred to the fact that of the 1,100 designated centres requiring registration at the date of commencement of the regulations on 1 November 2013, only 200 remain to be registered today.  This points to progress on the issue.<br/><br/>Engagement with the people with intellectual disabilities who we support is vital.  They should be foremost in our thoughts in all of these discussions.  We are mindful of the need to ensure that the perspective of these people is understood.  As a result, we established a video booth at a self-advocate conference run by the Brothers of Charity Services Ireland, one of our member organisations.  The conference was attended by over 300 people.  We offered the attendees the opportunity to tell us what they want to say about HIQA.  This resulted in the development of a DVD, which I included in the briefing pack for committee members.  We had the opportunity to present this work to HIQA senior management.  It was gratifying to see the way the content of the video was noted by HIQA management.  Significant learning is to be gained from such study.  Earlier, Mr. Quinn from HIQA alluded to the fact that it is HIQA practice to consult and liaise with people who are supported.  We advocate a more systemic or systematic engagement with people who are supported because they have informative things to tell us.<br/><br/>It is fair to say that the commencement of the inspection and regulation process has posed considerable challenges for service providers.  Organisations have welcomed the introduction of standards and the establishment of HIQA to oversee the registration and inspection process.  However, the detailed requirements of the regulations and the pace of change have forced organisations to respond and adapt within a relatively short timeframe.  While progress is being made, it will take more time for all organisations to be fully compliant with the regulations.  This was adverted to in earlier contributions.<br/><br/>The federation has no doubt that the absence of a pre-regulatory impact assessment was a major deficit.  Such an assessment would have established the state of readiness of service providers as well as the resource implications for the sector.  It meant that service providers have to meet the significant regulatory requirements without adequate resourcing.  The costs associated with registration and home adaptations, including upgrades, fire equipment, protection measures and staffing, are immense, surprisingly.  Total compliance costs for our member organisations for the period 2015 and 2016 amounted to &euro;43 million, of which &euro;17 million had been provided to agencies by the HSE.  This left a shortfall of &euro;26 million.<br/><br/>I will outline the overall impact to date.  In the main, the introduction of the regulations in November 2013 has had a positive impact on the lives of children and adults living in residential services and designated centres.</p> <p>The process of external inspection is powerful and the introduction of the statutory regulations has made services more accountable and identified areas of poor practice that services need to address as a matter of priority.  There is also an increased focus on residents' rights, equity, how complaints are addressed and treating people with dignity and respect, all of which enhance individuals' overall quality of life.</p></speech>

They have taken measures for which they may or may not have adequate funding, but they have had to act.  They continue to engage with the HSE to try to secure funding to address deficits.  This contributes to the financial pressures on some organisations.  Others are engaging in a mix of fund-raising and so on to address the issue.</p></speech>

What is their response to many people's concern about the policy of decongregating?  Most members have received correspondence from people whose relatives are being moved out of residential care.  They are concerned about how their relatives will cope in new settings when their previous settings have been their homes for much of their lives.  Is this a common occurrence and do the witnesses support the policy?</p>  <p>  The witnesses mentioned the &euro;17 million of the &euro;43 million that had to be provided by the HSE, leaving a shortfall of &euro;26 million, but could they be more specific?  Have voluntary bodies had to reduce services because of this shortfall and have many designated centres been closed as a result of non-compliance?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-03a.133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017050300014#P01400"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  I asked HIQA a question about the 1,100 designated centres.  Of the approximately 9,000 beds, what percentage is provided by the voluntary sector?  Have we any idea of that figure?  HIQA stated that it would revert to us, but the witnesses have a fair idea on the matter.</p>  <p>  My second question is also one that I asked of HIQA.  Many of the witnesses' organisations, a number of which are large, also provide day care facilities.  Have those organisations undertaken an analysis of whether their types of day care service will have to change in the coming years if, for example, there is inadequate family support - an attendee's parents might be ageing - in the next ten, five or fewer years?  What problems are we likely to face?  I have in mind COPE in Cork, where approximately 1,500 people attend its day care services.  I imagine that it will face major challenges in this regard.</p>  <p>  The witnesses mentioned how the HIQA forum had been useful, but could more be done to help the federation's members work in a timely manner?  Is there co-ordination between HIQA, the federation and the funding organisation, namely, the HSE?  Are we running into problems?  On the one hand, voluntary bodies are coming under pressure from HIQA to reach a certain standard and, on the other, the HSE does not seem to recognise that.  Does that vary between different parts of the country?  Is it an issue that must be taken to national level to be addressed?  What progress can be made?  Can this committee be of help if there is an area of the country where the necessary supports are not being provided by the HSE?</p>  <p>  I also mentioned the issue of respite care.  HIQA raised some concerns about, for instance, respite care being provided at weekends in facilities that were occupied for the full week by people who were permanent residents but were able to go home at weekends.  Respite care is a major issue, but less of it seems to be available now than at any other time.  Are the various organisations involved being worked with to try to improve this situation?</p></speech>

The HIQA forum is a welcome development, but Senator Burke is right.  He did not use the expression, but we often find that member organisations &ndash; the service providers &ndash; are the meat in the middle of the sandwich.  HIQA gets on with what it must do, namely, inspecting and reporting on compliance or non-compliance.  I would not go so far as to say that it is not concerned about the requisite resourcing, but that is not its business.  Rather, its business is to inspect and report.  The issue of resourcing is a matter on which the service providers must engage with the HSE.  As the figures indicate, we have had limited success in that engagement.  It remains a major issue for us.  Anything that the committee could do to assist in that regard would be welcome, given the impact on other services.  As Mr. O'Regan mentioned, in order to ensure compliance, significant costs are incurred that create deficits in other parts of the organisations, which undoubtedly impacts on their ability to respond to all identified needs.</p>  <p>  Regarding the 1,100 designated centres, those probably include statutory providers and providers of services to people with physical disabilities in residential care.  We do not represent those organisations, rather, voluntary organisations providing services to people with intellectual disabilities and autism.  To answer the Senator's question directly, I do not know how many beds in the 1,100 designated centres relate to us.</p> <p>I note that the chief inspector agreed to provide that information and we would be very interested in it.</p> <p> The subject of day care facilities and changing need is a huge issue for future services planning and one that we highlight all the time.  Working in collaboration with Senator Dolan's organisation, the Disability Federation of Ireland, it is an issue that we raise constantly with the HSE as the statutory organisation.  There needs to be planning around this because there is no doubt that it is a ticking time bomb.  As Senator Colm Burke rightly says, carers and parents are growing older and in some cases are acquiring health issues and disabilities themselves.  Their ability to continue to respond is compromised.  We raise this issue at every opportunity we get.</p> <p> The value for money and disability policy review is now called the Transforming Lives programme.  It is progressing with its work through a series of working groups.  The first working group, of which I am a member, is tasked with forecasting future demand for disability services.  It is a work in progress at the moment but the topic is getting a lot of attention in respect of changing needs, carers getting older and the carers' concern of "Who will be there when I am gone?"</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-03a.137" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard O'Regan" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017050300015#Q00200"><p>I would like to add to Mr. O'Donnell's comments.  Some of the pressure on services at present is coming on the back of years of cutbacks.  While there has been investment in service developments in recent years, it has come on the back of years when the investment in services had reduced significantly.  As the investment in services is happening now, it must also retrospectively deal with the cuts in services that had happened over those years, the consequences of those cuts and the impact they had on families.  We are seeing extensive evidence and experience of families who have survived, and I use the word advisedly, through those very difficult years and who are now finding it extremely hard.  The pace of investment over the next few years will need to be significant to catch up and start meeting the need.</p>  <p>  Reference was made to decongregation and congregated settings.  The position of the national federation is to endorse the national policy.  We were part of the development of that policy and contributed to it.  As the representatives from HIQA said earlier, there is much evidence that those models of service were developed when that was the best that was known but we now know different.  We have different models of service that we can and should be providing for people.  That area also requires investment and, as the HIQA representatives said, it cannot just be done overnight.  We are talking about people's lives and about places that have been their homes for decades.  Any consideration of what a different service or support arrangement might look like must be based on each person, their assessed needs and how it might be best designed.  The transition from where people are currently living to any new arrangement must be as carefully thought out as is the outcome for people at the end of the process.</p>  <p>  I have no data on reduction in services but I have no doubt there has been some experience of organisations not expanding their services because they have had to raise the standards of the services they provide or that may have been obliged to curtail what they do in some way.  There are examples of providers deciding not to continue with a service because the costs of getting it to the standard where it complies with regulations may have been prohibitive and they may have had to look at alternatives.  That has not always been a bad thing; it has sometimes created opportunities for innovation in developing different models of service or exploring what different models might look like.  It is not always a negative thing.  It has also created some opportunities around it.</p>  <p>  Senator Dolan referred earlier to "hot-bedding" and with respite and the use of people's beds, it certainly is an issue that has raised some difficulties.  It goes back to a fundamental issue about what we believe home looks like.  I live in my family home but I am here in Dublin tonight because I have meetings today and tomorrow.  While the prospect that somebody might use my bed in my absence as a respite bed has a certain economic benefit, it presents huge issues around what is my private space, my sense of home and so on.  The challenge for providers is to maintain good quality and adequate levels of respite service but in a way that safeguards the interests of people using respite and the interests of people whose home it is.  The challenge can be seen in some instances where it has not been possible for a provider to figure out a solution to that; they have had to make a decision about whether a bed is a respite bed or a residential bed.  I am aware, for example, that in a number of services there is a respite bed in a residential home and the provider has sought to dedicate a bedroom that is only used for respite and is not a person's bedroom.  They try to ensure there is only a small number, maybe three or four people, using that bed for respite so the people who live in the facility do not experience 20 different people coming in and out of their home in the space of a month.  It is a case of trying to find the best solution against a difficult backdrop of limited resources and of trying to meet a range of needs within those services, as well as complying with regulations and what is set out there.</p></speech>

An opportunity comes up for a respite break and they use the respite break but are then not in a position to accept the son, daughter, brother or sister back into the home.  He or she is pretty well left in the care of the service provider.  This is probably an indication of the desperation felt by some people and it goes to the heart of the concerns raised by the Senator.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-03a.139" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard O'Regan" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017050300015#Q00400"><p>With regard to the timely engagement of the different stakeholders, the service providers, the regulators and the HSE in responding to needs, undoubtedly the impact of regulation has been quite significant on services over recent years and Mr. O'Donnell has alluded to this already.  Another reality is that the HSE has itself been going through quite a significant restructuring and redesign.  Part of that has been the development of some new structures at local level to try to bring together the service providers and the HSE.  This is at the very early stages and some of those committees are only having their first meetings now.  It could certainly be hoped that this might provide a structure for timely and effective planning and responding to the issues that arise.  If there is an inspection by HIQA of a service that points to significant issues - such as the examples given by Mr. O'Donnell where a building upgrade might be required at significant cost - sometimes the only way this could be addressed is through a collaborative approach with the HSE.  There must be mechanisms to be able to engage with the HSE to try to prioritise that work within the limits of the budgets available to the executive.</p> <p>I hope that some of the committees and structures that are forming will help to grow the kind of speedy interaction to which the Senator referred.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-03a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1419" speakername="John Dolan" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017050300016#R00200"><p>I appreciate the presentation and the work the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies has put into it.  It is important to emphasise that very last paragraph which states that in the main, regulation has had a positive impact on lives and that external inspection is powerful, brings more accountability, picks up on poor practice and shines a light on issues around dignity, respect, equity and such like.</p>  <p>  Having said that, I have a few questions that arise from the earlier session.  I will ask for some comments on them and then if we have the time I have a couple of other questions for observations.  I think it was Mr. Finbarr Colfer that said the provider community is increasingly recognising that it is better not to focus only on the residential.  Currently, protections are around buildings and places.  Mr. O'Regan talked about the different models of services we now have.  I think they connect in some way and I would like a comment on that.  Ms Dunnion talked about the importance of cultural change from the top down.  Does that resonate with the witnesses or do they have any other comments?  The other point is on governance and is similar to one I raised earlier.  To what extent does an appreciation of what the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is about act as a driver in respect of governance orientation in organisations?  Could it be a stronger driver in that regard?  Ms Dunnion also spoke about things that might usefully change or develop in the regulations.  What progress or alterations of the regulations would the witnesses like to see, given the experience of this first round? </p>  <p>  To change course slightly, is there anything mitigating, preventing or making it difficult for younger people to stay out of institutions or congregated settings of one kind or another?  How has the profile of people in services or coming into services changed over the decades?  What impact is that having?  Mr. O'Regan talked about the pressure as a result of cuts.  It think he used the phrase families who have survived over those difficult years.  Is there a question there?  What is his sense about the sustainability of what is going on?  My final comment was spurred by Mr. O'Regan.  I think I heard him speak a number of years ago about moving from the notion of service provision to being of service to people.  Is that relevant here or does Mr. O'Regan have any comment on that?</p></speech>

To what extent has Mr. O'Regan observed any changes in volunteerism and the availability of volunteers in recent years?  From what kind of background do the volunteers who are available or who make themselves available come?  Do they come with a knowledge of the subject matter to which they are about to relate, or do they come with no knowledge?</p></speech>

I will try to deal with these questions as best I can.  Sustainability for families is a real concern.  In other situations I have used the word "crisis".  I have tried to be careful in the use of that word because it can be overused, but I would not underestimate the stress and demands on families and on their family member with a disability in light of inadequate services.</p>  <p>  In some way that links to the question about the future regarding children and keeping people out of those service models we are trying, in some respects, to move beyond.  Where families are in crisis and where we are not meeting their needs at the point where the need first emerges, that level of need escalates.  When it escalates, we then tend to provide the solutions that we know.  The better thing to do would be to try to engage with families at an earlier stage and try to figure out solutions that are innovative and responsive to their needs, but which are not necessarily the conventional answer or the conventional model of service.  The more we can get back to that grounding, the more we can keep a focus on young people as children and as teenagers who want to be part of their community with supports.  We can focus on engaging and connecting them to their communities and helping them to develop relationships and supports within their communities, so that a reliance on services is diminished.  We can focus on reducing reliance on the conventional model, where when one needs a place to live, one goes to a group home.  Instead one should be supported to find a home that is designed around one's needs and preferences and which is shared with the people with which one wants to share it.  Where people need support, those supports should be organised in a way that makes sense for them.  The regulatory framework should be designed in such a way that it can assure the public and the State about the quality of those supports and not just about the brick walls within which people live.</p>  <p>  The comment on whether we are service providers or of service is critical.  It goes to the nature of what the future will be.  It has to be part of our ongoing dialogue.  Traditionally, services and service providers have found themselves almost trying to be all things to all people.  I do not think anybody or any organisation can do that.  We must ensure that the person who is being supported is the reason we all exist as service providers in the first instance, and that in carrying out and providing those services we are there in service to the person who needs some support.  In that sense, there is a shift in power from service provider to the person supported.  As people increasingly govern their own arrangements and are supported to do that, many things will be shifted.  </p>  <p>  As people are more in control of their own services and are directing them - and are being supported by their families and friends in doing so because some people will need significant levels of support to do that - the work of the regulator will also be impacted because there will be a wider range of models.  It will not just be a conventional organisational hierarchy with a board and a management structure.  Increasingly we will see new models or governance and oversight of support arrangements come into play and they will have to be part of a new framework.  </p>  <p>  For my own part, and Mr. O'Donnell might have a different view, I think the direction that HIQA is talking about in terms of a different regulatory framework is very welcome.  Certainly, for my own part, I think it has taken a lot of cognisance of the experience over the past number of years.</p> <p>Some of the struggle, to which Mr. Colfer referred, concerns providers either being hesitant about what can be done within the current framework or providing different models of service but with great uncertainty about being in breach of some regulation.  Therefore, moving to a different framework would be welcome.</p></speech>

At this point we should be fair to the Legislature because national disability policy has seldom, if ever, been more exciting and full of potential.  Resourcing is of course required for effective implementation, but a key prerequisite in the effective implementation of disability policy is culture change.  Many organisations have been around for a long time.  Some, in fact, have been providing services since before the foundation of the State.  Practice culture therefore becomes embedded in organisations.  Some people have described the scale of the challenge as being akin to turning the <i>Titanic</i>in Dublin docks.<br/><br/>I mentioned some of the work we are doing ourselves, including shared learning events, study visits and bringing in international experts.  That work is bringing about a realisation of the need for culture change and how one does it, which is critically important.  As the chief inspector said, it is not without a challenge and it is a slow-burn matter.  As CEO of the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies, I am satisfied it is happening on an increasingly progressive basis over time.</p></speech>

It is a good thing and I was surprised to hear it is an issue in some organisations.

The purpose of this part of our meeting is to conduct pre-committee scrutiny of the Employment Equality (Abolition of Mandatory Retirement Age) Bill 2016, sponsored by Deputy John Brady.  I welcome Deputy Brady.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Deputy Brady to brief the committee on the Bill.  He will present a brief opening statement and I will then open the meeting for general discussion, questions and answers.  The officials are distributing a replacement opening statement by Deputy Brady as there were a couple of typos in the one circulated, which he has addressed, so this is the substantive address that he will now proceed to put on the record.  Before I invite Deputy Brady to present his opening address, I thank Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh for facilitating the quorum requirements of the committee.  I call Deputy Brady.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-03a.158" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017050300002#A00500"><p>I thank the Chair and members for bringing this Bill forward for scrutiny by the committee.  I would also like to acknowledge the support, assistance and advice I received from a number of organisations ahead of the debate on this Bill in the D&aacute;il on 23 February last, including Age Action Ireland, Active Retirement Ireland, the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland and SIPTU.</p> <p>  The Bill seeks to give people choice.  It is about one issue - abolishing mandatory retirement and putting an end to ageism at work.  Its importance to so many people is extraordinary.  Since I first introduced the Bill, my offices have been inundated with letters, emails, phone calls and personal visits asking when this Bill will become law.  Of course, while it has been impossible to provide such a timeframe, I want every member of this committee to know that people approaching retirement are holding out hope for this Bill, so its importance should not be underestimated.</p> <p>  It is also important to consider the wider benefits this Bill will have and the issues it will help to address.  Abolishing mandatory retirement will mean that 65 year olds will no longer be forced onto a jobseeker's payment, a lesser payment than the State pension, for one year.  In 2021, when the pension age will be 67, will jobseeker's payments be extended for two years, given this would be very messy?  Abolishing mandatory retirement will also assist people who do not have the necessary contributions to qualify for a full State pension, which is a huge issue.  To date, due to the 2012 pension changes, 35,000 older people are on a lesser pension payment than they would have been on had they retired before 2012.  It should also be borne in mind that mandatory retirement has been abolished in a number of other countries, for example, New Zealand, Australia and the United States as far back as 1986.</p> <p>  This Bill is not perfect, which I acknowledge.  There are a number of technical issues that must be addressed and here is the place for that process to be undertaken.  However, although issues were identified by the Government, I welcome the fact it saw beyond those issues to the bigger issue at play to pass the Bill unanimously.</p> <p>  With that said, I would like to address the concerns raised by the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, in his speech when this Bill was debated on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  These concerns may be shared by some members of this committee today, so I will go through the Minister of State's concerns.  First, he stated that multiple pieces of primary legislation would be required in the context of the enactment of this Bill.  We know that changes to employment law are not simple and that one change will not suffice.  However, simply because multiple pieces of legislation may have to be changed should not be off-putting, given we are here to legislate.  I suggest we could easily insert a provision in this Bill that any references to mandatory retirement in existing legislation would no longer be applicable as our new provision would apply.</p> <p>  Second, the Minister of State mentioned the amendment made to the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 to bring our equality legislation more in line with a directive issued by the Court of Justice of the European Union.  This is an important amendment in light of this Bill.  The directive was issued by Europe 17 years ago.  It states that any compulsory retirement age must be objectively and reasonably justified.  However, this is difficult to define and it has largely been left to the courts to define what is objectively and reasonably justified and what is not.  There have been various interpretations of what "objectively and reasonably justified" may mean and it invariably works against the employee's interest.</p><p>We want to balance this out.  We want it to be based on clear actuarial evidence rather than interpretation, strengthening what is already there and giving further support to employees.</p><p> The retrospective question is key to this Bill.  The Minister raised concerns around the setting aside of retirement provisions in most existing employment contracts.  The Bill will impact on existing contracts; for many of those contacting me about the Bill, this is an essential element.  It does not mean that people will be forced to remain at work; people can retire whenever they want.  Instead of being given a set age at which they must retire, employees can consider their own circumstances and make their own choices.  It is nothing more than a question of choice.  The Minister commented that the Attorney General has advised that applying this Bill retrospectively to pre-existing contracts of employment may be susceptible to legal challenge.  All legislation is susceptible to legal challenge.  It is up to us to analyse this legislation and make it as strong and well drafted as possible for the benefit of workers.</p><p> The Minister said there may be significant implications for youth unemployment.  This is the most overused and tired argument when it comes to abolishing mandatory retirement, and one which people fail to back up with any proper evidence.  It is also defined as one of the legitimate aims referred to in the EU directive to allow mandatory retirement.  In reality, the evidence indicates that reducing labour force participation among older people does not lead to increased employment for young people.  Norway, Sweden, New Zealand and Iceland are among the top ten countries in the world for youth employment and also for the employment of older people.  Age Action Ireland addressed this argument in an excellent briefing paper on abolishing mandatory retirement and outlined the following evidence: a 2014 report from IZA World of Labor found that there is no trade-off in the employment of young and older workers; higher employment for older workers coincides with higher employment for younger workers; and reducing the employment of older persons does not provide more job opportunities for younger persons.  The report also found that measures introduced in Denmark and France that reduced labour force participation for older workers saw drops in youth employment over the same period.  The link has also been comprehensively dismissed on repeated occasions by the OECD.  It is important to dispel myths in this area.  The claim that fewer jobs for older workers results in more jobs for younger workers, though unfounded, is proving especially stubborn.</p><p> The Minister mentioned that allowing financial incentives to be offered to employees to cease work would have cost implications.  They will give an employer the option to provide an incentive for an employee to retire.  That is not an obligation; it is simply providing an alternative avenue.  The Minister mentioned PRSI contributions being paid by those who would remain at work.  It is far more beneficial to have payments going into the Exchequer than out of it.  The Minister spoke about the impact on defined benefit pension schemes.  Obviously, legislation of this nature will have knock-on effects but this should not prevent us from moving forward with the Bill.  There are fewer defined benefit schemes than ever before and provisions can be put in place to complement the Bill.  Instead of setting older and younger workers against each other, we should be trying to maximise the valuable contribution older workers provide to the economy, including making full use of the skills, experience and wisdom of older workers to train in younger and newer employees.  For me, this argument resembles those that could have been made against women entering the workforce.  Although it might have been argued that women would take men&rsquo;s jobs, this was not the case.  I ask the committee to look at the evidence and not to focus on this flawed argument.</p><p> Turning to the Bill itself and examining it section by section, I would like to address a number of issues.  The structure of the Bill needs to be changed.  Instead of substituting subsection (3) of section 34 of the Employment Equality Act, as the current drafting of the Bill provides, we would like to insert this subsection into section 34(9) of the Act.  This is a structural issue and it is not serious.  Alternatively, it could be inserted into section 37.  The specific section into which the provision is inserted is not of great importance.  As I have already said, using the wording "clear actuarial or other evidence" will strengthen the provision, which currently allows for mandatory retirement once it is &ldquo;objectively and reasonably justified&rdquo; which I feel allows for far too wide an interpretation.  A definition of what "clear actuarial or other evidence" involves is important here and I would like to see that included for clarification purposes. </p><p> I would like to see a further definition of what is meant by &ldquo;capable of doing the job&rdquo; &ndash; physically able to come to work, do the job and carry out all necessary duties.  Section 1(b) makes reference to the Garda and Defence Forces, and is contradictory in its current position in the Bill.  We do not wish to delete the text here but insert it and again, this is part of a structural issue which I feel can be easily rectified.  To clarify, we are retaining the reference to "objectively and reasonably justified" for those in security-related employment .</p><p> We remain open to suggestions and amendments from Deputies, Senators and the relevant Ministers once they do not impede the overall objective of the Bill, which is to abolish mandatory retirement and to end ageism.  That is its sole objective.</p></speech>

I would not worry about the fact that it is not perfect.  I have never seen a Bill in this House that is, and it is no reason that we should not discuss this very important issue.  Looking at the legislative basis of the Employment Equality Act, it outlaws a number of grounds upon which people can be discriminated against in the workplace such as gender, marital or family status, sexual orientation, religion, disability, race, and Traveller status.  Age is included among these grounds but the Act states that discrimination on the basis of age is allowed where a person has not attained the age of 18, which is understandable, or has attained the age of 65 or 66.  I always thought it was very unusual to have such discrimination permitted in our legal system.  It only really applies in the public sector and there have been a couple of examples recently.  David Davin-Power had to retire recently although he seemed to be perfectly good health and to be a very competent journalist.  I was listening to Michael O'Keeffe on the radio.  He is an ophthalmologist in the Mater hospital and he has to retire from practice in the public health system.  Both of those people can, of course, continue to work in the private sector.  It shows how indiscriminate this is, and I welcome the fact that the issue is being presented here.</p> <p>  The way Deputy Brady has presented it, in order for the discrimination to be justified or not, we will have to consider whether there are increased costs.  It appears to be the case under his proposal that discrimination would only be permitted if there was going to be a very large increased cost to the State.  How does the Deputy think that would operate in practice?  There is also a legitimate concern that if there is no retirement age for people in the public sector, they will never leave.  They will be like politicians who get in and never get out.  It may then become more difficult for young people to get in to the State sector.  I am interested to hear what Deputy Brady has to say about those two things.</p></speech>

The sole purpose of the Bill is to give workers choice because up to now, the choice has been in the hands of the employer.  There are many people who feel they have many more years of work in them.  Their decision is based on a number of grounds, be they financial, personal or to prevent isolation.  It is about putting choice in employees' hands.  We know that with increased health benefits for people, people are living far longer.  This was acknowledged in the changes that were made in 2012 when the State pension age was increased to 66.  The fact that mandatory retirement was not abolished in line with that is a serious anomaly.  People who are forced to retire, against their will in many cases, are forced on to a jobseeker's payment.  We know that the State transition pension was in place for a number of years but has subsequently been abolished so there is a serious issue.  The Bill gives the employee the choice to decide whether or not to retire.  David Davin-Power was mentioned.  To use RTE as an example, I have spoken to other employees in RTE.  This is an example of the broader problem in the State.  They tell me that this year, 21 people in RTE are being forced to retire due to mandatory retirement rules.  RTE has systems all those employees must tie into.  Of those 21 employees, two want to work longer.  The other 19 want to take their pensions and retire and that is brilliant.  This is what this Bill essentially does.  It gives those 19 people who want to retire from RTE the choice to do so but it also gives the other two people who do not want to retire at this point the option to remain in the workforce for longer.</p> <p>  A point was raised about the fact that we want to apply the test of clear actuarial and other evidence.  A point was made about an increased cost for the State.  I do not get that point.  If an employer could prove that it had been told by an insurance provider that it would cost an additional &euro;20,000 to retain an older manual worker in the workforce and the employer could prove that because its workforce comprised three people, this additional load would make the business completely unviable, discrimination would be allowed on that ground.  However, solid evidence would be needed to show that it was justified on those grounds.  </p></speech>

Plenty of examples come to mind.  One thinks of nurses forced to retire at a particular age who are then rehired by an agency to work at the same workplace so they have a pension and might be fully employed through an agency, which costs the State twice or three times what it cost previously when they wanted to continue to work in the public service.  This rigid age anomaly should be lifted.</p> <p>  How would the process work in the public service?  Who would decide?  What would be the process to deal with the difficult circumstances that would arise where someone did not want to retire but there were probable grounds for them to do so?  How would Deputy Brady envisage that working within the public service?  How has it worked elsewhere?  </p></speech>

We will do away with any age restrictions because age is a figure on a piece of paper.  In many circumstances, people do not feel as old as that piece of paper states.  To use a terrible clich&eacute;, 80 is the new 70 and 70 is the new 60.  That is the case for many people because of healthier lifestyles.  The Bill will remove any age restrictions in any contract.  It will allow an employee to remain in work longer and it just means that people can work longer.  They can also retire so it gives people choice.  I do not foresee any difficulties in those circumstances.  If people in the public service want to retire at 65, it will give them that option and if they want to continue working beyond that age, there will be no age restriction within the contract.</p></speech>

Ultimately, that is where it will lead.  The difficulty up to now is that the directive from the EU, which was passed 17 years ago, was only incorporated into legislation here in 2015.  The courts have tended to be interpret it in the employer's favour.  There have been many examples.  In the case of Paul Doyle<i>v</i>. ESB International, the court believed that compulsory retirement could be applied to ensure cohesion among all employees so it ruled against Mr. Doyle in that case.  In this case, forced retirement was essentially allowed to facilitate promotion within the ESB and that is the difficulty with the interpretation.  This is why I am seeking to bring in a higher level of proof where clear actuarial and other evidence will determine these cases if they end up in the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</p></speech>

You must be joking.  We want lower retirement ages.  Fair play to Deputy Brady for coming in.  Our main job today is to say as a committee that this is an urgent issue for loads of people.</p><p>It is so because of the changes to the pension legislation.</p><p> Trade unions and others fought for years for a retirement age so that workers could retire, enjoy life and not be overburdened by work.  One visits America and somebody serves people in a shop - a little granny, who can hardly stand as she gives people their change.  She probably has three jobs because she could not survive otherwise.  Obviously, we do not want that type of situation and it is probably why in some ways the unions have resisted changes to retirement ages.  It was seen as a protection measure for workers.  What we are trying to do is balance the situation because life has changed.  People's health and expectations have changed, and we need to accommodate people's choices.  I do not know how we do this, but it needs to be addressed because of the changes in pension schemes.  It was a poor response by the Minister to state on Second Stage that it will cause problems for defined benefit schemes because it is precisely because of changes to pensions that many people are in this situation.</p><p> I support Deputy John Brady's point.  I would like the committee to move this on as one of our equality legislation priorities.  Many people would thank us for it.  It is not really our job to correct the faults - the Department can assist us in that regard.</p><p> One area that will be important is what being capable of doing the job means.  We certainly do not want those who should be at home and are not capable of doing a job being in there merely by virtue of the fact that one cannot get rid of them-----</p></speech>

Workers become institutionalised, and it is very difficult.  How one address that needs to be factored in as well, but those are management areas.  What we are talking about here is removing the fact that one must go at 65 and providing choice for many workers.  Ideally, I would like a situation where workers who have the income and the wherewithal are encouraged to retire comfortably at 65, which is the other side of the equation.  Many people do not want to work forever.  Well done to Deputy John Brady.</p></speech>

I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few awards.</p> <p>  I thank Deputy John Brady for opening up this debate.  Many people I have known certainly did not want to retire and, sadly, they did not live very long after retirement.  A few of them were depressed and felt bad about it.  Others did not live until the day they were due to retire.</p></speech>

Some people are still very capable at the point of retiring.</p> <p>  There is another side to it that we must be wary of, for example, where teachers retire and for some reason or other are re-employed.  This is depriving young teachers of jobs, but I do not know how we can legislate for that.  This must be properly thought out.  It is unfair that a teacher retires and has his or her pension, but the next thing he or she is working again and a young teacher who is qualified cannot get a job.  If such young teachers get jobs, they may have to travel to the other end of the country and be away from home.  They have the cost of that and the job is not as good as it should be after many years in college getting qualifications and jumping every hurdle.  They find they cannot get proper jobs.  I was with somebody who was home from America the other day.  He is 77 years of age and is driving a lorry in New Jersey and New York.  He is in perfect health and well capable of doing his job.  I am sure if one told that man that he had to give up work tomorrow, he would probably die very shortly after that because he lives for it and he is good at it.  There are two sides to Deputy John Brady's Bill.</p> <p>  I again thank Deputy Brady for raising this topic.  It is something that is important to many people.  We will have to work together to see how we can progress it and ensure that fair play is available to all.</p></speech>

The issues around schoolteachers and others in the public service who are being brought back as consultants to work clearly shows that for a multitude of reasons they feel that they must continue working whether that is for financial reasons or due to issues around isolation or whatever.  It could be because of the changes that were brought in, as Deputy Clare Daly outlined, in 2012, where the State pension and how it was calculated was changed, which had a particularly hard-hitting effect, predominantly on women.  I outlined that at this stage the changes that were brought introduced in 2012 have affected 35,000 people.  They are on a lesser payment than if they had retired prior to 2012.  Clearly, there are issues, and that is why some would feel they have to remain within the workforce.  This will do away with that problem.  Instead of retired people being brought back as consultants, they will be able to continue working beyond the set retirement age, whether it is 65 years or whatever level is set.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the support of Professor John Crown who, as a Senator, tried to bring forward a Bill that would have abolished mandatory retirement.  Professor Crown is fully supportive of this Bill also.  He has outlined at length the difficulties within the medical fraternity where staff, particularly senior consultants, are forced to retire, and with that goes their knowledge and experience built up over many years.  We are all aware of the difficulties in terms of the recruitment of new nurses and doctors.</p> <p>  All of this will do away with the litany of errors that have been made previously.  It will address to some extent the issues around the changes that were made to the PRSI contributions and how the State pension is calculated in 2012.  Importantly, it will give the employee a say.  It will not force workers into remaining at work.  Certainly, as Deputy Clare Daly stated, the intention is not to force workers to remain at work into their 80s or 90s, as in the example given in America where a very old lady was working behind a till, but to give workers the choice to retire when he or she sees fit.</p></speech>

Individuals will decide to retire for various reasons.  As Deputy John Brady stated, some may decide to retire on health grounds.  Others may have a nice pension that they feel comfortable they can retire on and they might want to spend time with grandchildren or become their childminders.</p><p>Then again, there may be other people in those circumstances who do not have family or grandchildren.  Their only social interaction might be through work.  The mental health side of it is important because if somebody who does not have strong family support at that age is forced to retire, it can affect that person's mental health.  </p><p> It is important that the objective is not to force people to retire.  One of the arguments that was raised on Second Stage was whether it would be possible to stop somebody who was not capable of doing his or her job from carrying on forever.  If people are not capable of doing their job it does not matter whether they are 66, 76, 36 or 46.  If that person is not capable of doing the job, there are mechanisms to deal with that.  </p><p> The age argument is also somewhat of a red herring.  In the public sector very few people of that age would have jobs involving a lot of manual labour.  There would be a very small number of cases where somebody might be physically unable to do a job.  It is a flawed argument to say that somebody would not have the mental capacity at 66, 65 or 67 to continue doing a job that the person was doing excellently 12 months previously.  Age does not come into a person's ability to do a job.  Obviously certain types of jobs would be an exception, but age certainly does not come into the argument regarding a person's ability to work or not.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-03a.187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017050300002#E00300"><p>There is none in particular.  On the point that Deputy O'Brien mentioned around the isolation when people are forced into retirement, I want to acknowledge the fantastic work of Active Retirement Ireland in trying to make the process of retirement easier for so many people.  I acknowledge the fantastic work it does right across the State in helping to keep people active and in breaking down that rural isolation.  There are certainly examples where people who have been forced into retirement, and who do not partake in the fantastic work of Active Retirement Ireland and other bodies, fall into that kind of isolation.  This will give people the opportunity to make the decision themselves.</p> <p>  It has to be acknowledged that there are different types of work.  I do not want to put any employment or job down or anything like that, but some jobs are more difficult in terms of physical labour as opposed to jobs where someone who might work behind a desk.  They are two different types of employment.  Someone who is involved in physical employment might feel that, because of the nature of the work, 65 is the time to go.  Indeed they might feel that 60 is the time for them to retire.  Again, this Bill will give those people the choice.  If they feel 60 is the time for them to retire, the choice will be theirs.  There are different types of employment.  Some may require more physical endurance than others, but this gives the employee the option.  Employees know best when it is for them to retire.  There are people out there in their 80s and 90s who are doing fantastic work.  As was previously alluded to, there are some people in their 20s and 30s and questions might be asked as to whether the work that they are doing is of a suitable standard.  Age does not determine what kind of level of engagement one has or how good one's work is.  People will know themselves whether they are suited to the job.</p></speech>

I do not know the extent of the lobby that members of the committee have been individually subjected to in respect of this Bill, but I can confirm to the committee and to Deputy Brady, that this has been one of the most active lobbies that I have personally experienced, either in my capacity as a Deputy or as Chair of this committee.  There has been a significant lobby from throughout the country.  In fact I wrote to a great number of people yesterday to advise that the committee was facilitating this pre-Committee Stage scrutiny this morning.  I hope that they are watching or have the opportunity to watch a recording.</p><p>I think I am representing the views expressed when I note that the unanimous position on Second Stage is continuing in this committee and state that we, as a committee, look forward to the facilitation of Committee Stage of this legislation as soon as possible.  We will be preparing a report.  It will be furnished to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality as an <i>ex officio</i>member of the committee for any observations, but we would urge Government to facilitate the onward passage of this Bill into law.  That is one of the most important concluding statements I can make while Deputy Brady is still here with us this morning, not just for his own benefit but for the benefit of the many people I know from the lobby I have received not only from my own constituency, but from across the country.  Some are in their 60s and looking at the calendar.  It is almost like an advent calendar.  They are afraid to open the little boxes, it is getting ever closer, but they are very anxious about this legislation.  It could be their last chance to be able to continue in fruitful employment - employment that they love, appreciate and in which they want to be able to continue.  On behalf of the committee I would like to send our good wishes to them in the hope that we collectively and individually will be able to assist in that objective. </p><p>Would Deputy Brady like to make any closing point before I draw this session to a close?</p></speech>

I know there are so many people watching this debate.  I have been inundated.  I do not say that to overplay this Bill's importance, but since I brought it to the floor of the House I have been inundated by people who are turning 65 this year, including schoolteachers who are turning 65 in September and who are hoping that this Bill is passed before they retire.  It is not in my power to move this any faster than it is moving.  I welcome the words from the Chairman of the committee and the overall support of committee members here, but unfortunately there have been false hopes in the past.  One of my own former constituency colleagues, Deputy Anne Ferris, brought forward this legislation back in 2015.  It went through Committee Stage, there was a committee report produced and at that stage the Thirty-first D&aacute;il fell, as did that legislation.  I do not have a crystal ball to see how long this Government will stay in place, but I do know that this is essential legislation that has the potential to greatly benefit many people and to give them the choice to decide themselves when they want to retire.</p> <p>  I concur with the Chairman's remarks.  I hope that Ministers or the Taoiseach are watching this morning.  I think it is a money order or a money note that is needed at this stage.  I appeal to Ministers to ensure that this Bill is advanced as quickly as possible.</p><p>That should be done to end the sleepless nights for the many people who are looking at the calendar in fear of their next birthday, which is sad.  People should be able to enjoy not just their birthday, but turning 65, 66 or however many years of age.  I urge that the Bill be advanced to the next Stage as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

The statistics that the Deputy cited regarding RTE were interesting.  It is not that the situation will be so overpowering in terms of the numbers that will choose to remain.  Two of 21 opting leaves 19.  It is not necessarily that they are going into retirement.  Some may be going on to some other form of employment or activity in life.  That is a choice, as the Deputy has emphasised time after time.  There should not be any nervousness about the potential outworking of this Bill's passage.  Absolutely, I hope that the Taoiseach is watching this morning.  He should be.  There we are.</p><p>I thank Deputy Brady for his engaging with the committee today.  The clerk will prepare a draft scrutiny report, which will be circulated in due course to members of the committee.  As I have already indicated, the Minister will be included in this circulation as an <i>ex officio</i>committee member and invited to submit observations or propose amendments to the draft.</p><p>The committee will suspend for one minute, which we are required to do, and will then resume in private session to deal with housekeeping matters.</p></speech>

I am delighted to welcome the witnesses to today's meeting.  The are Ms Lisa Brady, chief executive officer of Longford Chamber of Commerce and Industry; Mr. Ciaran Corcoran, Abbott Diagnostics and midlands chairman of IBEC, Councillor Seamus Butler, Butler Manufacturing Services and former president of Longford Chamber of Commerce and Industry; Dr. Brian McCann, lecturer in the Institute of Technology, Sligo and Mr. William Carty, Sligo Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  I hope I have all the names and titles correct.  The joint chambers have brought a large number of their supporters and campaigners and they are with us today in the Public Gallery and in the seats to the rear of the committee room.

We represent nine chambers of commerce from the north midlands and the north west, an area that has a major infrastructural deficit on the N4 and N5 routes.  The chambers are from Longford, Athlone, Ballina, Carrick-on-Shannon, Letterkenny, Mayo, Mullingar, Roscommon and Sligo.  Many of the chambers are represented here today and some of the local authorities in the area are also represented.</p>  <p>  Dr. Brian McCann, the programme co-ordinator of postgraduate education in road and transport engineering at Sligo IT will speak next on the technical and economic viewpoint, followed by Mr. Ciaran Corcoran, the site manager at Abbot Diagnostics in Longford and also president of IBEC in the midlands, who will speak from the business perspective.  I understand we may have a question-and-answer session after that.  Also present, as the Chairman mentioned, is Ms Lisa Brady, CEO of Sligo Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Mr. Bill Carty, former group finance director of Abbot Ireland.</p>  <p>  The N4-N5 is the last spoke in the national roads radial network connecting the nation to our capital city.  That should be an overarching priority over much-needed intercity connections.  Most of the other radials have been completed to motorway or class 1 dual carriageway standard.  The north midlands and the north west is a national asset waiting to be unlocked.  The N4 and N5 area that is served by the chambers serves a population of 650,000.  That is 14% of the population.  There are 100,000 people living within 5 km of the N4.  That provides an ideal opportunity for a development corridor, which would take the pressure off the east coast and the greater Dublin area.</p>  <p>  We ask the committee today to consider five objectives and to include them in the review of the capital programme which is currently under way.  We call for the completion of all pre-construction works, namely, the design and CPO works, in order that construction of the remainder of the N4 motorway from Mullingar to Roosky will commence by 2021.  We also seek completion of all the planning and pre-construction work leading to the commencement of the construction of the N4 Dromod-to-Carrick-on-Shannon bypass by 2021.  We are looking for construction on the N5 from Scramoge to Ballaghaderreen to commence in 2018 and be completed by 2021.  That would also provide extra access to the international airport at Knock.</p>  <p>  We wish to confirm that construction will commence on the N4 from Collooney to Castlebaldwin in 2018 and be completed by 2020.  A safety issue has arisen in that regard.  Similarly, we seek that construction on the N5 from Westport to Turlough will commence in 2018 and be completed by 2021.</p> <p>I will now hand over to Dr. Brian McCann.</p></speech>

I have responsibility there particularly as programme co-ordinator for the postgraduate degree in road and transport engineering.</p>  <p>  I am also a member of the Atlantic Economic Corridor Infrastructure Committee and the Industrial Committee of Sligo Chamber of Commerce.  Through being involved in those studies, I have researched and produced some information on the expenditure and infrastructure requirements for the Atlantic Corridor but also for the north west, and the need for an expansion of our infrastructure to improve business, community and tourism.  </p>  <p>  One of the key priorities is to focus on the improvement and upgrading of capacity, safety and journey times of the radial national network to which Mr. Butler alluded.  The north, west and north midlands have a population of 650,000.  That region, therefore, comprises 14% of the country's total population, yet it is served by only one corridor - the N4 and N5.  After Mullingar, those routes are a sub-standard, deficient, single carriageway.  There is a motorway as far as Mullingar and the M6 to Galway.  After Mullingar, however, the road is sub-standard in terms of capacity, alignment and safety record.  Part of that route has been put on a pre-construction and pre-planning phase at the moment.  The design and tendering process is coming up this year.  We have alluded to those matters in the last three projects under the heading of key priorities.  </p>  <p>  The first two projects are the first and second priorities due to the fact that we need a safe, consistent and efficient road network to service that region.  It needs to be safe as well as reducing journey times, and fitting the potential capacity which is now above the road's current capacity.</p>  <p>  As it leaves Dublin at the M50, the M4 is initially a three-plus-three dual carriageway which then goes into a motorway.  The motorway has quite a high capacity of more than 50,000.  There are about 42,000 vehicles leaving west of Maynooth.  Quite quickly, at Kinnegad it diverges towards the M6.  We have an extension of a motorway which was an old high-quality dual carriageway that has been upgraded.  It now provides a motorway just short of Mullingar. </p>  <p>  While we have a dual carriageway taking us around Mullingar, beyond the town we only have a single carriageway, apart from a short section from Rooskey to Dromod, which is a type 2 dual carriageway.  The latter road has additional capacity as well as a much improved safety record in terms of its ability to reduce head-on collisions and particularly overtaking accidents and collisions.  According to statistics from Transport Infrastructure Ireland we know that such collisions on our national roads network are particularly poor on stretches of the N4 and N5.  A number of those sections have twice the number of expected accidents.  It also has a potential to create additional congestion.  In fact, at times it is very heavily congested.</p>  <p>  For example, around the village of Rathowen there are flows as high as 13,000 vehicles per day, according to current figures.  The road is a type 1 single carriageway with a capacity of 11,600.  That road is therefore already 10% over capacity.  There is a growth in transport and population in the north west which is similarly to the national figure of 3% or 4%.  We expect future growth due to other factors such as Brexit and increased tourism.  Betters routes and shorter travel times have the potential for increased business and commerce.</p>  <p>  Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, has also identified the safety record of roads which have a potential for additional accidents due to over-capacity.  TII has identified the routes between Westport and Turlough on the N5, and Castlebaldwin to Collooney.  They have relatively low flows compared to the Dublin end of the N4, but also have particularly poor safety records.  Those roads are well over capacity in many cases.  We would like to see those road improvements being progressed to construction stage.  From our studies with the groups I am involved with, we have discovered that those projects should go to tender this year.  They should go to construction next year and it is essential that that happens.</p>  <p>  The policy that should inform the transport sector comes from the Government's own transport infrastructure policy developed in 2015.  A document entitled Our Transport Future: Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport was done in consultation with all stakeholders across the country to try to determine how best to inform funding for the national planning framework and the capital expenditure plan.  That document was published in August 2015 and contained a number of high-level findings and priorities.  The first was that current funding levels are not sufficient to maintain the existing land transport network across the country.  The document also said that we need to invest more to maximise the contribution of land transport to our country's national development by enhancing the efficiency of the network.</p>  <p>  The third priority is to provide road access to poorly served regions.  That is current Government policy as contained in the Department's own infrastructure report on investment in land transport.  The document also sought to support identified national and regional spatial planning priorities.  The national planning framework has a regional focus.  While we can improve transport across the regions and thus provide business opportunities, the radial network must be completed.  The most efficient one I have discovered is the N4-N5 route to the north west and north midlands.  Unless that is done, we will certainly have a poorly served region which will be further inhibited by a lack of access to necessary public services.  In addition, there will be a lack of access for tourism with a consequent negative effect on business promotion in the region.</p>  <p>  The Government's own report has identified such development as a priority for safety and infrastructural investment.  Engineers Ireland has also identified high quality infrastructure as an important element of modern society, strengthening economic growth and underpinning social cohesion.  </p>  <p>  Congestion and pollution is occurring in the south east and the greater Dublin area.  We feel there is a lot of potential for businesses to relocate to, and new businesses to set up in, the north west if they have the proper infrastructure, shorter journey times and safer roads.  People who want to move to those areas feel that the level of isolation needs to be reduced by having shorter journey times.  They would thus be closer to services, including new centres of excellence in education and health.  These matters are important for the general public.</p>  <p>  Our recommendations are for the radial primary route network from Dublin to be completed with the deficient N4 and N5 upgraded to dual carriageway status by an extension of the M4 from Mullingar to Longford.  That project has effectively been suspended, although it was in the national development plan.  A key part of the national spatial strategy was to develop that radial network.  We feel it is now time to put that back in the capital expenditure plan and to extend the current motorway just short of Mullingar right through to Longford.  </p>  <p>  The N5 branches off a Longford, so we need an appropriate dual carriageway road type for all proposed road schemes.  That is the proposal but it needs to be done by a type 1 or type 2 road right through to Longford, Sligo and Westport.  That will help to improve the safety and efficiency of transit for the population, tourism and business in the region and the wider economy.</p> <p>We do not know what will happen in the aftermath of Brexit.  However, there is likely to be a transfer of traffic from the N2 and N3, which currently serve Donegal, for example, through the North.  There will be two Border crossings required as a result.  That traffic is likely to transfer to the N4, which is a route that does not involve crossing the Border.  The Border will be an EU frontier following Brexit.  We do not know what is likely to happen regarding other factors but there will be some transfer of traffic.  The current figures and the projected figures up to 2030 are likely to increase following Brexit.  People in both south and north Donegal are likely to use the N4 as their main route.</p></speech>

I am also president of the IBEC regional executive committee for the midlands, which represents business from counties Laois, Longford, Offaly, and Westmeath.  I am present to support the N4-N5 joint affiliated chambers in highlighting the infrastructure deficit along the N4 route through the midlands into the north west and to share a business perspective.</p>  <p>  The national planning framework and mid-term review of the capital investment plan present opportunities to advance the regional policy agenda and achieve more balanced regional development.  In line with IDA Ireland's strategic plan, it makes economic sense to invest wisely now in the region's road network in order to allow businesses to create more jobs locally and to secure future growth.  Ambitious investment is central to creating a positive brand for the region and is a key catalyst in the context of attracting and retaining foreign direct investment, FDI, there.</p>  <p>  With regard to the key for business in decision-making in the context of FDI, infrastructure was ranked first in a recent US survey.  It is a key decision factor in locating businesses.  I work closely with IDA Ireland and recently people have visited our site in Longford.  Discussions always focus on the infrastructure in the area and access to talent.  These are the top of the agenda items for these decision makers and they go hand in hand.  Balanced regional development will also create a much better brand for the region.  There is a major deficit in the brand of the midlands and north-west regions.  This goes hand in hand with the infrastructure we are asking to be prioritised in the capital expenditure review to attract talent to these regions and to built their brands.  Without that, people will not relocate and support the FDI opportunities or even indigenous companies to drive talent into these regions.  We recently hired a number of people from around the country.  They are engineers and science graduates who are originally from the midlands and north-west regions and they wanted to return.  Having been born and reared there, they went to college and began their careers in the south west, Dublin and Galway but they wanted to return to the midlands.  There is value there and there is a proposition for us to build on in this regard but we need this infrastructure to realise the potential of the region.  The key decision factor is linked to infrastructure and access to airports and ports.  As my colleagues said, this is the only missing link and deficit in the radial network that needs to be addressed to close that gap.</p>  <p>  Tourism also goes hand in hand with this, although it is a different topic.  Infrastructure will enable the region to maximise its tourism potential into the future.  By doing that, it will be tied to the brand of the region and will bring more jobs to the region.  That will build momentum, which can be used to leverage the brand for the region and attract talent.  This is all interconnected and we need to keep these factors in mind when decisions are made for the capital expenditure review.</p></speech>

Some are involved in industry and Sligo Institute of Technology.  I thank them for their detailed briefing and not only today's.  I attended a briefing they gave in Buswells Hotel prior to Christmas.  I am familiar with the scene in Mayo, in particular, and the obstacles to industry provided by the lack of infrastructure but the more I read the figures presented by the delegation and the more I looked into the issue, I concluded that a collaborative approach was needed.  This infrastructure is vital for the west, north west and the midlands.  Deputy Troy and I pushed hard to get the delegation before the committee because, as Mr. Corcoran mentioned, the review of the capital programme is under way.  The Mullingar to Rooskey section was removed from the previous capital programme in 2008.  The Celtic tiger was on its way to Mullingar but never got past it.  This is a no-brainer.  Colleagues in various parties support this.  The Brexit negotiations are about to begin.  There is an economic recovery but one side of Ireland could be choked and the other cut off if action is not taken.  This project affects a number of regions and could unlock their potential.  The Government's aim is to have a greater percentage of the jobs created under the most recent Action Plan for Jobs go to the regions and this is a way of doing that.</p>  <p>  I have three questions.  From an industry point of view, will the witnesses explain the disadvantages they are at currently, and will be at as the years go by?  Even if the project was prioritised in the capital programme, it would be years before it is delivered.  What would be the positive effects if the roads in the various regions were upgraded?</p>  <p>  Mr. Corcoran referred to the implications from a business perspective.  When I read the word "talent" in the submission, I was wondering what was meant by that.  Does it mean the highly-qualified people from these regions will be able to get jobs in them if this project goes ahead?</p></speech>

Jobs are not always specific.  When businesses expand or when companies come in using FDI, a jobs spread is needed across them in various departments.  It is scientific, supply chain and financial talent while automation and various other skill sets are required.</p> <p>Attracting those people to the region is the one big factor we need to watch.  It is always top of the agenda whenever we are discussing the next investment in the businesses.  We need to be able to show there is a pool of talent in the area and in the country that will come to the area.  This is what we are really trying to grasp here and focus on.</p> <p> We may have a unique situation along the N4 with the National University of Ireland Maynooth and the Athlone, Sligo and Letterkenny institutes of technology.  We have a channel of universities there.  In my experience, Athlone Institute of Technology and NUI Maynooth are very engaged and want to support us.  They really want to have their graduates working in that region.  Given the institutions' locations, many of the graduates come from the north west and midlands areas and they would like to get through college and then relocate back to those regions.  We need to provide the opportunity for those people.  The Government's recent Ireland Connected strategy talks about raising the college numbers and providing the talent for the future.  I see this as a key enabler towards meeting that strategy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-03a.211" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Carty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017050300006#F00300"><p>On the problems associated with manufacturing and the service industry, there are two ways of looking at it.  There are tangible problems such as, for example, most goods today need to move on time.  In other words, goods are coming in and they are wanted today.  One does not hold stocks anymore and it is important that goods get there on time.  One problem with coming down these roads is that coming out of Dublin and heading west up to Ballina or Sligo through the midlands, a person will encounter a 40 or 50-mile stretch with a 120 km/h speed limit while the rest of the way, one is limited to 100 km/h.  If a driver is lucky, he or she would get to travel at 80 km/h.  I was coming to Dublin last week and outside Roosky I was confronted by four vans travelling in front of me.  It took me an age to get to Longford and I was so frustrated that I stopped for a cup of coffee.  It is important that everything moves quickly and is not held up.  The reality of this situation is that transport costs go up because one is then paying for the time; the poorer the state of the road the more expensive the transport costs.  Depending on the nature of the product, transport costs can be as much as 20% of the product cost and manufacturers are paying to have their goods sitting on the road.</p>  <p>  The other side of the situation concerns the intangible - Mr. Corcoran alluded to it - where we have multinational companies and their executives coming with IDA Ireland to visit areas.  If an investor arrives to Dublin and then has to travel to Ballina or Sligo, it is not a pretty journey.  These people are obsessed with getting down a motorway; it is what they are used to in the US with their highways.  The problem is they will come and have a look and one of their first comments is, "The roads here are terrible, it took so long to get here".  Over the years I have met many people who have said this and once we hear that, we can forget about it.  They are not going to come back.  Worse still is when they head back to their cars, go to Dublin and the next day they may head for Galway or Limerick and have a lovely spin down.  Once they go down either of those routes it is "Adios" and we will not see those guys back.  This situation debilitates against the regions.  This is a vast expanse of region as far as Letterkenny, down to Sligo, across to Ballina and Castlebar, down to Ballaghaderreen, Longford and Athlone.  Those people are all being impacted by the state of that road.  It is deficient.  Those whole areas in the west were dealt a bad hand in the last decade.  Obviously, other areas had been a priority and by the time it was getting around to the north west things changed.  There is a deficiency there that needs to be redressed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-03a.212" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brian McCann" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017050300006#F00400"><p>Members asked about the positives if the infrastructure is provided.  I believe it is not only towards business and industry, as Mr. Carty and Mr. Corcoran have mentioned.  If we cannot transport our goods and people to and from industry quickly, efficiently and safely, it has a major inhibiting effect on both investors and in expansion and in trying to hire people who can do jobs for the various industries that are set up.  There is also an issue around public services.  It affects everybody.  If we do not have proper infrastructure then we do not get good access to public services within the area, which can present a safety issue.  This access issue especially affects access to education.  There is public transport but it is very limited.  Access for tourists to the Wild Atlantic Way, which is a very strong brand, is also an issue.  We want to increase the potential of the region for industry, tourism, agriculture and community generally.  We need to have good infrastructure for good living standards for the community; it goes hand in hand.</p>  <p>  I have been living in Sligo for 20 years and it was mentioned to me once that the north west is isolated.  It is where it is and we cannot do anything about that.  It is isolated but isolation is only about the length of time it takes to get there.  We no longer look at the distances, we look at the time it takes.  People look at Google Maps to see how long it would take to get to Sligo, for example, using a particular route.  It is very important that we make the journeys efficient and more consistent.</p>  <p>  We must also remember that these roads are part of the strategic road network in Ireland.  The strategic road network for the country has been identified not only by the Trans-European Transport Network of the European Union, but also by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It is part of the national primary roads network and it must have those consistencies.  Obviously a lot of that national network is motorway, which provides very little hindrance to travel and where there are no added junctions or intersections and no access roads.  Not only do we not have a motorway, but we are two or three steps below that level with most of the N4 and N5, where there is direct access onto the roads, there are no hard shoulders and there is poor alignment and visibility.  We really need to bring our infrastructure up to date and up to a consistent level right across the country.  It is imperative.  It will have a knock-on effect for everybody and it would mean that the region would not be as isolated.  It would also, hopefully, reduce the congestion and pollution that is occurring in the Dublin region.</p></speech>

It is a major issue for us as public representatives in the north west.  As an Oireachtas Member for the Sligo-Leitrim constituency, which covers Sligo, Carrick-on-Shannon and all the other areas that were mentioned, I was very interested to hear the points raised by Dr. McCann.  I have, on a number of past occasions, listened to his presentations on the need for this upgrade and about the statistics attached to the issue.</p>  <p>  I have met with the Chamber of Commerce in Sligo several times.  I welcome to the Public Gallery Mr. Aidan Doyle from the chamber, which supports the business improvement districts and industry in Sligo.  I also welcome Mr. Bill Carty, who had a long association as a senior executive with Abbott Diagnostics.  This issue has been a huge contributing factor over the years where we have a deficit for jobs and infrastructure in our area.  We talk about the Wild Atlantic Way, which is brilliant and it was referred to here in respect of tourism, jobs and safety.  We do not have any of those provisions with the N4 or N5 and I travel that road on an almost daily basis as do my colleagues.  People have said to me, and it was outlined by Dr. McCann and by Mr. Carty, that IDA Ireland has had executives from various parts of the country and worldwide in Sligo and the north-west area looking at potential sites and areas in which to invest. </p> <p>Unfortunately, they find the sight of so many white crosses on the roadsides between Collooney and Castlebaldwin very off-putting.  Many fatalities have occurred on this stretch of road, on which works are under way.</p> <p> There is a major deficit in roads infrastructure outside Dublin.  I have travelled all over the country and the area west of Mullingar has not received infrastructural investment comparable to that which has been provided in the east.  Money has not been spent on the roads from Mullingar to Sligo, which are second rate.  I appeal to members, when assessing the outcome of this meeting, to look favourably on the case for providing funding for the N4 and N5 roads projects, perhaps on a joint basis.</p> <p> I am making a cry for help.  Only recently, I met a delegation from all the chambers of commerce in counties Westmeath, Sligo, Leitrim and Longford.  We seek a fair crack of the whip and a fair share of funding to upgrade infrastructure.  While the Wild Atlantic Way has been a major success, business people tell me that time is money.  Many industry leaders have informed me that the west is losing business and jobs because we do not have vital road infrastructure to Dublin and other ports.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-03a.215" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017050300007#G00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  It is great to see chambers of commerce from areas near the N4 and N5 coming together and taking a proactive approach to this issue.  As Senator O'Mahony stated, since we met the group in Buswells Hotel before Christmas, both he and I as well as other members of the committee have repeatedly raised the plight of businesses in the area and the need to invite a delegation to address the committee and make a strong and compelling case for the upgrade of the N4 and N5 roads.  The witnesses made such a case this morning.  While it would be great if the committee had the power to advance or sanction the project, unfortunately not the case.  The witnesses have, however, given us the ammunition to make a compelling case to the Minister on this issue.</p>  <p>  In recent years, investment in roads has been at an all time low.  Despite rapid population growth, Ireland has the second lowest level of capital expenditure on infrastructure in Europe.  Earlier this year, IBEC noted that between 90% and 95% of capital expenditure on roads is being spent on maintenance rather than building critical infrastructure.  The time is right for the witnesses to make a case for this investment as the review of the capital expenditure programme is under way.</p>  <p>  The witnesses referred to the three most important issues.  We spoke at length in recent weeks about road safety.  There is no doubt that as traffic on the N4 increased, the number of fatalities also increased.  Last year, for the first time, progress made in reducing the number of fatalities was reversed.  Sustainable regional development is also critical to the organisations represented today.  As a previous speaker noted, when a company is considering making an investment in a region, infrastructure is always the first consideration.  While the road to Mullingar is either motorway or dual carriageway, the further one travels west from Mullingar, the harder it becomes to attract investment.  We, as public representatives, continually make a case for IDA Ireland to bring more companies to County Longford and the west.  The State has a responsibility to develop the infrastructure needed to ensure the west is attractive as a location for inward investment.</p>  <p>  On the issue of access to talent, we are fortunate to have institutes of technology in Athlone, Sligo and Letterkenny and a university in Maynooth.  All these institutions are located along the M4-N4 corridor.  A motorway or dual carriageway would open access to educational facilities and the Wild Atlantic Way.</p>  <p>  The witnesses are pushing an open door as far as the committee is concerned.  We will bring to bear whatever political pressure we can on the Minister to include this section of road in the review of the capital plan.  Did the chambers of commerce make a formal submission to the review of the capital plan?</p>  <p>  Reference was made to various sections of the road, including Mullingar to Longford and Longford to Rooskey.  Is a specific section of the route considered a priority?  The group is collaborative in nature and represents the entire north-west region.  Does it have a preference as to which section of the route should be completed first?  The route for the section of the M4 between Mullingar and Longford in my constituency has been identified.  Has the route been identified beyond Longford? </p>  <p>   We constantly hear about the limited capital envelope available for investment.  I have pointed out to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, a number of times that the European Commission has established the European Fund for Strategic Investment, which is better known as the Juncker fund, under which &euro;500 billion has been made available to all member states to borrow at very low interest rates for investment in much needed infrastructure.  We should avail of this fund because we are not making enough use of it.  Other countries with high levels of national debt, for example, Italy, are using it.  Loans are made available provided the member state can demonstrate that the money will be invested in critical infrastructure.</p>  <p>  I thank the witnesses again for making such a compelling case, which strengthens our position.  Members will do everything in their power to bring pressure to bear on the relevant Minister.</p></speech>

Between the three areas, submissions were prepared for the overall IBEC submission to the national planning framework.  The document highlighted the priorities for items such as infrastructure.  The priority in all of the regions was the infrastructure needs in the various areas.  However, the alignment was between the north west, midlands and west in terms of the N4 Sligo to Dublin corridor, N5 Westport to Longford route and the N4 Sligo to Dublin route in the midlands.  Once the submissions were produced, we routed them through the regional executive committee in IBEC.  I understand some of the councils also made submissions.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the presence of the cathaoirleach of Longford County Council, Councillor Mick Cahill, and two directors of services from the council, Mr. John Brannigan and Ms Barbara Heslin.  We partnered on this issue and the number one issue in our submission was the N4 from the Leitrim border to Mullingar.</p> <p>As Deputy Troy knows, the route was selected over nine years ago.  We have a frozen development corridor.  This is not virgin territory.  One cannot build so much as a hay shed in that designated corridor.  It is extremely difficult to dispose of property.  The corridor has been frozen for over nine years.  The next step is ready to go, and the area is crying out for it.  We are making a case for the whole region, but this is the one key piece of infrastructure, the missing link, from which everybody west on the N5 seeking to come to the east coast, and everybody north of Longford up to the Leitrim border on the N4 seeking to go to the capital, will benefit.  We understand the Collooney-Castlebaldwin and Turlough-Westport roads will go ahead in 2018, but this is the one that, if it can be brought forward, will have an immediate benefit to the region.</p> <p> I am an exporter, and exporters often have overseas visitors.  I ask the committee to think of the advantage of being able to collect someone in Dublin Airport who wants to purchase one's goods or services and deliver them all the way down into the midlands by motorway or dual carriageway.  It is a massive advantage.  As Mr. Corcoran said, in a survey of US foreign direct investors, the key, number one item they mentioned was a highway.  Until the past 18 months or two years, during which time I admit things have improved, Longford was the one county in the country without a foreign direct investment visit by IDA Ireland for a large number of years - five years or more.  I ask the committee to think of the game-changer this could make for a county such as Longford.  The mantra going out was that we are not suitable for foreign direct investment.  Why is Abbott expanding in Longford if we are not suitable for foreign direct investment?  We are an asset.  We come up to Dublin and it is congested, it is very difficult to get accommodation and it is very difficult even to get in certain areas the suitable industrial space.  If one travels just an hour down the country, the north midlands and the north west are open, and that is where it lies.</p> <p> I appreciate the hearing we are getting today.  I know the committee can only make recommendations to the Minister but I ask it to give us something to bring back to our members so we can at least say that the committee will make a very strong recommendation on our requests.  We need to bring something back to our members.</p></speech>

We have listed what we feel are the priorities, the top one being the Mullingar-Roosky road, which impacts every traveller on that route and every vehicle and person using it.  That is the number one priority because it has the largest need.  Deputy Troy asked about the timescale.  Unfortunately, it is also the one that has been off the table for so long, and it needs to be put back on the table.  It needs to go through the pre-planning, consultation, design and tendering stages, which may not commence until 2021.</p>  <p>  The second priority is the Dromod to Carrick-on-Shannon road.  The Roosky bypass is great.  Any dual carriageway is better that any single carriageway.  It does not matter how wide the single carriageway is - dual carriageways are much safer and provide overtaking opportunities and less congestion, and travel times are more predictable.  Predictability of travel times is needed for industry.  The route between Dromod and Carrick-on-Shannon goes through Carrick-on-Shannon.  That is the only major town on the route that is traversed, so there is a real need for a bypass around Carrick-on-Shannon as well to try to reduce the journey times to the north west particularly.  The other three projects are on the table and we hope they will progress.  They not only represent safety issues, but the roads are also congested.</p>  <p>  Another point to make is that the Minister yesterday, I think, stated that a report will come out soon that will verify the figures, but the cost to the economy of the congestion in the Dublin region is &euro;350 million per annum at present.  That is constant through health, lost travel time, lost work time, pollution and other aspects.  It is likely to rise to &euro;2 billion per annum by 2033.  These are figures the Department is now producing in a report that will examine the implications of the congestion we have in the greater Dublin area.  It is all the more important, therefore, that one of the regions adjacent to Dublin and beyond into the north west is provided with better infrastructural services and facilities.</p></speech>

I welcome everybody from the different organisations.  I thank Mr. Butler, Dr. McCann, Mr. Corcoran and Mr. Carty, whom I know quite well from Sligo.  Mr. Butler referenced Abbott Ireland.  Not alone does it have operations in Longford, but we have Abbott companies in Sligo which contribute massively to the economy of the area and employ I do not know how many people in total, certainly well into the hundreds or thousands anyway.  It is massive when one thinks about it.  They employ people from the surrounding areas of Sligo, not just Sligo town, including Ballymote, Collooney and Tubercurry.</p>  <p>  In support of what has been requested today, I have met quite recently IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, and they say there is no question but that the major issue in trying to get companies to the north west, particularly to Sligo, is the road.  We do not have an airport as we did before, which made it easier for people - company managers and directors - to consider Sligo as an option when one could fly in and fly out.  Now all we have is the road.  It is a very poor road.  I am glad that the Casltebaldwin stretch from Castlebaldwin to Sligo, which is a 12 km part of the road, was enforced.  We all hope that will be started next year, and we are told it will.  When one considers that 27 people were killed on that stretch of road of 12 km - 27 fatalities over the past few years - I hope this will help in some small way.</p>  <p>  I understand the Mullingar to Roosky route has been selected.  I know how this work takes place and all the controversy, the problems and everything else it creates for local authorities and council members, but it is good to know that it has been selected.  Over the past year particularly, there have been quite a number of launches of development plans and so on, but what we really and truly need is a commitment.  This road will have to be done in stages.  I am talking about the N4 mostly now; the N5 is another issue.  What we need is a commitment to go to stage one.  We need a road plan - excuse the pun - of where we are going.  Even if the Minister said tomorrow morning that the Department will complete the N4 from Mullingar to Roosky, we are looking at six or seven years before we get near the road, quite honestly, when all the preparatory works are carried out.  If we are serious about regional development and if we are to have any hope in the north west, it is crucial that this commitment be given.  Even if a commitment were given to begin work on the road, even if it were next year or the year after, it will still take quite a long time to get to the stage at which advanced work is carried out on the road.  What we need is that commitment so that we can say to people who are planning on investing, hopefully, in the north west that it will start, that a programme is in place and that it will be completed.  That is crucial.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt about it: Dublin is bursting at the seams.  People cannot live here because they cannot afford the accommodation.  There are people I know commuting from Longford and from Carrick-on-Shannon to Dublin.  That is very unfair on those people and their families, so it is crucial that the commitment be given.  All we want is a commitment that this road will start at a particular time, that the process will be started and that, once started, it will be finished eventually.</p> <p>Whatever I can do to support what is being done here, I will do. </p> <p> I apologise on behalf of Deputy Eugene Murphy who cannot be here this morning.</p></speech>

I am not a member of the committee but I am deputising for Deputy Imelda Munster.</p>  <p>  I welcome everyone from all the chambers across the north west, the midlands and down into Mayo who are here to convey a simple message.  It is a region that has been left behind because of an infrastructural deficit.  All of Ireland has a difficulty in that we are well below par as a developed country in our level of infrastructural spending.  That is a general comment and it would be recognised internationally.  It is something we need to address.  It is widely known that if there is activity it creates opportunity and that opportunity creates more activity and so the spiral goes upwards.  The difficulty for the vast number of people living in the north west is that the spiral has either stopped or started going in the opposite direction, going downward.  In order to arrest that, we need investment from Government.  It is often said that we can only spend what we have got, that the economy is like a household budget.  That is not true.  The reality is that when money is invested into an economy and into infrastructure such as this, it has a return or a pay back and that pay back in the long term is often better than what was put in.  Even looking at the short term, road building might not be the best example but it is an example.  If we spend &euro;100 million, the activity that creates through taxation, through income tax, through VAT and so on, there could be a 40% return on that &euro;100 million in the first year.  It is not really a spend of &euro;100 million.  There is also the additional activity created on the outskirts which creates more, because all the people who go to work on the road will buy their diesel and petrol and go for sandwiches.  They are living and creating economic activity in their local economy.</p>  <p>  Government investment in infrastructure of this nature is not a cost.  It is an investment and one which has a return which is much greater than the cost.  This is one of the big things missing from this conversation.  The north west brings to mind Sligo, Yeats country, surfing, Donegal, Carrick-on-Shannon and boating on the Shannon; there is all this tourism in those areas, but to this one can add the opportunities for economic development.  Recently, I was speaking to a senior manager in a company in Britain.  They were considering moving some of their manufacturing because of Brexit.  This person had a connection with Leitrim and was talking about trying to convince their company to move some of the production to the north west.  The problem they hit against was the travel time of their product to the port.  They said they would really like to do it but we want to be near Dublin so that we can be near the port.  That was the immediate obstacle they had to overcome.  That is not an obstacle put in place by the people who live in the north west, but by under-investment for many years.  To turn that around, not only do we need to put the investment in, but we need to emphasise the positives of the region.  The production economics in an area which has a lower cost of living, lower rents, a greater quality of life and, though it might seem airy-fairy, a happier workforce because of those things, are things that cannot be bought.  It cannot be measured in a metric by economists but makes a real difference to people's lives, the 14% of Irish people, some 650,000 people of that region.  For quite a small investment by Government, although it might seem like a lot of money, we could make the north west and the west into a region that will pay huge dividends and contribute greatly to the overall economic advancement of the country.  As my colleagues noted earlier, access to that capital is there at a very low interest rate.  </p>  <p>  The argument the witnesses have put forward today is welcome and is pushing an open door.  Representatives from all parties would say that.  Our difficulty is trying to convince the Minister who unfortunately has not been open for this to happen.  We welcome that they have strengthened our hand in this and do what we can to raise it with the Minister, the Taoiseach or the Government.  We have a Taoiseach from the west and before he relinquishes his responsibilities as Taoiseach, maybe it would be one of his priorities.  It would be very welcome if he did that.  Maybe we could put that to him on his return from Canada.  </p>  <p>  Between the presentations and the questions which have been asked already, I have no questions to ask and there is nothing else to be said except that the big issue is about convincing Government that this is not a cost it is an investment which will have a return. The witnesses have done a good job on that and I thank them for coming here and making that clear. </p></speech>

Above any group which has come before us, there is a unanimous approach from its side and from ours.  It has been pointed out already that the committee cannot allocate funding, but what I hope to do, along with Deputy Troy and other members is that we, as a committee, would make a recommendation to the Minister that this be right on the top of the capital review.  We have all the facts and figures here now.  I will propose that and while I cannot speak for the whole committee I can speak for many of them.  I hope that we can do that and advance it in every way we can.  We can talk about providing jobs and so on but we need the infrastructure to ensure they are distributed to the regions.  There are other projects that other members of the committee will push too, but both members and non-members will push this, firstly at the committee.  Every little helps.</p></speech>

For clarity, how much is needed to get the project off the ground over the years?  Would it be a couple of million?</p></speech>

That will cost around &euro;5 million.  That is the initial stage over the next year or two.  The aim would be to go into construction in 2021 and be completed in 2023.  As Deputy Scanlon said, that is six years.  We have to get it off the ground and onto the capital programme.  Longford County Council met with TII in December 2016.  They more or less said that they could not open a file or sharpen a pencil on the N4 section unless it gets onto the capital programme.  That is what we are asking for here.</p></speech>

We appreciate the support from all parties.  We are apolitical here.  We took the approach that this will benefit everyone in the region.  If it is possible to get that over the board and convince the Minister, we will have done a good day's work today.</p></speech>

That is a factor in the context of investment.  How can it be overcome?  There are huge volumes of traffic into other parts of the country.  I am not a member of this committee but I am a Member of the Oireachtas and I represent the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, which includes parts of Donegal and Cavan.  My biggest concern is in regard to the southern end of the country, particularly when I hear people talking about a Cork to Limerick road and various other places.  We have an obligation here.  In the aftermath of the presentations that have been made here this morning, we must do whatever we can to improve the situation in the west, the north west and the north midlands.  Can Dr. McCann say how we can reverse the shortfall compared to the south of the country?  We will not get the volumes that there are in other parts of the country.  Mr. McCann mentioned figures, perhaps per day, on some routes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-03a.230" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brian McCann" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017050300010#K00200"><p>Relative to the capacity of the type of road that is there, volumes are over capacity.  There is a very good document from Transport Infrastructure Ireland, National Road Network Indicators 2016, the most recent version of which contains a lot of schematics, tables and diagrams showing the infrastructure and its various aspects and attributes.  One of the aspects which can be seen very clearly in terms of volume-to-capacity ratio is that many parts of the N4, including the section from Castlebaldwin to Collooney, and the section of the N5 from Turlough to Westport are far over capacity.  They are above 120% of capacity.  There are 12,500 vehicles per day coming through Castlebar.  In most places, that route is a type 2 road with a capacity of only 8,600.  Similarly, the Collooney to Castlebaldwin road is not a type 1 carriageway or dual carriageway.  There are no hard shoulders on the majority of it.  Its capacity is only just over 8,000.  The traffic on that road is well over 10,000 vehicles per day in many parts.  There are similar problems and a major bottleneck at Carrick-on-Shannon, where the road goes through the town and is really a relief road.  One has to look at the individual route and whether it is safe and within capacity.  If it is over capacity, not only does that mean that congestion causes issues with travel times but it also makes it very unsafe because people try to overtake in locations where they ought not, which leads to many accidents.  The Dromod to Roosky bypass, which was upgraded a number of years ago, is much safer and has a higher capacity of approximately 20,000 vehicles per day.  That section is likely to be the type of dual carriageway that will be put in place between Castlebaldwin and Collooney.  It will allow for expansion, ease of access, better overtaking and increased safety.</p>  <p>  The N4 is a national primary road and an arterial route for the whole country to the north west, the west, and the north midlands.  It services a very large region.  The amount of traffic is constricted by the poor quality of the road.  If there were a wider road, it is likely that there would be more ease of access and that might lead to an increase in tourism.  The nearest access to the Wild Atlantic Way from Dublin, the main centre of population, and any traffic that comes from the UK to visit the west of Ireland is to travel along the N4.  To give access to that facility, our businesses and potential sites that we have earmarked, there needs to be an improvement in the road.  IDA Ireland is trying to develop and encourage foreign direct investment but it is hindered by the fact that the route is substandard and unsafe.   Obviously, other regions and other Deputies will argue that other locations need investment and they may have good points but it is important to put the main strategic road network first.  In the region that all the witnesses represent, the road network is the only network.  There are alternatives for those going to parts of the country such as the south and the south west and the road network from Dublin to the main centres of population at least is of good quality but the same cannot be said of the N4 or N5.</p></speech>

In the same period, the figure for the north west and the midlands combined was less than 1,000.  That is the scale of the gap which is there.</p></speech>

The consultation period was gone through in the mid-2000s and therefore it is selected.  It is next to move to design and compulsory purchase order.  That is what we are specifically asking for.  That is relatively low expenditure.  It is not getting into the main capital expenditure, which is why it is a low-hanging fruit that can be picked without committing a large amount.  Hopefully, as the economy improves, funding will be there for the capital investment.</p></speech>

In average peak weekday traffic, it would be a three-hour journey to Sligo.  If there were a motorway the whole way, that could be reduced by at least 30 minutes.  Galway to Dublin is a longer journey than Sligo to Dublin by the current route.  In terms of travel time, however, it takes just over two hours to get from Galway to Dublin.</p></speech>

We did not have the M7 from Portlaoise to Adare until 2010.  The one thing that always struck me while travelling the regular single-lane route was the number of crosses and headstones along the old N7.  It was absolutely frightening.  It is now a nice journey because one gets on the motorway and off one goes.  I very much feel the witnesses' pain as once one gets to Adare, it will take at least another hour and a half to get to the Dingle peninsula.</p>  <p>  Looking at the figures compiled for the north west and the midlands in terms of investment and jobs, there is definitely a correlation between accessibility and reducing peripherality.  It is two-way traffic.  It opens up the jobs market of the east to people who are resident in that location and also potential investors encountering that lack of infrastructure totally diminishes an the opportunity for an area to get-----</p></speech>

Both Engineers Ireland in its state of infrastructure reports and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in its strategic investment plan for land transport have indicated the strong link between accessibility, investment and the economy.  One of the main priorities is that not only do we need to target poorly serviced areas, we also need to front-load the investment because of the lack of past expenditure.  As Deputy Troy mentioned, just over 1% of GDP is spent on infrastructure in this economy, which is much lower than the European average.  Therefore, there is a need to front-load investment to effectively complete the national development plan.</p></speech>

That is the context.  As I am from the centre of the western province, this is really the heart of the matter.  I was driving a car but a person driving a juggernaut could add another 30% to those times.</p></speech>

He mentioned Brexit in the context of the north west and the routes we have been discussing.  Does he foresee a possible increase in traffic volumes through Donegal from Northern Ireland to the north west?</p></speech>

There was a plan to strengthen the A5 and bring it through to the N2.  There is also the Cavan road going through Enniskillen to the south Donegal area.  Obviously, travel times could increase on those routes and restrictions could create delays for tourists and could detrimentally affect the economy of County Donegal.  Although this has not been measured and there is a need to study the impact in more detail, it is likely people will try to avoid the various tariffs and other factors that will be imposed-----</p></speech>

This is likely to have an impact on the N4.  Therefore, we are talking about a problem of increased traffic not just on the N4 but around Sligo and onwards into Donegal.  The whole length of the N4 will likely be the route of choice for many businesses and people who are travelling.</p></speech>

A proposal was made by Senator O'Mahony and seconded by Deputy Troy in regard to making a recommendation from the committee.  I acknowledge that Senator O'Mahony and Deputy Troy have been seeking this meeting for many months.  On behalf of the committee, I want to apologise as we have had a very busy schedule and it took some time to arrange this meeting.  It was not for the want of trying by the said members.  I am glad this meeting took place as it was useful in the context of the review of the capital plan.  I propose that the full transcript of today's meeting is sent to the Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport and Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>
