However, the proposed guests were not available.  Instead we have decided to invite other guests to discuss managing or containing back-to-school costs.  I welcome the representatives from CPMSA, the Church of Ireland, Educate Together, An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta, the IVEA and the joint managerial bodies.  I hope I have not left anybody out.</p> <p> I wish to draw the attention of the delegations to privilege.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her, them or it identifiable. </p><p> I invite the groups to make their presentations and I remind them to speak for a maximum of five minutes each.  I also remind them that we seek solutions and proposals rather than criticisms and that applies to the Members too.  The presentations shall be followed by a question and answer session.  We shall commence in the order that I read out earlier and I call on the representatives from the Catholic Primary School Management Association to make their presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-10a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eileen Flynn" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012101000004#C00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to make a presentation here.  As Members will know, the Catholic Primary School Management Association, CPSMA, represents the boards of management of 2,900 primary schools and provides a wide range of services to those schools.</p><p> The rising costs for parents whose children return to school in September is of major concern to us.  Primary schools are can-do places and have a good relationship with parents and work closely with them.  Issues of concern to parents are issues of concern to the boards of management.  As a brief backdrop to the issue, one cannot consider the problems faced by parents without putting them in context.  At present there is inadequate funding for primary schools so there is a direct correlation between funding for schools and costs borne by parents.  Many schools are chronically under funded and when they are short they must go to the parent population - their nearest port of call - to make up the shortfall.  I shall give a brief example.  The capitation grant for primary schools was reduced over the past three years by &euro;22 for pupils in a mainstream class and by &euro;100 for a special child in a mainstream class.  The way the capitation grant is paid also poses a problem for schools.  It is paid in two moieties - the first arrives in June and the next arrives the following February.  It is a bit like live horse and eat grass, one is left without a cashflow for that period each year.  </p><p>  A wonderful grant called the minor works grant - which we feel is under threat - used to arrive which gave a great cashflow opportunity to schools during the period when the capitation grant had well run out.  It allowed schools to survive until the second capitation grant moiety was paid the following February.  If one combines the capitation reduction and the potential loss of the minor works grant together one will find that a school of 100 pupils, which has five special needs pupils in mainstream education, will be down &euro;10,000 in total.  That is a significant drop in income in any school and where must the school turn to make that sum up, to the parents. </p><p>  Additionally, there are changes in schools because they are treated like businesses.  Therefore, they must pay charges for water, An Post and all of the usual utility bills for oil, heat, bin charges, fire certificates, fire alarm calls and their maintenance.  Schools are treated as a business but being able to claim what businesses can claim is not the same thing.  For example, schools cannot claim VAT expenses on purchases.  </p><p>  The CPSMA conducted a survey of its members to provide solutions - and that is what the committee asked for too - to issues that are of concern to parents.  The two biggest cost factors identified were uniforms and books.  It was suggested - and largely supported across the board - that parents should be allowed to buy uniforms in any main store and crests could be bought as a separate item thus enabling them to be sewed or stuck on and passed on to the next school jumper or cardigan that a pupil wears.  Bulk buying was another suggestion.  The notion of swapping uniforms and parents hosting recycling days for uniforms were also clearly indicated in responses received from parents as ways to cut costs.  Sometimes people promote the idea of having no uniform but the notion was not quite what we thought it would work out to be.  We asked about it but were told that it may seem attractive initially.  However, when the yearly cost of providing clothes instead of a uniform was examined one was faced with peer pressure.  Children wanted labels from high-end products sewn onto cheaper models and then they would wear them to school.  </p><p>  The next issue was books and book rental.  The vast majority of schools seem to have a book rental scheme in place.  Its set-up and maintenance costs are significant.  Schools must find the money to continue with such schemes.  It was suggested that publishers should bind their books properly thus ensuring that they last longer.  It was also suggested that publishers should be asked not to update their books on a regular basis and for schools to examine their book policy.  In other words, they should first ensure that there is a series of books available before making the decision to change.  Perhaps they should also examine alternative ways of teaching the curriculum so that schools are not so dependent on textbooks or workbooks but instead use visualisers that are available through grants from the Department of Education and Skills and so on.  Several suggestions were made along those lines.  </p><p>  The CPSMA has run procurement competitions.  Schools were asked to sign up for the procurement of gas, oil and other requisites with the National Procurement Service.  One school saved 40% because it joined a national procurement scheme to pay its bills.  We encourage schools to examine the measure outlined in order that they do not pass their financial pressures on to their parent population through seeking voluntary contributions or other fund-raising exercises.</p><p>   If schools can plan for what is required and spread it across the year then it might lighten the financial burden on parents.  Schools in certain locations may find it more difficult to fund-raise.  I hope that I have covered most of the issues.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-10a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ken Fennelly" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012101000004#C00400"><p>On behalf of the Church of Ireland private schools I thank the committee and the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to make a short presentation this morning.  I am the Secretary to the Church of Ireland's General Synod Board of Education which is the board within the church's structures that has responsibility for its education policy.  In that capacity the board represents the interests of the Church of Ireland in education and also provides an advisory service to the boards of management of Church of Ireland primary schools.  To some extent I shall echo what Ms Flynn has said.</p><p>  While schools under Presbyterian, Methodist or Quaker patronage have their own boards of education, the board also provides support and advice to those schools.  For the committee's information, there are ten bishops in the Church of Ireland who are patrons of their local diocesan Church of Ireland primary schools.  We also liaise and advise them closely.  </p><p>  The schools that I represent can be outlined as follows.  There are 200 Protestant primary schools in the State, 174 are Church of Ireland, 24 are Presbyterian and there is one that is Methodist and one is Quaker.  Fifty of the schools are located in Dublin and the remainder are dispersed across the country and many are in rural locations.</p><p>  In the course of this presentation I hope to describe the direct and indirect costs to parents that result from the costs of running schools.  I will echo what Ms Flynn has said.  The direct costs are items such as school books, art and stationery, materials, uniforms, costs associated with activities such as swimming and school tours, along with transport costs for those in rural areas.  The committee will be aware of the recent survey conducted by Barnardos which advised that it costs &euro;355 for a child to start junior infants and rises to &euro;390 per year thereafter.</p><p>  As Ms Flynn has said, school books are a significant cost for parents.  Many of our schools operate a school book rental scheme where the schools buy books and rent them out.  There is a cost incurred by the school but it is a good endeavour in the long run.  I wish to express our thanks to the Department of Education and Skills for its book rental scheme guidelines for schools that it issued recently as it has done so for the past couple of years.  Schools have told me that they find the guidelines useful.  I also thank the Minister for initiating a review of the operation of the school book scheme.  Again, schools have told me that they have also found it useful.  </p><p>  A major issue faced by parents living in rural areas is the provision and increase in the cost of school transport.  In 2011 a charge of &euro;50 per child for the provision of school transport was introduced and budget 2012 raised it to &euro;100 per child.  It constitutes a significant increase over a short period.  In 2011, changes to the eligibility criteria in respect of the retention of a school bus service has resulted in the loss, or projected loss, of a large number of school buses representing a significant hardship to the affected parents.  We are advised that the grant provided to parents in lieu of the provision of a school bus falls far short of the cost to provide a private bus, instead of the main bus, or to cover the cost of getting a child to school by alternative means.  There is also the cost of fuel.  The recent changes to the school transport scheme have inflicted an inequitable hardship on parents and children attending schools in rural areas.  This matter is of particular interest to the Protestant minority.</p> <p> As Ms Eileen Flynn stated, the practice in respect of school uniforms varies widely.  I am advised that many of our school have moved away from the idea of a special school uniform and now opt for generic clothing that can be purchased relatively cheaply from large retailers and the crest can be affixed later.  Some schools have moved from a school uniform entirely and boards tell me this is a conscious effort on their part to reduce costs for parents.  I am advised also that some of our schools operate a recycling shelf for school uniforms for children leaving and children coming in, which they found reduces costs considerably.  The supply of stationery, art equipment, bags, etc., constitute further direct costs for parents.  The current curriculum introduced in 1989 requires art resources.  The State does not provide additional funding for this.  In most of our schools, the parents' associations are the major supporter for financing these items.  The boards of management also rely on the parents' associations to support activities such as swimming or school trips.  Parents' associations are also experiencing the effects of the recession with fund raising becoming more difficult, as members will appreciate.  I am aware of at least one area of the country where school boards of management have been assisted by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in regard to funding school related activities.  School principals also advise me that they are conscious of giving plenty of notice to parents if they are planning a school trip.</p><p> While a child's back-to-schools needs may be reduced by cheaper uniforms and book rental schemes and so on, it is important to mention that these costs occur throughout the year and are not a once-off expense.  Indirect costs fall to parents arising out of the running of a school.  The responsibility for the running of a school or a primary school rests with the board of management of the school receiving funding from the Department of Education and Skills in two main ways, through specific grants for ancillary staff, such as a caretaker and secretary, and capitation funding, which is the amount received per child.  As Ms Flynn outlined this will be reduced incrementally by 7.5% by 2015.  From our point of view, this represents a major decrease in the core funding of Irish primary schools.  In addition, the minor works grant will cease.  Schools relied heavily on this grant to fund works during the year.  There will also be a VAT increase to 23%.  As a possible solution, I wonder if the State could consider applying a reduced rate of VAT to schools.  That would greatly assist schools.</p><p> The administrative fees for substitution will be reduced by 3%.  Fuel and electricity costs in schools and the costs of refuse, recycling and insurance are ever increasing.  Schools advise me that insurance ranges from between &euro;4,000 to &euro;6,000 per annum, which is not unusual.  There will be an increase in water rates.  One of our schools was charged &euro;270 for the month of July when the school was closed.  Cleaning is also expensive and the ancillary grant does not usually cover the cost of cleaning.  Security is becoming a major issue in schools and this puts another cost on schools.  In respect of the cost of the school office, the ancillary grant does not normally pay for the cost of the secretary, the caretaker, the cleaner and security.  In addition, given increasing legislative requirements, we must meet the cost of professional advice.</p><p> I am aware that many schools have annual deficits of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;20,000 or perhaps more and this is not unusual.  This deficit can only be defrayed by seeking contributions from parents and fund-raising while seeking an emergency loan from the patron and the parish.  Boards of management are bracing themselves for further announcements in regard to cuts in December, given that we were told last year that the overall target reduction in the budget was &euro;138 million by 2014.  Schools also advise us that grant money does not arrive until the end of the year, putting pressure on the cash flow of the schools, with electricity, heating, insurance and so on being paid throughout the year.  I wonder if it is possible that funding would be made available throughout the year.  Could the Department look at this as a way of helping schools?</p><p> While these are not direct costs on parents a shortfall in funding from the State to defray these costs in the schools seeking financial assistance in this regard from parents is the only way that schools can turn.  I suggest that boards of management and parents' associations currently use their best endeavours to reduce costs and to fund-raise to support both activities in the school and the running costs of the school.  In addition, both school management bodies and the Department of Education and Skills through the procurement services have been endeavouring to encourage schools to use procurement to try and reduce costs to individual schools further.  However, the shortfall between the support provided by the State and the rising cost of expenditure faced by schools contributes significantly to the real cost associated with maintaining the child in the school.</p><p> Support supplied by the State is standard even though costs can be different across the country.  Schools in wealthier sections of the community have a greater capacity to fund-raise than others.  I wonder if the Department would consider some differentiation on the grounds of geographical area.  We sent out a survey to all our schools on this.  One treasurer came back to me with the response that as far as he was concerned school treasurers, principals, boards of management are planning for the worst and hoping for the best.</p></speech>

I now call on the spokesperson from Educate Together to make a presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-10a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Colette Kavanagh" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012101000005#D00300"><p>My name is Colette Kavanagh and I am the principal of Esker Educate Together national school in Adamstown.  There is a deep appreciation among teacher and principals that parents are struggling with the rising cost of sending their children to primary school.  School communities are constantly struggling to come up with innovative ways to reduce these costs to parents and yet to ensure the school itself remains solvent and keeps up-to-date with the newest innovations.  It is generally felt, as the two previous speakers said, that primary schools are seriously underfunded and the boards of management have no option but to go back to the parents to fund-raise.  The capitation in primary schools is far lower than that in secondary schools, yet it costs the same to heat, run and maintain a building be it a primary or second level school.</p><p>  We accept that primary schools are overstretched due to underfunding yet we recognise there are current restraints on public spending.  Principals and patrons can and do make efforts to lighten the load for parents as much as possible.  Both previous speakers discussed the book rental scheme.  That is the single most efficient way to help to reduce costs to parents.  Any textbook that is not a workbook, that is a book in which children do written work, is purchased in advance by the school, using the book grant scheme and parents pay a quarter of the cost for that year.  After four or five years, we buy a new stock of books.  It has the advantage that we buy in bulk so that the costs are reduced.  When publishers bring out another edition, we are at an advantage because we have the stock of books and every child has the same book for four to five years.  Work parties of teachers and parents get together, cover the books and maintain them.  It is a way that parents can be involved in schools, without asking them to pay.  It does not cost money to volunteer.</p><p>  We would encourage schools to work as far as possible to implement this low cost book scheme for parents, through careful management of the book grant for schools.  The books grant itself is used to support the buying of books or the renting of book for parents who cannot afford to buy.  It is also used to help to buy in schemes at the beginning of the year and to support the cost of running the books scheme, replacing lost or damaged books or covering the books.  With the renewed emphasis on literacy in schools, the book grant is essential to enable schools to purchase sets of books to do lift off to literacy or read and recovery initiatives that schools have been asked to do.  Any reduction in that grant would materially affect school's ability to make improvement in their literacy as required by the literacy and numeracy strategy.  It would also be helpful to schools if the books scheme grant was paid in June of the previous year so that a stock of books could be available to the school to begin in September. </p><p>  Parents still have to purchase books.  They get the book list well in advance and by September they usually have bought the books.  Many schools are re-examining the educational value of many of the workbooks.  We are trying to reduce the number of workbooks that are used in schools for educational as well for economic reasons.  Some of our parent teacher associations run a book club apart from the book scheme which encourages parents to pay in on a monthly basis, similar to a Christmas club, and at the end of the year, they have paid for their books in June.  The PTA buys in bulk with the money parents have paid in advance.</p><p>  Other contributors have raised the issue of the materials money.  Parents have to pay to rent books, for personal accident insurance, the cost of materials, class stationery, art, photocopying and so on and schools find it is harder to collect the money for these sundries..  We find that parents buy the books from the book list, but the more we put books on to the book rental scheme we find it more difficult to get the money in from it.  It is now common practice for a number of parents to pay this charge for materials in staged payments, perhaps a monthly payment or a payment per term.  Perhaps it could be formalised at the beginning of the year that parents could chose to opt to pay for materials yearly, monthly or by the term, so that they do not have to talk to the principal or negotiate the terms of payment.</p> <p> Educate Together primary schools do not have a uniform, but parents must still clothe their children and buy shoes and coats.  The initial outlay of buying an expensive school uniform in September does not exist for our parents.</p><p> Irish primary schools have a history of fund-raising by parents.  As we all know, this may no longer be viable in communities where families are overstretched.  In my school, the majority of our children come from international families, and the fund-raising ethic, so part of the norm in Irish schools, is unknown to our parents.  They do not realise schools need to fund-raise.  I will not say they resist it, but they find it a very unusual thing to have to do.  Consequently, it is more difficult for us to raise funds among our parents.  Educate Together advises that schools do not fund-raise in September and any fund-raising that is necessary should be strategically planned throughout the school year.</p><p> Some schools raise money through an annual voluntary contribution, others do this monthly and others run what they call "small change Friday" whereby parents send in loose change each week, which is a bit messy but works for some schools.  We hope that any such contributions are strictly voluntary and that there is neither pressure on parents to contribute nor reminders sent to individual families in respect of these voluntary contributions.</p></speech>

Educate Together recently introduced it for its schools but patrons need to sell it more to schools and boards of management.  The establishment of the 16 education and training boards to replace the 33 voluntary education committees should generate substantial savings in administration costs to the Department.  Educate Together argues that such savings should be retained in the education budget and used to increase the subventions paid directly to schools and-or to reinstate the minor works grant.  This additional income stream to schools would reduce the fund-raising burden on parents.</p></speech>

Ar dt&uacute;s, conas laghd&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar na costais agus ansin, an cine&aacute;l bainisti&uacute; a dh&eacute;antar air.</p><p>  Maidir le bainisti&uacute; ar an airgead, moladh gan aon airgead a lorg &oacute; thuismitheoir&iacute; i m&iacute; Mhe&aacute;n F&oacute;mhair.  Dar leis na scoileanna, an pr&iacute;omh rud &oacute; thaobh na dtuismitheoir&iacute; de ghn&aacute;th n&aacute; go mbeadh &eacute;ada&iacute; scoile cearta ag na leana&iacute; agus iad ag filleadh.  B&iacute;onn tuismitheoir&iacute; ag buis&eacute;ad&uacute; le haghaidh an t-airgead at&aacute; le caitheamh.  Muna bhfuil le ceannach acu n&aacute; le h&iacute;oc amach i Me&aacute;n F&oacute;mhair agus roimhe sin ach &eacute;ide scoile agus na bill&iacute; leabhar, t&aacute; s&eacute; n&iacute;os &eacute;asca bainisti&uacute;.  Mar sin, cuirtear amach bille na bliana ag deireadh Mhe&aacute;in F&oacute;mhair n&oacute; i dtreo t&uacute;s Dheiridh F&oacute;mhair.</p><p>  Chomh maith le sin, &oacute; thaobh buis&eacute;ad&uacute; de, ba cheart go nd&eacute;anfadh na scoileanna iarracht costas ioml&aacute;n na bliana a chur amach chuig tuismitheoir&iacute; ag t&uacute;s na bliana, ionas go bhfeicfid&iacute;s c&eacute;n costas at&aacute; le n-&iacute;oc acu ar feadh na bliana agus gur f&eacute;idir bainisti&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh air.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-10a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Campbell" time="10:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012101000006#E00500"><p>I am the principal of Scoil Gr&aacute;inne community national school and, like Ms Kavanagh, I have a day off school today, so I thank the committee.  In listening to the previous submissions I am happily and unhappily struck by the consistency of the ideas, happily because it means we are on the right track, but unhappily because all of my good points have been stolen.  Rather than labouring over the points made in our submission and parroting the previous speakers, I ask the committee's indulgence as I examine the case study of a child in school.</p><p>  In the time-honoured tradition of teachers we will call the child "little Johnny".  All teachers will be familiar with Johnny as he is used to train them on classroom management.  He is normally the boy at the back of the class who misbehaves.  However, in this situation Johnny is very good, and in fact he is a model pupil.  Unfortunately, Johnny's parents have fallen into a tight spot financially.  Not unlike many other people they have lost their jobs.  Imagine it is August and the start of term is approaching.  The school has very helpfully sent a letter to remind mammies and daddies about the children's needs for the start of term.  Johnny's parents go through the list in the letter item by item.  First is the book list, which involves traipsing from shop to shop ensuring all the workbooks and textbooks are bought.  Enterprisingly, Johnny's mammy has been able to get them for &euro;100, which is not too excessive.  Next comes the uniform, which can be bought in only one shop.  New shoes are also needed and these and the uniform amount to &euro;150.  Added to this are the schoolbag, lunchbox, pens, pencils and copies, which amount to another &euro;50.  This adds up to a considerable amount, but on top of this schools ask parents for a contribution to the pupil personal accident insurance fund and arts and for crafts money, which is another &euro;15, and to round it off to the nearest &euro;100 parents will probably be asked for &euro;85 as a voluntary contribution.  All of this adds up very quickly and amounts to &euro;400.</p><p>  There is nothing excessive about what has been mentioned so far.</p> <p>That is not atypical of many schools.  While parents may be able to avail of the back to school allowance of &euro;150, it still leaves a substantial bill for somebody with zero income every week and it adds to pressure they do not particularly need with ideas that their child does want to be ostracised and so on.  Basically, the kernel of our suggestions is that schools should prepare for the start of the year as communities rather than individuals where schools purchase everything in bulk and are, therefore, saving through economy of scale.  We have started down this road in that we purchase in our school books, copybooks, workbooks, textbooks, pens, pencils, crayons and so on and we have noticed obvious benefits from that.</p><p> One of the points that has been made again and again, and it is no harm repeating it, is that VAT is payable on everything a school buys.  If we did not have to pay it and the good and kind people of the Oireachtas managed to exempt schools from VAT, that would significantly and dramatically decrease the costs for all concerned because, as mentioned, one cannot examine the increasing costs for parents in isolation from the broader ecosystem of the costs of education generally.</p><p> I remind committee members of the privileged position in which they find themselves.  They have at their disposal an extraordinary power of persuasion and acts as simple as asking energy companies to come in and explain what they think they can do to lower the costs for schools could do an enormous amount of good.  I urge them not to underestimate their power to make a positive impact.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-10a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Fr. Paul Connell" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012101000007#F00200"><p>I am president of the Joint Managerial Body, JMB, and principal of St. Finian's College, Mullingar.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to address members.</p><p>  The JMB was founded in 1972 to represent the interests of all voluntary secondary schools in the Republic of Ireland.  It advises, supports and negotiates on behalf of the boards of management and school management in the 380 voluntary secondary schools.  The JMB welcomes this opportunity to participate in the examination of the rising costs faced by parents every year when sending children back to school.  It is the strongly held view of the JMB that every effort must be made to ensure costs are kept to a minimum for all parents in order that children have the opportunity to fulfil their potential during their time in the education system.  This issue can only be tackled by a collaborative approach by all stakeholders, including the Government.</p><p>  The Government needs to recognise that the historical starvation of resources to the education system has been exacerbated by the recent and further projected budgetary reductions for schools.  The country has lingered for many years in the bottom rankings of the OECD table for funding of the first and second level education system.  If that was not bad enough, in 2010, schools received no increase in capitation, a 5% reduction in 2011, followed by a further 2% decrease in 2012 with a projected decrease in 2013 of 2% followed by a 1% reduction in both 2014 and 2015.  These reductions in funding to schools means that a secondary school with 400 pupils lost &euro;12,400 in income alone as a result of the budget cuts in 2011 and 2012.  A secondary school of 600 pupils lost &euro;18,600 in the same period with a school of 800 pupils losing &euro;24,800.  How is a school to replace this financial loss when basic costs such as electricity, oil, gas, water, refuse charges and insurance have soared in the same period and must be met from its capitation grant?</p><p>  The regrettable answer is that management in a secondary school can only respond in one way to this loss of income and that is to seek the assistance of parents through either fund-raising ventures or voluntary contributions.  Research conducted by the JMB indicates that, on average, more than 30% of a secondary school's annual expenditure must be raised through local sources.  In other words, central Government has decided that the school community must raise &euro;3 out of every &euro;10 locally.  Thus, in the view of the JMB, the main burden for parents in sending their children to school is created by the Government policy to grossly underfund schools.  There are no bailouts for schools, so school management has no option but to look to parents to provide the funding to balance the school accounts on an annual basis.  In addition, the loss of the summer works scheme has created more pressure for schools as now essential repairs to the school buildings must come from the already overstretched school budget.  The situation is even more severe for the voluntary secondary sector when one realises that, in the case of the average 400-pupil school, a voluntary secondary school inexplicably continues to receive &euro;90 per pupil less each year than a comparable community and comprehensive school and &euro;212 per pupil less than a vocational school.  This results from a decision by Government to underfund secondary schools at the time of the introduction of the free scheme in 1967.</p><p>  Turning to the issue of procurement, the JMB welcomes the motivation behind the setting up of a national procurement service, NPS.  It is in the interest of everyone associated with schools that best value for money forms the basis of all spending.  However, to date, schools have found two critical problems with the NPS, namely, the slow and cumbersome process involved in establishing the service and the high levels of bureaucracy associated with the process.  An over burdened school management will simply not be able to cope with the mechanics of a NPS without a major streamlining of the process.  Oil and electricity make perfect sense nationally but we also have to be conscious of the local economy, which must be taken into account.</p><p>  Apart from the requirement to shore up the school budget as a result of Government policy, the other main costs for parents are books and uniforms.  The JMB in a submission last June to the Department of Education and Skills consultation process on school book grants and rental schemes agreed with the overall aim of this initiative, that is, to reduce the cost to parents of school books.  The JMB acknowledged the progress made by the Minister in the establishment of a code of practice in respect of publishers and on the protection of funding for book grants to schools for 2012.  There, nonetheless, remain some challenges to be overcome in respect of equity and implementation which require comment and these were the focus of the JMB submission.  It is unarguable that book rental costs less to families than buying new texts.  No school wishes to add pressure to parents but the figures released to the media stating that a year's books could be provided by schools for a tiny fraction of their cost are unrealistic.  Where such is being achieved, it can safely be assumed that the scheme is well beyond its seed phase and other reliable sources of funding are being sourced.</p><p>  However, the JMB acknowledges the publication of draft guidelines for book rental schemes.  The staffing demands of such schemes will require engagement on the part of parents as current ancillary staffing in schools, as well as the moratorium on posts of responsibility, militates against a wholly school-staffed solution.  In this respect, we welcome the engagement of the NPC in the development of these guidelines.  However, the JMB must put on record the following serious reservations for schools regarding the feasibility of trying to establish a book rental scheme at this moment in time: the initial cost of setting up book rental schemes is very high - in the case of my school alone, I estimate that to be &euro;100,000; schools do not have the resources in terms of personnel to operate the scheme - all our middle management posts have been abolished and will not be replaced; there is no space in the school to store the books; more important, the implementation of the reforms at junior cycle will result in new syllabi being introduced across 21 subjects between 2014 and 2017 so it would be ridiculous for a school to spend, say, &euro;100,000 putting together a book grants scheme only to discover in three or four years the books were obsolete; and schools are exploring the introduction of technology such as e-books.</p></speech>

The next section is the important bit.</p><p> It is, therefore, important that policy makers appreciate the work involved in running, yet alone establishing, a book rental scheme.  We advocate careful consideration of the above points before coming to any decision about the future of the school book grant and a school book rental scheme.  We see e-solutions as a good way forward.  It will have the additional benefits of introducing IT as a core part of learning, reducing the weight of school bags and eventually reducing costs to parents.</p><p>  With regard to uniforms, I echo the comments of previous contributors.  Consultation between parents and schools is close on this issue and we all do as much as we can to reduce the cost of uniforms.  We share everybody's concerns.</p> <p>In considering the issue, recognition must be given to the bad financial situation of our schools in the voluntary sector and the serious concerns of boards of management about keeping their schools running.</p></speech>

I also thank them for their suggestions on how it can be addressed and improved.  It has become more and more difficult in the past three years to manage schools, with costs, subsidies and grants from the Government having taken a hit in successive budgets.  It has become correspondingly difficult for parents because of the increased burden placed on the communities surrounding the schools to make up the shortfall to maintain the level of service that has been provided.</p><p>  Surveys show the key costs in pupils returning to school are uniforms and book costs.  An issue that is not being addressed this morning is the cost of students in the third level sector.  Many families may have children at primary, secondary and third levels and the cost to such families becomes oppressive at third level.</p><p>  The comments on the school books scheme were particularly interesting.  Where one can be set up, it can have an impact on reducing the cost of books to families.  Ms Kavanagh referred to the Educate Together school in Adamstown and the fact that the scheme costs one quarter of the cover costs of books.  Fr. Connell referred to an example of a school where the set-up costs were &euro;100,000.  Perhaps Ms Kavanagh can comment on how to get to the stage where the scheme is up and running without such oppressive costs at the outset.</p><p>  Fr. Connell referred to reform of the junior certificate.  From first to third year, there will be a complete change starting in 2014 and running to 2020 across a range of subjects.  It will pose real challenges for parents and schools in terms of the cost involved.  That must be given significant attention.</p><p>  Regarding school uniforms, experiences are different among the witnesses.  Some have none and Ms Flynn referred to the existence of peer pressure in schools with no uniforms.  I am interested in further comments on that point.</p><p>  Some pupils in lower infant classes have to leave school at 2 p.m., which has become more of an issue in the past two years.  In the past, schools managed the pupils between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m., when family members were not able to pick them up or avail of public transport.  Anecdotally, it is becoming a flashpoint in some schools.</p><p>  The code of practice agreed with book publishers seems to be working well.  Is that also the experience of the witnesses?</p></speech>

Parents face major challenges as the cost of sending children to school is increasing.  With a reduction in the education budget, there will be an increased cost for parents, who can expect a figure in the region of &euro;77 million.  This is separate to the multi-annual reductions announced last year, such as the capitation grant.  We must look at solutions in a different light because it is important to reduce the cost to parents as much as possible.  Many of the solutions were the same across all presentations.  However, there are different challenges to parents in terms of costs.  For instance, Dr. Fennelly referred to school transport being a significant issue for parents in rural areas, whereas it is not a factor in urban areas.  In Educate Together schools, the cost of school uniforms is not an issue.  While there are different pressures in terms of the cost to parents, some of the solutions could be implemented across the board.</p><p>  Regarding VAT rates for schools, is there any research on how much schools will save if it was abolished?  What is the amount of money paid by schools?  It will vary across the board but it may be significant in helping schools to manage budgets.</p><p>  In respect of start-up costs, I am interested in the figure of &euro;100,000, referred to by Fr. Connell.  It is not feasible for schools to raise that amount of money.  If it was possible, it would alleviate the costs for parents.  Do the witnesses have any suggestions on how to overcome the obstacle?  Junior certificate reform will make it more difficult to get to that position.  Educate Together is in a position where 25% of costs are passed on to parents.  Is there anything the Department can do to help schools to get from the start-up process to being able to implement the scheme very well?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-10a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1018" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="10:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012101000008#G00600"><p>I thank the witnesses for attending to discuss this issue.  The premise is that we want to come up with solutions and work together.  This is not a finger-pointing exercise but a collaborative approach to finding solutions.  The suggestions made have been practical and positive.</p><p>  On the issue of books, DEIS primary schools receive &euro;21 per student and non-DEIS schools receive &euro;11 per student.  Some 25% of schools are not running book rental schemes.  Can the patron bodies give me an indication of why that is the case? </p><p>  I am interested to hear about the Educate Together policy of no uniforms in schools.  Do other patron bodies provide direction, make suggestions or have policies on the issue of crested jumpers, jackets and tracksuits?  Has a policy framework been devised to encourage and direct schools in respect of uniform policy, as Educate Together has done?  I am a former school principal and I am a believer in school uniforms for various reasons. </p> <p>They reduce peer pressure.  My personal opinion is that there is also a health and safety aspect to the wearing of uniforms.  As has been outlined, some parents must go to a particular store to buy a designated jumper.  That puts a cost on the uniform, which is not necessarily fair in any circumstance, particularly not in the current circumstances.</p><p> On the question of voluntary contribution, everybody present admits that schools are, and always have been, chronically underfunded.  I do not believe anybody will deny that.  The manner in which voluntary contributions are collected is the issue.  If somebody has the means and wants to contribute to the school and wants to contribute to a fund-raiser, be it that we should not be required to have fund-raisers, that is all very well, but there have been suggestions and indications given to public representatives that schools are being quite aggressive in targeting certain students and parents telling them they have not returned their "voluntary contribution".  Will the patron bodies give a direction to the schools as to how that should be done properly?</p><p> It may sound silly to raise the issue of Christmas presents.  Every year it comes up it is suggested to parents to give a present to teacher.  Can we give directions to our schools to stamp out that unnecessary practice?  There are the small little pressures that come up every year or at the end of year.</p><p> The witnesses have made very practical suggestions on public procurement and workbooks, on capitation payment at the end of August and September and on bulk buying.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien made a suggestion in regard to VAT on energy consumption and I believe that is an issue we can work on.</p><p> We have benefited from this conversation and I appreciate the contributions.</p></speech>

Gradually parents had a lower book bill, as they had to pay for fewer books as the years went on.  We get parents to pay a rental charge of a quarter of the value of the books.  In second level schools, it would be very different as teachers may want to use different schemes in their classrooms.  I can understand how it would be much different.</p><p>  The question of after school care was also raised.  The cost of after-school care is a major issue.  I know that Educate Together is looking at forging a relationship between its school and a not-for-profit organisation, where the schools could be used as a venue for after-school child care at a reduced cost.  We think that is a very good initiative if we can help parents with after-school child care without being involved.  Obviously we cannot do it ourselves, it has to come from somebody else.</p><p>  There is an initiative in Lucan, which has five Educate Together schools called "time banking", where parents, teachers and children all can donate time to the school - Mr. David Campbell referred to schools as communities - where people work for the school and help to run after-school clubs.  If one gives an hour of one's time then one gets an hour's worth of service.  Let us take the example of a mother who works in the after-school club on a Monday, she can get an hour's "time banking" for her child on another day.  Parents are working toward giving to the school but also getting something that has a value for them as a result. </p></speech>

The Minister reached an agreement with the publishers relatively recently.  We were impressed by the agreement that books will not be changed within a period of five years of first being published.  That is to be welcomed and it is very helpful.  The danger in the past was that particular sections or chapters were changed, which could lead to the entire book having to be replaced.</p></speech>

I know Mr. Campbell raised it.</p></speech>

If the Department gives a grant approximately one fifth becomes obsolete because one must pay VAT.  A significant amount of money is involved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-10a.40" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Moriarty" time="10:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012101000009#H01000"><p>Having listened to the debate, two issues arise.  First, how can the State lessen the burden on the school?  If the burden is on the school it transfers to the parents.  If one orders fuels costing &euro;2,000 and the VAT rate of 23% applies it amounts to &euro;460 in VAT, which is very significant.  Then the school must pay for water rates, public utilities and other charges.  The cost of running a school has become prohibitive.  The school must function and must pay its bills.  The load then transfers to the local community.  If the school is located in a well-off area, the burden is not as great but if it is in a disadvantaged area then there are serious issues with equity.  The State can examine and make provision for lightening the burden on the school management.</p><p>  Second, there is a cost in sending children to school.  Schools are tying to be creative in meeting these costs.  I like the collaborative approach Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in mentioned.  There is much we can do to try to develop that.  Uniforms act as a leveller and stop fashion parades.  The idea of a generic uniform with the logo or crest being affixed is a simple solution which will benefit everybody. </p></speech>

I know the position of Educate Together but I ask the other patrons to respond to this question.  Has the joint managerial body issued instructions to its schools on this issue?</p></speech>

There are a variety of customs and practices and tradition and it is best for decisions to be made at local level with a view to ensuring that cost is kept to a minimum.  It is important to make the point about designer labels.  We hear from our schools about the fund-raiser of non-uniform days.   We hear of the angst that non-uniform days causes to parents and most particularly to young people who have to appear in the various labels.  We need to be careful in balancing  the cost of a uniform and keeping it at a minimum while at the same time not swaying the balance in the other direction and putting additional costs on parents for labelled items.</p></speech>

They are very flexible.  If a school wants to have no uniform and that is okay for them, that is fine.  However, if a school wishes to have a uniform, that is also fine.  The decision is one that is entirely up to those at local level.  The patron would not impose a guidance in that sense.  As Mr. Ferdia Kelly said, it is a decision for the local school but the Church of Ireland bishops are very flexible in that regard.</p></speech>

There is a fundamental issue that we might be missing, that is, encouraging schools to look at everything they are doing on a whole school basis at local level.  For example, if one examines the building one is sitting in can one save energy?  I know of one school in which every second florescent light was removed.  Nobody missed it and it took &euro;1,000 off the ESB bill.  We can encourage children to look at how they can save energy by turning off lights, watching when they are using heat, having windows open while the heat is on - all things with which we  are familiar - and to participate in the green schools initiative.</p><p>  With regard to school books, there is a fundamental question to be asked where the local school population or community should look at the books they have listed as being required for the purposes of teaching the curriculum.  Do they need them all, do they need them all now, can they get them on loan from each other?</p> <p>Is there a dependence on text books and workbooks, as a component of teaching the curriculum?  That is a challenge.  We could look at this issue as well.  We are mindful of advising schools to look at the economics of how they do their business, including all of the issues I outlined.</p></speech>

Many of the school under the patronage of An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta are newer schools.  There is the issue of identity and with that comes the uniform and the crest.  There has been a move at local level to address the cost of the uniform and the trend has been to choose items such as trousers and tops that can be purchased in Dunnes Stores.  The cost arises with the crest on the school jumper.  Some schools have a mechanism for having a more cost effective crest and some do without a crest.  This is an issue that is decided at local level with parents and management.  Generally the decision is based on the parents' requirements.  There are no guidelines on a uniforms.</p></speech>

At the start-up stage and in existing schools, we have the conversation with the parents and the local community.  We always find that parents want a uniform because overall they find it cheaper than having to buy different sets of clothes over the school year.  In terms of cost they would find it cheaper to have a uniform over the school year.</p><p>  As a patron body we would promote book rental schemes and support schools in the start up phases of the rental scheme.  Overall it is cheaper.  We can, as a management body support schools as they start up and encourage them in that regard.</p><p>  On the question of energy costs and other issues, we find that in all our schools we can effect significant savings in areas such as insurance through bulk procurement, also in print managed services and through using the national procurement service for energy and other costs.  That has made significant savings for schools.  These savings can be passed on to our primary schools as well.</p><p>  Schools will face significant water charges in the future.  While we would, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills, be engaged in processes such as water harvesting in our new schools and a number of other features, the costs for primary school children will be significant.  In many cases it is double taxation for parents.  They are paying the charge at home and now they will be paying in at school.</p></speech>

In a secondary school, a fill of oil could be &euro;20,000, therefore, one could see the benefit of removing VAT.</p><p>  I would like the committee to take into account that we have moved on from physical text books.  In secondary schools, there have been significant developments in teaching methodologies.  We have IT in our classrooms and textbooks are an aid and not the whole story.  It is now apparent that  e-books are the way of the future.  With link-ups to credit unions and various bodies there is a possibility to make it a great deal cheaper for parents.</p></speech>

I know they have put great deal of work into their presentations.  They want to put their message across.  However, all the delegates are singing from the same hymn sheet as they have all the same ideas and have collaborated on suggestions.  I found it very interesting that Fr. O'Connell is the only person who has mentioned e-books.  I would be a great promoter of e-books as it would greatly reduce the weight of the schoolbags and this would alleviate the causes of back problems.  I would say that nearly every house has a computer.  For the homes which do not have a computer, they would use school books.  I believe e-books are the way to go.</p><p>  I am a parent and my children have gone through all levels, junior, secondary and third level.  I know exactly what it costs.  I know the pressures on families.  I did not have a Senator's wages and got no grants.  It was tough to have to put the children through school, but we got there and thankfully the result is worth it.</p><p>  I was on the board of management of a school in County Kerry which had a book rental scheme.  When there was a change in one chapter of a book, the relevant chapter was printed again and given to the school children as an addition to the book so that they did not have to buy a new book.  That is an idea that could be looked at.</p><p>  In the current climate savings must be made.  While we would very much like to increase the capitation grant, we cannot do that and the country is not in a position to do it.  There is a return to the days of fund-raising.  I am on the board of management of a national school which is located beside where I live.  They do bag packing in Dunnes Stores to fund-raise and make quite a bit of money from it.  There is a great deal of community involvement.  The parents come in and see it as a day out and do not see it as going out on the streets and looking for money.  They are doing something and they are getting paid for a service.  It is a good fund-raiser. </p><p>  We can certainly take up the issue of the VAT rate .  It is a very good suggestion to consider ways that we can exempt the schools from VAT.</p><p>  On the question of uniforms, when we moved to the country there was no uniform in the school but my children continued to wear the uniform from their previous school.  Today that school has a uniform and I think it saves money.  The pupils made their confirmation in the school uniform.  That saved a great deal of money.  I believe that uniforms are the way to go.</p><p>  The awarding of a green flag is a great initiative for schools.  I hoisted the green flag recently where the school was awarded it for water conservation.  The children gathered lemonade bottles and put them into the cisterns, they also changed the taps to ones that go off automatically.  Everybody knows that young children will leave taps running.</p><p>  An issue that was raised recently with the board of management of which I am a member is the transportation of children to football matches, swimming and so on.  The parents were grouping together and taking turns in driving them.  This is now a major issue and parents are being advised not to do this, which is putting an extra cost on everybody.  Now the school has to organise a bus to transport the children.  We need to consider ways of having the parents help out.</p></speech>

I have two sons, and each goes to a different secondary school, but it cost &euro;60 for a jumper with a badge.</p> <p>For a green or blue jumper with a badge stuck on, that is a living disgrace.  I urge all of the organisations representing schools to bulk buy badges and give them out at a nominal price or free in order that parents can sew them on themselves.  It happened 40 years ago so why can a simple thing like that not be done in this crisis?  It is great to hear every organisation coming up with almost the same solutions but either the boards of management or the Department are not getting the message.  If every group here encourages the schools they represent to look at the book rental scheme or uniforms, why is this still happening?  This has nothing to do with the downturn.  It should not have happened during the boom either.</p><p> Dr. Maria Griffin mentioned the bulk purchase of insurance and the grouping of schools together.  Are all of the school organisations looking at that?  It could be done for stationery, schoolbooks and electricity.  The schools could negotiate a better discount.  The logical proposal is for schools to bulk purchase books.  If that happens, the publishers can be forced to give a greater discount.</p><p> The prices being charged for books in this day and age are a living disgrace.  Textbooks, which are being produced and printed for &euro;5, are being sold to parents for &euro;40.  It is not that expensive to print books in Ireland and many companies would love the contracts to produce these books for less.  Something must be done to force these companies that are ripping off parents to lower prices.  Fr. Connell is correct that there are e-books, but the majority of schools do not have access to them.  There was a pilot in St. Louise's in Ballyfermot, however, and it was much easier.  Every child who took part in the pilot scheme gained from it.</p><p> If people are considering bulk buying, they could do the same for schoolbags,  which are also &euro;40 for a bag that will hold the necessary books.  I have two children in secondary school and one in primary school and I know this myself.  It is an additional cost.  I am lucky that I have an income and my wife is also working.  People who are not working, however, cannot cover these expenses with the back to school grant when a school jumper costs &euro;60 and a schoolbag &euro;40.</p><p> The VAT proposal is a positive idea and should be pursued by the committee with the Minister for Finance.  There should be a mechanism for schools to claim a rebate on water charges as well.  There is an exemption and that was one of the rules, but there is nothing to prevent the State from granting a rebate.  That alone would benefit everyone.</p></speech>

The cost of textbooks and school equipment for kids peaked a few years ago.  The number of textbooks has been reduced and it should be cut further because there is an over-reliance on textbooks.  The point made in the CPSMA submission would cut the cost of going back to school by between 25% and 50%.  I say that because I followed those rules myself as a school principal and cut the cost of going back to school by 50%.  With proper rigour it would be possible to do that.</p><p>  I would not hold my breath, good as the proposal is for a VAT reduction.  I am old enough to remember the campaign for VAT on hurleys and it got nowhere.  I agree with Fr. O'Connell but we also must be careful about procurement in order that we do not affect local businesses too much.  Even when we are talking about a new framework for printing, it could exclude 90% of local suppliers.  We must be careful.  I preferred the approach outlined by Ms Flynn of adopting a whole-school approach.</p></speech>

We are having this meeting in the context of a difficult budgetary situation that has occurred over recent years and that is likely to continue.  By and large, while every group referred to that fact and to the reductions in funding, they all remained positive and tried to come up with solutions.  The challenge for the patron bodies is to continue the work they are doing to come up with ideas.  There was common ground and there were some differences, so it is important we share ideas.  For us as legislators, particularly on the Government side, we must rise to the challenge issued by the groups to come up with solutions to the VAT issues and energy challenges outlined by Mr. Campbell, the timing of grants and local authority charges.  Those are all challenges we will take on board.</p></speech>

If a number of schools come together and decide to purchase their oil and insurance from certain suppliers, they run the risk of breaching EU law.  I accept that this seems extraordinary but we are continually faced with the problem of ensuring that we comply with health and safety regulations, EU law, etc.  Schools are obviously concerned about matters of this nature.  We work very closely with the National Procurement Service, NPS, because it offers schools a way in which to bulk buy without being in breach of competition law. The CPSMA has been pushing the concept of working with the NPS in order that schools will not fall foul of the rules and regulations.  Unfortunately, it is sometimes the case that difficulties can arise in respect of what might seem to be an obvious solution.</p><p>  Schools are becoming VAT collectors.  The CPSMA, in conjunction with the JMB, is currently running seminars throughout the country because schools are now returning VAT to the Revenue Commissioners.  Perhaps an arrangement could be arrived at in this regard, particularly in the context of schools that are involved in any sort of building or alteration works.</p><p>  Another issue that arises is ICT.  Of course, e-books and e-learning are fantastic.  However, school authorities continually point out that we should not forget about the ongoing costs involved in respect of ICT.  For example, it costs several thousand euro to purchase an interactive whiteboard and if one is obliged to change the bulb on it, the cost of doing so is a further &euro;300.</p><p>  These are some of the issues which arise.  I am of the view that it would certainly be worthwhile to examine the option of using the National Procurement Service when it comes to purchasing books from publishers.</p></speech>

One of the publishers launched a new English reading scheme - which we have taken on - for which there is no physical textbook.  Everything relating to this scheme is done via interactive whiteboards.  The point Ms Gorman made is very relevant.  The maintenance of computers and interactive whiteboards is giving rise to our biggest cost and we need to fund-raise in order to cover this.  The savings made as a result of children not being obliged to have textbooks are being lost as a result of the need to meet maintenance costs.</p></speech>

All of our schools have interactive whiteboards and there is a cost associated with their upkeep.  I wish to refer to a matter that has not yet been raised, namely, special schools.  I do not represent special schools and I have no expertise in the area.  However, I am aware that the costs involved in running these schools are three to four times as great as those relating to the running of ordinary mainstream schools.  The heating in those schools must be switched on constantly and they have water needs which are far in excess of those of other schools.  As already stated, I do not have any expertise in this area but I have received feedback from some of our patrons who are involved in special schools to the effect that the costs relating to running them are over and above those incurred by ordinary mainstream schools.</p></speech>

Children at junior level need to have 3D learning opportunities.  They cannot learn about money from a whiteboard; they actually need to handle it.  This means that it is not quite as simple as it sounds.  They also need to handle books and turn their pages.  There are children who come to junior infants now who believe that if they place two fingers on an image in a book, it will automatically become enlarged.  I wish I had an iPhone 4S to give to each of them.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in referred to Christmas presents, etc., for teachers.  I am not representing the CPSMA when I, as a principal and a teacher of many years experience, say that I have never accepted a present from anybody.  The experience of receiving a present is horrific.  In order to have a present for their teachers, some children would actually steal something from their mothers' dressing tables.  I could not agree more with the Deputy that the custom of giving presents should be done away with.  However, the decision in that regard is one for schools to make.  I am of the view that it is very odd that children are still giving presents to teachers.</p><p>  If the committee has power to do anything with regard to schools being treated as businesses, perhaps it might consider the position with regard to standing charges.  We want to be green and clean, so schools have switched to gas for their heating.  However, one third of their bills are made up of the standing charge.  In July and August, primary schools are closed but they must still pay the standing charge.  We investigated this matter previously and tried to make representations to various legislators in respect of it.  I understand there is a legal issue in this regard.</p></speech>

We have very good experience in respect of procurement and have saved up to 40% on printing and other costs.  I take on board what was said in respect of SMEs, etc.  We met representatives from the SMEs recently in order to discover how they might be incorporated into the framework.</p><p>  In the context of e-books and e-learning, VAT is charged in respect of iPads, laptops, e-books, etc.  This is a matter to which the committee could give immediate consideration.  The fact that VAT is charged on these items is actually a disincentive in the context of expansion.</p><p>  In the interests of trying to remain positive about the maintenance of ICT systems, this is a matter on which we can all work in a collaborative manner.  The Education and Training Boards Bill 2012, which will facilitate the VECs' replacement with the new education and training boards, includes an expectation of collaboration between these boards.  Such collaboration must happen at local level and there is evidence that this is already the case.  For example, County Cavan VEC provides ICT support to a considerable number of primary schools.  This can help reduce costs.  The new education and training board for Cavan and Monaghan will be able to bring about significant improvements in respect of the cost base of primary schools within its catchment area.  Working in a collaborative way is a matter to which we must, as Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in suggested, give consideration.  In the current climate, this is the route we must take.</p></speech>

I understand the progression in this regard but we are trying to focus on the costs parents incur when their children return to school.  Many speakers have indicated that this is a local issue, particularly in the context of schools' policies on uniforms, etc.  However, members would be encouraged if our guests took a leadership role in respect of this matter and sent out some guidelines to schools with regard to what might be considered appropriate for investigation at local level.  I understand that our guests' hands are tied but their showing some leadership on this matter would have an impact at local level in the context of policies relating to school uniforms, the giving of presents to teachers, etc.  Children giving presents to their teachers might be regarded as being no big deal or even frivolous but it has an impact on families at various times throughout the school year.  If we state that this should be decided at local level, then we are not showing enough leadership.  I am of the view that guests should take the lead and issue some guidelines.  However, it is entirely up to them to decide what they wish to do.</p></speech>

As nobody is offering I will raise a number of issues.  It was suggested to me that an upfront enrolment fee can be a deterrent for low-income families to apply for a place in such a school.  Should there be a higher capitation fee for schools located in older school buildings?  Obviously people attending schools with newer buildings will not agree, but it is harder to heat an older building.</p><p>  Senator D'Arcy referred to the cost of workbooks and suggested it was more difficult for parents to meet these additional costs because of reducing incomes.  I understand, but I did not get a chance to read it, that the<i> Irish Examiner </i>has a story on the higher than expected number of applications for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, even though the number of eligible categories was reduced.</p><p>  Will each group cover the issues that were raised when making their final contribution?  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in asked if the patron bodies could take on a leadership role and issue guidelines.  Deputy McConalogue raised the issue of fee-paying schools.  Deputy Griffin mentioned a company by name, but we do not endorse a particular company, but will somebody comment on the type of service it provided?  During the summer, a company was in the news for the length of delays in servicing the orders for school books.  I asked whether the capitation fee is sufficient for older buildings and if the upfront enrolment fee acts as a deterrent for low-income families going to particular schools.</p><p>  I will call the groups in the order in which they made their contributions,</p></speech>

The question is whether capitation should be differentiated.  That could and should be looked at.  In an older building, one cannot selectively turn off the heat in one wing.</p><p>  We are absolutely opposed to a fee on enrolment.  There should be no question of paying a registration fee for enrolment.  We appreciate the reason that some schools, even at primary level in some areas, have to do it because they are faced with multiple enrolments and they cannot determine how many children will go to an individual school.  We would not be in favour of such a fee.</p><p>  We were asked whether we could take a leadership role by way of issuing guidelines.  I do not think there is an issue with that but I will ask my colleague, Ms Margaret Gorman, to comment.</p></speech>

In our next newsletter we will deal with that issue.  The question of a differentiated capitation grant brings into sharp focus the issue of the minor works grant, which we think could be going.  We are still hopeful that some money might be found somewhere for these works, although it is said that it could be gone.  Schools are making that point to us.  We get a significant level of correspondence on minor works grants, particularly from older schools.</p></speech>

We can also advise schools about the guidelines on school uniforms.  The patrons have no issue with school uniforms, so it would be no problem for us.</p><p>  It is important to highlight that many of our schools are older small schools.  The loss of the minor works grant will affect them and will add to their running costs.  As Ms Flynn said, one cannot turn off radiators in one part of the building.  If one turns off the radiators it would cause an airlock.  There is also the issue of insulation and heat conservation.  One must comply with building regulations and for that reason, PVC windows may not be suitable.  Individual boards of management must try to cope.</p></speech>

We would imagine that would create substantial savings for the Department.  We hope those savings would be used, perhaps, to reinstate the minor works grant or to defray the cuts in the capitation.</p><p>  I am principal of a DEIS school.  Without the DEIS grant our school could not survive.  The schools that are not eligible for the DEIS grant are struggling more than I would be struggling in a DEIS school.  The parents who are not eligible for the back to school allowance or for free school transport, the so-called "coping classes" are struggling.  I would like that they should be kept in mind.</p></speech>

We must consider that the management of these schools is being carried out and conducted by volunteers.  The school system is based on the goodwill of the boards of management around the country, which is a substantial saving for Government.  We are putting an onus on the boards of management to adhere to guidelines, procedures and EU competition law and so on.  They all buy into the cost savings and reducing the costs on parents.  They want to run the schools as best they can.</p> <p>They need assistance.  I accept there are several initiatives but a concerted effort on cost reduction support is required.  I refer to implementation support at school level for the points made by Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy.  Currently, schools are engulfed with issues ranging from child protection to new curriculum implementation.  Trying to reduce costs is another issue.  Many issues arise in both rural and urban schools.  Sometimes it is necessary to have someone to come into the school and say, for example, that if one takes out every second bulb it will save &euro;1,000 or that one should go to the national procurement website.</p><p> School principals receive a multiplicity of correspondence daily by e-mail, letter and also from speaking to parents.  It is not easy to absorb all of the information and to co-ordinate it.  That must also be taken into consideration in what we are trying to do.  If we are to reduce costs we must provide assistance to school boards on how to do it.  Reference was made to centralised bulk buying and the cost savings that would ensue.  We should bear in mind that those on school boards are volunteers.  Board members, teachers and principals bring all the goodwill in the world to their approach but consideration must be given to providing assistance to them.</p></speech>

However, as the principal of a brand new school, I would be remiss if I did not point out the difficulties of building up educational resources and supplies when one starts with nothing.</p><p> I wish to add to what was said about electricity charges.  This year one quarter of my capitation grant to the school will go on heating and lighting.  That is a significant proportion of the funding.  I do not see why standing charges could not be abolished.  At home I have a night meter and a day meter.  I do not see why schools could not be charged night meter rates.  There are many ways to make a big difference.  I urge the committee to ask the energy companies to come before it to see what they could do for schools which would not affect the Exchequer.</p></speech>

They are representative of local communities and they are dealing with a complexity of issues.  It is important that we recognise that.  Boards of management are aware of local issues that affect parents.  Great work is done by them.  There is a danger at meetings such as this one that we can sometimes hone in on the negatives.  Much positive work is being done in terms of the mass of 30,000 volunteers who support the education system at first and second levels.  We must congratulate them and also encourage them to continue to look at how to reduce costs.</p><p>  At the core of our submission is the fact that central government has a role to play.  Schools have no source of funding other than central government or the local community, in particular, parents.  It is a huge dilemma and a struggle for local management to reconcile.</p><p>  I will deal with a couple of issues that were raised by various members of the committee.  On the enrolment fee and voluntary contributions, we are clear and we send regular guidelines to schools reminding them that if they are in the free education scheme they cannot charge a compulsory fee of any type.  I have a copy of the most recent correspondence we sent to schools four weeks ago.  That point has been reiterated time and again.  At the same time we remind parents that we need the support at local level to keep the school open.  It is literally down to that nowadays.</p><p>  Fee-paying schools have about 7% of the second level school population.  The State contributes the salaries of teachers.  No matter where those 26,000 children are, the State will be paying the teachers&rsquo; salaries.  If parents can no longer afford to continue to send their children to such schools and they have to move into the free education scheme, the State will be paying much more.  They will still be paying the teachers&rsquo; salaries but they will be paying capitation and other grants to keep the schools running. That must be remembered and kept in focus.</p><p>  Everyone recognises that the national procurement service is a good idea but there are difficulties.  I went to a meeting in March 2011 at which we spoke about the provision of electricity.  I gather a competition was to be run.  The primary schools are still involved in the same situation.  I do not know whether electricity is measured in watts or ohms but not one competition has run yet.  I am told it will be next March &ndash; two years on - before the aspiration can be fulfilled.  Big questions arise in that regard.</p><p>  We were asked about local suppliers.  We are conscious about office supplies and stationery in particular.  If three or four schools in a town switch to the national procurement framework then a local business will be gone overnight.  We must get the balance right.  We need to save money.  We will save money, but we must recognise the balance between saving money and maintaining local businesses.</p><p>  Reference was made by a few members to school transport.  There is a danger, in particular with the new school transport arrangements that have been introduced since 1 January 2012, that parental choice will be restricted.  We are getting more and more representations by the week from schools representing parents who have to contribute substantially higher sums of money to pay for school transport to a school of their choice.</p><p>  As Mr. Moriarty said, we welcome the opportunity presented by shared services but it would be remiss of me not to mention that when setting up the education and training boards, the other education sectors should have a statutory right to representation on them.  This would help to ensure the integration of all of the educational services within an area and allow shared services to operate in an integrated way because representation would exist at board level.</p></speech>

I thank each of the groups for taking the time &ndash; some had to take time off from schools &ndash; to make presentations to the committee.  The presentations were constructive and contained many good suggestions.  We have had a productive meeting.  We will send a transcript of the meeting to those who attended and we will try to itemise the suggestions that were made and the issues that were raised.  We will follow them up with the Minister.  I hope the committee will come up with further policy development in the area.  The engagement with the witnesses was positive.  I thank members also in that regard.</p><p>  I remind members that we are meeting next Tuesday in the Department of Social Protection.  We will have an additional meeting on Thursday of next week with the nominated chair for the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland.</p></speech>

I hope it is an indication of how smoothly things will go from here.</p><p>  I am honoured to have been nominated and appointed to the position of Chairman.  The work the committee does is of major national importance, and in taking on the role of Chairman I am very aware of what the task involves.  In thanking the committee I have outlined what an honour and privilege this is and I look forward to dealing with the challenges and tasks of the committee in its busy work schedule.</p><p>  Over the coming period we must give consideration to a wide-ranging remit of matters under public attention.  I have had experience of working with some committee members on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, and they would very much see me as a Chairman who operates by consensus and who tries to bring everybody on board.  If the committee works well it is a reflection on all of us, whether we are in government, in opposition or Independent members.  My number one goal will be to ensure the committee reflects well on members of both sides of the House.  I will operate the most non-partisan approach possible.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Michael McAteer, joint administrator, Mr. Aidan Cassells, chief executive officer, Quinn Insurance Limited, QIL, Mr. Patrick Dillon, advisory services partner to Grant Thornton, and Mr. Aidan Sherry, QIL.  From the Department of Finance we have Mr. Aidan Carrigan, assistant secretary, Mr. Pat Casey and Mr. Cathal Sheridan.  Representing the Central Bank of Ireland are Mr. Domhnaill Cullinan, head of general insurance division, Mr. Faheem Mirza, deputy head of general insurance division, and Mr. Tom Cleary, general insurance division.</p><p>  The format of the meeting will be that Mr. McAteer, Mr. Carrigan and Mr. Cullinan will make opening remarks which will be followed by a question and answer session.  I understand members of the committee have been issued with the witnesses' full statements.  I propose that the three opening statements be confined to a maximum of ten minutes each.  If the witnesses exceed that time I will cut them short.  I ask them to prioritise the main points they wish to make in their presentations.</p><p>  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors' Gallery that all mobile telephones must be switched off and not put on silent mode.  This meeting is being broadcast live by UPC on channel 207 and if a mobile phone is switched on it will interfere with the broadcast, sometimes to the extent that the broadcast is seriously disrupted and those watching it cannot follow the questions being asked or answered.</p><p>  I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If witnesses are directed by this committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to do so they are entitled, thereafter, only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Finally, members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  Before we hear the opening statements I remind members of Standing Order 57 and the matter of <i>sub judice</i>.  The topic before the committee today is Quinn Insurance and the State's Insurance Compensation Fund.  Members are advised not to stray into other matters which are before the courts.  I call on Mr. McAteer to make his opening statement who will be followed by Mr. Carrigan and Mr. Cullinan.</p></speech>

A further order on 15 April 2010 for the formal administration of the company was made, and this was not contested by the company.</p><p>  Separate to the appointment of provisional administrators, on 30 March the regulator also directed the company to cease writing all lines of business in the United Kingdom.  As officers of the court we have reported, and continue to report, to the President of the High Court on matters arising in this assignment.  To date, we have lodged over ten reports with the court which have kept the president informed as developments occurred.  We also appeared in person earlier this year and answered questions the president wished to put to us.  The court also oversees and approves the fees and costs associated with the administration.</p><p>  The administrators share the dismay of all Irish citizens that the current estimate of deficit in the insurance compensation fund has risen to &euro;1.65 billion.  It is important to point out that while it took approximately 18 months from the date of our appointment to uncover the &euro;1.65 billion deficit level, this deficit always existed and neither the actions or lack of actions by administrators have contributed to this number.  Furthermore, the nature of insurance claims means that while we are comfortable with the adequacy of the provisioning now in QIL, the final deficit number will only be known with certainty when the last claim is settled, a process which will take a number of years to complete.</p><p>  I will now set out some of the background information which I hope will assist this committee but in particular I will deal with the financial position of QIL upon our appointment, subsidiary companies, the under-provisioning of reserves, and the sale to Liberty Insurance.</p><p>  On the financial and operating position upon appointment, when we were appointed the task as set out in the relevant legislation was to put in place a plan to return the business of the company to a sound commercial and financial footing.  Prior to our appointment, discussions had been ongoing between the board of QIL and the company's auditors, PwC, with regard to finalising the audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009.  The draft unaudited financial statements for that year indicated a loss of approximately &euro;47 million.  However, the auditors actuarial review of the provision for claims suggested an under-provision of &euro;68 million by the company, thereby indicating a maximum loss for the year of &euro;115 million.</p> <p>These draft 2009 accounts presented a picture suggesting the company, while loss-making in 2008 and 2009, had been historically profitable.  Figures indicated there was a surplus of assets over liabilities of &euro;338 million before the 2009 loss was posted.  This is if one ignores the impact of the guarantee issue, which I will detail.  This surplus was after the Quinn family and connected parties had extracted approximately over &euro;200 million by way of gifts in the previous two years.  However, it subsequently materialised that these draft accounts and the historical audit accounts did not reflect accurately the true financial position of the company, for the reasons we will highlight today.</p><p> We concluded quickly the sale of the business was the most effective solution and we moved to achieve this through fundamentally restructuring QIL.  This required the following actions: the recommencement of certain lines of business in the United Kingdom with substantial price increases; a significant redundancy programme; and the adjustment of the cost base of the company.  As part of our oversight during this period, we unearthed significant operational issues, in particular, inadequate file reserving practices, and poor underwriting and pricing controls.  As a result, we carried out a comprehensive review of these claims and underwriting departments, which resulted in a fundamental change to the claims controls and estimation practices and significant improvements in underwriting controls and pricing policy, particularly in respect of UK business and, to a lesser extent, Irish business.</p><p> With regard to subsidiary companies and guarantees given, at the time of our appointment, QIL had over 20 subsidiary companies, which held assets such as hotels in Sofia, Krakow and Cambridge, a wind farm in Derrylin, a landfill site outside Newry and a number of commercial properties located in Ireland and the United Kingdom.  At the time in question, these assets had a net value of approximately &euro;450 million, which was consolidated into QIL's balance sheet and which formed part of the solvency assets of QIL.  While there was no legal impediment prohibiting these asset types from forming the asset base within an insurance company, it would be fair to state this asset type would not typically be held by insurance companies.</p><p> Unlike QIL, which was a regulated entity, these companies were not regulated.  An issue had arisen approximately seven days prior to our appointment when the board of QIL became aware of the existence of guarantees which had been given by a number of directors of subsidiary companies in 2005 and 2006 as security to loans provided by banks and bonds that funded the wider Quinn Group.  As soon as the board of QIL became aware of the existence of these guarantees, it notified the Central Bank.  These guarantees were for a total of &euro;1.3 billion.  Had these guarantees been called upon, the effect would have been to reduce the net assets of the insurance company by approximately &euro;450 million.  The discovery of these guarantees by the regulator was a factor in deciding to appoint administrators to QIL.</p><p> While there is some doubt over the validity of these guarantees, due to how they were executed, legal opinion was obtained by the joint administrators which confirmed that, notwithstanding that proper board meetings had not been convened to approve the signing of the guarantees, it would be difficult to prove their invalidity and that, therefore, they were enforceable by the banks and bonds.  Following a significant amount of work and negotiation, the banks and bonds agreed to a payment of &euro;200 million in full and final settlement, thereby generating a saving for the Irish taxpayer of &euro;225 million.</p><p> With regard to the under-provision of reserves, it should be noted the company engaged a third-party actuarial provider, Milliman, to calculate the claims reserves for 2009 and preceding years.  The company did not have any in-house actuaries.  One of the key points upon our appointment was to use the services of Grant Thornton in London to provide assistance in that regard.  During the pitch process for the sale mandate of Quinn Insurance, it was identified to us that we should complete insurance-reserve due diligence.  In this regard, we appointed an actuarial firm called EMB to complete the exercise.  This commenced in July and, by late August, EMB gave us its initial findings, which indicated under-reserving to the tune of &euro;400 million.  The company continued its work and finally, on 5 November, this position was confirmed to us.  We then re-engaged the services of both Milliman and PwC to complete the 2009 accounts.  Eventually, the two companies moved to the EMB estimates.</p><p> During mid-2010, we continued to notice an ongoing trend indicating an increase in case reserves.  We requested a full and detailed review of claims departments to ensure adequate case provision.  The various file reviews added approximately &euro;230 million to claims reserves.  Prior to our appointment, there was reluctance to reserve large cases adequately.  These findings resulted in our reporting to the court in October that the deficit had increased from an original &euro;600 million to &euro;738 million.  That increased again to &euro;775 million in December 2011.  We decided to appoint a new auditor, Deloitte, for the year ending 31 December 2010.  As part of the exercise, the auditor recommended that we make a new provision called an adverse-deviation provision of &euro;300 million for unknown claims that could occur.  In addition, we provided a further &euro;250 million in regard to the fact that all our claims were then in sterling and that we are reliant on the ICF in euro to fund those claims.</p><p> A further adjustment of &euro;278 million was required on the case reserves in regard to prior-year adjustment.  It is important to note that over 90% of these actual reserve movements were in respect of policies incepted prior to the appointment of the administrators and that they had the effect of eliminating substantially all the profits that QIL made in the previous five years prior to our appointment.  Some significant loss areas included professional indemnity insurance, in respect of which premiums of &euro;93 million were earned, and projected claims to date of over &euro;333 million.  It is important to note that all these loss areas featured before the incurring of operating expenses and the costs of running the business.</p><p> We have now carried out a review of prior-year reserve movements.  It indicates that, in the accident year 2006, the reserves were underestimated to the tune of &euro;215 million.  In the accident year 2007, the figure was &euro;168 million.  In 2008, it was &euro;299 million and, in 2009, it was &euro;264 million.  This indicates that a total of &euro;936 million in claims had been under-reserved prior to our appointment.</p><p> With regard to the sale to Liberty Insurance, in June 2010, having concluded an extensive selection process, we appointed Macquarie Bank to advise on the sale of the insurance company.  Initially, 91 parties expressed interest in acquiring QIL.  By the time of the deadline for submitting formal expressions of interest, this had reduced to eight.  In November and December, following access to the data room, this number reduced to only a handful.  By late 2010, it became apparent to us that there was a real possibility that no sale would occur, which would result in the loss of over 1,500 jobs and an even greater call on the ICF.</p><p> Following extensive negotiations in the intervening period, we managed to secure a purchaser for the Irish business.  In 2011, Liberty was selected as the preferred bidder.  This is because it was a new entrant that would ensure the preservation of the maximum number of jobs.  It was willing to take over the Republic of Ireland reserves, which would derisk the exposure to the ICF, and there was to be a goodwill payment of &euro;88 million.  It also gave us a solution for the remaining UK claims, a solution to the guarantee issue, which attracted a saving of &euro;225 million.  It allowed QIL to take indirectly a 25% stake in the new enterprise and it allowed IBRC a further direct stake of 25% meaning that, should the company be successful, the Irish State would benefit.</p><p> While the proposal was extremely complex, we announced the sale on 14 April.  A significant number of operational issues still had to be addressed.  As is normal in such cases, the agreement contained a number of material adverse conditions, MAC clauses, which, if breached, could have allowed Liberty to terminate the agreement.  By the time we were in a position to complete the sale in October 2011, both macro and micro-conditions had deteriorated which put the whole deal in jeopardy and led to a renegotiation of the terms of the deal.</p><p> A significant attraction of the Liberty deal was the fact that it ensured that the joint administrators had a robust solution for the run off the UK claims book which remained with QIL in a going-concern environment through the execution of a transaction service agreement.  We are confident, based on third-party expert advice, that the run off the UK book in this fashion will ultimately result in significant savings for the ICF.</p><p> We remain convinced that the deal involving Liberty Insurance represented the best deal available for all stakeholders, including the over 1,500 employees of the companies and the Irish taxpayer through the funding of the ICF.  We are confident we now have appropriate controls and procedures in place to ensure the remaining business of QIL is managed in as efficient and cost-effective a manner as possible.  This includes the appointment of a full-time executive team, including a new CEO with extensive experience in the insurance industry, to oversee the operation of the TSA and particularly the settlement of claims.  In conjunction with the Department of Finance, we have availed of the expertise of Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen in the State Claims Agency.  He sits on our claims advisory committee, which has been set up to guide and advise the joint administrators and QIL management on future claims strategy policy.</p></speech>

Before doing so, let me outline the main elements.</p><p> On 31 July, the joint administrators presented their tenth report to the High Court.  That report set out that the potential call on the ICF would be up to &euro;1.65 billion, representing an increase of &euro;875 million from the amount of &euro;775 million set out in the application to the High Court of 14 December 2011.  The joint administrators indicated to the High Court that the main reasons for the increased call on the fund are: an increase in the best estimate of the ultimate claims by Grant Thornton actuaries - &euro;208 million; a new adverse-deviation reserve for potential claims in Ireland and the United Kingdom - &euro;300 million; a contingency reserve to protect against currency fluctuations - &euro;215 million; and a further reduction in asset values in the investment portfolio and revisions to trading estimates - &euro;152 million.</p> <p> The administrators pointed out in their report that the projected call on the insurance compensation fund, ICF, now includes considerable contingencies and that it is hoped these will not be called upon.  They made the point that poor claims handling and reserves practices as well as a culture in Quinn Insurance Limited, QIL, of suppressing estimated claims all contributed to an under-provisioning for claims.  The joint administrators have undertaken several actions relating to claims settlement which could reduce the ultimate claims cost.  They have indicated that were they to remove most of the accounting adjustments and use a best estimate calculation, the call on the fund would more likely be in the range between &euro;1.1 billion and &euro;1.3 billion rather than the &euro;1.65 billion for which they have provided.</p><p> The Minister is mindful that there is concern among Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas that they were not made aware of the increase in the call on the ICF at an earlier stage.  The Minister understands this concern and believes it is important that some explanation should be provided.  The committee is aware that the joint administrators are court appointed officers and have a duty to update the High Court at regular intervals on developments relating to the administration.  In circumstances in which they believe there is likely to be a significant increase in the call on the ICF, the joint administrators must be in a position to demonstrate that additional funding will be available, otherwise the court will not be in a position to approve the release of moneys from the fund.</p><p> In preparation for their court application, the joint administrators drew the attention of the Department to the possibility that there was likely to be a significant increase in the call on the ICF in April 2012.  At that stage the information provided by the joint administrators was still provisional in nature and was provided to the Department in confidence as part of preparations for their High Court appearance.  We were advised that the information was preliminary and still had to be confirmed by their internal procedures.  The Minister was concerned about the scale of the proposed increase at that stage and advised the joint administrators accordingly.  In the following weeks, the 2010 QIL annual accounts were finalised and the administrators determined that there was need for a contingency reserve against currency fluctuations, leading to a further increase in the potential call on the fund.  On receipt of this information in July, the Department wrote to the joint administrators on behalf of the Minister expressing his frustration, especially with the fact that the call on the ICF could reach &euro;1.65 billion.  This correspondence was produced in the High Court by the joint administrators as an exhibit for their court appearance of 7 August 2012 and, as such, is in the public domain.  At that stage the joint administrators had yet to inform the court and it would not have been appropriate for the Minister to have brought the details into the public domain in advance of it being presented to the High Court.</p><p> The Minister shares the committee's concern about the significant increase in the potential call on the ICF from &euro;775 million to &euro;1.65 billion as reflected in the correspondence with the administrator.  This increased call is significant from a budgetary perspective because while the contributions to the fund will be recouped, they still cause short-term strain on the economy at a time when a range of competing financial demands are being placed upon the Exchequer.  The reduced best estimate calculation of between &euro;1.1 billion and &euro; 1.3 billion represents small consolation but it is a target which the Minister is keen the joint administrators should work towards achieving.  The Minister has consulted the Central Bank about his concerns at the increasing call on the ICF and at the conduct of the administration.  The bank has made the point that reserve calculation by its nature is a difficult and complex process heavily dependent on several factors, including a firm's claims handling process and its approach to reserve setting.  The bank indicated its understanding that the adverse loss development was related to business written prior to the firm being put into administration.  In other words, in the bank's view, the joint administrators have not conducted themselves in a way to cause any losses to increase.</p><p> The Minister has emphasised to the joint administrators the importance of taking appropriate measures to ensure cost-effective management of the claims settlement process and to ensure everything possible is done to minimise the call on the ICF.  To achieve this objective, the joint administrators have informed the Department that as part of a new enhanced governance structure, a claims advisory committee has been set up to guide and advise them and QIL management on future claims strategy and policy.  They have indicated to the Department that the claims advisory committee is devising a strategy for managing the settlement of outstanding claims as quickly as possible and at the lowest possible cost.  Further, to protect Exchequer interests, the Minister has ensured the State Claims Agency is more involved in the administration process, especially in the claims management area, which is critical to keeping the call on the ICF down to its lowest level.  It should be noted in particular that, at the Minister's request, Mr Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director of the State Claims Agency, has been appointed as chair of the claims advisory committee.  The Department proposes to continue to work closely with the joint administrators and to use the services of the State Claims Agency to monitor progress with a view to ensuring, in as much as it can, that the most cost-effective outcome to this process is achieved.</p><p> It is hoped this overview is helpful to the committee's understanding of the call on the ICF.  The Minister shares the concerns of the committee at the escalation of costs.  I assure the committee that the Minister will continue to pay close attention to the matter.  We are open to any questions the committee considers appropriate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-10a.127" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Domhnall Cullinan" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012101000005#D00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me and my colleagues from the general insurance supervision division of the Central Bank to discuss the insurance compensation fund and Quinn Insurance.  The insurance compensation fund was established under the Insurance Act 1964.  It is maintained and administered under the control of the President of the High Court acting through the accountant of the High Court.  Only the High Court may make payments from the fund.  The fund is financed through contributions received from non-life insurance companies up to a maximum of 2% of their gross written premium.  The contribution is collected by the Revenue Commissioners and forwarded to the fund through the accountant of the High Court.</p><p>  The role of the Central Bank in respect of the fund includes carrying out an annual assessment of the financial position of the fund and determining an appropriate contribution to be paid to the fund by non-life insurance companies.  The Insurance Act 1964 states that the High Court may pay out of the fund to the administrator of an insurer such amounts as are required to enable the administrator to carry on the business of the insurer.  Quinn Insurance Limited, QIL, is required to comply on an ongoing basis with its obligations under the Insurance Acts and regulations.  Of particular note in this regard is the obligation that each insurer shall establish and maintain technical reserves in respect of all underwriting liabilities assumed by it.  The amount of technical provisions must be sufficient at all times to cover any liabilities arising out of insurance contracts as far as can reasonably be foreseen.  The amount of any item in the accounts must be determined on a prudent basis.  It is the obligation of insurance companies to ensure compliance with these requirements on an ongoing basis.</p><p>  Throughout 2008 and 2009, the Central Bank continually engaged with QIL in respect of its business and financial performance.  The Central Bank was concerned there were gaps between the technical reserve calculations of Milliman, QIL's signing actuary, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, QIL's external auditors, because Milliman's calculations were lower than those of PricewaterhouseCoopers.  The Central Bank advised QIL during 2009 that these gaps were unacceptable.  We required QIL, Milliman and PricewaterhouseCoopers to attend several meetings in the Central Bank to discuss the issue.  The last of these meetings took place on 24 March 2010.  At this meeting the Central Bank informed QIL that the &euro;68 million gap between Milliman's estimate and PricewaterhouseCoopers's estimate for 2009 was unacceptable.  In addition, since May 2008, monthly returns submitted by QIL showed that the company had only complied from time to time with the required solvency margin.</p><p>  Submissions made to the Central Bank by QIL during the early part of 2010 showed its financial position had deteriorated to such an extent that the company's solvency margin was only 107%, considerably below the 150% level required.  There was no satisfactory plan in place for QIL's recovery and on 19 February and 23 March 2010, the Central Bank informed QIL that consideration was being given to applying to the High Court for the appointment of administrators.  Then, on 24 March 2010, the Central Bank was advised that previously unknown guarantees against properties of QIL valued at &euro;448 million were in place against Quinn Group debt.  In addition, the Central Bank was advised that an amount of &euro;35 million, in respect of which the Quinn Group had given an absolute commitment that it would be injected into QIL by the end of that week, would not be made because the consent of Quinn Group's lenders was required for such a payment and this had not been forthcoming.</p><p>  The Central Bank's decision, therefore, to apply to the High Court on 30 March 2010 for the appointment of the joint administrators was based on the emergence of the guarantees, a significant concern that QIL's technical reserves were insufficient and that the manner in which the business of QIL was being, and had been, conducted had failed to make adequate provision for its debts.  The appointment of the administrators was confirmed on 15 April 2010, after the board of QIL consented to the permanent appointment.</p><p>  The Central Bank understands and shares the concern about the level of the potential call on the insurance compensation fund by QIL and in particular that the projected call has increased from &euro;775 million to &euro;1.65 billion.  Reserve calculation by its nature is a difficult and complex process heavily dependent on several factors, including a firm's claim handling processes and its approach to the setting of reserves.</p> <p>The joint administrators have kept the Central Bank informed of developments in this regard during the course of the Central Bank's ongoing supervision of the firm.  The Central Bank understands that, in broad terms, the source of the increase can be divided into four distinct parts: first, there has been an increase of &euro;207 million in the estimated reserves that the joint administrators believe are needed; second, the joint administrators have made a provision for adverse deviation of &euro;300 million; third, the joint administrators have added a contingency reserve of &euro;215 million to protect against exchange rate exposure; and fourth, there has been a fall of approximately &euro;150 million in the value of QIL's assets.</p><p> The joint administrators have undertaken a number of reviews in order to identify and correct any shortfall in the case reserves of the company.  It would appear that the joint administrators have undertaken a robust review in arriving at their revised estimate of the call on the fund and that the increase in the potential call arises essentially from business<b></b>written by the firm prior to the appointment of the joint administrators.  It is essential that the joint administrators make and continue to make adequate provision for QIL's debts to ensure that the rights and interests of QIL policyholders are protected, and the Central Bank will ensure that the joint administrators continue to do so.</p><p> In conclusion, I assure the committee that the Central Bank will continue to monitor QIL's compliance with its statutory obligations to make provision for its liabilities and adopt a prudent approach in doing so.  Thank you for your attention, Chairman.  We are now happy to take questions from the committee.</p></speech>

Is it agreed that the witnesses' opening statements be published on the committee's website?  Agreed.</p><p>  Every insurance policy in Ireland, apart from health insurance, now carries a 2% levy.

I welcome the witnesses and thank them for being here.</p><p>  Administrators were appointed to QIL in April 2010.  In April 2011, when the sale to Liberty Mutual was approved, it was estimated that the call on the fund would be about &euro;600 million.  In September 2012, the Minister for Finance came before the Oireachtas and said the estimated call was &euro;738 million.  The Minister gave that figure in good faith.  In December 2012, the administrators informed the High Court that the estimate was &euro;755 million and at the end of July 2012, the estimate given to the High Court was, &quot;anything up to &euro;1.65 billion&quot;.  The original estimate was given one year into the administrators' work.  It was not a back-of-the-envelope exercise.  It was a considered estimate given when the administrators had been<i> in situ</i> for one year.  That estimate has increased almost threefold since that time.  </p><p>  For whatever reason, there was a catastrophic miscalculation of the potential losses.  Given that ordinary policy holders will be paying this levy for quite some time, they are entitled to know how the administrators could have got it so wrong.  In the first year, the administrators estimated a call on the fund of &euro;600 million, and that has increased almost threefold since then.  How could they have got it so wrong?</p></speech>

We had completed the 2009 accounts and the actuaries had gone through the work.  Using the information presented to me by EMB, which had been independently brought in by ourselves, PwC and Milliman, that was the best estimate at the time.</p><p>  Because we were concerned about the continuing movement in case reserves on a week-by-week basis, we took a further review of the case files, of which there are approximately 26,000 at any one time within QIL.  Part of that review process resulted in what the actuaries felt was continued volatility in the case movements.  For every euro of case reserve level the actuaries, based on their experience, tend to add on another &euro;1.5, on average.  For example, current reserves in the UK model are &euro;1.3 billion.  That is made up of &euro;485 million of case reserves at company level, plus &euro;588 million, which is the actuaries' estimate of where that &euro;465 million will end up.  The final component of &euro;300 million is an adverse deviation provision which the actuaries and auditors have recommended to us as a prudent way to take into account unknown unknowns that may occur over the next ten to 15 years in settling those claims.</p></speech>

It was when that sales component had been completed that some of the other factors came into play.</p></speech>

In fact, I would say the opposite in that some of the actions we took have led to a significant reduction in what would have been the ultimate cost on the claims front.</p></speech>

How can we be reassured that this situation will not occur again?  This is not the first time that ordinary policyholders have been hit by losses incurred in the insurance industry.

Since the financial crisis - we include this as part of that crisis - there has been a substantial increase in our resources.  The model we use is more pointed.  It is an impact risk-assessed model whereby the resources are devoted most to the places where they might have the greatest impact on the taxpayer.  Where previously we would have had a limited amount of resources covering more than 300 companies, we now have substantially more and we dedicate more of them to what we refer to as the high impact companies.  There are seven non-life insurance companies in Ireland which we consider to be high impact, which we consider would have a significant impact on the fund if a repeat situation were to happen.  There is considerably more engagement with those firms now.  Each of them has a specific team charged with its supervision.  An actuarial partner from our actuarial team is assigned to assisting each firm in the supervision of the company.  We have close and continuous engagement with each firm throughout the year to ensure we would spot any problems earlier.</p></speech>

The original estimate was almost one third of what the final call from the insurance fund will be.  It strikes me as very bad value for the taxpayer.  Will Mr. McAteer review those fees?  Does the Department or the Central Bank have any comments to make on what, in my view, are exorbitant fees paid to a professional firm and firms engaged by Mr. McAteer for a job that has not been done well?</p></speech>

I do not believe that the job was not well done.  The ultimate cost to the taxpayer would have been substantially more if we had not delivered the deal which took a substantial amount of time to achieve.  It involved a team of more than 50 people working during all of 2010 to 2011, day and night, for a long number of weeks, six to seven days a week.  I take issue with the view that the job was not done correctly.</p></speech>

In so far as there any good guys, I regard Grant Thornton as having come out of this situation reasonably well, relative to the others.  It is clear that Quinn Insurance was managed in a chaotic manner.  It is clear there has been a regulatory failure which is not dissimilar to the catastrophe in the banks over the same period.  The result is that non-personal insurance policyholders will have to pay more than &euro;1 billion over the next number of years.</p><p>  My first question is for the Central Bank representatives.  Did alarm bells not sound when the Central Bank saw the Quinn Insurance profits in the year 2006 or thereabouts?  Was the Central Bank aware that some of the country's largest insurance brokers refused to sell Quinn's policies.  Did the Central Bank engage in any communication with the UK financial regulator or the Bank of England about Quinn Insurance and its selling practices such as its undercutting in the English market?  It is stated that since 2008, monthly returns submitted by Quinn Insurance Limited, QIL, showed that the company had gaps in its returns.  What did the Central Bank do?  What procedures are in place since then to ensure there will not be a recurrence?  It seems the regulatory section in the Central Bank was asleep on the job in this case.  Did the Central Bank have similar concerns about any other companies during this period?</p><p>  I refer to the potential claims in Ireland and the UK.  This issue was also referred to by Grant Thornton.  Is there a division as between claims in Ireland and in the UK?  Mr. McAteer mentioned that an additional &euro;300 million was added during his review.  Is a breakdown available between claims in Ireland and in the UK?  I note there was a reduction in asset value of &euro;152 million in the investment portfolio of Quinn Insurance.  What is the composition of this investment portfolio?  How much of this investment portfolio was contained in original Quinn companies belonging to Quinn Group?</p></speech>

As referred to in my opening statement, that statement was provided to us by Milliman, a well-respected global actuarial consulting firm.  If a signing actuary is unable to provide an unqualified opinion to us, the actuary must act as a whistleblower and inform the Central Bank.  At no point did we receive a whistleblower report.  PricewaterhouseCoopers was the auditor.  It is part of the work of any auditor to audit the work done by the signing actuary.  PwC raised some concerns regarding the difference in the estimates - to which I referred in my statement - but equally, PwC was willing to sign off on the reserves on the basis that these were, in its view, within a range of best estimates.  While I am very conscious there were rumours about the performance of the company and that people were concerned, very few came forward to the Central Bank to provide any concrete evidence.  Our safeguards include the statement of actuarial opinion and this was being returned to us as an unqualified opinion.  The United Kingdom's Financial Services Authority raised some concerns with us about the firm, but when we requested the provision of specific data, it was unable to provide any.  We had a good level of engagement with the FSA because Quinn Insurance had a branch in Manchester and also a presence in the North of Ireland.</p><p>  I have referred to the arrangements for the future such as the new engagement model with the firms.  Our powers have been greatly extended by means of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 which provided the bank with new powers with regard to fitness and probity.  It also amended the Insurance Act 1989 to allow authorised officers other than employees of the Central Bank to be called upon to carry out investigations on behalf of the bank.  Further powers for the bank are planned in the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill which is currently before the House.  This will provide even further powers with regard to what we call skilled persons reports whereby the bank can commission another party to carry out an investigation on its behalf, the cost of which is charged to the firm under investigation.</p> <p>In other words, significant additional measures have been and will be taken.</p></speech>

In our calculation for the Insurance Compensation Fund, we had previously estimated a return on our investment in Liberty Insurance of &euro;92 million.  For the sake of prudence, however, we have written off that investment in our 2010 accounts.  If we do get a return on our investment, it will ultimately reduce the &euro;1.65 billion call on the fund.  That accounts for &euro;92 million of the &euro;152 million.  The remaining &euro;60 million relates to the large number of property assets on the company's balance sheet.  It is normal accounting practice to value those types of assets every year.  They would have included the buildings in Cavan, Fermanagh, Dublin and Cork, a hotel in Cambridge, an office block in Manchester, a hotel in Krakow and a hotel in Sofia.

Will Mr. McAteer indicate whether the same claims-handling staff remain in position in the company, notwithstanding the charge that has been aimed at them?  What experience does the State Claims Agency have in managing the types of claims that Quinn incurred?  Mr. Cullinan referred specifically to professional indemnity for solicitors.  Does the agency have experience of dealing with such claims?</p><p>  One of the issues that strikes me as unusual in all of this is the indication in the Grant Thornton submission that the actuarial firm EMB discovered in late August 2010, having been appointed only the previous month, that there was an under-reserving of &euro;400 million for 2009.  On receipt of this analysis, Milliman and PricewaterhouseCoopers revisited their draft 2009 reserves.  How did they get it so wrong, given that it took EMB only six weeks to identify the issue?  What did EMB present to Milliman and PricewaterhouseCoopers that made them revise their earlier, incorrect estimates?</p><p>  My understanding is that Liberty Insurance is administering the legacy claims.  Is there an agreed price for this project and who is paying Liberty Insurance to carry it out?  The delegates mention in their submission that the Quinn family and connected parties extracted approximately &euro;200 million over the previous two years by way of gifts.  Do we have a breakdown of that and can the delegates indicate who the beneficiaries were?</p></speech>

Note 22 in the published 2008 accounts for Quinn Insurance Limited shows that the company made gifts to Barlow Financial Services Limited, a company within the Quinn Group, amounting to &euro;75 million.  In 2007, the company made gifts totalling &euro;135 million to Quinn Group Family Properties Limited.  That was in the 2008 accounts.

In terms of governance, we have utilised the services of two United Kingdom-based experts to review file handling in our claims operation.  The response from them has been encouraging and positive, which gives us reassurance that the files have been handled efficiently.  That has been endorsed by the chairman of our claims advisory committee, which gives us comfort looking ahead.  We will continue to monitor the issue very closely.</p><p>  On the question of experience within the State Claims Agency, I will leave that for my colleagues in the Department of Finance.  My interaction with the head of the agency has shown him to be a very experienced professional and we are very keen to have him working with us.</p><p>  Under the transitional service agreement, we have outsourced all of our services to Liberty Insurance, not just the claims side, at an estimated cost in 2012 in the region of &euro;25 million.  This includes financial compliance and risk management as well as claims.  It is a significant cost but one which we constantly monitor to ensure we are getting adequate value for it.</p><p>  On the question regarding the actuarial activities of Milliman, PricewaterhouseCoopers and EMB, that is an issue we are examining from the point of view of legal redress.  As such, I cannot go into too much detail at this point.</p></speech>

I am astonished at some of the contributions I have heard.  It does not surprise me, however, that the call on the insurance fund has gone up.  If one looks back at the transcripts of the committee from September or October of last year, when the legislation was being rushed through the Oireachtas, this issue was flagged up by Sinn F&eacute;in and others.  What happened in this instance was unique, with a requirement for members to submit amendments to legislation before Second Stage had even taken place.  In the Seanad, all Stages were dealt with within 24 hours of the Bill being published.  This is what happens when that type of legislation is rushed through the Houses.</p><p>  The potential call on this fund is &euro;1.6 billion.  I am aghast at what we have heard from the professionals, the Central Bank and the Department.  What has been described is almost like a game of Monopoly, with no acknowledgment that we are dealing with real people's money and real people's lives.  We have six witnesses representing three of the agencies directly involved, yet there has been no apology or admission that they got it wrong.</p></speech>

He said the courts were informed in the first instance that there would be no call on the fund at all.</p> <p>Is Mr. McAteer in a position to confirm whether that is accurate?

Grant Thornton stated in 2010 that there would be no call on the fund.  At the time of the sale of Quinn Insurance, it indicated that there could be a potential call of &euro;600 million on the fund.  When the D&aacute;il was passing legislation last October, it stated that the call could be as much as &euro;738 million.  When the matter came before the courts again in December, the amount had risen to &euro;775 million.  Now it stands at &euro;1.65 million.  I accept that Grant Thornton might not be in possession of all the correct information but there is a time when one indicates that one got it wrong.  Mr. McAteer should state that his original assertion to the effect that the taxpayer would not be obliged to cover the costs relating to this matter was completely wrong.  Mr. McAteer and his company have been paid millions of euro to carry out work in respect of this matter.  He indicated that his priority was to sell Quinn Insurance.  However, there must be due diligence in respect of the call on taxpayers.</p><p>  Almost everyone in the State has an insurance policy.  It is ordinary citizens who, if we are to believe the officials from the Department of Finance, are going to be obliged to pay the price in respect of this matter for the next 15 years.  There is a time and place to accept responsibility and state that one got it wrong.  In my opinion, there has been far too much of this kind of behaviour in the past.  I am reminded of comments to the effect that ours would be the "cheapest bailout in history".  As we are aware, the cost of the bailout continues to increase.  The figures produced by Grant Thornton in respect of this matter have gone through the roof.  It must be held responsible for the fact that it got it wrong over a very short period.</p><p>  In the context of the Central Bank, Mr. McAteer indicated that his company called in the auditors in respect of a dispute regarding a discrepancy of &euro;68 million between audits.  If we were only talking about &euro;68 million, then the country might be in a much better position.  I am aghast by what has taken place.  Reports indicate that Mr. McAteer has been directly responsible for supervising this company since 2006.  When a financial regulator from another member state indicates its view that a problem exists, then something must be done.  I presume that financial regulators do not engage in loose talk in respect of different companies.  It is shocking that a financial regulator from another state had to bring to the attention of the company the fact that it had failed to go through the accounts and identify some of the losses.</p><p>  It was stated that some of the additional losses relate to the fact that QIL's &euro;450 million of assets are deteriorating in value.  Why was this fact not factored into Grant Thornton's original assumption in respect of this matter?  Why were currency fluctuations not taken into account?  We are aware that the purpose of the 2% levy relates to products that are available in the North and Britain.  Why were currency fluctuations not taken into account in the context of the original estimates and why are they only being thrown into the mix now?</p><p>  The officials from the Department of Finance indicated that the amount of money required in respect of Quinn Insurance will be in the fund by 2015.  It is difficult to accept the figures the Department - and indeed the Minister for Finance - have provided in this regard.  The Minister for Finance informed the D&aacute;il that this fund would be in place for between 11 and 12 years.  That was his estimate and I presume the Department supplied him with the relevant figures.  We now know that he was basing his assertion in this regard on losses amounting to &euro;738 million.  As we are aware, those losses may eventually amount to &euro;1.65 billion or more than double the amount originally communicated to the Minister.  Our guests from the Department have indicated that the fund will only be in place for three years.  It was stated that assets and asset sales are being taken into account but why were these not part of the equation when the Minister stated that the fund could be in place for 11 or 12 years?  Did the Minister just ignore the position in this regard?  Our guests are playing around with figures, while we are concerned about people's lives and their money.  It is very disappointing that we have not received very honest and forthcoming presentations from them at this meeting.</p><p>  Will the officials from the Department indicate when the State will get its money back?  The administrators referred to action being taken against certain professionals.  Will they indicate the individuals against whom they propose to take legal action?  What are the chances of recouping any, if not all, of this money from the professionals who provided the administrators with dodgy advice in the past?  This matter has arisen in the past in respect of the banks, when auditors presented books indicated that certain institutions were solvent when, in fact, they were insolvent.  The State lost billions of euro as a result.  However, those to whom I refer just walk away and are later given other State contracts and-----</p></speech>

How many people were employed by QIL when Grant Thornton took over as administrators?  How many were employed by it on the day of the sale?</p></speech>

When the sale was completed, the figure was approximately 1,550.  It is important to point out that the claims existed on the day on which we were appointed.  The claims were always there.  If we had not sold the company, the claims would still have had to be met.  If it had not been sold and had gone out of business, we would have no company in place to process those claims and over 1,500 would have lost their jobs.  In such circumstances, the amount of the claims would have been substantially greater than &euro;1.65 billion because we would not have had the infrastructure in place to collect them.  As stated previously, the figure of &euro;1.65 billion comprises several numbers which may or may not be required to be used.  What is important for the Department of Finance from a budgetary perspective is that those components are built in.</p><p>  The company is not a normal trading company.  That is one of the reasons why the actuaries and the auditors have requested that &euro;300 million be set aside as an adverse deviation provision.  This does not relate to a specific case within the Quinn Insurance caseload, it is a buffer to move the actuaries from a 50-50 review - which they would normally carry out on a trading basis - to 80-20 cover.  That is a provision the actuaries have put in place in the sense that the company is in run-off.</p><p>  We identified that hedging was required, we sought it and we expected to obtain it.  Unfortunately, when we approached the banks in respect of it, they indicated that they required a letter of guarantee from the Minister for Finance.  The Minister was not in a position to give such a letter and we do not have a hedging facility as a result.  It would be irresponsible for us to predict whether sterling would go up or down.  The figures were, therefore, calculated on the basis of a spot rate.  We disclosed to the court that the number was based on a &euro;1 to &pound;0.83 exchange rate and was exposed to currency fluctuations.  The &euro;215 million is based on an exchange rate of &euro;1 to &pound;0.70.  Luckily, sterling has weakened since our appearance before the courts in August.  As a result, we may not require the full &euro;215 million.  Some &euro;515 million of the &euro;1.65 billion relates to provisions which may or may not be required.</p></speech>

Grant Thornton was appointed and paid a great deal of money to do its job.

It is important to note the we indicated that the call on the fund would be zero within six to ten weeks of our appointment.  At that stage, we had been presented with numbers which showed this company to be a solvent financial enterprise.  We had engaged the services of EMB but we had not yet received its report.  When the report appeared, it provided the first indication that there was something wrong in the context of the reserving of the business.  With regard to the figures of &euro;600 million up to &euro;775 million, I am an officer of the court and it is my duty to inform the court at any particularly time of the information that has been presented to me.  When the figures of &euro;738 million and &euro;775 million became available, I immediately informed the court about them.  I did not wait to see whether they would rise or fall.  I kept the court informed as the information was becoming available to me, which is my duty.</p></speech>

In the context of the estimates on which he must report, he is obliged to rely on the information provided to him by the administrators.  As I indicated in my opening statement, the Minister is considerably frustrated at the increases in the call on the fund.  Such increases have occurred despite the amount of actuarial expertise which has been applied to assessing the position during the past two years.</p><p>  There was no mention of 2015.  However, we assessed that it would take 15 years to raise the money.</p> <p>Obviously when we are looking into the future and we are trying to calculate what we think it will cost over 15 years - there are a number of moving parts - but our assessment is based on the best estimate figure of &euro;1.1 billion to &euro;1.3 billion.  I am being a bit optimistic and hoping we can get to the &euro;1.1 billion, which takes account of asset sales and the fact that some of these contingencies that are provided for are worst case scenarios that will not come true.</p><p> It was quite late in the day when the hedging issue was brought to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  It might have been helpful if it had been raised earlier but when it was brought to our attention it was indicated to us by the administrators that they could do hedging but only if the Minister gave a further guarantee on any risk around that.  There was sufficient exposure to the State in this particular instance without the Minister giving further guarantees.  I understand that other approaches are being made to resolve the hedging issue and we are facilitating consideration of that by providing the expertise of the National Treasury Management Agency to work with the administrators to see if they can work a solution.</p></speech>

In light of that he asked the State Claims Agency, which has specialist skills in the area, to undertake a review of the process in Quinn Insurance Limited.   He was satisfied.  The State Claims Agency review was also wrong because it led to the increase from &euro;600 million to &euro;738 million, which is just half of what could potentially be called upon.  The Minister did have direct involvement.  He wanted to be satisfied and he was given either wrong or inaccurate information.  In light of the fact that this figure has been revised upwards on five occasions, how can we be satisfied that this is the final figure and the final call upon on the public in regard to Quinn Insurance Limited?</p></speech>

We are doing everything we can to oversee the process to ensure that costs are kept to a minimum.  We are relying to some extent on the Minister&rsquo;s appointment of Ciar&aacute;n Breen from the State Claims Agency as chairman of the claims advisory committee to achieve progress on the matter.  The initial engagement of the State Claims Agency was at the request of the Minister also but it did a preliminary and short review of the risk assessment and the reserves requirement.  It was the State Claims Agency that put a flag up saying that in its experience this seemed to have been considerably underestimated and needed to be reviewed further.  That resulted in the administrators engaging further and digging deeper into the issue and finding an increased hole in reserves.</p><p>  We are not involved on a day-to-day basis but we have an interest in protecting the taxpayers&rsquo; interest.  We will meet regularly with the chairman of the claims advisory committee, Ciar&aacute;n Breen, from the State Claims Agency, and with the administrators to satisfy ourselves that everything that can be done is being done.</p></speech>

It would not be unusual for us to have a relationship with a supervisor in another country where they have a physical presence, which is the case both in Northern Ireland and in Manchester.  The concerns were expressed in that context.  I hope I did not leave the committee with the impression that we did not act on the concerns, as we did, and explanations were sought from the company and answers were provided.  There were a lot of rumours circulating about the company but, unfortunately, when one needs to act and go before the High Court to apply for administrators one must have firm, tangible evidence.  When that was available, we did act.</p><p>  Deputy Doherty asked a question of my colleagues about the certainty around the &euro;1.65 billion.  It seems to me that what has caused an awful lot of the anguish is the jump from the &euro;775 million to &euro;1.65 billion.  As I said in court last month, the work the administrators have done is based on a robust process.  One will not see anything like that size of an increase again but reserve estimation is not static.  I would not like anyone to leave the meeting with the impression that the amount could not go up incrementally again.  Everyone is working towards reducing the call in so far as it is possible.  The administrators are judging their performance on keeping the amount to within the range of &euro;1.1 billion to &euro;1.3 billion.  From my perspective and that of the protection of the policyholders of Quinn, it is very important that they make adequate provision, whatever that will be.  As Deputy Doherty said, the claims were there on the day the company went into administration.  The frustration has been in trying to get to that and to get to how bad it was.  We are where we are now but there is no absolute certainty.  One cannot have absolute certainty on the final figure but I sincerely hope it does not reach &euro;1.65 billion.</p></speech>

I am sure many other people share my frustration that the agencies of the State failed to recognise what was happening and failed to act appropriately in advance to limit the losses or the liability of the State.  We have had problems with the banks and now we have the insurance company.  There is nothing to indicate that this scenario will not repeat itself.  If one looks back on history we have had banks in the same situation 20 years ago as they are now and levies being imposed on people.  We have a regulator to regulate them but it failed to see a potential &euro;1.65 billion loss.  What went wrong and what will be done to ensure that difficulties will not arise in the case of another insurance company, bank or financial institution that the Central Bank regulates, and that the witnesses will not be put in front of a committee to say that PricewaterhouseCoopers gave them a report and that an auditor gave them another report?  What is in place to satisfy people at home who are being screwed as a result of the financial institutions that what has happened will not happen again and that the agencies of the State are robust enough and have sufficient manpower and tools to make sure this does not happen?  Does the Central Bank need anything or could assurances be provided that it is sufficiently strong and robust to ensure this will not happen in the future?</p></speech>

We have had reports from Nyberg, Watson and Regling and Professor Honohan&rsquo;s own report.  As an organisation we were under-resourced by any standard.  Now we are at a place where we are at least in keeping with best practice internationally.  I referred previously to the engagement model we now have with firms.  The capacity of the office has been increased massively.  The capability and the specialists we now have within the organisation have been increased substantially.  In terms of our supervisory powers, some have already been amended and others are currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Again, it is a little like the reserves, I cannot give an absolute guarantee.  Nobody can ever guarantee that nothing will happen.  We have seen insurance failures in the past in other jurisdictions and it is well documented that things were hidden from supervisors.  If people are so minded, that can be done and there is very little a supervisor can do in that regard.  We have close, continuous and ongoing engagement with the firms based on their impact category and the potential impact they could have on the Exchequer.  A lot of work has been done.  It would be wrong of us to ever conclude that we are there now.  We should always try to improve our processes.  We are considerably better equipped and empowered to do the job we are statutorily obliged to do than we were prior to the crisis.</p></speech>

I am of an age with those who were affected by the PMPA.  Reference was made to brokers not working with Quinn Insurance Limited and inquiries were being made from outside the State.</p> <p>For the Central Bank to say it was under-resourced and that it could not act unless there was firm evidence does not hold with the public, and it certainly does not hold with me.  It happened previously.  The flags went up but the Central Bank was slow to react.  Those are the facts.  We let a PMPA type situation happen again on the Central Bank's watch, and what I am hearing disgusts me.  It is not about the jump but that it happened at all.</p><p> Deputy Doherty asked a question but it was glanced over.  The statement that it stays in the administrator's historical audited accounts has turned out not to be accurate.  The term "looked into" was used.  What exactly are the witnesses looking into?  What kind of action are they considering?  What measures do they intend to take.  What is happening now because of those historical inaccuracies in the audited accounts?  What steps have the Central Bank and the administrator taken in that regard?</p></speech>

I hope the delegation will agree that this is a pretty sickening episode in the pretty awful recent history of this country.  On top of all the other crises concerning the banks and financial system, we have the mess in Quinn Insurance.  Hundreds of thousands of ordinary families and householders are on the hook again, this time for &euro;1.6 billion.  If I understand Mr. Cullinan correctly, we cannot say for certain that the figure will not be higher.  We could be forgiven for being alarmed by that thought given that the estimates have been revised upwards fairly dramatically in recent times.</p><p>  The main cause of this is obviously the cowboy capitalism in which the Quinn family was engaged, driven by nothing but greed.  Will the delegates from the Central Bank state how this could have happened?  That a company could be engaged in this sort of reckless mismanagement, and falsely declaring profits when making losses, represents a catastrophic failure of regulation.  There was massive under-provisioning against potential losses or claims, and none of this was spotted.  Could the delegates from the Central Bank explain the nature of the supervision, or the lack thereof, during the period in question?  What was the nature of the relationship and how was the supervision carried out?  If the delegates were under-resourced, did they tell this to the then Government or state it publicly?  Did they state they were worried that they did not have sufficient resources to carry out the necessary supervision of people such as Mr. Quinn?  If the Central Bank was not complaining about this, it was also culpable.  It is not good enough just to pass the buck, although I do not doubt the Government has to take some responsibility.  The public would like some accountability.  Who was to blame for the fact the Central Bank was under-resourced?  Was it because of the ideological commitment to light touch regulation of the previous Government?  Is that why we are paying the &euro;1.6 billion?  Was it because of the failure of the Central Bank itself to ring the alarm bells about its lack of resources or power to regulate the industry properly?</p><p>  On the issue of profits which were actually losses, profits were taken out of the firm by the Quinn family, which was the sole shareholder.  Gifts were mentioned.  Some &euro;135 million was given to Quinn Group Family Properties, or just to the Quinn family, and some &euro;75 million was given to Barlo Financial Services.  What precisely is that company?  Is it just another front for the Quinn family?  Do these sums comprise the same &euro;200 million that Mr. Quinn described as adding to the personal wealth portfolio of his children?  Did he not give &euro;200 million to his children a few years ago?</p><p>  How much profit did the Quinn family make when it was declaring profits falsely and were there more gifts than those I have mentioned?  What is the Central Bank doing to get the money back off the Quinns?  Is there any action that can be taken to limit the call on Irish policyholders and the fund by getting back the money that was essentially robbed from the company by-----</p></speech>

The false declaration of losses as profits and the reckless mismanagement that underlay this practice are pretty criminal by any public or objective standard.  What is the Central Bank doing or what can it do to pursue the money that was handed out to the Quinn family?</p><p>  If I understand the delegates correctly, they are saying they had not adequately got to grips with the problem of the Central Bank's failure to recognise the degree of under-provision for the losses in the Quinn company because of the urgency of selling Quinn Insurance.  As one who opposed the sale of Quinn Insurance and who still fails to see the logic of selling it, I do not see the logic behind the people covering the losses, bailing out the company and then handing to Liberty Insurance what could, I presume, be a profitable enterprise.  Why was there a rush to sell the company rather than nationalising it such that potential profits could be used to cover the losses we have incurred?  Who made the decision to sell?  Was pressure exerted by the Government or was it the Central Bank's decision?  I would like to know the circumstances surrounding the matter.</p><p>  Let me consider the question of fees.  Some &euro;14 million was paid over three years to the administrators.  This is a pretty sizeable sum.  How many people were working on this case to account for remuneration at that level?  Is this another cost for ordinary insurance holders and people who have already had a big burden imposed on them unfairly?  Could the delegates attempt to justify the payment of &euro;14 million over three years as a reasonable cost for the work they have done?</p></speech>

I accept Deputy Humphreys' point that it is not just a question of the jump.  The rise from &euro;775 million to &euro;1.65 billion was exponential; the sum has more than doubled.  I do not expect that again but I would not like anyone to leave with the impression that the &euro;1.65 billion is absolutely static.  We all hope the figure will be much lower.  Claims concerning people with brain injuries, for example, develop over time so one cannot know the absolute cost until the end of the process.  It is important that whatever we can say in this regard is understood.</p><p>  A couple of points were made on gifts.  They were really what I would describe as dividends.  One might ask the difference.  It was just a mechanism for paying money up through the group for what I assume were tax-efficiency purposes.</p> <p>As for anything to do with adding to the personal wealth of anyone's family or anything else like that, I have no idea.  We were the supervisors of Quinn Insurance Limited and not of the Quinn Group or any particular individuals or individual shareholders of that group.  Barlo Financial Services Limited was the group treasury function of the Quinn Group and, in that regard, it would not be unusual for dividends to go to a group treasury function.</p><p> As for the supervision, I have spoken about this previously in terms of the under-resourcing and similar issues.  I have spoken about the additional powers we were given and I do not wish to repeat myself on that point, given the time available to the joint committee.  One important lesson learned, which has been picked up in respect of both fitness and probity and in the acquisitions directive that came into force in 2009, is about dominance.  It also is very important that we have good governance within all these companies, which is a vital point to understand.</p></speech>

I am afraid I do not have much of an answer for the Deputy in that regard as at that time, prior to the crisis, I was not in a position where I would be demanding such things in respect of resources within the Central Bank.  Certainly, in my own personal capacity, I absolutely raised the issue of resources in the context of my ability, as a member of the insurance supervision team, to supervise the extent of companies we were obliged to supervise and to do so adequately.  While I am aware this was passed further up the line, beyond that I simply do not have the knowledge to state where it went after that point.</p></speech>

No insurance company remaining in administration is a long-term viable enterprise because people seek certainty when picking an insurance company.  Consequently, it was critical that we had a sale and that a sale occurred because, otherwise, I note the company's sales were declining during the period of administration because a company being in administration does not provide customer confidence.  In addition, administrators cannot make strategic decisions on items such as capital expenditure and so on because the company was loss-making at the same time.  Consequently, it was necessary to sell the company and to do so as quickly as possible.  We were also faced with a clear possibility that there would be no sale.  This was not a case in which a queue of people was lining up to purchase the company.  We did the best deal possible to secure the 1,500 jobs and had we not achieved the sale, they would have been lost.  The Deputy also raised the question of benefit to the State and what is important in the future is that, both directly and indirectly, the State has a 50% interest in Liberty Insurance.  That company is now run by professionals, in the sense that they are from the fifth largest insurance company in the world.  They run the business and have the expertise and the access to capital.  They have all the know-how to run an insurance company properly and the State has an indirect 50% stake in that business in the future.  If that business is successful, the Irish State will benefit.</p></speech>

It would have entailed more than 50 people at various stages over the past three years.  Of the &euro;14 million, more than &euro;6 million of it basically was paid to our firm in the United Kingdom in respect of a full actuarial division of up to 15 actuaries at any one time working on the case because Quinn Insurance had no in-house actuarial division during the time it was trading.  Consequently, &euro;6 million of the figure of &euro;14 million relates to the UK payment for actuarial fees.  As for the total of &euro;8 million, we also had a property portfolio, if one wishes to call it that, of more than &euro;448 million.  We had asset management and were obliged to get buildings ready for disposal.  We sold the hotel in Cambridgeshire for &pound;35 million last August.  We have fundamental issues to walk through to get each of those assets ready for sale and to maximise the value for the taxpayer.  It takes substantial time and effort to get the assets to its maximum value for sale.  The figure of &euro;8 million involves tax, forensics and asset management, as well as the core administration team that was involved in the day-to-day operation of the company itself in respect of both running it and on the sales side.</p></speech>

Whatever about business failure in itself, business failure that is engineered because of deliberate mismanagement, maladministration and greed is something the joint committee must address to ascertain how the pieces can be picked up.  In that sense, I note the witnesses before members today are not the bad guys in many respects, although I have some critical questions I wish to ask.  In the very first paragraph of his opening remarks, Mr. McAteer stated the company did not contest the appointment of an administrator.  For the benefit of members, he might elaborate further on the reception that awaited the administrators when they arrived at Quinn Insurance Limited.  The fact the company did not object to the appointment of an administrator might appear to suggest it was prepared to work with Mr. McAteer in a spirit of co-operation to try to secure the employees and the business in the future.  Mr. McAteer might elaborate on this and whether this was the position.  In that context and in respect of the administrators' preliminary reports to the courts, with hindsight, does Mr. McAteer think there was an excessive reliance on senior management with regard to the guesstimate he was in a position to make at an early stage?  Was there an excessive reliance on senior management as to what the call might be on the insurance fund?</p></speech>

Neither I nor any of my staff were treated with disrespect in any way and the Quinn Insurance staff should be commended in this regard because of the uncertainty they faced regarding their own livelihoods and future.  As for the estimates one puts before the courts at any time, it is fair to state we based those estimates on the information provided to us from both internal and external sources.  In hindsight, an over-reliance on those numbers is one reason the figure is where it is today.</p></speech>

The information of which I am aware is that there were a number of directors who did not know of the existence of these guarantees.  While I was not involved beforehand, my understanding is that when the former board of Quinn Insurance, which was made up of a number of non-executive directors, became aware of the existence of the guarantees, it immediately contacted the Central Bank.  It would appear these guarantees had been in existence for several years before that.</p></speech>

How would the management of individual claims and cases at Quinn Insurance been at variance with best practice in the industry?  How can what appears to be a calamitous and deliberately engineered systemic under-provisioning be explained in individual cases?  For example, if I were to break my leg, my insurance company would have a process which marks down that this could cost a certain amount including higher costs for surgery.  There must be a process by which case management filters upwards regarding the amount of reserves required as individual cases are managed.</p></speech>

In terms of the accuracy of the reserves and the level of certainty one can build around reserving, as Mr. Cullinan stated it is not a precise science.  The core foundation is the file estimates.  When a file comes, say, for an injury, one has a snapshot of what is involved.  If one has the right balance of experience and knowledge in the organisation, one can give a reasonable estimate of what the claim is likely to cost.</p><p>  One of the issues in Quinn Insurance is what is described as a culture of optimistic or aggressive reserving.  If a more conventional view was a figure of X, Quinn Insurance would tend to target a much lower number on the estimate.  If the estimate were low, then the actuarial reserving on top of that would miss it.  This would lead to a compounding of the error and the error in the file estimate.  There was a culture of aggressive reserving while processes and controls were not strong.  This was backed up by the State Claims Agency when it went into the company.  There were some examples of deliberately under-reserving which led to sanctions against some individuals in the claims department.  There was a foundation around the file estimation of the company which was not up to the standards one would expect.</p><p>  In fairness to the administration, much of that was done in the first 18 months.  How long did it take to find this?  It took three exercises at different stages with different degrees of pressure to get the file estimates up to the level that was regarded as satisfactory.</p><p>  When one is trying to project into the future the cost of any claim, one is dealing with the potential deterioration in the injury that the individual has suffered, external environmental issues, changes in legislation and the decisions of the courts.  It is a complex area and is not amenable to a precise figure.  Hence, when we give the committee a figure that we consider is robust and prudent, we are 80% certain about it but there is 20% risk depending on what happens in the external environment.</p><p>  There was a culture in the company of aggressive reserving and there was probably not the right skills set within the company for managing, particularly the more complex claims.  These two issues together created a scenario in which there was much under-provisioning of the files which the actuarial provisioning then accentuated the problem as it did not adequately pick up on that.  I do not want to go into it too much further because there are issues there where we feel some of these matters should have been picked up.  We will be examining that in the context of legal action.  Another difficulty is that some of the claims go back to 2000 and it takes a long time for the more complex claims to settle.</p><p>  Broadly speaking, there was a culture of aggressive provisioning and lack of adequate experience, knowledge and controls.  These have now been addressed and we have adequate reassurance from our investigations that the situation today is satisfactory from our perspective.</p></speech>

That was the end of an engagement which, according to the presentation, began in 2008.  Over a period of 27 or 28 months, as Mr. Cullinan presents it to the committee, they were in the last chance saloon.  I put it to Mr. Cullinan that four months after the appointment of the administrator they were in a position to quantify, through the involvement of EMB, that there was an under-reserving of &euro;400 million.  Twenty-seven or 28 months after the Central Bank began exploring the extent of its concerns, it was arguing over a figure of &euro;68 million.  Given that Quinn did not have in-house actuarial experience and that the UK financial regulatory authorities had been in contact with the Central Bank, and notwithstanding the fact that the Central Bank did not have in-house expertise but had at all times the option of availing of external assistance in this matter, does Mr. Cullinan accept that that is a fairly shoddy record of regulation?</p></speech>

By way of reassurance, however, all of the other major high-impact companies operating now in the country have in-house actuarial resources.  Throughout the noughties, the actuarial resources available to the Central Bank varied between zero and two, and they were almost exclusively devoted towards the development of the Solvency II directive, which is coming from Europe and is probably the biggest piece of legislation ever in the insurance arena.</p><p>  Outsourcing was not an option for us.  The Insurance Act 1989, under section 60, provides for the appointment of authorised officers.  It was only through appointing an authorised officer that we could go in and conduct the level of investigation that would be required in order to carry out a reserving exercise of the type that EMB undertook.  It was not until the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 that the Act was amended to allow us to appoint third parties.  Outsourcing the function and getting the capability from outside the Central Bank was not an option.</p></speech>

This afternoon's proceedings are a bit of an eye-opener.</p><p>  As a taxpayer and somebody who pays the 2% insurance levy for this compensation fund every year, the issue of Quinn Insurance Limited is one of those subjects that has been moving around in the back of my head for a long time.  The amount of money we are talking about is staggering.</p><p>  Mr. McAteer, in his presentation, set out the facts and the financial and operational position upon his appointment.  He had to go in and deal with what was there.  According to what was revealed here this afternoon, it was not a pretty picture.</p><p>  There was mention here that the Quinn family extracted &euro;200 million in 2007 and 2008 by way of gifts.  It appears these gifts were money transfers to internal property companies within the Quinn Group.  The Central Bank representative described these as perhaps not gifts, but tax efficiencies.  Is it the case that there was tax evasion?</p><p>  It has been revealed here that the practices the company was engaged in were at best questionable and at worst, perhaps, reckless.  It could be described as Wild West capitalism and some have described it as that.  It is alarming that a major insurance company in Ireland was engaged in siphoning off more than &euro;200 million and using it for internal companies - it now appears the money was used mainly overseas to buy up property - at a time when its balance sheets were in a precarious state.  What I want to know is what the regulator or the Central Bank was doing.  Who was supposed to be protecting the small people such as us who pay their 2% levy and their PAYE every week, or why were we not being protected?</p></speech>

It is not only the insurance compensation fund that the taxpayer is being hit with.  The activities of companies such as this, associated companies and banks have landed us in a considerable mess in this State.  Who was supposed to be protecting us during all of this time?</p></speech>

I want to clarify that in the context of a great deal of media speculation about people and everything else.  These were proper - for want of a better expression - inter-company transfers and I have no reason to believe for a second that there was any tax evasion involved, particularly not on the part of Quinn Insurance at that time.  I want to clarify the issue of gifts.  Sometimes, what items are described as in the accounts are not necessarily what they might appear.  I have no reason to believe there was any tax evasion.</p><p>  The responsibility for complying with the insurance Acts and the regulations, which are in place to fundamentally protect policy holders and, more widely and indirectly, the wider taxpayer, rested squarely with Quinn Insurance and those charged with the management of that company.  The role of the Central Bank is to ensure as far as possible that such companies comply with the requirements and, indeed, to act when they do not do so.  I have already explained why certain things were not done in the past as well as they might have been and how we feel we have rectified and will continue to improve that in the future.</p></speech>

Given the figures outlined here today and the types of practice that were being carried out within the company, it is clear that it was not happening.  What I am really concerned about is whether I can be sure, walking out of this room today, that some other insurance company or outfit are not involved in leading us into a situation like this again.  What guarantees do we have in this regard, and what is the Central Bank doing about it?  Perhaps someone from the Department of Finance might like to reply as well.</p></speech>

Our resources are dedicated towards those firms that could have the highest impact.  We have increased capacity, we have increased capability and the resources are directed towards those companies that could have the highest impact.  There are seven other high-impact insurance companies out there.  I do not believe Quinn Insurance was a proxy for those other companies.  I think they believe in a better way.  They must all comply with the corporate governance code requirements and the various other requirements that are in place.  They all have in-house actuarial functions.  There is considerably more reassurance we can take with regard to those other entities, both in terms of their own compliance and in terms of our increased supervision of those entities.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the good work that has been done in maintaining so many jobs in the current climate.</p><p>  In regard to the industry&rsquo;s processes, as a layperson it is extraordinary that an insurance company would not employ actuaries.  The actuarial process seems to be at the core of the insurance business.  Did the auditors have actuarial experience?  The reserve account was underestimated by &euro;250 million over a four year period.  How could an auditor allow that to happen?</p></speech>

There is no equivalent provision for non-life companies.  I concur with the Deputy that it appears extraordinary but, as I noted earlier, I do not necessarily see Quinn Insurance as a proxy for the rest of the industry.  The rest of the industry did employ actuarial functions.  Under the solvency II directive, all insurance companies are required to have actuarial functions.  If there is a deficit from a legislative perspective it will be addressed by means of that directive.</p><p>  In regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s second question, it is the case that auditors have actuarial functions.</p></speech>

Clearly in this case not only was no one blowing the whistle but there was not even a whistle to blow.  Does the Central Bank contain a dedicated separate division for the insurance industry, given that it is the regulator for the banking and insurance sectors?</p></speech>

The period we are discussing is between 2006 and 2009, which was a period in which this country had more money than ever before and, perhaps, ever again.  Mr. Cullinan&rsquo;s comment that the Central Bank was under-resourced is significant and should be borne in mind by the committee.  I presume the same could be said of banking supervision.  The insurance industry was supervised by a specific division.  At a time when the Government had unlimited capacity, did Mr. Cullinan seek the resources that could have saved the Irish taxpayer &euro;1.6 billion?</p></speech>

There were allegations, for example, of retired garda&iacute; being used to visit claimants in their homes, etc.  Did the Central Bank look into that?  It was widely reported at the time.  Will Mr. McAteer give an assurance that nothing like that is happening in the new manifestation of the company?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-10a.386" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Domhnall Cullinan" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2012101000017#Q01500"><p>I want to be a little careful about what I say in this regard because I think it is related back to a <i>Sunday Tribune</i> report, if memory serves, and the company may have taken some sort of action.  I do not know where that lies, particularly given the newspaper is no longer with us.  Many people spoke about the model that company had.  The real problem with Quinn Insurance was the large claims.  We refer to the smaller claims as attritional claims such as the fender benders and the slip and trips.  The model they had for that is probably more the model to which the Deputy is referring.  With any model like that where the cost is &euro;10,000 and one settles for &euro;7,000 and somebody views that as a &euro;3,000 profit, there is a danger in that one of the basic principles of insurance is to indemnify people in order that if they lose, they are compensated for their financial loss.  It is equally wrong to overcompensate them but they should be in the same position after the claim has been settled as before it.  That is the fear in that type of model.  What I can certainly say to the Deputy is in terms of complaints about Quinn Insurance claims settlement and the company's compliance with our consumer protection code and the rules, there were no significant issues and there was not a significant level of complaints, certainly as compared to their peers.  While I am aware of the allegation, it did not manifest itself in a manner within the Central Bank that I could make any comment on beyond that.</p></speech>

There are significant codes of practice laid down relating to the operations of people who interface with customers relating to settlements of attritional claims.  They are onerous and good and something we would want to fully adhere to.  As chief executive officer, I definitely would not have any truck with the activity of approaching claimants with a view to forcing them into settlements that are not fair and reasonable relative to the injury they have suffered.  The Deputy can take it for sure that as far as we can governance will ensure people are treated fairly as regards claims.</p></speech>

I refer to the accounts and the financial operation position upon appointment.  It states, "The surplus was after the Quinn family had extracted approximately &euro;200 million over the previous two years by gift".   Is that from the QIL group?  How was that reflected in the accounts?  Was it as a director's loan or inter-company loans?  What was the money used for?  It seems an extraordinary amount, equating to &euro;100 million per year.</p></speech>

I would guess this but gifts usually mean that the money was written off between companies.  Money was owed by Barlo Financial Services to the tune of &euro;75 million and then written off and, therefore, treated as a gift.</p></speech>

Can Mr. Cullinan explain how QIL was able to operate with reserves, which appeared to be significantly less than other insurance companies were providing in the market?  Clearly, anecdotally or otherwise, it was significantly undercutting other insurance companies and gaining significant market share.  The purpose of regulation is to ensure there is a level playing field.  How did it happen that QIL was clearly operating with smaller reserves than other companies?  I ask Mr. Cullinan and to explain the regulation that allowed that to continue.  Shortly after Mr. Elderfield had been appointed as Financial Regulator he moved to put the group into administration.  I believe that related to pressure on the QIL group in terms of guarantees and so forth.  How was the QIL group allowed to operate with reserves so much smaller than other insurance companies?</p></speech>

That statement is also subject to the audit of the company's auditors.  If the signing actuary cannot provide an unqualified statement, he or she must whistle-blow to the Central Bank.  We never received a whistleblowing report in respect of QIL from its signing actuaries.  During its interaction with the company, PwC highlighted to us that there were some differences between the calculations of Milliman, the signing actuaries, and PwC.  In 2009 and at the beginning of 2010, we facilitated a series of meetings between these bodies and informed QIL that it was unacceptable that these gaps existed.  So we were aware that there was arguably an element of deficit in the reserves, but not to the extent that subsequently transpired.</p><p>  I wish to revisit one or two points Mr. McAteer made.  I appreciate he is much more knowledgeable on matters of accounting, disclosures and rules than I am.  My understanding is that the &euro;200 million was actually cash that left the company and was not the cancellation of intercompany balance.</p></speech>

It can happen by way of director's loan or director's salary.  It was hardly motor expenses - it would be a bit high.  The other way is through inter-company loan.  Does Mr. Cullinan believe that this went out to individual directors of the company?</p></speech>

We did not have the capability of doing it.  Throughout the 2000s, as I said earlier, our actuarial capacity was between zero and two, and they were almost exclusively devoted towards working on the Solvency II directive that was coming about in Europe.  Ideally what one would do in those circumstances would be to outsource it.  That was not an avenue that was open to us because of the way section 16 of the Insurance Act was drafted.</p></speech>

It has been reported by informed journalists who had carried out analysis and who reported on what was known in the public domain.  Quinn Insurance Limited had descriptions on its balance sheet when PwC was addressing that balance sheet.  I am not sure if it was for 2007 or 2008, but it related to balances on deposit.  On further examination it turned out that those balances on deposit were in fact inter-company and group holding balances which had been "borrowed from" Quinn Group Holdings for Quinn Insurance Limited.</p> <p>When the matter was looked into, the regulator and the auditors said it had to be rectified and it was done over a period of about nine months by equal instalment repayments to the group holding company and back into the insurance company.  A fine of &euro;3 million was imposed on the company, the largest fine in banking and financial history in this country.  However, it was not even a slap on the wrist.  If the amount had been &euro;400 million, as it was at one stage, that would have amounted to three quarters of 1% for what had been a raid on cash reserves.  Flags were waving, multiple alarms were sounding and orange lights were flashing, yet complacency seemed to follow and again there was drift, which was extraordinary.</p></speech>

I hope I got the pronunciation right as I rarely call him by his surname.  He is accompanied by Mr. Mahdi Babakazemi, third counsellor at the embassy in Dublin.  I sincerely thank the ambassador for accepting our invitation so promptly.  The committee has asked him here to discuss a number of issues that have been raised by visitors to the committee or by way of correspondence and we look forward to hearing his views on these.  The matters the committee has signalled it wishes to discuss are: Iran's nuclear programme and the associated sanctions, which is an important topic at present and dominates the news headlines; reports that anti-Semitic comments have been made by the Vice President of Iran; the organisation known as the People's Mujahideen Organisation of Iran and related issues of Camp Ashraf; and the protection of human rights in Iran, including the rights of adherents to the Baha'i faith.  We would also like to discuss broader issues, including bilateral relations between Ireland and Iran - we consider that extremely important as well - and the prospect of developing a trade relationship.  The ambassador has been working extremely hard over the last year or so to encourage trade between Ireland and Iran, and a number of delegations from the educational and agricultural sectors have come from Iran in recent times with a view to improving trade with our country.  That is very important.</p><p>  Before inviting you to make your presentation, I wish to advise you that you are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at the committee.  However, if you are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of your remarks.  You are directed that only comments and evidence relating to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite you to address the committee.</p></speech>

Mr. Hossein Panahiazar" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2012101000002#A00300"><p>First, I thank the committee for inviting me.  It is a pleasure and an honour to be here to discuss the issues of interest for both countries.  I will speak in my introduction about my country and perhaps in the members' questions we will discuss all the issues that are important for both sides.</p><p>  Members will have a general idea about Iran but I will only mention some points.  In the name of God, Iran, which is known also as Persia, with several thousands years of history and civilisation, is located in a strategic area of the Middle East.  It has 15 neighbours, some of them with a variety of regional problematic issues.  Iran has a population of 75 million and is located in a region with a population of 300 million.  We have very close relations in that area.</p><p>  The Islamic revolution of 1979 was rooted in the constitutional movement in Iran in 1905, whereupon, for the first time in that region, Iranian people could realise their right to have a national parliament.  Five decades later, in a popular uprising, Iranians were able to overcome the dictatorship of the Shah and introduce a popular government.  Unfortunately, it was subsequently suppressed by a foreign-supported <i>coup d'&eacute;tat</i> in 1953, and the Shah came back to power.  The struggle was not over, and two decades later new ways of uprising led to the collapse of the Shah's regime in 1979.  The Islamic revolution came up with the slogans of independence and freedom, and a new age of political, economic and cultural life began for the Iranian people based on those slogans.  Following the revolution the state's main policies basically changed, especially foreign policy.  At the top, there was a withdrawal from military alliances.  Iran was part of the western military alliance in that region.  We hosted more than 30,000 military experts in that time and they all had to leave.  We joined the Non-Aligned Movement, ceased our relations with the apartheid regime in South Africa and supported Mr. Mandela and the African National Congress, ANC.  We shifted our foreign policy towards supporting the Palestinians' legal rights.</p> <p>In terms of regional policy, Iran has always taken and promoted peaceful approaches as a part of the solution.  It has helped to find just solutions through diplomacy and dialogue.  During the past 30 years Iran hosted more than 3 million Afghan and Iraqi refugees and displaced persons.  We still have more than 1.5 million refugees and Iran is one of the largest refugee destinations in the world.  We have also been a pioneer in the fight against drug trafficking, despite the huge casualties and expense.  We have a long border with Afghanistan, approximately 1,000 km in length.  In terms of economic capacity, Iran is third in oil reserves and second in natural gas reserves in the world and, as such, is a significant energy exporter.</p><p> In terms of bilateral relations, Iran and Ireland established formal relations approximately four decades ago, during which our co-operation has been positive.  The two countries have often had common viewpoints and positions towards a wide range of international issues, particularly with regard to disarmament.  Political and parliamentary delegations have repeatedly visited each other in Tehran and Dublin.  A total of nine parliamentary delegations, including delegations from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs - now including the term "Trade" - have visited Iran and exchanged views.  We are interested in continuing co-operation with the Irish Parliament, and establishing parliamentary friendship groups in the parliaments of both countries will help in this objective.</p><p> In terms of economic relations, in the past, between 1976 and 1996, when BSE emerged in Europe and the importation of Irish beef to Iran was stopped, the total annual imports of beef from Ireland to Iran was 50,000 tonnes, which was quite high.  Despite the closure of the Irish Embassy in Tehran last year, our embassy attaches great importance to the expansion of relations between our two countries and has worked hard to remove the ban on the imports of Irish beef to Iran.  With the efforts of our embassy, a high ranking delegation from the Veterinary Organisation of Iran visited Ireland in April of this year.  I am honoured and pleased to announce that the process route of Irish beef shipments to Iran has been concluded and the ban is lifted.</p><p> Total beef production in Iran is approximately one million tonnes per annum but we still have a shortage of between 50,000 and 200,000 tonnes, which is mainly supplied from other countries but by the same Irish dealers who used to export beef directly from Ireland.  Therefore, the connections still exist.  Currently, the bilateral trade volume between Iran and Ireland is about &euro;87 million, &euro;80 million of which is Irish exports to Iran.  To speed up the process of Irish beef exports to Iran, as well as to increase the bilateral trade relations, my specific proposal is that a delegation from this committee, headed by the Chairman, Deputy Pat Breen, would travel to Tehran where they can meet their counterparts and relevant officials in the chamber of commerce.  Such a trip will surely encourage more business ties between the two countries.</p><p> Regarding the other areas for trade and co-operation between the two countries, I will only mention two important fields.  With our increasing population, the Iranian market has the potential to attract all kinds of pharmaceutical products from Ireland.  Furthermore, because the population in Iran is overwhelmingly young, the numbers of Iranians wishing to attend foreign universities in all fields is increasing.  Last year there were approximately 600,000 participants in the entrance exams for PhD courses in Iran but we have only 75,000 places.  The remainder of the students will have to reapply for subsequent years or else try to gain entrance to foreign universities.  The presence of good, high ranking universities in Ireland means our two countries can work successfully in this area.  However, the long process of granting visas to foreign students needs to be changed.</p><p> These are the main points that I wanted to raise in my introduction.  I should also say that the EU regulations regarding trade with Iran, which were established in 2010, very clearly exempt food, agricultural products, medicines or goods for other humanitarian purposes.  The regulations also mention that the normal trade between EU countries and Iran can continue.  Therefore, the areas where there is potential for increasing trade between our two countries are outside the restrictions currently in place in the EU.</p><p> I am sure the committee will ask questions about nuclear and other issues, so I will leave those matters to the question and answer session to follow.</p></speech>

He knows these questions will be asked and he will not have to answer them twice.  I welcome the fact Iran is about to lift the ban on Irish beef, which is a welcome boost for Irish agriculture and a vote of confidence in that sector.  We look forward to seeing the effect that will have on agriculture here.  I also thank the ambassador for his invitation, which we will discuss further in the context of our work programme for the remainder of the year.</p></speech>

I also welcome the remarks by the Chairman concerning the ambassador's work here in trying to increase bilateral trade and relations between both countries.  On the issue of the export of food, especially beef, I understand the ban was lifted last July but that certain technical details must be sorted out before exports can begin again.  As the ambassador is aware, the standards of animal husbandry and food production in this country are exceptionally high, right through from the farms to the processing facilities.  As a country we have welcomed, over the years, senior veterinary delegations from countries all over the world to see at first hand how our food production system works.  We are very proud of that system and the high standards we maintain.  I ask the ambassador to try to ensure that whatever technical details are outstanding are finalised as soon as possible.  I am sure the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister will be able to meet any of the reasonable demands made in respect of certification and assurance for the products for potential export.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions on various matters.</p> <p>The nuclear matter was raised.  Ireland was a driving force in the creation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.  In 1968 it was opened for signature and Ireland was one of the first states invited to sign it.  I am proud of that history and believe Ireland should continue to play a leading role in supporting nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.</p><p> Many parties represented here have no difficulty with Iran developing nuclear technology for civilian, peaceful purposes that are fully supervised.  Looking at released intelligence reports from the US and Israel, it appears Iran does not have a nuclear weapons programme.  I base that on experts such as Professor Paul Tiller, who worked for the CIA for 28 years, Mr. Peter Jenkins, the British ambassador to the IAEA between 2001 and 2006, and Mr. Hans Blix.  I am conscious the director of intelligence reports to the US Congress going back to 2007, when asked if Iran has a nuclear weapons programme, has answered in the negative.  Is there any evidence that would suggest Iran seeks to develop nuclear weapons?  I am conscious the supreme Ayatollah Khomeini has said that would be a grave sin.  Would the grave sin relate to the stockpiling of such weapons or their use?  What happened to the 20% enriched uraniam swap deal for Iran that was brokered by Brazil and Turkey?  It appears to have been pushed to one side.</p><p> I am conscious that there are double standards in the sanctions being applied by some western countries to Iran, including Ireland.  Oil sanctions are hurting the Iranian economy.  There were reports in the media about the Iranian rial collapsing by 20%.  These are not UN-mandated sanctions and Ireland and the EU are not under any obligation to apply them.  How are the sanctions affecting the Iranian economy and Iranian people, particularly the poor? </p><p> Amnesty International appeared before the committee in October 2010 and outlined reports on human rights violations in Iran.  The case of a Nazrim Sotooday was raised as an example of the jailing of a human rights lawyer.  She is being held in Evim security prison, where conditions are reportedly dreadful, with reports of prisoners being tortured.  Would the Iranian Government have any problem with Irish parliamentarians travelling to Iran and visiting that jail to meet some of the prisoners?  We are worried about the reports about torture, prisoners undertaking hunger strikes.  I do not expect and answer today but perhaps the ambassador will go back to the Iranian authorities to ask them to open up their jails to a visit by parliamentarians.</p><p> Many Irish people would ask why the Assad regime in Syria is supported by the Iranian Government.  Is Iran concerned about the sectarian conflict that seems to be getting worse in the region?</p><p> Those are huge questions but I would be interested in hearing the ambassador's response on a visit to the prison.</p></speech>

I visited Iran twice some years ago and we are all keen students of history of the Egyptians, Persians, Greeks and Romans so we have an ongoing interest in the area.  Some of those regimes were very peaceful and educational and cultural while some were very war-like.  It is part of what we are.</p><p>  The question of weapons grade uranium and the development of a nuclear weapons programme is a difficulty that I understand.  Iran says it does not have any such programme and we must be convinced, which is a matter for the Iranians; they must convince the global community.  We know there was an unfortunate experience previously with Iraq and the weapons of mass destruction that did not exist.  We do not wish to engage in any way in a propaganda war suggesting that something exists when it does not.  We need, however, because of the seriousness of the situation in the region, to know what is going on.  If something like that is happening, it is of massive importance to Iran's neighbours and the rest of the global community.</p><p>  Anti-semitism has been discussed at this and other meetings.  Because of the sensitive nature of relations in the area anything said by either side to inflame passions is not of any benefit to anyone, not to Iran, its neighbours or the rest of us.  I would like clarification of this issue.  I am sorry the ambassador must leave so quickly.</p><p>  Human rights is a huge issue that this committee is particularly interested in.  Going back decades, the Irish Government has taken an interest in the issue.  While propaganda may give false impressions, from the information we have, and I would like to hear if it is true or not, it appears there is a problem with the observance of human rights in certain quarters with particular reference to the right of the individual to practice his own religion or customs.  Deputy Crowe mentioned prisons and people are judged by the manner in which they treat the people who are in custody.  It is vital for the benefit of those in power in any administration that human rights are strictly observed.  Deputy Crowe's point is valid.  Is it possible for international human rights observers to attend and engage with the Iranian authorities to reassure the rest of the global community that basic human rights are being observed?  That would be very important and beneficial in the entire Middle East.</p></speech>

We just received a letter yesterday and we will convey it today to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

We are going to supply the committee with a detailed paper in respect of this matter.  I should mention the fact that the nuclear programme in Iran was launched in the 1950s.  It is not new and it was started with the help of the United States as part of the atoms for peace programme.  In 1967 the Tehran nuclear research centre, in respect of which the US supplied a 5 MW nuclear research reactor, was established.  The centre was fuelled by enriched uranium.  Following the Iranian revolution, the United States cut off the supply of the enriched uranium required for the research centre.  The Tehran research reactor uses 20% enriched fuel to produce radioactive isotopes used to treat more than 1 million people who suffer from various diseases, mainly cancers.  This is the outcome of the research centre, which requires 20% enriched uranium.</p><p>  We have tried to import 20% enriched uranium, both through the International Atomic Energy Agency and from other countries.  Unfortunately, we have not received a positive response in this regard.  A proposal was put forward, by the US and others, that Iran should send out part of the enriched uranium - approximately 1,200 kg - and have it enriched to 20% and then returned for use in the research reactor.  This proposal was not successful.  The President and Prime Minister of Brazil and Turkey, respectively, came to Tehran and signed the deal.  Everything was finalised and I can supply to the committee the relevant letter that was published by the foreign Ministers of Brazil and Turkey.  It was our view that problem had been solved and that we would not be obliged to enrich uranium to 20% purity, particularly as this is very costly and we do not need that cost.  Unfortunately, the deal to which I refer did not work.  We were left, therefore, with a research centre and a reactor on which patients in Iran are dependent.  There was no possibility of obtaining the uranium required.  As a result, we had no choice other than to produce 20% enriched uranium ourselves.</p><p>  On 2 October, our President clearly stated that Iran had no alternative other than to enrich uranium to a purity level of 20% after the Western countries had refused to sell Iran the nuclear fuel it needed to operate its research centre reactor for producing the medical products required for patients.  The Western countries have refused Iran's requests on several occasions.  The President stated that we were even ready to give 3.5% enriched fuel to the West and to get back fuel enriched to 20%.  Again, the West was not ready to do this so we were forced to start enriching uranium to a purity level of 20%.  The President also emphasised, in New York and again during an interview in Tehran, that Iran is still willing to stop enriching uranium to 20% if the International Atomic Energy Agency members sell the required fuel to it.  Last week, in an interview with <i>Der Spiegel</i> in Germany, our Foreign Minister clearly stated:<blockquote>If our right to enrichment is recognised, we are prepared to offer an exchange.  We would voluntarily limit the extent of our enrichment programme, but in return we would need a guaranteed supply of the relevant fuels from abroad.</blockquote>Our proposal is very clear.  We are ready to stop enriching uranium to a purity level of 20% if a guarantee is given that the research centre will be supplied with the fuel it needs.  The research centre is the only place in Iran which supplies the material required to treat the patients to whom I refer.  Some 1 million Iranian patients rely on the materials produced at the centre.  As soon as the western countries reply positively to our proposal, we will cease producing the 20% enriched uranium about which they are concerned.</p><p>  As one of the members stated, none of the reports from either the IAEA or various intelligence services have provided evidence to the effect that Iran is working on nuclear weapons.  We have made it clear that we are not engaged in such work.  Iran is a member of the IAEA.  Inspectors are present at the centres in Iran on a 24-hour basis.  They are verifying what is happening and there are cameras on site.  We have no plan to produce nuclear weapons.  Independent experts from different countries, including from the United States, have produced reports in respect of this matter.  Members may have seen those reports but we can certainly make them available to the committee.  Our position in this regard is very clear.  The only demand we have is that the countries who are opposed to Iran enriching uranium should provide us with what we need and should recognise our rights under the NPT.</p></speech>

When I attended the Conference of Justice and Home Affairs Committee Chairs in Cyprus, I put a similar question to Baroness Ashton who replied that her relationship with the chief inspector of the Atomic Energy Agency of Iran has improved immensely during the past 12 months and indicated that they continue to engage in dialogue with each other.  The next four members who wish to contribute are Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan and Eric Byrne and Senators Norris and Daly.</p></speech>

We are continuing the conversations we have had on previous occasions.  I acknowledge that Iran, or Persia, as it was formerly known, is a very old civilisation, much older than ours.  It is also a very cultured civilisation, with a wealth of poetry and literature.  It is difficult to reconcile this with the various human rights issues we hear about in respect of Iran.</p> <p>There are human rights issues in respect of people doing the job they are supposed to do.  It is almost similar to the doctors in Bahrain who cannot be doctors and treat people because of issues with the law in that country.  People such as lawyers and those in the media are prevented from doing the work they are supposed to do.  Lawyers, in particular, end up in jail and being tortured and so on because they are defending other human rights activists.  Nazrim Situde has been mentioned.  I want to mention<font color="#222222">Abdolfattah Soltani,</font>one of the co-founders of the centre for human rights defenders.  Last week Mr. <font color="#222222">Abdolfattah </font>Soltani was awarded the International Bar Association human rights award.  He is in prison and is subject to abuse and torture, more than 1,000 km from Tehran which is difficult for the families to visit.  The families of these lawyers are also being victimised in society.  It is very hard to accept and to understand these things are going on.</p><p> I am disturbed by executions, particularly group executions and the execution of people under 18 years of age.  His Excellency and I have discussed this already on another occasion.  It is the lack of respect for the judicial process, that people in very many countries all buy into.  What can be done to stop this barbaric practice - the executions, particularly where young people have been executed.  We discussed the role of women in Iran on one occasion.  Having spoken to Mr. Panahiazar's wife also, I formed the opinion it was a much more tolerant society and there was no obligation in terms of wearing the burqa as there is in other countries.  Then I read about the 1 million signatures campaign, which suggests there is discrimination against women.  I would like to know the ambassador's opinion on that.</p><p> I know members will raise the issue of religious minorities and Camp Ashraf.  I would like to hear His Excellency's comments on human rights issues, executions and women.</p></speech>

Mr. Hossein Panahiazar. and congratulate him on the excellent work he has done in opening up the trade relations between Iran and Ireland for beef and sheep meat.  We, on behalf of the trade, applaud his efforts.</p><p>  I have very little in common with his country, in so far as an Irish politician gets a mandate from the people to represent liberal democratic standards.  The difference between the democratic society we are used to and an Islamic republic such as Iran is like chalk and cheese.</p><p>  I am surprised at the sentiments expressed by members of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party when they questioned the nuclear enrichment programme.  There has been eight fruitless years of negotiations on the nuclear enrichment programme between China, France, Germany, Russia, United Kingdom and the United States.  These six are known alternatively as the E3+3.  Six major powerful nations have been involved in negotiations with Iran on the nuclear issues with fruitless results.</p><p>  We as a small island country are equally concerned about the welfare of the 75 million Iranians, particularly the beautiful and highly-educated young population.  We would hate to see any pre-emptive strike by Israel against the nuclear deposits in Iran.  We are entering a very sensitive period, with the forthcoming elections in America.  One can clearly see that Mitt Romney would support the Israelis in pre-emptive strikes whereas President Obama has to be more understanding and has supported the extension of the talks.  The talks must reach a conclusion.  I disagree with my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues.  Sanctions are a crude method of punishing a nation.  I understand Iran is suffering tremendously from sanctions.  The people who suffer as a result of sanctions are usually the poor and less capable who cannot sustain themselves in a sanctioned society.  I am pleading with the ambassador to convey to his Government that Ireland applauds Iran's right to nuclear energy.  It is, however, the potential military use of the enriched uranium that worries us.  We would like to see a conclusion to the negotiations on that issue.  </p><p>  We cannot support the Iranian Government on a vast range of actions.  Human rights has been mentioned.  We know of examples of the outrageous treatment of women, the horrendous treatment of gay, lesbian and transgender people and the public executions.  The hanging of gays from cranes in public places is inhuman.  I cannot see the religious context for that type of behaviour.  It is horrendous to hear President <font color="#222222">Ahmadinejad's bellicose outcries about Israel and how he intends to wipe Israel off the face of the earth.  That type of language does nothing to secure the security of the 75 million population in Iran.  I would be very interested in visiting Iran.  Iran has a rather complex border of 1,000 km.  I applaud the way it deals with</font><i><font color="#222222"> </font></i><font color="#222222">drug trafficking which is a major problem.  We in Ireland know the negative effects of drug trafficking on a community or a society.  Just because there is a border of 1,000 km with neighbouring Afghanistan, to call the influx of drugs a Zionist plot is confrontational.</font><br /><font color="#222222">  There are many human rights issues.  The delegates will appreciate that we as a committee and a country apply a very high level of support for those who are activists in the human rights field, front-line defenders, NGO movements and so on.  </font><br /><font color="#222222">  Until such time as the nuclear issue is brought to a satisfactory conclusion, the sanctions will apply.  Until Iran returns to being a society that is more acceptable in the wider game of international politics, there will be pain involved for the people of Iran unless negotiations are successful in dealing with these tricky issues.</font></p></speech>

I too recognise the immensely rich history of Iran or Persia since ancient times.  I have had the privilege as a member of this committee or because I was a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann of visiting Tehran and the remarkable welcome that we were given by the people.  Our visit coincided with a religious festival and officials could not meet us in the beginning.  We were taken up the mountains and local people were warm and welcoming to the strangers in their midst.  I also had the opportunity to visit Isfahan, a city of immense and complex richness and technological advances, even in the 15th and 16th centuries.  The beauty of the mosques and palaces in that enormous square is a sight to behold.<br /><font color="#222222">  I also asked some questions at that stage and I am very heartened that my colleagues, Deputies Eric Byrne and Maureen O'Sullivan, have asked some of these difficult questions.  It is important that people do ask the difficult questions because it by answering these difficult questions that friendship is established. </font></p> <p>If we conceal these questions and do not ask them, however difficult they are, they will just fester.  Some people say that democracy is not suited to every country.  I suggest that the ambassador's country, which has an immensely long tradition of jurisprudence, for example, should understand the rule of law.  That is not the case at the moment, however.  We are aware of that.  I have no doubt that the evidence for the things that have been alleged with regard to arrest and torture is overwhelming.  The ambassador might not be aware that I have spoken against torture.  I was horrified when the Americans attempted to justify the use of torture.  I am interested in human rights.  It is not a question of whether people are Jewish, Muslim, gay, not gay or whatever - it is a question of the right to respect that is at the core of being human.</p><p> When I was in a mosque in the Middle East three weeks ago, I read a document with great interest.  I am sure the ambassador and his adviser are much more familiar with it.  It seemed to be a kind of last letter of the holy prophet Muhammad, in which he gave his final message to the faithful.  He spoke about the need for respect for difference.  He said Muslims did not believe they were better because they were white rather than black, or because they were this, that or the other.  I thought it was a wonderful and prophetic message, but it does not always seem to be enacted by the Iranian Government.  Why make a pretence of democracy when the Guardian Council is in existence?  It is easy to win an election if one excludes the entire opposition.  I am sure I could be in permanent power - I could attain any position in this country - if I could eliminate anyone who stood against me and did not share my views.  That is dangerous because it means the Iranian Government does not reflect the views of the Iranian people.  That really worries me.  I was very saddened to hear an Irish person who has business interests in Iran saying some time ago that Iran was a democracy because it had just held an election.  I rang in - I am glad to say I was put on - to point out that it was not an election as we understand it.  I will mention a disturbing case.  Mansoureh Behkish was sentenced to four years in prison, having been accused of assembly and conspiring with intent to harm national security, after she established the Mourning Mothers group for women whose children have been killed, forcibly disappeared or detained.  It is a natural instinct for mothers to protect their children.  How can that threaten a state?  The state should foster children.</p><p> I wish to speak about the executions in Iran.  I am concerned about the method of execution and the increase in the rate of execution.  I have protested about this in the United States.  I am against the death penalty.  People are often killed in Iran because of their nature.  I am glad that Deputy Eric Byrne raised the question of gay people.  I was horrified to see the photographs to which he alluded.  I could not bear to watch the video showing two young men being hanged from a crane on the back of a lorry because they had been in a relationship.  I understand one of them was under age.  The executions of minors is awful.  I would ask those in the Iranian Government to try to put themselves in the position of those people.  Those young people were roughed up and humiliated.  They did not even have the salve of believing they were <i>shahid</i>, or martyrs.  It goes against the very core of decency and humanity that they died in such ignominy, loneliness and despair, deprived of religious comfort and everything else.</p><p> I raised this issue with former President Rafsanjani and Mr. Velayati when I was in Tehran.  They said I could not understand it because I am not a Muslim.  My answer was that I have read the holy Koran.  Having read the words of the holy prophet Muhammad, which I treat with great respect, I am aware that he did not appoint such punishments.  How can the Iranian Government purport to erect itself as a greater moral authority than the holy prophet himself?  That seems to be an arrogance that is very close to blasphemy.  I also raised the question of the Jewish people with them.  I have been accused by Israel of being anti-Semitic.  If everybody thinks I am a different thing, perhaps some little core is right.  It is unrealistic to deny the Holocaust, or to arrest tiny communities on the basis of spying.  I would worry that inflamed rhetoric might help to provoke an attack, which would be a disaster.  I would do everything I could to try to restrain such an attack.</p></speech>

I would like us to visit Evin Prison.  I was involved in getting two people out of it in the 1980s.  That resulted from a press and publicity campaign.  I think we should be able to visit opposition people like Mir-Hossein Mousavi, Mehdi Karroubi and the woman who was detained as well.  We should discuss issues of human sexuality.  There are times when Mr. Ahmadinejad seems to have a remarkably perceptive view of foreign policy, but then he goes off the deep end.  He said in New York that there are no homosexual people in Iran.  How did he execute two of them if they did not exist?  There is an absurdity there.  We are just human.  We are just flesh and blood.  I can sit here talking to the ambassador in a civilised manner, but I know very well what would happen to me if I was a citizen of his country.  As we advance towards full equality, I feel an obligation to speak out for human beings like me who comprise a vulnerable minority and whose lives are in danger in a country that was once so wonderful and civilised.</p></speech>

I have to say the Iranian leader's comment that Israel should be wiped off the map was reprehensible, to put it mildly.  I would like to hear the ambassador's views on that.  It is unacceptable that the leader of a country like Iran, which has such a proud history and culture, said when addressing people at a public forum like the United Nations that an entire country and race of people who have has suffered so much should be wiped off the map.  I would like the ambassador to comment on what his Government is proposing for its near neighbours.</p><p>  I will comment briefly on human rights.  If members of the committee go to visit the ambassador's country, we would like to see those whose names have been mentioned here.  The first place we would like to go is wherever we can visit the people about whom the human rights defenders have written to us.  Why are these people in prison for expressing their views on what we and the United Nations would consider to be basic human rights?  My colleagues have already covered the uranium issue so I will not speak about it.  I look forward to hearing what the ambassador has to say about it.  I will listen to his response on the tape after I have voted.</p></speech>

It sets out in detail the programme of the Iranian Government regarding human rights issues.  I will speak briefly about Iran's co-operation with the UN Human Rights Council.  We are working very closely with it.  We have participated actively in the universal periodic review.  Like Ireland and other countries, Iran has accepted many of the suggestions that have been made by the human rights council.  We consider the establishment of the council as the right way to help to promote the human rights situation in all countries of the world, rather than a few selected countries.  We have invited the High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit Iran.  </p> <p>The preparatory delegation has visited Iran and discussed with the authorities the meetings that will be arranged for the High Commissioner.   We have invited all of the human rights thematic reporters to visit Iran.  Several of them have already done so and we are trying to arrange more visits. </p><p> We are not closing the country to international observers.  I am not saying the human rights situation in Iran is perfect.  I do not think any country can claim it has a perfect human rights record.  I am saying we are trying to do our best to improve the human rights situation in our country.  There are articles in the constitution looking after all aspects of human rights.</p><p> The new criminal code which is in its last stages in parliament will establish a separate court for minors under the age of 18 years.  That court will not impose sentences of execution.  Minors will be dealt with differently.  Some other punishments have been changed in the new criminal code.  Following the universal periodic review, UPR, we are trying to follow up on what we agreed in that council.  If one looks at the reasons for handing down sentences of execution, one can see that most of them relate to drug smuggling, which is one of our problems, but it is not only ours.  Unfortunately, it is a world problem.  Several years ago the level of drug production in Afghanistan was 200 tonnes.  Now, it is more than 8,000 tonnes.  Iran is one of the routes used to bring drugs out of Afghanistan.  We are fighting against drug smuggling, the result of which is the suffering of young people in Iran, Europe and even the United States.  All of us are suffering from it.  A sentence of capital punishment is mostly implemented for drug smuggling.</p><p> The largest Jewish community in the region is in Iran.  One can look at YouTube and see that members of the Jewish community in Iran are freely practising their religion.  According to the Iranian constitution which has been approved by more than 90% of the people, four religious groups are formally accepted in it.  They are Zoroastrianism, the oldest religion in Iran, Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  The number of churches in Iran is approximately 600.  I do not think one would find as many in any other Middle Eastern country.  The number of Jewish Kenisats is 35 - the Jewish population is very small - while the number of places for Zoroastrian worship is 33.  These communities can either participate in general elections, in which their opportunity to gain a seat is very low, or in their own community elections to have a seat in Parliament.  In the Iranian Parliament we have two Christian MPs, one Jewish and one Zoroastrian MP.  They have equal rights with any other Member of Parliament.  If members of the committee visit Iran, they can discuss with them and visit churches and other places of worship to see how they are worshipping. </p><p> This is also the case in central Tehran which I think Senator David Norris visited when he was in Iran.  As he has left the meeting, he cannot help me in this regard.  In central Tehran one can find a sports and entertainment complex that is exclusively used by Christians.  Although, according to current rules, there are separate gyms for boys and girls in Iran, in that complex there are not separate gyms.  Christians and other minorities enjoy their traditions and ways of life in their own way and do not seem to have problems.  I do not say Iran is the best place in the world, but one should compare it to other countries in the region.</p></speech>

According to the constitution, as the Baha'i faith is not considered to be a religion, its members do not enjoy the same privileges as members of the four religions do.  They cannot, formally, have a separate place of worship.  According to the constitution, these religious communities can have their places of worship and schools.  They have the choice to send their children to public schools or their own schools, in Tehran or other cities.  Baha'is enjoy civil rights like others.  They are trading.  If one looks at Iranian television, one will see advertisements by many Baha'i companies.  Baha'is are trading, working and studying, as others do.  They enjoy civil rights, but the Baha'i faith is not considered formally, according to the constitution, to be a religion.</p></speech>

In the past we asked applicants to state their religion on public service application forms, but we deleted that question.

They were not convicted on account of their faith or belief.  The centre of Baha'i groups is located in Israel.  They established a university, without the permission of the higher education Ministry, that is connected directly with their base in Israel and have been informed that this is illegal.  We have thousands of Baha'is in Iran.  If their faith was the problem, all of them would be in prison.  The  Baha'i leaders about whom Irish people have heard have all been charged with offences that I can explain to the committee.  They were convicted according to the rules and regulations all countries are following.  In Ireland, for example, I do not think someone can establish a university without following the rules and regulations of the Minister for Education and Skills.  This is what the Baha'is have done.</p> <p>If members want, we can go into detail on these case by case.</p><p> In general, what I am saying is that we are doing our best to improve the human rights situation in our country and we are co-operating with the Human Rights Council.  We are aware there are shortcomings and have accepted some of the recommendations made during the universal periodic review, UPR, and are implementing them.  We are changing some parts of our criminal code and we hope this helps to improve the situation.</p><p> I should mention that Iran is located in a very dangerous area and the main concern at the present time for our Government is the security of our people.  Every morning when one looks at the newspaper, one reads about explosions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkey and other areas near us, but one does not read so much about Tehran or other cities.  Our main focus is to look after the security of the people of our country.  This contributes to the problems, because when security is the main priority, this highlights areas that could be better and more open.  We hope that as the situation in our region gets better, our situation will improve as a result.  We have neighbours, in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and even in Turkey, who struggle every day for their lives when they leave their houses.  Many explosions take place in those regions or near the borders.  Terrorist activities are ongoing in those regions.  We hope this will be resolved and hope to see an improved situation in those areas.</p><p> I mentioned our concerns regarding the threats of a strike against Iran.  We are completely ready for that.  We take the threats of a strike by Israel very seriously in so far as we should be prepared for it.  However, we do not think there is a real aerial threat, because as members know, Israel has already attacked Iraqi and Syrian nuclear plants previously.  Therefore, if Israel wanted to attack Iran, it would have done it many years ago, not now.  Israel knows what the consequences and reaction would have been then.  Although we take the threat seriously and are prepared for a strike, we do not have a real concern a strike will take place.</p></speech>

Israel did not warn Iraq and Syria that it was going to attack them.  Therefore, it does not need to warn other countries if it intends attacking.  Israel knew the case of Iran was different and a strike was not possible then.  However, if we are put in a position where we must defend ourselves, we know how to defend ourselves.  A war has been imposed on us for eight years, but we have resisted against war.  If one looks at the history of Iran over the past 200 years, there has been no case of Iran starting or initiating a war against a neighbour.  We do not have any border conflict with our neighbours and we have not initiated any war.  Even our revolution, if compared with other movements in the region, was the most peaceful.  The revolution was conducted peacefully, with as few casualties as possible.</p><p>  Iranians, as Senator Norris and others know, are more concerned about culture, civilisation and human beings as a whole rather than other matters.  For example, if one looks at terrorist attacks that have taken place, such as the 11 September attack and others, one will not find even one Iranian national involved.  None.  In the past 1,000 years of civilization we have looked for peaceful solutions for all problems.  With regard to the nuclear issue, we are optimistic the situation will improve without violence.  Also, we will work with Europe and other countries to help improve the situation in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Bahrain and all countries with problems. </p><p>  As members know, Iran has been chair of the Non-Aligned Movement, NAM, for three years.  The most recent summit of this group was held in Tehran just a month ago and Iran will remain the chair of the movement, which has more than 120 members, for the coming three years.  Ireland will hold the Presidency of the European Union for the first six months of next year offering an area of potential co-operation to help bring about improvements in our region.</p><p>  Senator Norris mentioned his knowledge of Islam and our beliefs.  I recall a letter from one of the Islamic leaders to his representative when he was sending him as governor to Egypt one time.  He told him when he was going there that the people could be seen as being in two groups.  Some of them would have the same religion, but the others were sharing human beings.  Therefore, he could either govern the Muslims there or govern them as human beings, because people are all the same and share the same common areas.  We believe that all people around the world share a common essence of being human and that this is the most important common ground on which we should base other relations. </p></speech>

However, we are trying to do our best to reduce the effect of sanctions on ordinary people.  We used to have approximately from &euro;30 billion to &euro;40 billion trade with European countries, but as a result of sanctions this has reduced to from &euro;10 billion to &euro;15 billion.  We are shifting trade relations to other countries in Asia and Latin America in the effort to reduce the effect of sanctions.  Of course, however, this causes inconvenience for the people and the Government.  It is not right to impose sanctions on a nation.  We have resisted against eight years of war in defence of our right to say the United Nations should condemn aggression against Iran.</p><p>  What we are saying now is that we demand that our rights in accordance with empathy and international law for enrichment be recognised and we are ready to compromise.  If they provide fuel for our research centre, we will stop producing 20% enrichment.  We see our proposals as logical.  We hope the sanctions will be lifted and regret that, unfortunately, Europe has changed its policy.</p> <p>In the past the EU only applied sanctions that had been approved by the United Nations, not unilateral sanctions.  Unfortunately, in recent years that has changed but the unilateral sanctions, according to international law, have no basis.  If we accept that the United Nations is the basis for these kinds of decisions, we should follow that rule and not apply unilateral sanctions.</p></speech>

The sanctions have some negative effects but we are changing the Iranian economy.  We are trying to eliminate subsidies, which will result in higher prices.  The people understand that such changes will be helpful in the long term.</p><p>  The sanctions are an inconvenience for the people and the Government but we hope that through negotiations we can reach a compromise and move things forward, because the sanctions are causing suffering on both sides.   Iran's trade with Europe was worth between &euro;30 billion and &euro;40 billion but that has now been reduced to between &euro;10 billion and &euro;15 billion.  It is not only Iran that is suffering from the reduction in trade.  European countries are selling less, which means they are producing less, which leads to job losses in Europe.  Iranians and Europeans are suffering and we hope that the sanctions will be lifted soon.</p></speech>

We should let the Syrian people decide their own future.  We are not saying that everything the Syrian Government is doing is right.  We have been critical of it.  At the beginning, the people were only demanding a degree of democracy, which should have been dealt with better.  We have made it very clear that it is not acceptable for any government to use mass destruction against its own people.  Any government that uses such tactics loses its legitimacy.  We are very clear about that.  At the same time, we have also asked the countries in the region not to help the armed groups there.  The Syrian people are the ones who are suffering.  Unfortunately, there is also a power struggle going on within the opposition.  They want to gain as much ground as possible to shore up their bargaining position once negotiations begin.  We hope that by stopping the arms supplies to the opposition groups and also pressurising the Government to stop using the military against the people, we will have a ceasefire and negotiations for a peaceful solution.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that it may soon be possible to resolve the issue regarding the export of beef to Iran and I also welcome the invitation extended to the Chairman and members of the committee to travel to Iran and help in the ongoing discussions.</p><p>  The President of Iran, speaking at a recent session of the United Nations General Assembly, made a very interesting and enlightening speech, where he talked about the problems and injustices in the world and the need for a new order and a fresh way of thinking.  He made some interesting points and spoke of:<blockquote>- An order in which man is recognized as God's Supreme Creature, enjoying material and spiritual qualities and possessing a pure and divine nature filled with a desire to seek justice and truth.<br /> - An order that aims to revive human dignity and believes in universal happiness and perfection.<br />- An order which is after peace, lasting security and welfare for all walks of life around the globe.<br />- An order that is founded upon trust and kindness and brings thoughts, hearts and hands closer to each other. Rulers must love people.</blockquote>This is wonderful but when one looks at the human rights situation in Iran, one wonders if the President is signalling a new vision for Iran and a new way of addressing the problems that have been highlighted by so many of my colleagues today.  We are all alarmed and horrified at the reports of summary executions, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, the closing down of newspapers and websites and the threats of the death penalty against Pastor Nadarkhani, whose only crime has been his conversion to Christianity.  How can President Ahmadinejad speak in those terms when the reality in Iran is so different?  Is there new thinking in that country which will address these issues as a matter of urgency?  Does the ambassador foresee a situation where EU countries and the United Nations will look very differently on Iran and on the sanctions, with a view to lifting them?  I ask the ambassador to help me understand the dichotomy between what the President says and the reality on the ground.  Can he convince me that what his President has said is likely to happen in the future?</p></speech>

I mentioned earlier that we do not think Iran is perfect and indeed, no country in the world can claim to be so.  What the Senator read are the ideals that we aspire to for everyone in the world.  We want to see justice for everybody, including the people of Iran.</p><p>  We have distributed a paper on human rights but I am not sure if the Senator has received it.  That paper explains in detail what we are doing in terms of improving human rights in Iran.  We are working closely with the UN Human Rights Council and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and we hope that things will go well.</p> <p>I believe the committee already knows that Mr. Nadarkhani has been released.  The issue mentioned was not accepted by the court of appeal and he has been released.</p><p> Regarding executions, I have explained that criminal courts in Iran can sentence people to execution, as is the case in many countries throughout the world.  Most of the cases where the death penalty is used in Iran relate to drug smuggling, which is one of the main problems in the country and region.  If this problem is solved and the international community gets to its root cause, which is poverty in Afghanistan and the situation there, we can get rid of smuggling.  We are not happy that people are executed and we know it is not the answer to the problem, but at present according to the criminal court if somebody is involved in smuggling drugs - not addicts - the punishment is execution.</p><p> The situation regarding Camp Ashraf has been resolved.  The group resisted moving to the new camp because it was not ready but it has accepted the move and people are seeking refugee status in other countries so they can move there.  Iran will welcome anyone interested in returning.  Some people returned to Iran from Camp Ashraf and do not have any problems.  Of course those who committed crimes will be tried on their return.  Those who did not commit crimes should not worry about returning.  We understand other countries are reluctant to accept as refugees those involved in terrorist activities in the past.  This is the reality.  We hope for a solution for these people, who have now moved to the new camp.  The statement by the United States on removing the group from the designated list of terrorist organisations mentioned that the United States cannot forget the group's past terrorist activities which include killing US citizens.  We have protested about this removal because we consider it to be a double-standard.  We do not have good or bad terrorists; terrorism is terrorism and those considered good terrorists should remain on the list of terrorist groups.  We have not seen changes in the group's policy.  Terrorist operations supported by this group still occur in Iran.  The most recent was the assassination of a scientist.  Information has been published on the group's co-operation with intelligence services in killing nuclear scientists in Iran.</p></speech>

The discussion was very useful.  Committee members raised questions on people in prison.  I do not expect the ambassador to know where all prisoners are located so if we provide him with the names perhaps he can get back to us through the secretariat with information on where these people are and what future lies ahead for them.  Everybody mentioned human rights and I hope the regime in Iran makes available more access to the UN special rapporteur on human rights as this would be very helpful.  I ask the ambassador to convey this message.  I hope the meeting has contributed to developing mutual understanding between our two countries.  We have had a good long relationship with Iran.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-10a.511" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2012101000002#A00200"><p>I thank the committee for giving me this further opportunity to discuss the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill and my 2011 annual report.</p><p>  I would like to begin by impressing upon the committee how important I consider it that this Bill is passed as soon as possible.  I wish further to impress upon the committee the extent to which the people of this State have been badly served by the extraordinary, if not unprecedented, delay in extending the remit of the Office of the Ombudsman to public bodies that are central to their lives and well-being.</p><p>  It is now 27 years and five months since a proposal emanated from the then Department of the Public Service inviting the Office of the Ombudsman to submit proposals for an extension of remit, following a suggestion from the first Ombudsman, the late Mr. Michael Mills.  It is now 25 years and nine months since the office, delayed by a legal wrangle over remit, submitted a comprehensive set of proposals for the amendment of the 1980 Ombudsman Act.</p><p>  Earlier this year, in a letter to the new Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, I described what transpired over the next quarter of a century as a farce which must end.  I was pleased the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and his Department agreed with my views and their subsequent actions, plus a high level of engagement by my office with them, has now led to this day and, hopefully, to the enactment of this amended Act before the end of this month.</p> <p>It is not perfect, but if I share with the committee some brief part of that 27 year history, I hope it will agree that the public interest will best be served through the passage of this Bill now.  It will then be a matter for the Oireachtas, particularly for the members of this critical committee, to ensure the legislation's imperfections are remedied as speedily as possible whether through further regulation or through the passage of other legislation from other Departments which may bring independent oversight to bodies not currently under remit or not envisaged to be within remit through this amended Act.</p><p> The expectations raised in 1987 when the office issued comprehensive proposals to Government quickly disappeared.  A meeting called by the Department in February 1987 was cancelled and nothing more was heard about the Bill until a full seven years later, in 1994, when it appeared on the programme for Government of the incoming coalition.  In January 1995, the Department of Finance again wrote to the office citing the Government's policy statement, which declared: &quot;A Government of Renewal envisages an extension of the powers and remit of the Office and discussions on the proposed extension are on-going.&quot;  In its letter, the Department stated it was, &quot;anxious to undertake the necessary work&quot;.  What followed was a considerable amount of interaction between the office and the Department, rounds of consultation with Departments and offices and the drafting of a memorandum for Government.</p><p> In June 1996 when the then Ombudsman, the late Mr. Kevin Murphy, published his 1995 annual report, he noted that &quot;good progress was made during the year and preparation of a draft Bill is now underway&quot;.  One year later, in April 1997, when Mr. Murphy launched his 1996 annual report, a now rather exasperated Ombudsman highlighted the delays in getting the amendment Bill passed and called for the schedules to be amended in the immediate term.</p><p> Another year and another annual report later in April 1998, when Mr. Murphy launched his 1997 annual report, the Ombudsman, with hope restored, noted positively that the preparation of the Bill was reactivated in 1997.  This positive trajectory ran into January 1999 when a press release by the then Minister of State indicated the Government had accepted proposals to introduce an Ombudsman amendment Bill.  The press release went so far as to list the additional public bodies which would be coming under the Ombudsman.</p><p> As the winter of 1999 approached, the Minister for State responded to a letter from a very frustrated Ombudsman stating rather cryptically that he was &quot;not without hope&quot; that the Bill would be published by the end of the year.  Alas, by the time Mr. Murphy published his final annual report in April 2003, he could say nothing positive about a possible amendment Bill being enacted and he made clear his disappointment at the lack of real progress throughout his tenure.</p><p> My first annual report as Ombudsman, which was published in April 2004, chimed yet another positive note as I referred to yet another commitment from Government to publish an amendment Bill by the end of 2004 and to have it speedily enacted.  On my very first week in office, I was told by the then Minister for Finance that &quot;the amendment Bill will be through in the next three months&quot;.  I followed up my annual report remarks with a letter to the Minister for Finance, in November 2004, setting out the history of delays and calling for urgent action.  The Minister wrote back and said he was &quot;hopeful&quot;, which I read as being slightly more encouraging than the response of the Minister of State in 1999 who characterised himself as being &quot;not without hope&quot;, that the Bill would be published by the following Easter.  What, of course, was extraordinary about this was that the respective Ministers had virtually the absolute power to get the Bill through if the will and interest existed to so do.  The years 2005, 2006 and 2007 saw hopes being raised and dashed.  Throughout all of this time, I was attempting to manage my own office, readying it for the extension of remit and dealing with the understandable confusion and uncertainty of staff when, year after year, absolutely nothing happened.</p><p> I made a direct personal intervention with a new Minister for Finance, yet again urging action.  My intervention seemed to get something rolling and in September 2007, the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, wrote to me to say that the Department of Finance was &quot;actively working&quot; on an amendment Bill.  In July 2008, the First Stage of the amendment Bill finally came before the Dail but progress after this was painfully slow.  By 2010, it had reached Report and Final Stages but was not enacted by the time the Government fell.  The tone set in my 2010 annual report, which I published in June 2011, was a mixture of total frustration at past failures which I felt justified in describing as &quot;at the very least an embarrassment to all concerned&quot;, and cautious optimism at the current Government's commitment in its new programme for a national government to extend my office's remit to all publicly funded bodies.  Then earlier this year, I wrote to the Department about the appalling torpor and lack of real political will around the extension of the Act in the manner I described at the start of these remarks.</p><p> I hope members will forgive me for dwelling so much on the past but I do so to underline that at this stage the passing of the amendment Bill as soon as possible is the number one priority for my office.  I must also put on record my personal appreciation and that of the office for the recent hard work, commitment and energy of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his officials in bringing the Bill to the brink of enactment.</p><p> In terms of the most recent progress towards enactment of the amendment Bill, I understand that the hope and intent is to complete Committee and Report Stages in the Seanad on 17 October and I very much hope that the Final Stage of the Bill will be taken in the D&aacute;il as soon as possible thereafter.  The Bill, as drafted at present, provides that the additional public bodies being brought under my office's remit, of which there will be approximately 140, will fall within remit within six months of the Bill being enacted at the latest.  From a practical point of view, my office will need this lead-in time to engage with the new bodies to explain the role of my office, set up formal liaison arrangements and sort out other operational matters.</p><p> The programme for Government included a commitment to extend the remit of my office to all publicly funded bodies.  My office has been in close consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the drafting of the Bill and the scope of the extension of remit.  The 1980 Act listed in Schedule 1 those public bodies subject to my remit and, in Schedule 2, those public bodies not subject to my remit.  The current Bill contains a generic provision to identify in Schedule 1 those additional public bodies now coming under my jurisdiction, and this provision is broadly in line with the programme for Government commitment.  The new Schedule 2 lists those bodies which will remain outside my remit.  There has been some debate in the Seanad about the contents of the new Schedule 2 and I would like to clarify the rationale behind the continued exclusion of certain public bodies which, as I understand it, are publicly funded.</p><p> Both my office and the Department are of the view that the primary purpose of extending our remit is to include bodies not in Schedule 1 at present which have a high level of interface with the public and whose decisions, if taken improperly, have the capacity to affect adversely significant numbers of members of the public.  This rationale would, for instance, with some exceptions, exclude certain specialist advisory bodies.  We also agree that commercial semi-State bodies or highly specialised regulatory bodies are not an appropriate fit for oversight by my office.  They operate in a commercial environment and are in competition with companies in the private sector.  Furthermore, it would not make sense to have a further complaint appeals process to my office on decisions made by other independent complaint-handling bodies.  Thus, bodies listed in the new Schedule 2 include, for example, Aer Lingus, the Commission for Aviation Regulation, ESB, Horse Racing Ireland, the National Concert Hall, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, and the Office of the Information Commissioner.</p><p> In terms of the new bodies now coming within my remit, these will include all third level institutions, including the universities, and the vocational education committees, F&Aacute;S, the Legal Aid Board, the Equality Authority, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the State Examinations Commission, the Central Applications Office, the Student Grant Appeals Board, the National Transport Authority, the Family Support Agency, Sustainable Energy Ireland and a range of other public bodies not included in Schedule 2.</p><p> Members are aware that section 5(1)(<i>e</i>)(i) of the Ombudsman Act 1980 provides that the Ombudsman shall not investigate actions taken in the &quot;administration of the law relating to aliens or naturalisation&quot;.  The current amendment Bill does not remove this restriction.  My views on this restriction are well known and, indeed, in my previous appearance before the committee on 20 July 2011, I argued strongly that it should be removed.  I also note that in the recent debate in the Seanad on the amendment Bill, a number of Members, including Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh from this committee, made strong interventions calling for my remit to be extended to these areas.</p><p> I very much appreciate the support expressed for my position on this issue.  In his response, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, said he had consulted the Minister for Justice and Equality about the matter and said that a new complaints system was being introduced for prisoners which, he said, will be open, transparent and independent and will provide an immediate mechanism to deal with such complaints on the ground.</p> <p>In regard to the areas of immigration, residency and asylum, the Minister indicated that a new statutory appeals system will be established through the enactment of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010.  Until we see the final shape and substance of these new complaint processes it would be premature of me to judge how effective they will be.  However these processes must be robust and truly independent if they are to provide a genuine alternative to Ombudsman oversight.  They should also be introduced as soon as possible.  I will be watching developments in this regard and it will be interesting to see how complainants using the new systems judge their effectiveness.</p><p> I accept that my jurisdiction in this area will not expand in the immediate term and my main priority is to see the current Bill enacted as soon as possible.  I do not believe it is the public interest to continue to deprive the people of this State of independent oversight in critical areas of their lives.  I understand that the Minister has indicated a willingness to revisit the Ombudsman legislation if it requires fine tuning at a later stage, and prisons and asylum matters may be the subject of further consideration in that context at some time in the future.  It is, however, fundamentally the business of the Oireachtas to ensure that the people of this State, including those who come to live here for whatever reason, are given the means to have independent reviews conducted on decisions made about them by the State.  This committee, which has a potentially powerful and pivotal role to play in this regard, will continue to ensure that the Administration lives up to its commitments in these difficult and sensitive areas.</p><p> The Chairman indicated that he would prefer to confine the discussion to the Bill.  I have some comments to make about the 2011 annual report but I am happy to stop now.</p></speech>

As usual, the Seanad is a step ahead because we have had an opportunity to consider the Bill.  We welcome the increase in the number of agencies that will be under the remit of the Ombudsman but I wish to focus my comments on the areas over which jurisdiction is not being given.  I was forthright in the Seanad in arguing that people in direct provision and those who come under the auspices of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, the Reception and Integration Agency and the Prison Service should be included under the Ombudsman&rsquo;s remit.</p><p>  The Minister has indicated that he will establish a redress agency under the Department of Justice and Equality but the Ombudsman&rsquo;s role is one of final adjudication and issues could also arise with the proposed new body.  The Ombudsman should be given jurisdiction over these agencies even at this stage because even if the new body is established the need for redress could arise if voices are not heard.</p><p>  For the past several weeks I have been campaigning on behalf of Lisbrook direct provision centre.  Today we received a letter from the Minister stating that the centre is to be closed with immediate effect and that a review is ongoing.  The voices of the residents of that centre were not taken into consideration.  There was no meeting with Oireachtas Members from Galway even though we had sought one.  That does not bode well for the proposed new redress system for people in direct provision.</p><p>  This is why the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office needs to cover these areas and I imagine it is also the reason why Ms O&rsquo;Reilly has called for such powers.  I would yet not give up the cause.  As the Whip system is not supposed to apply to this committee, I will be calling on members to ask that her recommendations in this area be fully included in the Bill.  I commend her on her strong statement on these issues.</p></speech>

Over the years I have met individuals from many of the organisations to which the Deputy referred and I have pointed out at various conferences and seminars that I am virtually alone among ombudsmen in Europe in lacking jurisdiction in this area.  We like to say that the Ombudsman balances out the power equation between the individual and the State.  Few people are more vulnerable than those who come to this country seeking asylum.  One organisation which attempts to look after the needs of people who are in direct provision showed me a complaint form which residents of a particular centre were given.  Printed at the end of the form was a warning to the effect that an asylum seeker&rsquo;s chances could be damaged if his or her complaint was found to be vexatious.  I was absolutely horrified by this.</p><p>  In previous years, when we attempted to have immigration, asylum and naturalisation included in our remit the Department refused to even entertain the idea.  There is only so much that I can do.  At present I am trying to balance the needs of all the other bodies.  In some ways the frustration is personal but mainly my frustration is because it is absolutely wrong to be waiting 27 years for this amended Bill reach this stage.  If it is further delayed because of attempts to put these areas under the remit of the Office of the Ombudsman in advance of the Minister&rsquo;s Bill, I fear it will fall back into that black hole and the good that was served by including all the other bodies would come to naught.  That is the dilemma we face.</p></speech>

Her advice is that we should try to avoid delaying its passage in case it falls into same black hole as the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that many people would prefer the areas of immigration and asylum and prisons to be included in my remit.  I spoke extensively about the history of the Bill in order to impress on members the torpor that descends when things do not happen.  This Bill was ready to go 25 years ago but it never happened.  Much of the delay was caused by bodies which fought to be excluded - I do not refer solely to bodies under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality - with the result that long conversations and arguments took place, people lost the political will to keep up the campaign and then something else popped up.  It has been very difficult even to get the Bill to this stage but I am confident that we might have it by the end of the month.  It is entirely open to this committee and to individual members to do what they want but my view is that on balance it is best to proceed with it than to delay it further in the hope that whatever the Department of Justice and Equality proposes will fit the requirement for an independent and transparent appeals process.  It is not a turf war.  I personally do not care who is responsible for the process as long as it is done.</p></speech>

A range of new bodies will now be coming under the Ombudsman&rsquo;s remit but has a commitment been given on adequately resourcing the office given that it has insufficient resources at present?  Has there been any discussion with the Minister to date?</p></speech>

A few years ago, partly as a result of the decentralisation policy decision and when our remit expanded in the health area, we got 25 new staff.  We also did a major piece of change management.  I am not sure if that is the right term.  I am never quite up to speed on these terms.  Basically, we took our processes apart, examined them and put them back together again with the result that we greatly increased our efficiency and productivity and we are now able to deal with 30% more cases than we had been.  In six months, assuming the Bill goes through and people come to us with complaints, obviously they can only complain about things that have happened following the adoption of the legislation and, therefore, there will be a lag time.  We have the capacity to deal with a reasonably significant number of additional complaints but, no more than any other Ombudsman's office, when it starts or when it take on additional bodies, we cannot say how many new complaints we will have to address.  At the moment, we are saying to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that we can cope with the staffing we have but in the fullness of time we may look for additional staff.</p></speech>

I am not sure of the date it was published but, notwithstanding her strong words, progress is at last being reported and that should also be acknowledged notwithstanding the frustration, both personal and professional, of various Ombudsmen over the past 27 years.  It is imperative that the amending legislation be passed at the earliest opportunity and I take on board her comment that having regard to the shortcomings, nevertheless the priority appears to be to enact what we have and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has acknowledged that if there are shortcomings, they will be dealt with, if not in the immediate term, then in the medium term.  I am subject to contradiction by my Seanad colleagues but it is expected that a debate will be completed in the House perhaps the week after next, which means it will be ready to be brought before the D&aacute;il prior to the end of October.  If the committee deems it appropriate and helpful, I will arrange a meeting this evening with the Government Chief Whip and convey to him the Ombudsman's sentiment.  There is every reason the Bill should have concluded its Second Reading in the D&aacute;il prior to the Christmas recess, notwithstanding the busy schedule and, in particular, the budget.  It should be ready for Committee Stage in early January.  Having regard to the time involved, it should be the objective of the Houses of the Oireachtas - this committee is well placed to monitor progress - that with the six months lapse, the new Act could well be in force by 1 September next.</p><p>  The Bill is on the A list of the legislative programme and, therefore, assuming it can be tabled for debate before Christmas, there is every reason it can be enacted in full during February and be ready for commencement by 1 September.  We can revisit the issues mentioned by the Ombudsman.  Some issues are not within the Minister's remit, particularly those relating to the Department of Justice and Equality.  It will not prove feasible in the context of the current Bill, notwithstanding Committee Stage, to provide for the appropriate extensions into the areas under the remit of that Department but the priority must be an early enactment.  Following my meeting with the Government Chief Whip later, I will convey the outcome to the Chairman tomorrow.</p></speech>

Why has there been a delay in bringing forward an extension of the remit of the office?  Is there political resistance to extending her remit to the bodies or agencies we hope will be included?  It seems extraordinary that it has taken 27 years to do something eminently sensible and reasonable.</p><p>  On the issue of extending the office's remit to include offices dealing with asylum seekers, immigrants and those in the direct provision system, why is there resistance to this?  My explanation is it is just institutional racism and the State does not want to highlight the appalling treatment of people in the direct provision system.  I do not know whether the Ombudsman would feel free to agree publicly.  Is it not telling that asylum seekers who are fleeing persecution are exempted from the treatment every other citizen expects when they should have a right of resources or appeal against the way they are being treated by the State by being lumped in with prosecuted criminals?  While people in prison should also have rights, is it not telling that asylum seekers and so on are lumped in with them, which indicates the attitude the State has towards them, and that the normal process of justice, where people are innocent until proven guilty, is turned on its head and the State assumes asylum seekers are guilty until proven innocent and all rights are suspended until they work their way through the long and onerous asylum process?  What explanations have the Department of Justice and Equality and the Government given to the Ombudsman for their refusal to extend the office's remit to cover these areas?  Does she think if there was political will to do this, it would be such a complicated process that it could not be addressed on Committee Stage of the current Bill?  I take her point that she does not want the legislation held up because she wants it enacted but if there was political will-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-10a.526" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2012101000005#D00700"><p>There was a general torpor regarding the Ombudsman Act.  It was a series of stops and starts.  A head of steam would build up around it and then they might come into conflict with a particular Department or public body or agency that did not want to be included and everything would grind to a halt again or they would say it was a busy schedule or this or that was happening.  It never seemed important enough to keep it at the top of the pile.  I am not a journalist anymore and, therefore, I cannot comment in as free a way as I might have done ten years ago regarding some of the other matters, and it would be wrong of me to do so.</p> <p> It would probably be fair to say that there is a culture in regard to certain matters that are sensitive in Irish society around prisons, asylum and immigration.  That culture is around not trusting anybody not intimately involved within the system to make or review decisions.  There is a sense in which unless people are inside the Department and intimate with everything that goes on, that in a sense one cannot trust them to know enough to make the right decisions.  I remember several years ago meeting someone in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We were talking about freedom of information and the extension of it to the Garda.  That was another area where one was not going to go, although it has been proposed that freedom of information would be extended to the Garda.  The conversation was along the lines of "over my dead body" will freedom of information ever be extended to the Garda.  I said I am a reasonable individual and my office is a moderate and mature public service-minded body.  We are not all going to go mad.  This individual garda said to me that he trusted me but the concern was who might come after me.  It is this idea of not allowing that sort of external scrutiny on things that the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na feel, rightly or wrongly, are very important to the security of the State or whatever, and not wanting a lay person to make decisions.</p><p> It is also a fundamental misunderstanding of what the Ombudsman does.  I will not make a new decision but I will ensure that the processes that are in place in regard to asylum or naturalisation cases or prison complaints are done correctly, that nobody is cutting corners and that natural justice is being applied.  If somebody decides that somebody should not come into the country that is fine, as long as the process involved has been done by the book.  That is the issue.  There is a fundamental misunderstanding of that.  There must also be a questioning of the people who do have difficulties.  It may be the case that a lot of their difficulties are sound and rational but they need to be articulated.  Whatever about back in 1985 or 1987, the public now has a much greater expectation that if something is or is not being done, people would be told precisely the reason.</p></speech>

We have a number of petitions which we will discuss later.  Members will be aware that one of them discusses the possibility of freedom of information being extended to two bodies in future, namely, the Office of the Ombudsman and the Central Bank.  To help us in our examination of the petition we would welcome the Ombudsman&rsquo;s view on the request.  I will go to Deputy Healy-Rae and Deputy Conaghan.  We will take the three questions together and then Ms O&rsquo;Reilly can answer them.</p></speech>

Like a long engagement nobody could accuse the committee of rushing this in any way.  I know a couple that went out for 22 years and when they eventually decided to tie the knot I told them they were not rushing into it.  It is the same in this case.  On a serious note, it is better to get the Bill passed and then afterwards to seek to further extend the role.  I would be supportive of that at another time but it would be wrong to muddy the water now.  It would be preferable to proceed as we are proceeding.  A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.</p><p>  I would not be doing my job properly if I did not raise one final matter with the Ombudsman.  Every office of the State will receive complaints at different times, whether valid or not.  My question relates to how complaints against the Ombudsman's office are investigated and handled.  That is of concern to me not in reference to any particular case but in terms of the general process.  It is an important issue to consider in respect of any public body.</p></speech>

The Government did not, however, act on her recommendation.  Is there anything further she can do in this matter?  Does she envisage that something might be done by this committee to rectify the situation?</p></speech>

The administration of my office comes within the remit of freedom of information but not its investigations per se.  They are protected, as are other ombudsman office investigations.</p><p>  In regard to complaints against my office, I once attended a meeting of ombudsmen where the question was raised as to whether there should be an ombudsman for ombudsmen.  In other words, <i>quis custodiet ipsos custodes</i>?  We constantly review our own internal complaints procedures in order to ensure they are as transparent and robust as possible.  I accept that people sometimes will not be satisfied with the outcome of their engagement with the office.  There is the possibility of judicial review in such cases but that can be an expensive process.  I cannot give an easy answer to the Deputy's question and will not give a glib one, other than to say that we take every complaint seriously.  When a complaint is submitted, an investigator other than the person who received it is assigned to deal with it.  It then goes up the line, usually ending up with me, unless I am the subject of the complaint in which case the director general would deal with it.</p><p>  We have a great deal of personal interaction with complainants and will go back to them again and again.  There are people we continue to have dialogue with for years.  I am not saying we always act perfectly - that is absolutely not the case.  Sometimes people who feel they have been wronged either do not understand that I cannot do anything about it or it is something that so troubles them that they cannot let it go.  We take complaints very seriously, mainly because of the nature of our own office.  Nobody likes being criticised and we are no exception.  As I said, there is always the option of judicial review.  I may be creating a stick to beat my own back in pointing out that in the United Kingdom office, it is not uncommon for decisions to be &#8220;JRed&#8221;, as it is called.  I understand this has not happened in the history of our office, but that particular remedy is there.</p><p>  As it happens, I discussed the Lost at Sea case with my colleagues earlier this morning.  Members are no doubt aware of the history of that matter.  It was a very unhappy episode for my office, for the family involved and for the Oireachtas in terms of how it was handled.  I have exhausted all of my particular powers in this regard.  I put it before the committee at the time that the Government did not wish to answer to it in terms of its decision, but it did eventually relent.  The committee subsequently split along party lines and the recommendation was rejected.  I can do no more in this matter.  It is up to the committee or the Oireachtas to take it up with the Government.  I did what I could do and was legally empowered to do on that case.</p></speech>

In overall terms, 2011 was the busiest year for my office since its establishment in 1984 with 3,602 valid complaints received, which was a marginal decrease from the 2010 record high of 3,727.  The total number of cases dealt with in 2011 was 4,420, which was an increase of 38% on 2010 and my office dealt with 11,541 inquiries, which was an increase of 23% on 2010.</p><p>  In 2010, 61% of cases were received and dealt with in fewer than three months, which was up from the equivalent of 47% in 2010.  Our increased productivity was achieved as a result of a major organisational review which was completed in early 2011 leading to a more efficient and effective operational model.  I explained the detail of that change management process in my annual report.  In terms of the breakdown of the valid complaints received in 2011, 46.6% related to the Civil Service, 27.7% related to local authorities, just about one-quarter related to the HSE, 1.5% related to An Post and 0.1% related to my separate statutory role under the Disability Act 2005.  The Civil Service total of 1,670 included 1,135 complaints against the Department of Social Protection, which comprised just over 30% of the overall number of complaints received by the office in 2011.</p><p>  In my introduction to the annual report, I reflected on my office's role in dealing with complaints against public bodies prompted by the consequences of the economic downturn.  Needless to say, it is a matter for the Government to make difficult high-end fiscal policy decisions, which can mean that at a local level, services or benefits are either abolished or reduced, and it is not the role of the Ombudsman to interfere in such decisions.  I do, however, have a legitimate role in examining how such decisions are implemented when a complainant comes to me after having been adversely affected.  I am of the view that it is unacceptable if cutbacks are not communicated at all, communicated in a confused manner or implemented in an apparently unfair or arbitrary way.</p><p>  To give a practical example if, for example, a long-running scheme is closed down at short notice, I do not think a public body could treat people who had already applied for such a scheme and had submitted valid applications in the same way as people who had not submitted applications before the decision was announced.  In such cases, applicants have acted in good faith and have a legitimate expectation that their applications will be considered in the normal way having regard to the published eligibility criteria.  Furthermore, I do not think it acceptable for public bodies to seek to achieve savings by stealth by, for example, arbitrarily raising the bar in terms of eligibility criteria where discretion is available to grant or deny a particular allowance.  Decisions must be made based on clear-cut published criteria and individual decisions to deny a particular allowance must be fully explained and made in a manner consistent with the relevant criteria.</p><p>  In addition, where a public body has discretion available to it, the blanket fettering of the exercise of that discretion so as to deny an allowance or an opportunity to mitigate a penalty is not only unacceptable but would amount to maladministration.  Cutbacks can also lead to the introduction of a prioritisation system, formal or informal, to cope with limited resources.  When this happens, people should be told that this is the case and have it explained to them, including the reasons for the system and the guiding principles determining any prioritisation of one applicant or beneficiary over another.  I do not propose to go through in detail the individual cases outlined in the annual report as I hope they are self-explanatory but if members have any questions on its contents, I will be happy to deal with them later.</p><p>  I would like to make some comments on my relationship with this committee.  I take this opportunity to underline how pivotal I see my office's relationship with this committee.  The Office of the Ombudsman is a creature of Parliament and has a statutory duty to report to the Houses of the Oireachtas annually and in respect of investigations and special reports.  In order to fulfil the inter-relationship, it is of the utmost importance that there is a follow-through at parliamentary level when the Ombudsman submits a report.  This committee now provides a formal avenue whereby such reports can be given due consideration and debate while at the same time respecting the statutory independence of the Office of the Ombudsman in carrying out its complaint examination function.</p><p>  I would characterise the relationship of the committee with the Ombudsman as that of a "critical friend".  We offer each other mutual respect but we are not afraid to say what needs to be said if the situation demands it.  I also acknowledge the committee's stated determination to carry out its work in a non-partisan fashion by setting political allegiances aside, which is also crucial.  The committee's role in accepting petitions is now getting off the ground and I have arranged for officials from my office to engage with the committee's secretariat in order to agree operational procedures with the committee in that context.  This will cover such matters as the referral of complaints from the committee to my office, if appropriate, and the feedback process when my office completes its examination of such complaints.  We also need to avoid duplication and overlap in carrying out our respective complaint examination functions.  I can assure the committee that my office will bring its long experience to bear in assisting the committee in its vetting and handling of petitions in every way possible either formally or informally.</p><p>  Finally, I would like to inform the committee that I hope to bring a special report to it in the coming weeks under section 6(5) of the Ombudsman Act.  I hope the committee will understand that I am not in a position to discuss it today as the report is not yet finalised but when laid before the Oireachtas, I would welcome the opportunity to reappear before the committee to discuss it in detail and to answer any questions it may have.</p></speech>

This gives a monthly payment to people who have difficulty getting out and about by virtue of age, isolation or disability to allow them to use taxis or whatever means possible to get out so that they are not housebound or to get respite care.  The Department had an upper age limit of 66 for the scheme so anybody over the age of 66 could not benefit from the scheme.  When we looked at this, we discovered it was in breach of the Equal Status Act under the age category.  We wrote to the Department accordingly and recommended that the woman in question be paid &euro;6,000 in arrears for a benefit she would have received had she been given the allowance in the first place.  We also recommended that the Department make changes and inform people that from now on, people over the age of 66 are perfectly entitled to apply for this and get it if they meet other criteria.  The Department fully agreed with our analysis and accepted our recommendations.  There was no issue whatsoever in terms of how we had analysed it.  The Department accepted it was in breach of the Equal Status Act and what we expected to happen was that a circular would be issued to all relevant bodies and people would be able to apply for the scheme.</p> <p>We waited but nothing happened.  The individual was paid the &euro;6,000.</p><p> A similar issue had arisen previously with regard to motorised transport grant and the Department sent a circular to everybody and the issue was fixed.  In this instance we were told the person had to await a decision from the Government and we are still waiting.  In our view the person does not have to await a decision from the Government because we have found, and the Department agreed, it is in breach of the Equal Status Act, and therefore it should be changed.  We made a recommendation in April 2011 and it is now October 2012 so 18 months later nothing has happened.</p></speech>

Quite a number of files or documentation submitted to various Departments seem to have gone missing of late.  The biggest number of complaints I receive is about medical cards whereby people have submitted or registered them but they do not appear.  Another area is social welfare appeals.  In the past, a large number of complaints were made about Dublin City Council receiving documentation but not processing it.  All of this leads to consequences for the individual.  A person who has applied for a medical card and presumes it is being processed will telephone the Department to be told he or she must resubmit and wait in line.  It is the same with social welfare appeals.

If the Ombudsman has observed these and is making a point of calling our attention to them, what response has she had from the various bodies when she has tried to cope with any or all of the specific examples she has come across?  Is she stating this will continue?  Is she stating she does not know what to do?  Is she stating she has been dealing with these four issues and she can see progress in them?</p></speech>

To some degree, tough political decision making is clashing with bureaucracy.  Money is being saved.  As the Ombudsman, I do not have an opinion on policy.  If a Department decides to abolish a scheme or benefit for whatever reason, that is its decision.  I deal with how the Department goes about it.</p><p>  Let us take an example of someone who used to be in receipt of domiciliary care allowance in respect of a child with autism but who no longer receives it.  The child has not necessarily improved or worsened, but the scheme has been tightened.  We were finding that, in schemes where there was an element of subjectivity or discretion, one doctor might say "Yes" while another might say "Maybe not".  In the Celtic tiger years, the discretion went one way.  Now that there is a recession, it is going the other way.  Any Minister can truthfully claim that nothing has changed, the scheme is the scheme and the rules are the rules, but it does not feel that way to people because the discretion has changed.</p><p>  I have been trying to get the message across at meetings such as this and through our annual report.  We are in the process of drafting a new set of principles of good administration and complaint handling.  Sometimes people believe this is like motherhood and apple pie, but we have found these sets of principles useful when it comes to letting public bodies know how they should treat people and deal with the schemes under their remit.  When we publish the principles, I hope that the committee and the Departments of the Taoiseach and Public Expenditure and Reform will buy into them so that the message can go out that this is the way matters should be handled.</p><p>  No one likes to impart bad news.  What tends to happen is that people are not being straight about cuts.  People can cope with cuts to a degree, but it is difficult to cope with not knowing whether they are entitled or why they are no longer receiving payments despite having had an entitlement six months previously and nothing having changed in the meantime.  Some people received grants to buy cars because they had disabilities, etc.  We have noticed that, whereas the granting used to be flathulach, that is no longer the case.  I am not sure what the Irish word for "mean" is.</p></speech>

We have sent the allowance's independent reviewer copies of our correspondence with the Department.

It is one matter to draw up principles and get everyone to stick them up on an office wall.  One of my ombudsman colleagues in the UK has an expression, namely, "Live it, do not laminate it".  When we draft principles, we want them to be lived.  For this reason, we are planning a programme of stakeholder engagement.  It is a horrible expression, but it means that this will not just be a case of my colleagues and me publishing principles in a nice press release.  We will engage with the committee and relevant line Departments to ensure that the message trickles down.</p></speech>

We are receiving many complaints against local authorities concerning the administration of the non-principal private residence, NPPR, charge.  Legally speaking, local authorities have the discretion to mitigate penalties in individual cases if the circumstances demand it.  I have found that, when they interact with people who are in dispute with them, they are coy about pointing out that they have this discretionary power.  Standard letters are being issued claiming that there are no waivers or discretions when that is legally not the case.</p><p>  As this issue has started cropping up in so many places throughout the country, I have written to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government about it.  I am due to meet the Department in the coming weeks.  It is an ongoing issue that I hope we can resolve with the Department, but there is a concern that local authorities are not using their statutory discretion in individual cases.</p></speech>

The recommendation is that the committee refer this petition to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for consideration, with a report to the committee, on the basis that the Department is currently seeking to reform the structure for dealing with employment and industrial relations cases.  New legislation in the area is being prepared by the Department.</p><p>  In communicating this decision to the petitioner, the committee should advise the petitioner to make contact with the National Employment Rights Authority and with regard to specific cases, the enforcement services unit, which can seek to have a determination of the Labour Court or the Employment Appeals Tribunal enforced through the Courts Service in certain specific circumstances.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

The petition is open and this is only the preliminary stage of our investigation.  That will be communicated.</p><p>  The next petition for consideration for the committee is P00030/12 from Mr. Des Keane, concerning the issue of capital cases commuted prior to 1990 and which do not amount to a sentence, with the result that this group of prisoners have no redress to parole or remission.  The recommendation is that the committee refer the petition to the Minister for Justice and Equality for consideration, with a report to the committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  The third petition is P00032/12 by an t-Uasal Jimi &Oacute; Lorc&aacute;in, concerning the constitutionality and inequality of the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012.  We do not have the ability as a committee to decide on constitutional matters.  The recommendation is that we communicate with the petitioner to relay our regret that we are unfortunately unable to help in this specific petition request.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  That concludes the detailing of the petitions before the committee.  Next week we will detail the next three petitions on the list.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I propose that we send a letter to the powers that be requesting that they urgently consider that we have more resources assigned to us, as promised.  The secretariat working with us is doing tremendous work but a similar committee in Scotland has six individuals working with the petitions element, even leaving aside the ombudsman or investigations element.  We have a complement of approximately 1.75 full-time equivalents.  Due to the large amount of work that will arise, we need them to consider urgently the allocation of extra resources to the committee.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

It is extremely difficult to get to the bottom of some of these matters.  They appear simple but when they start unravelling, the process can get very complicated.  It is imperative that we have more assistance or we risk hitting a wall in perhaps two months.

The recent focus throughout the world on the potential use of shale gas has been particularly driven by the experience in the United States.  In Ireland and elsewhere concerns have been expressed at two levels.  First, there is concern about the potential negative impact of utilising the technology of hydraulic fracturing.  Second, there is concern about the scale of the infrastructure associated with a development project.</p><p>  In this short presentation I propose to outline the onshore authorisations granted to date and the types of work activities covered; to inform the committee of the link between the Environmental Protection Agency research - I understand representatives of the EPA will present at this meeting also - and decision making in the Department; and to outline briefly the regulatory regime that would apply during an exploration phase and, if a project moved to development stage, the regulatory framework that would apply at two levels.</p> <p>We have a very short presentation relating to groundwater issues.</p><p> Members of the committee would be familiar at this stage with the licence options granted in February last year.  There were three licensing options covering areas within Cavan, Clare, Leitrim, Roscommon and Sligo.  They operate for a two-year period from 1 March last year to the end of February next year.  The key point is these are licensing options and not exploration licences.  The works to be carried and being carried out are primarily of a desk study nature and do not involve intrusive work, which one could have with an exploration licence.  In advance of the licensing round that resulted in the licensing options being awarded, it was signalled that it is a condition of the licensing options that exploration drilling would be specifically prohibited during the licensing option phase.</p><p> People have a fair understanding of what is a licensing option.  It is a form of contract with the Minister conferring a first right of refusal for an exploration licence.  The purpose is simple; a company is not committing to the extensive type of programme that would come with an exploration licence but will invest both financial resources and time in considering data that is already there and potential.  The company would be given a space to do this with the understanding that they would be the first party allowed to apply for an exploration licence at the end of that process.  That is all a licensing option entails.  By the end of February next year the holders must decide if they wish to apply for an exploration licence and if an application is to be made, it must be supported by an environmental impact statement.</p><p> I will deal briefly with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, research and its importance in decision making from the Department's perspective.  The committee knows that the EPA carried out preliminary research into the environment aspects of hydraulic fracturing and published a report earlier this year in May.  The EPA is currently scoping a more comprehensive study, and the committee will hear more about that this morning.  There is a key link between that research and decision making.  The Minister in the House has made it very clear that no decision will be made to allow hydraulic fracturing until the results of this further EPA research has been considered.</p><p> The next issue is the regulatory framework that would apply at the exploration and possible production stage.  Much of the discussion to date has been focused on the production stage, which would be a large-scale development with a significant number of paths and traffic movements.  The initial stage of any project is an exploration stage, which would be of a much smaller scale.  The Minister has confirmed that having regard to the nature of the proposed technology, even if the threshold provided by the relevant directive did not apply, he would apply the environmental impact assessment process to any application at the exploration phase.</p><p> That assessment would be informed by advice and submissions from a range of parties, including the EPA, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and a list of bodies with which the Department would have to consult.  It is a long list of bodies, including non-governmental organisations and local authorities, and there would be a public consultation phase where the Department would seek submissions from the public at large.  Additionally, a safety permit would be required at the exploration phase from the Commission for Energy Regulation and a planning consent would also be required.  I drew distinction between the exploration and production phase in terms of scale.  It is clear that at the exploration phase there is a detailed level of interrogation of an application and a number of required consents.</p><p> If a project goes through the exploration phase and demonstrates the possibility of a commercial development, it is possible to move to a development and production stage.  At that time there would be a more significant number of consent processes that would apply, including a planning consent from An Bord Plean&aacute;la falling under the strategic infrastructure Act.  A number of consents would also be required from the Minister, including a petroleum lease, a plan and development consent and a gas pipeline consent.  A safety permit would be required from the Commission for Energy Regulation, as well as an integrated pollution prevention licence from the EPA.  A Gas Act consent from the energy regulator would also be required to connect the gas to the national grid.</p><p> There is a broad range of relevant EU legislation and I touched on some of this earlier, particularly the EIA directive.  There are other directives which may be of relevance, depending on the nature of the project.  A part of our presentation will deal with groundwater, and I will finish our contribution after my colleague, Mr. Verbruggen, has dealt with that.</p></speech>

The Geological Survey of Ireland, as part of the larger Department, provides technical and independent geological advice, including in the groundwater area, where we also work with the EPA.  The circulated document demonstrates the importance of groundwater as a drinking water resource, and it can constitute up to 80% of the water supply in some counties.  Some 68% of group water schemes serving 20 or more people are supplied by groundwater boreholes or springs and we are aware that there are up to 200,000 private wells in rural areas not served by public or group water schemes, and where groundwater is usually the only source of supply.  We have a detailed map showing the level of information we have across all the country, and we can take the north west as an example.  Groundwater resources or aquifers where there is a water supply can be categorised based on its importance and strategic value.  Most of the rural houses and farms would have their own bore and spring, and not all boreholes are necessarily known or mapped.  From the data we have, the deepest water supplies known in the area are approximately 140 metres.</p><p>  As part of risk assessment we produce a groundwater protection or vulnerability map, showing the areas where groundwater is most at risk from surface contamination.  By combining the importance of the aquifer with the thickness of cover and nature of geology, we can produce planning maps used by the local authorities and in development plans.  With regard to contamination pathways, the highest threat is considered to be contamination from boreholes, and engineering solutions are considered to ensure that does not happen.  Gas leakage from below the aquifer along fractures is also an issue, and it should be pointed out that from what we know of the geology, existing faults are relatively tight in the area.  Seismics or acoustics are used to monitor and model the process.  Gas exploration within or adjacent to the aquifer which could cause lateral migration would seem to be unlikely due to lack of permeability or large lateral distances.  It is nonetheless considered a potential source of contamination.</p></speech>

No application has been made to date to drill an exploration well using hydraulic fracturing.  As we have outlined, the EPA is currently scoping further research, which is important for the regulators and any company considering applying for an exploration licence.  They will have to carry out their own environmental assessment but they would have to build into that the findings of the EPA research.  As has been stated, the Minister has confirmed that no decisions will be made to allow hydraulic fracturing until the results of the further EPA research have been considered.</p></speech>

It is vital that the information provided for this committee is conveyed to the wider public because of the concerns expressed, particularly in the areas in which it is proposed to carry out hydraulic fracturing.  </p><p>  One of my questions relates to a comment made earlier about the licence application option, which is that at the end of February the existing licence holders must take a decision on whether to apply for an exploration licence.  Tamboran Resources, representatives of which have chosen not to appear before the committee, indicated in a letter to it that the company was aware that a special study of shale gas had been initiated by the EPA which will report in about 12 months and until that time the company considered discussions would not be meaningful.  It stated it did not believe it was productive to make detailed comment on project impacts until the requirements of the EPA and other regulatory agencies were defined.  It stated its schedule was predicated on the EPA report and the strict regulatory and planning mechanisms that would be in place.  It stated it expected the project would be allowed to advance at least to the test well stage once these regulatory and planning requirements were known, although it believed this was unlikely to be before 2015.  In the light of that letter, does it mean its licence application will fall?  It appears from the letter that Tamboran Resources will not be in a position by February to apply for an exploration licence because it is awaiting the outcome of further research.  What are the implications of this for licence holders?</p><p>  Also, Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in has pointed out that there are a number of EU regulatory regimes in place that will have an impact and be relevant to the final decision on this issue.  A question was put by two Green Party Members of the European Parliament to the Directorate-General for the Environment last July and the reply stated that as part of its ongoing effort to determine whether the level of human health and environmental protection provided by the existing EU legislation was appropriate, the Commission had initiated work in order to assess by the end of 2013 whether there was a need for a risk management framework for shale gas developments in Europe, both at the exploration and commercial production phases and, if necessary, the form that it would take.  What input does the Department have into these discussions with the Directorate-General for the Environment?  Is it actively engaging with it in terms of what appears to be ongoing research and analysis as to whether the existing legislative framework in Europe will be sufficient?  As the officials will be aware, several European countries have suspended or introduced a moratorium on shale gas exploration; therefore, this is a Europe-wide issue, not exclusively an Irish one.  What input will the Department have into it?</p></speech>

One hears people talk about conflicts of interest; I certainly have one in this instance.</p><p>  It is a pity this meeting is not being held in north Leitrim instead of on Kildare Street.  At some stage members of the committee will need to meet in north Leitrim to see the countryside and the community we are discussing.  I formally propose that a meeting be held on a site in what would be the centre of fracking operations.  Can such a meeting be arranged?  I will facilitate by providing a nice conference room that would be capable of accommodating the meeting.</p><p>  To put it mildly, it is disappointing that representatives of Tamboran Resources did not see fit to attend this meeting.  The reason they have given is that it is difficult to engage in meaningful discussions at this stage, yet, according to them, they continue to work closely with the relevant Departments in establishing dialogue with all stakeholders.  Therefore, they are saying they do not have enough information to talk to legislators, but they do have enough information to talk to the community.  Is it any wonder that the community has concerns about the validity of the information being passed at those meetings?  Had Tamboran Resources representatives been here, I would have asked them to explain something.  There are recent credible reports which cast serious doubt on the company's projected figures for the estimates of gas available, average well performance and projected well life.  They also call into serious question the projected development costs, income projections, job number projections and, critically, the State income projections.</p><p>  I have a vested interest and my position is very clear.  It would constitute the worst form of social and environmental vandalism to turn the beautiful landscape of north Leitrim and subsequently counties Fermanagh, Cavan, Sligo, Tyrone and Donegal into what would be an industrial wasteland and put at risk our vital agrifood and tourism industries for the potential financial gain of a small number of people.</p></speech>

What input, if any, will the committee have in reaching that decision?  Is the committee a talking shop or will it have a real input in reaching that decision?  Is there any provision in legislation for a D&aacute;il vote on a decision of such crucial importance for the nation?  My view is that little is known about the impact of fracking.  People talk about experiments and work taking place in Poland and the United States, but north Leitrim is different.  The ground and scenery are different and what is underground is totally different from what is in Poland or the United States.  It will be at least ten or 20 years before we will have enough information to make a decision on this technology.  Will the officials advise of their estimates of the likely timescale to reach a decision on the Lough Allen basin?  I am referring to a timescale for exploration because that would be the beginning of the damaging of north Leitrim.</p><p>  Are we, as a Parliament, doing enough to exploit wind, wave and tidal energy off our extensive Atlantic coast?  Are all our eggs being put in the fracking basket?</p> <p>The Department has initiated work on energy conservation measures, but, given that domestic dwellings account for 40% of our energy use, surely we should do more on energy conservation measures for such dwellings.</p><p> I have serious concerns that a company in the initial stages of applying for an exploratory licence is offering so-called unconditional grants to community organisations.  Such organisations are almost always strapped for cash and desperate and will take money from any source.  It is, therefore, unethical for companies to offer so-called unconditional grants to community organisations which has the potential to cause serious rifts within the community.  The last thing we want is another Rossport.  Members, the Government, the Department and any company involved must be very careful about fomenting discontent in a community.  Are payments allowable expenses against tax if a company is subsequently granted a licence?  It would be the irony of ironies if the taxpayer was paying as dissent was fomented within a community by way of community organisations receiving a grant from a company.</p><p> I have three more questions.</p></speech>

Given the possibility that a company may sell on the permission or engage in a joint venture with another company, how will the Department enforce commitments made by it?</p><p>  Two weeks ago the advice of the European Commissioner for Energy to member states, unofficially, seemed to be not to make a decision for three to five years because work was ongoing and data were still coming in.  That provided some reassurance until I received a newsletter, <i>EU News Bulletin</i>, published by the Irish Regions Brussels office of September 2012, issue No. 94.  Lo and behold, I note a budget of &euro;200,000 has been set aside to cover five or six hearings and campaigns with a view to organising early stage dialogue with citizens and launch information campaigns on shale gas as a basis for informing decision-making on its potential industrial exploitation.  Many members of the community in north Leitrim will have heard the European Commissioner saying there was insufficient information available and telling people to wait and see what happened.  At the same time, representatives of a company will not appear before the committee because it is too early to meet legislators, but it will talk to communities to split them.  Members of the committee have insufficient information.  What is the gap between what we need to know and what we know?  People will think we are being led down a rosy path in the garden.  They will think decisions have already been made and that the community is being channelled in a certain direction.  The evidence seems to bear this out.</p></speech>

The officials have referred to the licensing options which will run out in February 2013.  The company will have to apply for an exploration licence at that stage.  Is there a possibility it will apply for a continuation or an extension of the licensing option in the light of its comments about not appearing before the committee without further progress being made on environmental reports and technology?  If the company cannot have its options extended, will the interest in fracking in Ireland die in 2013 if no other companies are involved?</p></speech>

It is very important that they do because many decisions are made, including on bus routes, without talking to people and seeing what the situation is on the ground.  One can do stuff on a desktop, but if one does not talk to people and see what the situation is on the ground, it is a waste of time.  Can the departmental officials do as I ask?  Deputy Michael Colreavy mentioned that we did not want another Rossport; we certainly do not.  People need to be consulted and listened to.  We do not need consultation involving the equivalent of an arrow being fired first and the target being drawn to it to make it look like there is consultation.  If the people living in an area do not want something, it cannot happen.  To what extent will the officials take into account the opinions of people living in an area?  I have a vested interest in the matter because I live in Roscommon where groundwater accounts for some 70% of our drinking water.  If it is contaminated, it is not as simple as decontaminating it.  If ever caution was needed, it is in this case.  We need energy, but we need water a lot more.</p><p>  I am sure the officials are aware of the study issued by the European Parliament which specifically points to how one has to be careful in going down the road towards fracking in sensitive areas.</p> <p>I am interested to hear the comments of the Department.  I will conclude by saying it is very worrying and very disappointing that Tamboran Resources would not attend today's meeting.  It does not inspire confidence, and confidence in Tamboran is not particularly high as it stands.  I think they have done themselves more damage here.</p></speech>

When will such a licence be issued?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-10a.639" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2012101000007#J00800"><p>I refer to the two themes which are common to many of the questions.  Questions were asked as to the next step in the application process and the associated timeline.  Questions were asked about a number of studies that have been completed or are ongoing and how they relate to the process.  I will start with those two themes and I will answer the questions as best I can.</p><p>  I refer to the application process.  The companies have a licensing option which gives them a first right over others to apply for an exploration licence.  If they wish to exercise that right, they must do so before the end of next February.  In reply to Deputy O'Mahony, three companies in different parts of the country have those licensing options.  They will make their decisions independently before the end of February as to whether they wish to apply for a licence.  If they wish to stay involved in the process and they wish to exercise that right, they would need to apply.  The key point is that any such application and process must be supported by an environmental impact statement.  The Minister has said that this process and the evaluation of that application will be underpinned by a full environmental impact assessment.  The Minister has also said that the assessment cannot conclude until the findings of the further EPA research are considered.  That is the first stage on the timeline, for the information of the committee.</p><p>  To be clear, there is nothing in the statutory process that indicates the timeline by which that environmental impact assessment must be concluded.  This is important from the perspective that no company has a right to make an application and demand a response.  The application process will take the length of time it takes and a key element in that process and in the evaluation will be the findings of the further EPA research.  The committee may have to wait for the next presentation to understand the timeline element.  I will not pre-empt the EPA findings because in the first instance it will be scientific research and it will make conclusions.  If those conclusions leave it open to a project advancing to an exploration stage, then the full evaluation of the application and the environmental impact statement and assessment process will begin.  One can anticipate that the process, if it runs well and if there were no need for additional information, would last for eight or nine months but it could be more than one year.  Time would need to be allowed at the conclusion of the EPA research for the company and the regulatory bodies to consider that research and then a nine to 12-month period would need to be allowed for an assessment of an application.  That is the timeline involved.  As for the range of studies that have been completed and those which are ongoing, they will feed into the EPA project.  The aim is to conclude with a scientific-based understanding of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing in Ireland and for that to inform future decision making.  </p><p>  I will deal with some of the other questions from members.  The potential environmental and social impact will be addressed through those consent processes.  Deputy Colreavy referred to the exploration stage in this regard.  There will be an environmental impact assessment of any application for an exploration licence and that environmental impact assessment has to take account of community issues and the environmental and social impacts.  A number of consent bodies determine whether the exploration phase can go ahead.  The exploration licence is a matter for the Minister, but as outlined in the presentation, a planning consent is required and also a safety permit from the Commission for Energy Regulation.  As regards the role of the Oireachtas, the members will understand that role as well as anyone.  In my view, the manner in which such applications must be considered is set down in the legislation by the Legislature.  A point that is raised at times with regard to the discussion about unconventional gas is relevant to a point raised by Deputy Colreavy about the trade-off between the use of gas versus the use of renewable energy.  It would relate to unconventional gas if unconventional gas was an acceptable way to proceed and it is also relevant to conventional offshore gas.  The key point for Ireland is that there will be a continued high dependence on gas in our energy mix.  There is a benefit for Ireland if that gas is indigenous gas and we can gain a financial return from it.  </p><p>  On the question about company figures, the Department does not comment on projections made by exploration companies involved at the early stages or in the exploration stage.  The only time the company figures matter is at the point when it is making the case that it has a commercial discovery.  There are often news reports, in advance of exploration drilling, of predictions by the company which are based on what might be the potential of an area.  Exploration drilling is required for any confirmation and a significant level of appraisal drilling will be required before there can be a determination of the reserves with anything close to great certainty.  As to the enforcement of commitments, the Department has a strong control in that any change in ownership of the authorisation-holder at an exploration phase or in a later development production phase requires the consent of the Minister.  The obligations entered into by the initial party must be transferred in that process.  On the question about the knowledge gap, the core aim of the EPA research is to identify the extent of that gap and to address it.  I will leave that matter to be dealt with in the next presentation.</p></speech>

In the event that a company was selling, or there was a change in control and it was withdrawing and selling its share to its partner, it would require the consent of the Minister.  The key issue for the Minister in considering this would be whether the partnership had been strengthened by the change in control.  The principal point is that it does not change the obligations that go with the authorisation; they continue.</p></speech>

We are speaking about the process the Department would use in granting an exploratory licence.

If we do nothing for a period, we will potentially be in the same place we are in now.  Ireland is doing something positive to address the science needed to underpin a decision.  We recognise that if an application is made for an exploration licence, it will have to be evaluated under the existing framework.  There is a gap, however, in terms of the science and we want to address it.</p><p>  I will leave it to the EPA to outline a timetable for research, but before a decision could be made by the Minister on an application for an exploration licence, there would have to be EPA research and time to consider the findings followed by an eight to 12 month process of evaluation under the EIA directive.</p></speech>

That is a sinister development because activity is already under way in County Fermanagh, directly across the Border.  This is the same operational area from which shale gas could be extracted and it affects both sides of the Border.  Is the Department aware of this initiative and what input can it have through Government access to bodies such as the British-Irish Ministerial Council, the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association and others?  This is a matter of great concern.  It will spill over into the South if it provides a direct financial incentive for companies to engage in hydraulic fracturing.</p></speech>

There are five wells in the north west that were drilled for conventional gas exploration purposes.  They were targeting thin sand intervals and vertical wells.  The most recent work was done by Evergreen Resources in 2000.  This is the first time work has been done to evaluate shale gas potential in the area.  The seismic data are very old and their quality is questionable.  The data need reprocessing work and may even need a new acquisition to aid in the interpretation and help to evaluate the potential involved.  As in the case of offshore exploration, the only time the Department would evaluate the size of a resource and the potential recoverable oil or gas is when the exploration and appraisal work has been done.  To date no exploration work has been done to assess shale gas potential.</p></speech>

I hope my statement will assist the committee.  As members are aware, the Environmental Protection Agency is an independent statutory body, established in 1993 under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  We have a wide range of responsibilities in the environmental field.  Today, we are discussing hydraulic fracturing.</p><p>  The main role of the EPA with regard to projects involving hydraulic fracturing, or fracking as it is commonly termed, is its regulatory role through the IPPC licensing process as set out in the EPA Act, whereby an IPPC licence is required for onshore extraction of shale gas on a commercial scale.  The EPA does not have a regulatory role at the exploration stage of these projects, but will be a statutory consultee with respect to any environmental impact assessment conducted by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, as indicated earlier.  The Environmental Protection Agency is also involved in research into the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing.</p><p>  The EPA has a number of roles.  First I will discuss our research role.  The EPA is responsible for the development, co-ordination and management of environmental research in Ireland and has provided funding for environmental research since 1994.  The current research programme STRIVE has been running since 2007 and is focused on major environmental challenges and the provision of policy relevant analysis and research.  The study Hydraulic Fracturing or 'Fracking': A Short Summary of Current Knowledge and Potential Environmental Impacts was published by the EPA in May 2012.  This short desk study was conducted for the agency by the University of Aberdeen.  It provides an introduction to the environmental aspects of fracking including a review of regulatory approaches used in other countries and areas for further investigation and research.  In brief, some of the key findings of the study included the importance of well integrity for preventing groundwater contamination; the importance of knowledge of local geology regarding potential impacts on groundwater quality and the possibility of tremors; and the uncertainty regarding the carbon footprint of shale gas in comparison to conventional natural gas.  This is an important climate change issue.  There are a small number of published, peer reviewed, scientific studies in the area.  This study also examined regulatory approaches in Europe, North America and elsewhere and identified areas where further research is required to determine best practice.</p><p>  The information provided by this preliminary research project will now be used to inform a more comprehensive study to be commissioned by the EPA, in co-operation with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  This project will be administered by the STRIVE programme, and steered by a committee with representatives from  the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resoaurces, Environment, Community and Local Government, the Commission for Energy Regulation, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Geological Survey of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency.  The EPA expects to commission this study in 2012.  The scope of the research, while not finalised, is expected to address, among others, the areas of environmental best practice; identification of potential environmental impacts, local and global, and associated mitigation measures; baseline studies to characterise the existing local environment; and an examination of regulatory frameworks in the Republic, Northern Ireland, and the EU.  The study will take account of existing international research in the field, and a public consultation process is also planned.  While elements of the research will relate to specific regions where options have been granted from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, it is the intention that the study will generally be applicable to the island of Ireland.</p><p>  With regard to international research on hydraulic fracturing, there is currently much research underway, particularly in the EU and US, on the environmental and human health aspects and impacts of fossil fuel activities involving fracking.  As recently as September 2012 the EU Commission has published two studies in this area, on climate impact and the environment and human health.  The EU Commission has also recently invited tenders for research aimed at supporting possible Commission initiatives on managing impacts and risks arising from unconventional gas developments, and assisting the Commission in developing best regulatory practices.  In the US, the US EPA is currently conducting research on the potential impact of these projects on drinking water resources.  This research is expected to be completed in 2014, and an interim report is expected in late 2012.  The Environmental Protection Agency will be keeping abreast of all such research with a view to being in the best possible position to perform its statutory duties.</p><p>  The primary role of the EPA with regard to fracking is our licensing role.  Any proposed project involving the commercial scale extraction of shale gas would therefore need to apply to the EPA for, and be granted, an IPPC licence in order to operate.  Any licence issued for such an activity would also regulate the environmental aspects of any hydraulic fracturing operations taking place as part of the extraction activity.  The IPPC licences aim to prevent or reduce emissions to air, water and land, reduce waste generation and use energy and resources efficiently.  Applicants are required to demonstrate that they meet the criteria set out in the legislation to be considered as "fit and proper" persons to hold such a licence.  They must also make adequate provision for closure and environmental liabilities.</p><p>  The IPPC licence is a single integrated licence which covers all emissions from the facility and its environmental management.  All related operations that the licence holder carries out in connection with the activity are controlled by this licence.  In order to grant a licence, the EPA must be satisfied that emissions from the activity do not cause a significant environmental impact.  Any application to the EPA must demonstrate the use of best environmental practice in order to minimise environmental impact.  Applicants are also required to demonstrate that the proposed activity would not cause any breaches of national legislation or European directives.  For example, with regard to protection of groundwater, an applicant would be required to show that no breaches of the EU Water Framework Directive or national water quality standards would occur.</p><p>  No applications for IPPC licences for commercial extraction of shale gas have been received by the agency to date. </p> <p>Any applications received in the future will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the requirements of the EPA Acts.  The key environmental issues to be addressed in any future application include the potential for groundwater contamination from methane migration, the impact of any chemical additives in the fracking fluid, the treatment and disposal of flowback fluid, greenhouse gas emissions and water usage.</p><p> I would like to speak about European work on this issue.  The EPA, representing Ireland, participates in an EU technical working group on the environmental aspects of unconventional fossil fuels, in particular shale gas.  The working group consists of representatives of member states, the European Environment Agency and the EU Commission.  The purpose of this group is to assist in identifying and addressing knowledge gaps, potential key issues and priorities in relation to environmental protection, to act as a platform for information exchange on environmental aspects of and best practices for shale gas projects and to contribute to the Commission's efforts to assess whether existing EU environmental legislation ensures there is an appropriate level of protection of the environment and human health.</p><p> Climate change needs to be considered as part of any discussion on fracking operations.  The EPA plays a number of key roles as part of Ireland's response to the challenges of climate change, for example by drawing up Ireland's annual greenhouse gas inventory, which is reported to the EU and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and used to determine compliance with emissions targets under the Kyoto Protocol and the future EU climate and energy package.  The EPA also provides official projections of future emissions of greenhouse gases in the context of projected policies and measures.  EPA projections for the period from 2011 to 2020 show that Ireland can comply with its Kyoto obligations with regard to greenhouse gas emissions.  Even in the best case scenario, however, Ireland is predicted to breach its annual obligations under the EU 2020 target from 2017 onwards.  Our total emissions are projected to be above the EU 2020 target by between 4.1 million and 7.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.</p><p> Globally, carbon dioxide and methane are the two most important long-life greenhouse gases that are driving climate change.  In this context, it is important to note that methane is the main constituent of natural gas.  At the point of conversion to energy, fossil methane is less carbon-intensive than other fossil energy sources, such as coal, oil or peat.  Fuel switching from coal, peat or oil to natural gas has a climate benefit at the point of use, in so far as the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per equivalent amount of heating or electricity generation is reduced.  The conversion of home heating from coal to gas in Dublin is a good example of this.  That measure has had significant benefits for air quality and has contributed to lowering Ireland's emissions from this sector.</p><p> Fugitive greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas exploration, production and processing are included in greenhouse gas inventories.  For Ireland, such life cycle emissions are currently low because most of our natural gas is imported.  Approximately 93% of it was imported in 2011.  Any methane emissions from fracking, or during exploration drilling, would be reported in Ireland's inventory.  While uncertainties are significant, the use of locally produced shale gas to replace imported gas is likely to increase associated emissions for Ireland.  While the level of such an increase is uncertain - it might not be large - it would add to our total emissions and have implications for other sectors, such as the agriculture sector.  If such gas is used to replace coal or peat or certain oil-using systems, it may reduce the associated emissions.  However, such a transition needs to be assessed in the context of overall climate policy.</p><p> As the committee will know, the National Economic and Social Council has been tasked to report on the development of climate policy in Ireland.  The first part of its report, which relates to 2020 targets, was published earlier this month.  The second part of it, which will consider Ireland's transition to a low-emission economy, is due to be completed by the end of the year.  Natural gas will have an important role in such a transition.  However, its use needs to be factored into a clear transition scenario.  For example, relatively lower-emission methane systems could replace higher-emission coal, peat and oil systems, which would then be replaced by sustainable energy sources over a certain period of time.</p><p> Further research is required to fully understand the potential impact on the environment of the use of this technology.  The key questions this research needs to answer are whether this technology can be used while fully protecting the environment and human health and, if so, what is the best environmental practice in using the technology.  The question of whether the existing EU environmental regulatory framework is adequate for unconventional fossil fuels projects is also being addressed.  The answers to these questions will assist the agency and other regulators in fulfilling their statutory roles with regard to these projects.  I hope I have given the committee an overview of the possible environmental implications of hydraulic fracturing.  Along with my colleagues, I will be happy to answer any questions the members of the committee may have.</p></speech>

I appreciate the comprehensive nature of her presentation.  Is there an understanding that the shale gas components would be made up in this country?  Is there enough geological evidence to indicate that this country's geological composition could be different from that of other countries?  Has the EPA received any indication of that?  What sort of criteria will the EPA use when it compiles its report?  Ms Burke mentioned various issues.  It seems to me, from the little I know about this matter, that different procedures are used in different countries.  Most of the information is coming out of America.  For example, chemicals are currently being used.  Tamboran, which is the leading company in this area, has repeatedly said it will not use chemicals but will use water only.  The area where it is proposed to extract shale gas has a high water content in terms of lakes and rivers.  That is unlike the American experience of locations like deserts that have a totally different topography.  Will the EPA take that into account when it is setting the criteria?  What will it be looking for?  What can we expect to get at the end of this report?  Ms Burke indicated that the EPA is tracking what is happening in other countries.  She referred to the American report.  It seems that the actual procedures continue to be the subject of a great deal of controversy.  Will the EPA issue a report that focuses on how the gas is extracted?  What sort of safeguards will be built into the procedures?  I appreciate that it is difficult for the EPA, which is just starting to examine this matter, to answer these questions at this time.  Based on the preliminary report that was issued by the University of Aberdeen, can Ms Burke give an indication of the conclusions the EPA has come to in its thinking at this stage?  There may be other questions.  I have asked about the generality.  I know others wish to get involved.</p></speech>

I am still unclear.  Does an exploratory licence permit hydraulic fracturing in north Leitrim?  I received an answer to that question, but I did not understand it.  It is not clear to me.  This document points out that people have the right to make a submission.  We are talking about the potential for environmental impacts such as the poisoning of groundwater.  Nothing in the document relates to the impact that this development would have on the people who live in north Leitrim.</p> <p>From reading about experiences in other jurisdictions where hydraulic fracturing is practised, I have learned that nobody listened to the concerns raised elsewhere.  In Ireland the concerns about fracking are not confined to the possible poisoning of groundwater or potential damage to the agrifood and tourism industries.  People are concerned that a beautiful agricultural area with drumlin hills, lakes, rivers, mountains and valleys - I again suggest members visit north County Leitrim - will be turned into an industrial wasteland.  Fracking will impact on local people.  Prior to my election to the D&aacute;il last year, I was a county councillor in County Leitrim where applications to build houses with a septic tank were rejected on the basis that a family home would be intrusive on the landscape.  This is the same area where consideration is being given to allowing the construction of seven acre concrete pads.  I cannot understand why we are even considering allowing exploratory hydraulic fracturing in this area.  Will someone explain the reason, please?</p></speech>

The main concern about fracking relates to the possibility of groundwater being contaminated.  Given our heavy dependence on groundwater, like Deputy Michael Colreavy, I wonder why the possibility of permitting hydraulic fracturing is even being considered.  The evidence from other countries suggests different jurisdictions take different approaches.  The United Kingdom appears to have an open mind on the process; France has closed down the process, while Germany and Poland are exploring the possibility of allowing fracking.  The intelligence, as it were, from North America and Australia suggests the approach taken in these countries is different.  Unlike Australia and the United States, however, Ireland's centres of population are close together and our dependency on groundwater is great.  Fracking is much easier to carry out in the middle of Australia where the nearest centre of population may be five hours away by air than it would be in Ireland.  Given that the process is in its infancy, we should consider permitting it and await information on the practice in other countries before allowing fracking to commence here.</p></speech>

Will the Environmental Protection Agency comment on the report from the European Parliament which expressed serious concerns about hydraulic fracturing technology?  Given that hydraulic fracturing is a new technology, what lessons have the Environmental Protection Agency learned from other countries and which of them will it consider when making a decision on the matter?  When does it expect to make a decision on the issuing of a commercial licence?  What links does it have with environmental agencies in other countries to ensure it is informed of developments elsewhere?</p></speech>

This is a prime driver of the research.  The role of the Environmental Protection Agency is to protect the environment and science is at the core of all our activities.  I hope I was clear in my statement in noting that we did not have information available to us to make a decision on whether this technology could be operated without harming human health or the environment.  This is the key purpose of the research, which is taking place at international and European level.  A key part of the research we will carry out in conjunction with the other relevant bodies is to examine baseline studies to characterise the existing local environment in Ireland, in other words, to address the issue of local geology and other local issues.  We do not want to duplicate research being carried out at European level or in other countries and will instead localise our research in order that we have data on which to make a decision.</p><p>  The Deputies are correct that compliance with the water framework directive is a key criterion in respect of any of these activities.  We cannot permit any activity to undermine Ireland's compliance with European Union obligations to have good water quality.  Water is also a significant resource for the country and we cannot undermine it.  The research is to obtain a large amount of baseline information on Irish circumstances. </p><p>  With regard to the impact of the development in north County Leitrim, as I stated, the Environmental Protection Agency is not the only body progressing the relevant research.  We have arranged that the steering committee has representatives of the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Commission for Energy Regulation, which will also have responsibility for regulation in this area, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Geological Survey of Ireland and the environment agency in Northern Ireland.  All the regulators that would at some stage in the future have a role in regulating the activity in question are included in the steering committee in order that any issue raised, including by the relevant bodies in question, may be addressed.  The purpose of the steering committee is to try to pull together all of the bodies which have a role in the context of the research required.</p><p>  The report of the European Parliament will feed into the research we are conducting.  We are very conscious of the findings of this and other reports.  It is important to note in the context of the report that it found that thresholds of environmental impact assessment needed to be examined.  In the Irish case, environmental impact assessment would be carried out for the exploratory phase.  This has been stated by officials from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  With regard to the regulatory framework, Ireland is slightly different from elsewhere in that under the Environmental Protection Agency Act and the integrated pollution prevention and control, IPCC, licensing regime, shale gas exploration is specifically included as an operation that would require a licence.  That is not the case in other EU member states.</p><p>  With regard to links with other environmental agencies, as I indicated, the Environmental Protection Agency is represented on the EU technical working group on shale gas.  In addition, members of EPA senior management and I are part of a network of environmental protection agencies throughout Europe in which fracking is being discussed as a key upcoming issue.  While we have not yet visited a fracking operation in another country, I am sure such a visit will take place before we make any decision on this activity.</p></speech>

In the first instance, the research must be completed, at which point an exploration licence would have to be approved.  It would only be at the end of an exploration licence process that an application would come to the Environmental Protection Agency.  For this reason, I cannot provide a timescale, although I will say a significant period will elapse before we even receive an application for commercial extraction.  The reason the EPA is being proactive and doing the work now is to ensure we will have the relevant data available to us in advance of any licence application being submitted.</p></speech>

If they do, could they bring someone from F&aacute;ilte Ireland to ascertain whether he or she thinks it is a lovely place to visit?  If someone from F&aacute;ilte Ireland does not think it too lovely, it would be a good indicator that not many people will be visiting north Leitrim if fracking comes there.  The man from Tamboran Resources was quite disparaging about how beautiful the place was and did not seem to think that there was much potential for tourism.</p></speech>

We need to ensure that any new activity that commences does not undermine what we currently have, which is a very good quality environment in Ireland.  That has an intrinsic value in its own right, as I am sure this committee is aware, but it also has a very important value for tourism and agricultural industries.  We have talked about water resources, which are predicted to assume increased strategic importance to Ireland, and we need to protect these resources.  Any action that is taken into the future cannot undermine our water quality or other industries.  Again, it goes back to evidence-based decision making.  We need to complete the research in order to help us base any decision into the future.  Of course, we must take local factors into consideration.  That is the reason why the EPA on the steering committee in respect of the research and organisations like the Commission for Energy Regulation and An Bord Plean&aacute;la are involved, all of which have their own distinct regulatory roles in this regard.</p></speech>

Where does that leave the EPA?  What would happen if the EPA comes down against hydraulic fracking as having an adverse impact on the environment but Northern Ireland goes ahead with fracking?  The British Government is now considering offering tax incentives to fracking companies.  Where does that leave us because it will have a direct impact on our environment?</p></speech>

I will also address the risk of groundwater contamination, which I know has been discussed previously but some of the slides might give a better view of the problem.  I will also discuss the impacts on health, the promise of jobs and the social impacts of this boom and bust industry.</p><p>  Onshore shale gas extraction is not the same as a North Sea oil or gas rig.  In conventional shale gas extraction there is a reservoir of gases underneath and a few wells can extract vast volumes of gas.  In the Corrib gas field five wells can extract 1 trillion cu. ft.  In unconventional gas extraction the target area is deeper, the gas must be released by high-volume hydraulic fracturing and thousands of wells may be needed to extract the same volume of gas.  In the north west, the proposal is to take over 156 sq. m., industrialise it, build 120 pads and drill 3,000 wells.  The scale of this project cannot be compared with a conventional proposal.</p><p>  This slide shows a picture of what would come to Ireland.  I am not speaking only about north Leitrim; I am also speaking about Fermanagh, Clare and other places where proposals may be made for shale gas extraction.  The pads shown are seven acres each and it is proposed to place one in every square mile throughout the target area.  A total of 24 wells are to be drilled from each pad, which is 3,000 in total.  This is the Tamboran proposal for north Leitrim and Fermanagh.  We do not know what proposal will be made for Clare.</p><p>  The picture shows a pad in British Columbia.  Soon after the picture was published a report showed that more than 40 seismic events were recorded where none had been recorded prior to 2009.  We know earthquakes were caused by the first two wells drilled in the UK.  The target area in Ireland has many geological faults so there is a high risk of the same thing happening.</p><p>  I am not speaking about the exploratory stage; I am speaking about what would happen if the proposal reached the production stage.  I see this as being like a juggernaut.  If it reaches the exploratory stage and the results are good this slide shows what we can look forward to in rural areas of Ireland and, if the area is good, it will creep towards centres of population.  This slide shows Dish in Texas.  If one logs on to Google Earth and keys in Dimock in Pennsylvania or Alberta in Canada one will see the same thing.  These places are not populated, but there are people the length and breadth of Ireland and the countryside is dotted with little villages and communities which have existed for generations.</p><p>  This slide shows a map of north-west Ireland indicating where the proposal would be situated.  The red circle is the first phase proposed by Tamboran where 3,000 wells are to be drilled.  The blue circle shows where the company could go afterwards because the shale there is more than 700 metres thick.  The company could go down around Lough Allen into the Shannon River area.  Where the company is now is in the Shannon catchment area, which is also linked to the Erne catchment.  Whatever is done in Fermanagh will affect the South.  Similar areas are found in clear extending through Limerick into north Kerry and Cork.  Many other counties need to be aware of this proposal.</p><p>  This slide shows a bird's eye view of what the area proposed for fracking would look like with the pads.  I will now show committee members some animations which will make a twinkly effect.  The slide gives an idea of the density of the pads.  It does not show the access roads, gas pipelines or huge machinery involved.  It would have huge consequences for the land.  These are areas of high visual amenity, vast underground water and cave systems and blanket bogs.  There is no room in the proposal for the farms which exist.  They may survive for a while but they will have contamination problems.  If there is a rumour of contamination entering the food chain it could have a disastrous consequence for agriculture throughout Ireland and not only in this part of the country.</p><p>  This is a diagram of under the ground.  The lower line shows the depth of the Barnett Shale in the US.  It is very deep and goes from 1,500 metres to 3,000 metres, which is one to two miles below the ground.  Whatever happens at this distance is very far away from the surface of the water.  The vertical lines show the depth of the fractures caused by hydraulic fracturing.  They can be 580 metres long and at this depth one might suggest they do not do any harm.  This slide shows the groundwater depth, which we know can go down to 150 metres below the ground and this shows where it is proposed to frack in Ireland.  The shale is much shallower and goes from 500 metres to 1,250 metres.  The same type and length of fracture will cause a high risk of contamination of the aquifers.</p><p>  Any geologist will cringe at this slide, which shows a very simplified view of the various layers in the area we are discussing.  We have shallow aquifers towards the top, layers of rock, and the shale target area, which is between 500 metres and 1,250 metres.</p> <p>The geology of north County Leitrim is unusual in that there is another aquifer under the shale layer.  It is called Ballyshannon limestone, because that is where it rises to the top.  Where it approaches the top is also the source of the water supply of Ballyshannon and south County Donegal.  People from the area need to be aware that this layer goes deep into the ground under the shale layer.  At that depth, the ground is dense and water does not flow.  The next animations will show how the drill goes through the shale layer and then across.  That is fine, but the layer subsequently fractures.  If the fractures are of the same length as the fractures shown in the previous slide, it is not just a case of the aquifer underneath being fracked, but also the aquifer above.  This will not necessarily be the consequence of shallow fracking in an area with aquifers above and below, but it certainly could be.</p><p> When the aquifer is fracked, it is shattered.  That is what "fracking" means.  It becomes more permeable and water can then flow.  I have been given this advice by a hydrogeologist.  A scale is described at the top of the slide.  I have included a little drill, but drill derricks are approximately 100 ft. tall and extraordinarily powerful.</p><p> I have outlined some of the risks.  There are risks to ground water from cement casing failures, which present significant problems.  Wells are supposed to be protected from the land by cement, but it is difficult to form a bond between cement and the clay soil of the areas being drilled.  The incidence of casing failure is higher the older a well grows.  We do not know what this will mean for the transport of fluids or gases.  Fluids and gases also move through fractures or faults and can reach ground water sources.</p><p> Accidents cause spillages and the contamination of lakes and streams.  We cannot legislate for accidents, but we know from industry papers that the number of accidents causing pollution events is approximately 21% of the wells drilled.  The industry actually congratulated itself on halving the number of accidents.</p><p> No one has explained how the large volumes of contaminated waste water will be treated.  It will be difficult, as it will be high in salt, etc.  Methane will leak into the air.  Some 1,000 vehicles are required to build a pad with a well, but we are discussing approximately 60 pads and 3,000 wells.  Dust and ozone pollution from traffic will be a major problem.</p><p> If this is not bad enough, we will need to consider the effects on health.  Chemicals will go down in the fracking fluid and will be added to by a range of substances below.  The nine most common chemicals found in fracking fluids have serious effects on human and animal health.  The next slide was produced by a reputable organisation that researches the effect of chemicals.  As members can see, the entire body is affected, including the nervous, endocrine, respiratory, gastrointestinal and reproductive systems, the kidneys, etc.  The slide does not show the nine chemicals in detail, but they include biocides, petroleum products, breakers, gel makers, etc.  Fracking without chemicals is impossible.  From a chemist's point of view, all substances are chemicals.  Even if one is using sand and water, it counts as a mixture of chemicals.  Modern technology does not allow the industry to function without the use of chemicals.</p><p> We do not know what the long-term effects will be.  High-density, high-volume hydraulic fracturing is a new industry and has only been around for the past seven years or so.  The studies of long-term effects have only just started.  One must also examine the effects on communities, including stress, disruption and deterioration of quality of life.</p><p> It has been proposed that the industry will create many jobs.  I wish to point out the pattern of jobs created in the US.  Initially, many workers are involved.  Establishing each well requires approximately 400 workers, but these jobs are not cumulative.  The workers move from well to well.  Although some jobs are created, the number is in the hundreds, not thousands.  Those involved are normally migrant workers, teams brought in by the oil companies with no relationship to the land or the people living in the area.  It is a boom and bust cycle.  The company proposes a 15-year cycle in the development phase.  The workers will come and go.  There are fewer longer term jobs.  The 60 pads in County Leitrim will probably create 180 jobs, given the intensity of the operation.</p><p> The populations in the target areas - Fermanagh, Leitrim, Clare and north Kerry - are significantly engaged in agriculture and tourism.  The new jobs will cause a considerable displacement of jobs on the ground.  If farming is disrupted, many more jobs will be lost than will be created.</p><p> Experience of the development phase in the US is for a sudden influx of new people to an area.  This poses challenges in terms of housing, culture and public services.  Some 400 does not sound like much in Dublin, but it is a large number in a rural area and will cause problems.  Social problems will increase because of the divide between the haves and the have-nots, those who are making a great deal of money and those who are making none.  These problems include crime, mental health issues, community dissatisfaction and conflict.  It is well known and documented that wherever the industry sets up, it is followed by increased levels of alcoholism, drug taking and prostitution.  This is the type of future that may wait for the areas in question.</p> <p>There are also the public health problems which I spoke of, including allergies, respiratory and immune issues.  Another very reputable organisation has pointed these out.</p><p> All of this means we have a choice of whether to go down this path.  Even talk of giving out exploratory licences has an implication for the granting of production licences.  We need a clear commitment from the Government that it will not provide any licences for on-shore shale gas exploration or development.  It must be adopted by the Government as policy that high-volume hydraulic fracturing will be prohibited in Ireland.  We are not saying there can be no investigation of alternative technologies or energies but this technology should not be allowed in Ireland.</p></speech>

A steel tube would then be inserted, with concrete used to bond it to whatever rock is there.  I mentioned there is a problem with the bond.  The middle is clear, with no sand.  The same applies to the horizontal drill process.  When the operators begin fracturing, they push down water containing sand, and to keep the sand in the water they use a gelling substance.  That is forced through the shale and keeps the fractures open.</p></speech>

Has the group been at all encouraged by what it heard this morning from the regulatory agencies, including the Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA?  The impression given is that nothing will happen in the short or medium term, with the Tamboran company now caught in the horns of a dilemma.  It has been made clear that if it does not apply for a licence in February, the process will fall.  The correspondence from the company to this committee has indicated that nothing will be done until all the EPA and technological reports are concluded.  In that context, are the witnesses encouraged that an attempt is being made, particularly by the Department and to a lesser extent by the EPA, to tread cautiously?  How would the witnesses respond to what they have heard?</p><p>  Are the witnesses indicating they will not accept hydraulic fracturing under any circumstances with regard to current technology?  Is it seen as being absolutely damaging to the environment, as it was made quite clear in the presentation's conclusion that high-volume fracking should be prohibited?  Has the research provided any indication from across the world that there will be improvements in technology or we could arrive at a position where shale gas could be extracted without the use of horrendous infrastructure?  It appears to be like a lunar landscape.</p><p>  In the Irish context, are the witnesses encouraged by the fact it is perfectly clear that the geology of Ireland is totally different to that of the other relevant countries?  That may be encouraging, as there is a high volume of water, including lakes and rivers, in the area where drilling is proposed; the chances are that the Government may decide it is not worth the candle.</p></speech>

I have attended a number of meetings with her in attendance and I know that the organisation has had extensive communication with the local community in north Leitrim and beyond.  Will she describe for the committee the concerns which exist and identify if even talk about hydraulic fracturing has had an impact on house values, investment decisions etc.?  Will she describe the fears and concerns that local people have communicated to her during these meetings?  Does Dr. McLoughlin detect the potential for conflict within the community of north Leitrim because of hydraulic fracturing?  Will she describe an optimal outcome from these discussions?</p></speech>

Could any guarantees be given by any regulatory authority to in any way influence the views put to us by the delegation?  Is there any technology that could be used in future that would change the view on how gas could be extracted with no damage to the environment?  I may play the devil's advocate but the views of communities should be uppermost in any decision taken.  On the one hand the witnesses have given very definitive facts; if people had not heard of fracking until the presentation this morning, the immediate influence would be that we should not touch it.  Nevertheless, it was indicated that it is too early to decide on this because the technology is only several years old and we are unsure of the effects.  Is there a slight contradiction in the definitive facts given with regard to health issues and on the other hand the contention that it is too early to know long-term effects?</p></speech>

They have done the country a service and made my job much easier as they collated facts that I would not have been able to put together on my own.  The witnesses have answered many of the questions I had.  I suggest that people take up the invite to consider the case of Dimock, Pennsylvania, and view it with Google Earth, which I am doing now.  Some people may say water could be poisoned and the issue can be debated.  Nevertheless, it cannot be debated that I am looking at an horrific and ugly landscape, and if a similar process goes ahead in Ireland, there will be no tourism in that part of Leitrim.  It is a fact.  I would not bring my kids on holidays to look at lumps of concrete.</p> <p>I suggest that the witnesses look at that in Google Earth.  If one views it in closely, one will see there is a lot in the area but if one widens the view, it just continues on and on.  There is no debate that it is ugly and it will destroy tourism in north Leitrim.  If there is any ambition to really develop a tourism industry there, we can forget about it if we do this.  Perhaps in the future if somebody might be able to drill with one well, it would be perfect and we could consider it then.  At present, however, this is not a runner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-10a.714" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aed&iacute;n McLoughlin" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2012101000016#S00200"><p>I will first deal with Senator Mooney's question about whether I was encouraged by the Department and the EPA.  I would not say I was encouraged.  What I heard was what I expected, because we know that this is what is happening.  There is a grey area emerging where the company is talking about one kind of timeline and the officials are talking about another.  That is made even more complicated by the fact that it is over the Border as well, which is contiguous with ourselves.</p><p>  With regard to not allowing anything to go forward, I am not sure that the licences will be rendered void by this.  I can only assume that an extension will be required.  We need more attention to be paid to policy in the entire area and to look at not only the technical aspects of it but also the human aspects.</p><p>  When talking about hydraulic fracturing I specifically said that high volume hydraulic fracturing should be prohibited.  The reason is that all the evidence coming from where this is taking place shows that it is not a safe technology.  Personally, and not speaking on behalf of the campaign, I think that if there is a new technology that might examine the production of gas in a completely different way, perhaps for the good of the community and not to have it produced suddenly with huge industry and probably just going into the international store of gas rather than have it used by the people, we could be talking about a completely different scenario.  That is why high volume hydraulic fracturing should be prohibited, but not the research into what could be the future development of gas production.  There is no doubt we all need and use gas and know its benefits.</p><p>  Being optimistic, I believe that the geology is different in Ireland and, as a result, it might well be found it is not worth it.  I agree with the Senator in that regard.</p><p>  Deputy Colreavy spoke about the community.  There is an extraordinary situation in the local area wherever this fracking is proposed, that is, Clare, Leitrim and Fermanagh.  The people on the ground are really united behind a call to stop this process and many of them are talking about banning fracking.  The reason is that people are very afraid of what might happen to their land, communities and health.  To refer back to the slide on health, somebody said that if we do not know what the long-term effects are, perhaps that was a contradiction of what I said.  In fact, the short-term effects of what was in that slide are effects on people.  This is happening now.  People are going to the doctors and the hospitals with all of these illnesses.  We know the long-term effects of the chemicals but if one looks at the communities, it takes more than seven years for certain diseases to appear.  We are now beginning to see the cancers emerging and the other longer-term effects on human health.  We do not know the extent of those but we know how the beginning looks.</p><p>  Another question was about if there were guarantees that the technology was okay.  Unfortunately, at present there are more disasters than technology advances in this field.  There is a great deal going on but given the technology as it is now, the proposal that is made is unacceptable in our view.  I will ask Eddie Mitchell to add his comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-10a.715" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eddie Mitchell" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2012101000016#S00300"><p>Deputy O'Mahony spoke about future technology and asked whether we would accept this under any conditions.  We would accept an industry if we could see a life cycle analysis of the industry.  We will not see that with fracking.  I am referring to future developments.  The people in Leitrim and Fermanagh are pro-development.  This is not an anti-development or anti-Government campaign.  We are interested in farming, tourism and clean manufacturing, and we want our areas to develop in that way.  If a policy was developed for an industry, we would like to get a strategic environmental assessment, health impact assessments and debates on the policy.  We would like people to educate themselves about that and then to make decisions based on knowledge.  That is the type of scenario in which we would like to see development progress.  We do not wish to have it pushed in.</p><p>  We are very concerned about the situation in Corrib and the way the community was dealt with there.  That community does not feel it was dealt with properly and it is still in the same position as it was 12 years ago.  We are facing a much bigger project on land in north Leitrim, Cavan and Fermanagh and eventually developing across to Monaghan if we follow the shale.  In order to cater for our demand for energy we would have to exploit the shale.  If we start to depend on unconventional gas as part of our energy mix, we will exploit the shale that is there.  This will mean that over the next 30 years production will be moving across the Border counties towards Fermanagh.  Therefore, we want to ensure that anything of that nature is debated in public and that people understand.</p><p>  This will destroy agriculture in those areas.  It will also do damage to our agriculture at international level.  Given that we have a small population of 6.5 million people on the island of Ireland, we must consider whether the solutions people are looking to in countries such as Britain, Germany and America are suitable for Ireland.  I do not believe they are.  We depend on our green, clean image, so we should be very cautious.  That is the reason we have been calling for a ban and for shale gas to be prohibited in Ireland.</p></speech>

The State agencies are going about this process in a certain manner.  The Department has made its position clear.  It is relying on the EPA and the EPA has pointed out that it is not going to get involved in anything until the research is completed.  The geology in Ireland is different, and the witnesses made the point that what is happening overseas does not necessarily apply to here.</p> <p>Therefore, is it not feasible for this country to compile every available piece of information on how this process would impact on the Irish environment and for the decision to be taken then at that point?  The consultative process mentioned is built into the decision making process and is required before anything can go ahead.  Notwithstanding the position taken, which I support, what other alternative is there?  Good Energies Alliance asks that a decision be taken right now, but there seems in my view to be an absence of information specific to Irish geology.  Does the alliance share that view?  With the understanding that the process as we have seen it outlined is horrendous, would having a definitive conclusion on what would affect and impact the Irish environment not strengthen everybody's case?  In that case we would have our own conclusions, not those of America, Europe or anywhere else.  Is there merit in that?</p></speech>

Was that in reference to pollution of the water supply, to the fact much of the land will end up under concrete or to the fact that farmers, instead of going about their daily work, will have to deal with trucks going up and down their roads and doing damage to them and making it more difficult to travel on them?  Is much being said by farming organisations about this or what is their opinion?</p></speech>

Everyone in the room was stunned.  People do not know yet about hydraulic fracturing.  There is significant awareness in north Leitrim and west Fermanagh, but the national media has not created a debate yet.</p></speech>

Is there any official position?</p></speech>

I feel we are going down the same route taken before on other issues that turned out to be extraordinarily contentious and caused enormous division in the community.  This is because no public consultation is being carried on currently.  For example, when I heard the list of organisations represented on the steering group that is sitting to examine the terms of reference of the new research document, I noticed there is no community representation.  In a situation where a policy decision will mean direct action in a community area, the community should be involved at every stage.  We have reputable organisations and have experts involved in the campaign, so there is no reason the people of the area that will be affected cannot be involved.</p><p>  Also, saying there "will" be public consultation at some stage is not in the spirit of the Aarhus Convention.  I put it to the Government that it needs to take the aspect of public participation in decision-making far more seriously.</p></speech>

However, this does not seem to be expressed at national level.  The Canadian farming organisation remained silent on the issue of fracking until fracking happened in Canada.  However, the experience of the farmers there now has the organisation calling for a ban on any further fracking development in Canada.  We must decide not to make a mistake, rather than have to clean up the consequences of a mistake.</p></speech>

While I accept that all of those involved in the EPA research are qualified, surely there is need for community representation.</p></speech>

I said it is important the committee, as a joint committee of the Houses, should be informed.  All members should be informed.  This exercise has achieved that.</p></speech>

It is not enough just to have this meeting and then leave it to the agencies to decide.  We should continue to monitor the issue.</p> <p>I hope Dr. McLoughlin and her colleagues will continue to engage with the committee and hold us to our commitment to monitor the issue.</p></speech>

I thank the members and other Members in attendance who stayed until now.  This is the longest meeting we have had in a long time.  I appreciate all their efforts and how well informed they have been.  I also thank the delegates for their helpful contributions.</p><p>  As there is no other business, the meeting is now adjourned.</p></speech>
