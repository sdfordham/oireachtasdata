    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016120600002#A00500"><p>The most recent estimates available suggest that the horse and greyhound racing industries combined underpin in excess of 24,000 jobs and stimulate &euro;1.6 billion in economic output.  These industries receive financial support from the State through the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, under section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  My Department makes payments from the fund to Horse Racing Ireland and to Bord na gCon.</p> <p>  In the period 2001 to date, a total of &euro;1.03 billion has been paid from the fund to the horse and greyhound racing industries in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  The cumulative upper limit on payments from the fund, provided under the relevant regulations, has therefore been reached.</p> <p>  Exchequer funding provided from the fund is pivotal to the survival and continued development of the horse and greyhound racing industries. To give effect to the provisions of budget 2016, this cumulative upper limit must be increased by regulation.</p> <p>  The Estimates for my Department, passed by both Houses as part of budget 2017, include an allocation of &euro;80 million for the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund.  This will be distributed in accordance with section 12(6) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, with 80%, or &euro;64 million, going to Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, and 20%, or &euro;16 million, to Bord na gCon.</p> <p>  To allow my Department to provide the moneys allocated in budget 2017, it is necessary to comply with the technical requirement under section 12(13) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act to increase the cumulative limit on the amount payable from the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund by &euro;80 million to some &euro;1.118 billion.  This is achieved by way of the regulations submitted to the committee today.  The aggregate limit on the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund has been increased in this manner in 2004 and every year from 2009 to 2015, inclusive.</p> <p>  It is estimated the Irish bloodstock industry provides 14,000 jobs and contributes almost &euro;1.1 billion to the economy.  In 2015, bloodstock export sales rose to &euro;268 million in what was a remarkable year for the Irish bloodstock industry.  The industry is also estimated to account for up to 80,000 tourists to Ireland each year.  These are among the estimated 1 million plus people who attend horse races each year in this country.</p> <p>  Ireland holds a distinguished position in the thoroughbred racing world, being the biggest producer of thoroughbred foals in Europe, and is the fourth largest producer in the world.  Approximately 40% of the European Union's output of thoroughbreds and 11% of the total worldwide are produced in Ireland.</p> <p>  The Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund has been pivotal in shaping the destiny of this dynamic industry.  It has helped Ireland to become a world centre of excellence for horse racing and has allowed Horse Racing Ireland to undertake a capital investment programme that has underpinned growth in the sector.</p> <p>  The horse racing industry satisfies all the critical requirements for success in terms of employment and foreign direct investment and it is the type of export-oriented industry we need.  The industry has been a flagship for this country and has had an immeasurable influence on Ireland's international reputation in recent years.</p> <p>  Government funding of this key industry is an excellent opportunity to yield a high return for its investment.  Support for certain strategic industries is important to future economic growth and can provide widespread benefits for our society as well as for our economy.</p> <p>  The greyhound racing industry is also an important driver of employment and economic activity in both rural and urban areas.  Bord na gCon estimates that the greyhound industry employs more than 10,300 people and contributes an estimated &euro;500 million in economic output to local economies around tracks which have a wide geographic spread.  Bord na gCon reports that since 2002, in excess of 10 million people have attended greyhound racing meetings.</p> <p>  The board itself employs more than 700 people including, both full and part-time, and has an annual turnover of approximately &euro;40 million.  Funds generated from racing are reinvested in the industry through contributions to prize money and grants to various bodies involved in the greyhound racing and breeding sector, as well as promotion of greyhound welfare and the regulation of the industry.</p> <p>  The challenge for the board is to encourage the development of a commercial greyhound racing and breeding industry built on a customer focused, high quality entertainment product, which meets the highest international standards of regulation.</p> <p>  The funding being provided to the greyhound racing sector helps sustain a long-standing tradition as the industry is part of the social fabric of our country.  This funding underpins economic activity in what are in many instances less affluent regions of the country.</p> <p>  It has also contributed significantly to the improved facilities now available at greyhound tracks around Ireland.  Greyhound racing is an activity that is inextricably linked to the farming community, and while it is undoubtedly part of the fabric of rural Ireland, it also enjoys a strong urban support base.</p> <p>  The overall objective of the Government is to ensure the horse and greyhound racing industries achieve their maximum potential and in so doing contribute to the economic and social development.  Governments of all persuasions have acknowledged the importance of these industries and have supported them through legislation and policy initiatives over a long period.  Without this support, these vital industries would simply not survive.</p> <p>  The advent of new technologies and business models has challenged Government to re-evaluate the funding mechanisms for the industry. As part of its overall commitment to the industry, the Government has addressed, through legislation, the anomaly whereby remote and online betting operators were outside the tax net.  The Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 came into force on 15 April 2015.</p> <p>  The Act brings betting exchanges and Internet and mobile betting providers within the scope of the existing licensing regime, and extends the existing 1% turnover tax on land-based bookmakers&rsquo; activities to online and mobile bookmakers.  The Act also means that a 15% commission tax for betting exchanges has also been  implemented.</p><p>The Act also means that a 15% commission tax for betting exchanges has also been implemented.  These measures have had a very positive affect on revenue streams with significant increases being realised.  Betting tax has increased by &euro;20 million in 2016 when compared to this time last year.</p><p> Both Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon have operated through challenging economic conditions over the past several years and my predecessor as Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, has had the activities and operation of both bodies reviewed.</p><p> The Horse Racing Ireland Act, which gives effect to the recommendations in the Indecon report, came into force on 8 February 2016 with certain sections commenced on 9 March 2016 and further sections due to commence in January 2017.  The Act introduced a range of improvements in governance and accountability arrangements, many of which derive from recommendations made by Indecon International Economic Consultants following their review of the sector.</p><p> Indecon International Economic Consultants were also commissioned to conduct a review of certain matters relating to Bord na gCon in order to assess the suitability of the legal, governance and regulatory framework supporting the greyhound industry and to identify opportunities to maximise its commercial income.  In that regard, I will shortly bring forward the heads of a greyhound industry Bill to ensure the principles of good governance and regulation are clearly and unambiguously set down in primary legislation.  In broad terms the Bill seeks to implement the deficiencies in the existing legislation as identified in a report authored by this committee in January 2016, and in both the Indecon and Morris reports.  The Bill addresses the governance of Bord na gCon, strengthens regulatory controls in the industry, modernises sanctions and improves integrity with a view to building a reputation for exceptional regulation in the sector.  The Bill will strengthen the Irish greyhound industry, enable it to deal with the existing challenges and maximise its future potential.  I expect this committee will have a significant role to play through the pre-legislative scrutiny process and I look forward to engaging with members in that regard.</p><p> Without doubt, Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon face significant challenges as they work to grow and develop the horse and greyhound industries in an extremely competitive market segment.  I am, nonetheless, confident that these industries have tremendous growth potential with sporting, leisure, tourism and cultural appeal across a wide demographic, both national and international.  The thoroughbred horse industry is a major driver in the economy and both industries breathe life and jobs into their respective communities from the grass roots up.</p><p> I very much appreciate the contribution the members of this committee have made to the debate on the future of these critically important industries.  I believe the &euro;80 million allocation is vital to help secure rural jobs and sustain communities.  Many parts of rural Ireland face ongoing challenges in terms of declining populations, a lack of jobs, a shortage of enterprise and poor infrastructure.  The Government plays an important role in considering policy and providing an input into legislation to counter these problems and nurture all potential growth.  I am confident that it is the goal of all of us here to realise fully the contribution of these sectors to the Irish economy, to employment and to the social and cultural fabric of this country.  The degree of success of these initiatives is dependent on the hugely important contribution made by the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund.</p><p> A copy of the draft regulation has been circulated to the members of the joint committee.  Section 12(13) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 provides that a draft of these regulations be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving the draft be passed by each House before the regulations are made by the Minister.  Accordingly, I ask members for their support to ensure that Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon receive the funding provided for in budget 2017 and that the very important role of these industries, and the economic activity generated by them, are sustained into the future.  I commend the motion to the committee and I look forward to discussing any matters arising.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016120600002#B00200"><p>I welcome the broadening of the tax base to include remote and online betting.  The latter sectors had to contribute to the greyhound and horse racing industries.  Do we have any idea of how much betting remains outside the tax net?  The number of track bookmakers has dwindled greatly and they are under much financial pressure.  We have a tax regime in place that, in effect, takes a one-size-fits-all approach.  On-track bookmakers are often small independent operators who do not have a large turnover and they are being taxed at the same rate as the major multinational companies such as Ladbrokes, Boylesports and others.  We must recognise the unique nature of track bookmaking and what they bring to horse and greyhound race meetings and also the costs they incur attending race meetings.</p> <p>  Deputy Michael McGrath devised an amendment, which has been tabled to the Finance Bill in the Seanad, to address what track bookmakers consider are anomalies given that they are treated the same as major multinational betting companies.  There must be some recognition of their unique contribution to the industry and their small turnover.  People do online betting now and on-course turnover has dropped significantly.  There must be some recognition of the difficulties that track bookmakers face.  They are different to multinational companies that are dealing in millions of euro.  Broadening the tax base was definitely the way forward but there must be some recognition of the situation.  The current approach to the taxation of the industry will not work if we wish to preserve track bookmakers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016120600002#B00300"><p>I thank the Minister for his comments.  This situation goes back quite a while and our swords have crossed a number of times on the issue.  I still have serious concerns with the amount of money Horse Racing Ireland, in particular, receives from the taxpayer and how it is being used.  I understand the number of owners in the horse racing industry in Ireland has dropped by almost 50% in recent years, which has led to a concentration of ownership among the wealthy elite at the top while smaller owners are being pushed out.  I am not aware if Horse Racing Ireland has a scheme in place to support small owners and breeders to ensure they stay in the industry and can develop and prosper.</p> <p>  Irish Thoroughbred Marketing is a subsidiary of Horse Racing Ireland.  The work it does to bring in new buyers is focused on Coolmore and Goffs and, again, that is for the people at the very top end rather than those at the bottom.  Significant questions must be asked about all of that and about where the money is being spent, given the amount of public money that is used for prize money at big races.  That is unacceptable when one looks at the situation in other sectors around the country.  It is simply wrong.</p> <p>  The board of Horse Racing Ireland appeared before the committee and most members would agree that they were very scant in terms of answering hard questions.  They did not answer many of the questions.  Further questions have been put to the board since then and information has been sought but it has not been forthcoming to an acceptable degree.  There are still many questions to be answered.  The CEO of Horse Racing Ireland was to come before the committee to answer questions but there has not been any sign of him.  I am seriously concerned about his role in getting himself reappointed to that position.  At this point, given the amount of money we are talking about, those questions simply must be answered before we can proceed.</p> <p>  Are the boards of all State bodies, be it Bord na gCon or Horse Racing Ireland, subject to the Protected Disclosures Act?  If they feel things are happening with how business is conducted, can they forward the information to you, Chairman, or to someone else to ensure matters are corrected?  There are still many issues, in particular relating to the horse racing industry - people also have questions about how Bord na gCon is run - that must be addressed.  I do not think they have been dealt with appropriately.  We have a long way to go before we are in a position to sanction the expenditure of &euro;80 million on such organisations.  It is a lot of money.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1268" speakername="Pat Deering" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016120600002#B00400"><p>Before I move on to Deputy Pringle I wish to clarify that we invited the chief executive of HRI to come before the committee in the new year and I expect that will happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016120600002#B00500"><p>I have two questions for the Minister.  We are talking about the allocation of &euro;80 million to Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon.  In his opening statement the Minister said HRI contributes &euro;1.6 billion to the economy and that Bord na gCon is responsible for an economic output of &euro;500 million.</p><p>He went on to say that "these vital industries would simply not survive" without Government support.  I remind the committee that the &euro;80 million being provided represents just 5% of these industries' total contribution to the economy.  At what point will these industries become self-sustaining?  When will they be able to continue to operate without this annual funding of &euro;80 million?  Is that an aim of the Government?  What is its aim in allocating these moneys each year?  Perhaps the Minister will square the difference between what he said about the contribution of these industries to the economy and his statement that they need this money to survive.  Will he explain that further?</p><p> Horse Racing Ireland, which will get &euro;64 million under this proposal, seems to be opposed to the development of harness racing.  Surely we should tap into the potential of this form of racing as a means of developing the industry as a whole.  How can the opposition to harness racing be squared with the development of horse racing?  What is the Department's view on this aspect of the matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1268" speakername="Pat Deering" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016120600002#C00200"><p>I invite the Minister to respond to Deputies Cahill, Kenny and Pringle.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016120600002#C00300"><p>I thank the three Deputies for their questions.  Deputy Cahill asked about the broadening of the tax base in the context of developments in online betting.  By the end of this month, we will have witnessed the impact of the first full calendar year of the new system which was introduced in mid-2015.  If I am not mistaken, the Department of Finance has indicated that it intends to observe the performance of the sector under the new regime when it has an opportune window to do so.  It is open to considering the appropriate next steps in that context.  I appreciate that there are many views on the matter.  I share Deputy Cahill's view that on-course bookmakers are part of our horse and greyhound racing traditions.  The demise of the on-course bookmaker would remove much of the colour, entertainment and value from the experience of attending horse and greyhound racing fixtures.  I suggest that the boards of Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon should reflect on how they might incentivise the continued participation of bookmakers in on-course activity.</p> <p>  I should mention that on-course bookmakers are also of value from the perspective of providing competitive leverage to punters who might be interested in other forms of betting.  I suppose the march of technology is inexorable.  There is ample documentary evidence of the rampant growth of online betting as the choice of many punters.  I share Deputy Cahill's view that on-track bookmakers bring something unique to the table.  I would like to see how Bord na gCon and Horse Racing Ireland might be able to use their respective roles to facilitate such activity.  The Department of Finance could also look at this area in the context of tax legislation.</p> <p>  I will try to deal in no particular order with the many issues raised by Deputy Martin Kenny.  Bord na gCon and Horse Racing Ireland both have provisions in place under the protected disclosures arrangements.  Anybody who feels he or she has something to disclose can do so within that protected legal framework.  That is as it should be.  We all share the objective of having an industry that works well and is properly regulated, and in which people feel they can speak freely.  That is important.</p> <p>  The inference from Deputy Kenny's comments about the ownership of horses is that it is becoming the pursuit of the elite.  It is inevitable as we emerge from a difficult economic period that a number of owners will have fallen out of the system.  I am aware that Horse Racing Ireland and the industry generally are anxious to address this matter.  Not long after I was appointed Minister, I met a group of people who are involved in the running of point-to-point races, including community organisers, handlers, owners and trainers.  We all discussed this issue in the same room.  Many sole owners and syndicates opted out of horse ownership when people's discretionary expenditure fell by the wayside during the economic downturn.  I am pleased to report that the most recent trends for 2016 indicate that things are picking up.  I do not want to over-egg the figures in these early days.  The number of horses in training has increased by 4.5%, the number of active owners has increased by 1%, the number of new owners has increased by 11% and attendances at race meetings have increased by 1%.  A number of other indicators are moving in the right direction.</p> <p>  It is important to acknowledge this because the more broadly based the industry is, the better.  There are farmers in every county who are involved in breeding horses.  It is a broadly based rural enterprise.  We read and hear a great deal about the cream of the crop who give us our international reputation as a country that does this business exceptionally well.  Their success is based on the industry as a whole having the very solid foundation that is put in place by point-to-point owners, trainers and organisers.  The work done by such people feeds into the success of people like Aidan O'Brien and Willie Mullins, who represent us with distinction on international stages.  The challenge is to make sure we keep the foundations of the industry in solid health.  I know from my engagement with people in the industry that they are extremely concerned about this.</p> <p>  Deputy Kenny suggested that certain issues in Bord na gCon need to be, as he put it, "dealt with".  The Department has acknowledged the report previously published by this committee, the Morris report and the Indecon report I mentioned in my opening remarks.  As a consequence of all these reports, I am committed to introducing legislation in this area at the earliest possible date.  I imagine that the heads of the Bill will not now be published before the end of this year.  I expect that very early in the new year, we will publish legislation dealing with a range of the issues in the industry that have given rise to concern and comment in the public domain.  We will ensure the legislative framework for the industry is fit for purpose for the years ahead.  We will address the issues raised in this committee's report, the Indecon report and the Morris report.  It is important for members of this committee to have an opportunity to make an input into the collective process of ensuring the best possible legal framework is put in place for the industry.  Participation in this industry by owners and trainers brings colour to life in rural Ireland.  There are greyhound tracks dotted all over the country, from Mullingar to Youghal and many points in between.  It has a certain appeal and it makes a significant financial input.  That is why we need to put it on a solid footing, legislatively and otherwise, for the future.</p> <p>  Deputy Pringle asked whether these industries should be self-financing.  He questioned the need to provide State funding of &euro;80 million to support horse and dog racing.  I remind him that the ambition of the industry is to grow.  I read in a document that the horse racing side of this industry is worth more than &euro;1 billion.  State assistance will be required if the ambition of doubling that figure over the coming years is to be achieved.  The State is putting funding into the programme of capital investment in racecourses, for example.  I was fortunate enough to be in Listowel, which is in Deputy Ferris's constituency, earlier this year to celebrate an investment that is being made through Horse Racing Ireland to redevelop the facilities and thereby enhance the experience of punters when they go to Listowel Races.  On the other side of that capital development, a flagship project at the Curragh has secured planning and is going through capital evaluation now.  If I recall correctly, this &euro;60 million project is funded by the State, Horse Racing Ireland, the Turf Club and outside funding.</p><p>It is important, in an industry in which we are a global leader, to have facilities that can showcase the industry in its best light.  Therefore, the Curragh is important.  So too are Listowel, Ballinrobe, Thurles and Tramore.  It is important the facilities are up to scratch and that there is a significant capital investment programme that the State is involved in providing funding for.  That is why I think the industry will do a lot in terms of foreign earnings and job creation opportunities.  The State can help.  The State does not turn its back on any other sector that has growth potential.  It does not say that because a sector has an ambition to grow it should do it all itself.  If we can assist and accelerate growth that brings a dividend to all of us in terms of tax revenues and employment creation, we will.  That is why it is appropriate for the State to invest.  It is an industry that is very broadly spread.  It is by and large a rurally based industry.</p><p> The Deputy also mentioned the issue of harness racing.  It was an issue Deputy Ferris raised 12 months ago in the context of the industry.  It is not particularly germane to HRI.  The Irish Harness Racing Association, as I understand it, is affiliated to Horse Sport Ireland.  We have engaged with it in recent times.  We provided &euro;24,000 for a stud book related project.  We assisted with &euro;22,000 for an animal welfare project.  There is also some funding received under the Leader programme for assistance with the racetrack in Portmarnock.  More recently, my Department has engaged Indecon consultants to look at the financial potential of that sector as a bedrock on which to establish whatever funding requirements we might provide to that sector in the future.  It is not that we have turned our back on any particular sector, and certainly a lot has happened since we engaged here last year.  It is hoped the consultants who are now engaged will provide us with the rationale to exploit the potential of the sector further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016120600002#D00200"><p>Surely the aim of the horse and greyhound industries is to reach a position where they are self-financing.  Many of the stakeholders and sectoral players will indicate that as their objective.  The State supported them through very difficult times when it had very little money to allocate to other very worthy projects and ventures in other areas.</p> <p>  If one speaks to somebody dealing with the bookmaking industry, they see lots of potential for that to be achieved.  Deputy Cahill is right, it is not only the on-course bookmakers who have an essential role to play.  They still take &euro;3 or &euro;5 bets whereas all those online boys want bigger bets.  We have to protect the ordinary people who might just make the odd bet.  The bookmakers in the streets and villages of this country are being wiped out.  There are no bookmakers now in rural Ireland.  They are being wiped out.  They are very concerned that there should be a cut-off turnover point of about &euro;2 million.  How could one classify a little bookmaker in my village, which has a population of about 350 or 400 people, who disappeared as a result of economic circumstances, the same way as a high street bookmaker with a very high profile that is part of a chain of 60 or 70 bookmakers?  It is important to differentiate those.  Funnily enough, there are a few local jobs available in some of those small bookmakers.  What happens is, as with everything in this country, we do not regulate for years and then when we do, it is overly prescriptive.  We wipe everyone out with the big brush that rolls in front of us.  That is important.  There has to be a differentiation between the type of bookmaker involved.  That has been made abundantly clear.</p> <p>  The Morris report is available and has raised some serious issues.  We cannot put it under the carpet.  If one speaks to people in the greyhound industry, they will say that in another couple of years, there will be no greyhound industry.  That is what they will say.  The owners are disappearing and there are huge questions about the integrity of the industry.  It is a major issue.  We can beat around the bush all we likes and dive for cover, but that is the big issue.  That is glaring in the report and it has to be tackled.</p> <p>  We will be watching carefully the heads of the greyhound Bill that will be coming forward.  It should tackle this once and for all.  There has to be zero tolerance.  There cannot be any nonsense of accepting little bits.  There has to be zero tolerance in terms of integrity in order that every race is run true to form with no external influences on the performance of horses, dogs or anything else in the industry.  That goes right through to the breeding.  It has to be protected in an overarching way.  That will give great confidence right across the board.  The governance area also has to be tightened up.</p> <p>  Governance is important because we are giving huge sums of extremely scarce State money.  We still cannot get a lot of resources that are required in other areas which have huge human costs and impact.  Some people tell me that the estimate that 10,000 people are employed in the industry is such a gross over-estimation, it is almost laughable.  I do not know.  I know plenty about the point-to-point scene but I do not know about dogs, except that people are foolish enough to bet a few bob and in less than 30 seconds they lose all their money.  That is all I know, but, stupidly, I have probably done it.  That happens.</p></speech>

In any event, we have to know how many if we are giving money to the industry.  I am not averse to helping out industries, because I know how important they are in rural areas.  They are a recreational outlet and have an income generation capacity for those people, but we have to know how many people are actually in the industry.  We cannot just say what we think it employs.  That will not get us anywhere because value for money is important.</p> <p>  That turns me back to the Indecon report on the horse racing industry and HRI.  I am looking forward to it preparing its value for money audit which it promised us.  That should be top of its agenda and board meetings.  I anticipate that it is.  If it is not, the organisation should question that because it has been demanded by the Minister through his officials and through us in a very concerted and unanimous way, so it should be forthcoming.  I hope that lessons have been learned in terms of governance.  One would only have to be a first year law student, not somebody with almost three decades at the law, to realise why the appointment of the chief executive went the way it did.  I understood that very well.  One could not recoil from that, unless one wanted a big legal action.  I understand it.  The real issue is that one cannot unscramble the egg and go back and cry over the spilled milk.  What we have to do now is make sure that lessons have been learned with regard to all of those semi-State and State organisations.  That is the issue I want to see addressed.  I will not re-run that horse because it is long gone past the post.  As Deputy Kenny, I spent hours on the new Act.</p> <p>  I am not convinced that people like the stable hands are getting a fair cut.  It is clear when one sees what happened at a recent meeting.  I argue they should have been included on sub-boards.  They are the people we see leading around horses.  They could leave a place at 6 o'clock in the morning to get to somewhere else and they are there all day.  They are great workers and a great face for the industry.  I salute them.  It is important we ensure they get properly remunerated.</p><p>If it is felt they are not getting a fair cut, I will not be averse to tabling amendments, seeking the support of my colleagues to ensure that everything works out in that regard.</p><p> Value for money will be important.  I do not think anything will pass on a nod.  I understand that we are allocating &euro;80 million, which is a great deal of money and people will want to see benefits from it.  I do not want HRI to set off on a run.  HRI always picks the easy targets when it is looking for money.  How could one justify targeting the owners who had paid for their colours, seeking to charge them on 1 January of the following year to renew the colours?  If an owner had a trainer acting as an agent in the first year, in the following year, year two, the owner had to pay more money so that the agent would continue acting for him or her.  Once HRI got one cut of money from the owners, it should move on and leave those who paid alone.  HRI always targeted the easy pickings rather than going to big wheels.  Unfortunately, the increases in the cost of training and everything else cumulatively led to people leaving the syndicates.  I was one of them myself.  One had to clear out because one formed the impression that one was at the end of the food chain and did not matter.  That is why I used to kick up a bit of a row because I was representing a great many people like myself who were foolish enough to get involved in syndicates, but without the like of us, the syndicate does not have the members.  The syndicates only have the big knives who arrive in and swallow it up.</p><p> I am delighted with the developments in the Curragh, but one needs developments in Kilbeggan, Roscommon, Ballinrobe, Thurles and Clonmel.  I go down to Clonmel.  The money has to be spent in the real places.  It is great to have flagship projects and to bring in all the boys and the great people - the multimillionaires and perhaps billionaires.  I want to ensure that a few bob goes to the fellow with a family who is surviving on &euro;300 to &euro;400 a week, who is trying to breed the odd horse and get a winner out of it.  If I think the money is going to that segment of the industry, I have no problem supporting any of the Estimate in that regard.</p></speech>

I am quite conscious of the value that small breeders bring to rural communities and what the greyhound industry means to rural Ireland.  I live in an area where every second person I know in the agriculture and farming sector in parts of North Kerry would also be breeding greyhounds, most of them do it at a loss.  They do it because it is a way of life and is part of their tradition and culture.  I would argue that they have maintained that industry for the common good.  Obviously there is always the expectation that one will breed a derby winner or something like that with everything going right.</p> <p>  I agree entirely with Deputy Penrose when he spoke about integrity.  I am not satisfied with the integrity of some of the carry on in the industry.  I look forward to debating the proposed legislation on it.  What sticks in my craw is that &euro;80 million, of which &euro;64 million goes to Horse Racing Ireland and &euro;16 million goes to the more depressed side, the greyhound sector.  </p> <p>  There are many people in the community listening to the contributions of members who take a very poor view of sections within the horse-racing sector.  Some major trainers and horse owners pay no tax in the country.  Coolmore Stud was exempt from stallion fees tax, but earning millions from stud fees.  This concession was given to them by Charlie Haughey.</p></speech>

He referred to the lack of response to the questions that were put to Horse Racing Ireland when its representatives appeared before the committee in the recent past.  Some of the questions remain still to be answered.</p> <p>  I have raised the issue of harness racing and how the association were prevented from having competitions for want of a better word.  Evidence was produced before the committee in regard to access to a track in Dundalk.  Through the intervention of the Minister, that issue was addressed and the meetings came about.  I welcome the fact that funding is being made available at last to advance this sector</p> <p>  I would have reservation and I had serious reservations in the past when I was on the committee in the past, but I have always voted for it.  I voted for it in  the interests of the common good, in order to protect the person who is involved in a small way and is trying to keep a little industry going in rural Ireland.  My advice to the committee is to do that, but there is a great deal of cleaning-up to be done and the integrity of the sector has to be restored.  This cannot go on forever.</p></speech>

I have a number of points.</p> <p>  First, the allocation of &euro;80 million on an annual basis to the horse and greyhound sector is significant.  I acknowledge the role that horse racing and the greyhound industries play in rural Ireland and the way the sector has been built up.  State funding and support from the State has played an important role and it is important that we work to protect and enhance the development of both sectors.</p> <p>  It was particularly disappointing to see the committee had to involve itself in the operations of the reappointment of the chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland.  I think it is important that lessons are learned.  In respect of the annual allocating of funding, there is obviously an obligation to come before the committee and to seek the approval of the Oireachtas for the allocation of funds every year, but as part of that do the board of Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon present a plan in their report to the Minister at the outset of the year?  I know there is a strategic plan but considering the Oireachtas is asked to support the allocation of funding on an annual basis, I think it would be appropriate that they present their projections for the year ahead, an update from both boards in respect of how the funding will be used and how it is helping them meet their objectives and the development of both the horse racing and the greyhound industries.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016120600002#E01200"><p>I thank Deputies Penrose, Ferris and McConalogue for their questions.  I will deal with whether the industry should be self-financing.  I acknowledge that &euro;80 million is a great deal of money.  I think we forget the circular economy.  The income from the 1% betting levy to October 2016, a period of ten months, is &euro;50 million.</p><p>This is a lot of money to be handing over.  With regard to the ambition of the industry to grow, the ongoing capital investment funded by HRI and how the business is integrated in the rural economy, the State probably gets a fair return from the investment it makes and it enables the industry to accelerate the investment and development identified for the horse racing and greyhound industries.</p><p> We have had ample reports, including from the committee and the Morris and Indecon reports, to inform us on how best to proceed with the greyhound industry and to ensure integrity is put up in lights.  This is an objective of the Department, and anybody with whom I have spoken in the industry and committee members all share this objective.  There is an outline in particular in the Morris report of the issues that need to be addressed with regard to governance, integrity, anti-doping and control committees having adequate powers with regard to the sanctions that would apply to anybody found to be offside.  My view is this is an industry of significant economic activity and anybody who puts its future in jeopardy should be dealt with in a very firm way.  We will bring forward heads of a Bill to the committee early in the new year, and I hope we have ample input from all quarters to ensure we equip the industry with the best possible legislative framework to deal with governance, integrity, medical control issues and anti-doping.  Deputy Ferris referred to his neighbours in north Kerry who stick with the industry notwithstanding all of the allegations.  They should be able to live the dream safe in the knowledge that at least it is a level playing pitch or level track.  This is what all of us want.  I am sure the legislation will address all of these issues.</p><p> The Morris report is spoken about so often one would think it has been around for a long time but it is not.  It was presented to Bord na gCon in July.  I do not have the date of publication.  We are not hanging around.  It contains issues which need to be addressed.  There will be no brief for anybody who resists placing integrity at the heart of the industry and ensuring anybody who is a shareholder or stakeholder in the industry can invest in it safe in the knowledge it is fair, above board and transparent.  This is what all of us aspire to.</p><p> To respond to the point raised by Deputy Penrose regarding on employees in the industry, such as stable hands and jockeys having a say, under the legislation introduced in 2015 and finished in January 2016, there is provision for the board to have the voice of all of the people to be represented.  Their unions also have potential for representation.  The Horse Racing Ireland Act 2016 provides for the establishment of a new industry services committee comprising a chairman and four members, including representatives of jockeys, qualified riders, employees of the industry other than jockeys and stable staff.  Its chairman will be selected by the members of the committee.  I understand HRI is in the process of establishing the committee and is in consultation with Mandate and SIPTU among others.  This is an important development.  We must also acknowledge recent initiatives by HRI in putting in place a proper career structure and educational opportunities for people who go into the industry.  Many people go into the industry without having many educational qualifications under their belt.  Some leave school early.  It is important they are given an opportunity for continuous education and professional development in the industry.  HRI has recently made initiatives in this area.</p><p> I am aware that ownership is an issue.  The statistics are beginning to turn with regard to increased participation of syndicates.  Part of the reason for this is to do with the fact the costs to HRI are reducing.  It is still an expensive sport, which is why syndicates are an attractive way of getting into it without anybody having to bear an excessive level of the costs.  I understand HRI's own costs to owners have dropped by 30% in recent times.  We have come through a very difficult time and the industry and governance bodies probably made decisions based on short-term financial needs rather than strategically being able to look at the long term.  We are now in a situation where we have a little more light within which to operate.  Strategically informed decisions are being made and this is reflected in the increased level of ownership.</p><p> With regard to harness racing, a point was made about the track in Dundalk.  There is now an agreement between the Irish Harness Racing Association and HRI for access to the track on five occasions.  This is progress.  We await the outcome of the Indecon report, which will give us, I hope, a rationale or strategic basis on which to adjudicate whether it is a sector that merits further investment and has further potential.  It has an international dimension.  I recall at a child sulky races at Ballingeary show, which is a different version.  In west Cork there are road races.  There is potential to explore and see what rationale there might be for further investments.  This is something to which we are open to, although it is not a HRI affiliate.  It is affiliated to Horse Sport Ireland, which is a separate agency.</p></speech>

There is a five-year strategic plan for HRI and we receive its annual report.  I do not see anything wrong with the suggestion that there should be engagement with the board on a structured basis.

People can use their credit cards to bet online.  In effect, this means they are borrowing to bet, including those with an addiction.  We should look at this and stop it.  People do not walk into betting shops and use their credit cards but they can do it online. It is a step in the wrong direction.  While I know it is not the Minister's direct responsibility, it is something that needs to be looked at.</p> <p>  With regard to the issue raised about Bord na gCon and the integrity of the greyhound industry, this is an issue that needs to be examined.  Everywhere I go when I speak to people they throw their eyes up to heaven.  We had the recent case of the abducted dog.  This all leads to the notion that shenanigans are going on.  What are the Minister's comments on this?  Can he give us any concrete assurance this will be tackled?  I know people engaged in the industry who look after the dog tracks.  They tell me many of the dog tracks are falling into disrepair bit by bit because fewer and fewer people go.  The main reason for this is the impression that is created and which is not without foundation.</p></speech>

It is a societal issue which needs to be reflected on at Government level.  It does not fall specifically within the remit of my Department but is something we all wish to tackle.  The online industry has a role to play, including by finding ways to identify where individuals are gambling excessively.  There are best practices that can be applied in this regard and the industry must take the lead in the matter.  The reality, however, is that we cannot halt the advance of technologies.  Online media are now the platform of preference for most people when it comes to betting, as reflected in the yield from the levy.  There are arguments for increasing the levy from 1% to 2% or higher.  On the other hand, there is the argument that the dividend from online gambling should be made more widely available to other beneficiaries.  That is a debate for another occasion.  A revenue stream from the online platform is now in place and I have no doubt it will continue to grow.  In terms of the taxation changes that might be envisaged, that is an issue for the Minister for Finance in the first instance.</p> <p>  Reference was made to integrity, which is an objective we all share.  We now have sufficient reports from consultants and so on, together with the wisdom of this committee, numerous public commentators and people who have spoken to the committee and to me.  It is time now to seek to address these issues.  Legislation can only go so far but it is necessary, nevertheless, to ensure Bord na gCon is equipped with all the necessary legislative tools.  That is the aim of the Bill we intend to bring forward.</p></speech>

As in previous years, a rigorous assessment has been undertaken to examine the implications for Ireland of the Commission's proposals for the fixing of total allowable catches, TACs, for the coming year.  The EU Commission proposal was issued on 27 October and a number of so-called non-papers updating the proposal have issued throughout November.  As the committee will be aware, the final arrangements for 2017 are due to be negotiated at the Council scheduled for 12 and 13 December.  The levels of TAC and the quotas for Ireland will be determined at that meeting following intensive negotiations with member states and the Commission.</p> <p>  The waters surrounding Ireland are a precious natural resource containing some of the most productive fishing grounds in the EU.  We have a duty of care to protect their biological richness and, as such, they must be managed responsibly and sustainably.  Ireland's total allocation of quotas in 2016 amounted to 216,261 tonnes with a total value of &euro;201 million.  There are also very valuable inshore species which are not subjected to EU TACs, such as crab, whelk, scallop and lobster, and which are fished by the Irish fleet inside our 6-mile coastal zone.  The process of preparing for the Council is well under way.  The proposal covers stocks which are not subject to third-party international agreements and are, in the main, whitefish and prawn stocks.  Stocks which are subject to ongoing international negotiations such as blue whiting and whiting in the Celtic Sea are not included in the proposal as yet.</p> <p>  On 19 October, I was pleased to announce that an international coastal states agreement for mackerel was finalised in Clonakilty which, economically, is Ireland's single most important stock.  The negotiations resulted in a quota for Irish fishermen for 2017 of 86,429 tonnes, an increase of more than 10,500 tonnes from 2016.  The agreement provides a high quota, stability and a framework to ensure the long-term sustainability of the stock.  This quota is not included in the sustainability impact assessment as we must wait for the conclusion of all of the international negotiations.  Negotiations have just been completed, on Friday last, between the EU and Norway.  The EU TAC for blue whiting has not yet been finalised as there are further negotiations between the EU and the Faroe Islands to be concluded this week.  However, it is expected there will be a substantial increase of more than 80% in Ireland's quota for 2017.</p> <p>  The year 2017 will see the continued phasing in of the landing obligation or discards ban.  This was a central element of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, and was agreed by all member states as well as the European Parliament.  It will, in effect, phase out the dumping of perfectly good fish at sea and end the catching and discarding of juvenile fish.  This is a common sense goal but the obligation comes with significant challenges.  We must be determined to face these challenges head on if we are to ensure the sustainability of our vibrant coastal communities, which depend on healthy fish stocks.</p> <p>  One measure to lessen the immediate impact of the discards ban which was included in the CFP is that the Commission will be obliged to take account of previously discarded fish when considering its TAC proposals.</p><p>So-called quota uplift, or top-ups, was applied to affected stocks for the first time last year and will be applied again this year.  I am closely examining the methodology used by the Commission to ensure that Irish fishermen get the maximum uplift compatible with stock sustainability.<br/><br/>Throughout this process, I have listened to a range of views on the Commission's proposals.  It has become clear to me, however, that there is a common desire among all stakeholders to ensure the sustainability of our fish stocks is guaranteed for future generations.  In order to achieve this, we need to engender a shared sense of responsibility and foster a willingness to approach the challenges that face us in a creative and open-minded way.  We need to strive to make our fleets more efficient in what they do so as to maximise the economic return, protect the sustainability of our stocks and safeguard the future of our coastal communities.<br/><br/>In my view, knowledge-sharing is a key aspect in accomplishing these goals.  The fishermen I have met have generations of experience and, more than most, fully understand the importance of protecting our natural resources.  I hope to see continued engagement between our industry, NGOs, the Marine Institute and BIM to ensure that the knowledge is fully shared.<br/><br/>I would like to refer to one of the key objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, namely, maximum sustainable yield, more commonly known as FMSY.  This is the largest average catch or yield that can continuously be taken from a stock under existing environmental conditions.  Our shared ultimate objective is to bring and maintain our fish stocks to levels that can deliver FMSY by 2020 at the latest.  In line with the CFP, however, it must be implemented in a progressive manner if, and only if, its immediate application seriously jeopardises the social and economic sustainability of the fishing fleet.<br/><br/>The proposals are based on formal advice received from ICES, the independent international body with responsibility for advising on the state of fish stocks.  It also takes account of the views of the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, which gives the Commission its views on the economic, technical and social impacts of the scientific advice. <br/><br/>In order to inform my negotiations at the December Fisheries Council, I have had an assessment of the impacts of the Commission proposal undertaken.  To facilitate the assessment, an open consultation process was initiated whereby stakeholders were asked to submit their comments and observations on the Commission proposal for fishing opportunities for 2017.<br/><br/>From 1 November, an online web portal on <i>www.fishingnet.ie</i>was activated to enable the transmission of electronic submissions for consideration.  These portals remained open until 25 November and in all four submissions were received by the closing date.  The full content of all the submissions received by the deadline will be published on <i>www.fishingnet.ie</i>.  In addition to seeking written submissions, I convened a meeting of stakeholders on 2 December to give a further opportunity to interested parties to outline their positions directly to me on the many aspects of these proposals.  As I have mentioned, there was a range of views among stakeholders.  However, there were also commonalities and I agree with many of the sentiments expressed throughout the consultation process.  These include a call for adherence to the available scientific advice to enable responsible and appropriate management decisions to be taken.  This, however, must be balanced with the concern that major cuts to TACs could have severe socio-economic impacts.  It is in that context, that I have given a clear message to the Commission that I will not support cuts unless I am satisfied that they are absolutely necessary and fully supported by rigorously assessed, clear scientific evidence.<br/><br/>I will go into more detail in this regard but I shall first illustrate what we are facing next week.  These are some of the cuts affecting some of our important stocks: nephrops or prawns &ndash; minus 9%, which is inclusive of the Commission proposal for quota uplift; cod in the Celtic Sea &ndash; minus 68%; megrim in the Celtic Sea &ndash; minus 28%; and monkfish in the Celtic Sea &ndash; minus 12%.  Following the consultation process and the expert advice of the Marine Institute, I do not believe that all of these reductions in quota are either justified or necessary.  There are stocks in respect of which I can accept the cuts proposed &ndash; for example, those affecting Celtic Sea herring and horse mackerel, among others.<br/><br/>The Marine Institute and BIM have again this year made an invaluable contribution to the assessment of the Commission's proposal, which is contained in the sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment that is before members today.  I would like to briefly set out the findings contained in that assessment.From a purely biological perspective, the Marine Institute's view, which coincides with the ICES view, is that there has been an improvement in the status of some fish stocks.  However, others remain a concern, namely in the areas west of Scotland and in the Irish Sea.<br/><br/>The impact assessment summarises the pressure on the 74 stocks dealt with in the 2016 stock book.  If anyone wants a copy for light reading, I can arrange it. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.52" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016120600002#H00300"><p>I am glad to report that there is again this year a higher number of sustainably fished stocks &ndash; 28 compared with 26 last year &ndash; and a higher percentage &ndash; 38% in 2016 compared with 36% in 2015.  I should note, however, that while the percentage and number of stocks overfished has declined in 2016, the number and percentage of stocks with unknown status are similar to last year.  The specific details for all stocks are available in the document which has been laid before the D&aacute;il and in the stock book, which was prepared by the Marine Institute.</p> <p>  The socio-economic impact assessment of the Commission's proposals does not fully account for Ireland's share of fishing opportunities.  The stocks not covered include blue whiting, horse mackerel, mackerel, north-west haddock, ling and Celtic Sea whiting because the Commission has not to date included proposals for these stocks, most of which are the subject of ongoing international negotiations with third countries.</p> <p>  If agreed as they currently stand, the Commission's proposals would see a net reduction in fishing opportunity of 19% by volume in tonnes.  In financial terms, this amounts to a direct income reduction of &euro;14.752 million.  These figures can be further explained, as follows.  Our valuable prawn fleet could see a critical reduction of 9% by volume, with a direct income reduction of &euro;5.849 million.  The proposed reduction to Celtic Sea cod would see a reduction of 76% in volume, equivalent to a reduction of &euro;1.89 million.</p> <p>  Let us consider the regional analysis of the impact.  For the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and west coast - area VII - there will be an 18% reduction in fishing opportunity.  This will cause a &euro;14 million income reduction for the demersal fleet.  This would have a severe negative impact on the ports of Clogherhead, Howth, Dunmore East, Kilmore Quay, Dingle, Castletownbere and Ros an Mh&iacute;l, in addition to other smaller ports.</p> <p>  For north-west - area VI - stocks, the impact assessment does not take account of some important stocks, which are not included as they are impacted by the EU-Norway bilateral negotiations.  In particular, haddock and saithe are not included in BIM's assessment.  BIM's assessment, excluding these two stocks, paints a slightly better picture, with a proposed 8% increase in fishing opportunity, resulting in a &euro;0.75 million increase for the demersal fleets in the north west.  This will directly affect the ports of Greencastle and Killybegs.  However, the impact assessment does not include large expected cuts to Ireland's horse mackerel and boarfish stocks.  The EU-Norway negotiations were concluded on Friday and the TAC set for haddock in area VIa involves a 42% cut and saithe in area VI involves a 61% increase.</p> <p>  Let me refer to the processing and ancillary sectors.  In addition to the direct losses to the fleet, income will also be lost from the processing sector as a direct result of reduced catches and in a number of ancillary industries, including net making, chandlery, engineering, refrigeration etc.  Based on turnover multipliers from fish landed in distinct Irish ports, BIM estimates that the full cost, including direct, indirect and induced, of the proposed quota reductions are in the order of &euro;30 million.</p> <p>  This will obviously have a knock-on effect on employment.  It is estimated that on the basis of the most recent employment surveys of the catching sector, these reductions could affect between 350 and 400 full- and part-time jobs, either through reduced incomes, partial lay-offs or redundancies.</p> <p>  The proposals do not include the Hague preferences, which are a safety net for the Irish fleet on specific stocks where TACs are in decline.  Essentially, these are additional amounts of quota that Ireland and the United Kingdom claim for important whitefish stocks.  Many member states object strenuously to their application as the additional quota comes off their allocations. </p> <p>  Ensuring that the preferences are applied will be a key political objective for me in the negotiations.  The loss of these allocations in 2017 would amount to 1,535 tonnes of fish with a direct value of &euro;3 million, according to BIM.  This will have an associated impact on between 60 and 70 full- and part-time jobs, either through reduced incomes, partial lay-offs or redundancies.</p><p> I fully concur with the findings of the sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment.  It highlights the significant impact the current proposals could have on the Irish fishing industry.  This will be my first December Council.  I have found that the process has given me an invaluable opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of our fishing industry and all those who care about it.  Significant challenges lie ahead next week but I will do my utmost to agree a fair and balanced package for Ireland to ensure the continued vibrancy of our industry and the long-term sustainability of our stocks.  I wish to publically thank and acknowledge all those who contributed to the production of the impact assessment and I look forward to the contributions of the committee.</p></speech>

They will be up for debate at the Council of Ministers next week.</p> <p>  Near the end of his presentation the Minister outlined that the potential overall employment impact from what is on the table could be between 350 and 400 part-time and full-time jobs.  That shows the significance and it sets out in real terms the potential impact of the fish quotas due for reduction next year.</p> <p>  To what extent does the Minister believe he will be able to mitigate what is being proposed at European level in terms of using domestic evidence and the Marine Institute?  How much will the Minister be able to hold on to?</p> <p>  In the north-west area 6A there is a potential cut of 42% in haddock and 61% in saithe.  What will the impact of this be financially and in terms of tonnage?  Can the Minister explain the rationale behind that aspect of it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.56" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016120600002#J00400"><p>I thank the Minister for his opening statement.  This is an annual process.  We discuss the savage cuts proposed at Council.  Then the Minister goes to negotiate and comes back having rescued the situation.  That is the story presented in the media each year.  The figures keep declining each year regardless.</p> <p>  We have a detailed proposal but some aspects of it have confused me.  The Commission sustainability impact conclusions state that there are no indications of progress towards achieving the maximum sustainable yield by 2020.  The target has been jeopardised yet the Commission is still proposing a 20% cut in effort for the Irish fishing fleet for 2017.  How does that square up against the proposal from the Commission?  The Commission has said there are no indications that we are not on track to achieve maximum sustainable yield by 2020, yet it has proposed a 20% cut across the Irish fishing effort.</p> <p>  Last year was the first year the so-called quota uplift was supposed to be in place.  It was not clear last year how much of the quota was comprised of the uplift and how much was comprised of the cut.  The impact assessment states that Ireland has required that the Commission provide the methodology used to calculate the quota top-ups in a visible and transparent manner.  That implies the process has not been visible or transparent up to now.  Has the Minister made any progress with the Commission in this regard?  To what extent do the proposals for 2017 include top-ups or are made up of top-ups at the moment?  It would be interesting and important to hear that.</p> <p>  We know there is a question over where the status of stocks is unknown.  How much survey activity has taken place?  How much effort has been put in to finding out the condition of the stocks?  We have two survey vessels.  I understand they spend approximately two months of the year in Canada surveying stocks there.  I am unaware of others.  For example, cod surveys have not been done in the Celtic Sea in recent years.  What effort has been put in to assessing stocks in the Celtic Sea and in our waters that would add to the situation in terms of negotiation this year?</p> <p>  If we negotiate the Hague preferences successfully it will mitigate some of the reduction.  The economic impact of the proposals ranges from &euro;14 million to &euro;11 million.  Do the Hague preferences cover prawns?  What impact will these have on the prawn fishery if we are successful in getting the full Hague preferences implemented?</p> <p>  For the past six months everyone has been discussing Brexit.  My question is more for the future rather than for this year's allocation.  Anyway, I will take the opportunity to ask the question.  If or when Brexit goes ahead, we will have 60% of EU coastal waters as opposed to 25%, which is the position now.  Does the Department have a view on whether this provides an opportunity for Ireland to increase the share of fish stocks that we can target, given that we will have 60% of the coastal waters?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.57" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1317" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016120600002#J00500"><p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  I concur with the remarks of Deputy Pringle.  Each year we get a report suggesting it is hitting the floor and then the Minister comes back with a great success.  This is a game plan and it does not wash with me.  I imagine it does not wash with anyone who has been involved with the fishing sector over the years.</p> <p>  Let us consider area VII.  It includes Dingle, Kilmore Quay and many other areas along the south coast that are being hit.  These areas are the poor relation when it comes to fishing.  They are being hit again and this will have a major effect.  Are there other fisheries that have not yet been tapped into?  I am specifically referring to spurdog.  I have organised public meetings all along the south coast from Kilmore Quay to Fenit.  Everywhere I go I am told that the waters are thick with spurdog.  Fishing spurdog has been banned.  This even applies to those who are potting.  They are coming up in the pots and there are many of them.  Is this not an opportunity to help those in the inshore sector who are having a terrible time?  Should they not have an alternative?  There could be many advantages if it was possible to have it opened up.  For example, it would take pressure off other sectors such as lobster, crayfish and people involved in gill netting.  They could have another source of income.  It should be considered for smaller inshore fleets and smaller boats.  They could attain some sort of sustainable income.  Then, there is the question of bass.  This is a thorn in the side of many fishermen.  Boats from other jurisdictions are able to fish bass, albeit outside the 12-mile limit, yet we cannot catch bass in our waters.  This is coming up at all the meetings.</p> <p>  The Minister referred to a figure of 86,429 tonnes for mackerel and said it was up by 10,500 tonnes.  How will this be distributed?  Are we going to have the same allocation of quotas as in the past?  In many areas they were political allocations ring-fenced for certain people.  This is a chance to try to do something.  I am not at all concerned about the 23 or 24 millionaire big boats.  I am concerned about the fisherman who works out of Ballycotton or Youghal, over as far as Helvick Head, Dingle, Castletownbere and so on up as far as Rossaveel and back to Kilmore Quay.  They are trying to make ends meet.</p><p>A quota is a huge problem.  There is nothing but reductions again this year.  In regard to cod in the Celtic Sea, there is a minus 68% proposal; megrims, 28%; monkfish, 12%; and prawns down by 9%.  I know these are in negotiation but there will be cuts again.  It is destroying a way of life.  Some mechanism has to be found to try to protect that way of life not to force people into the opportunity to decommission and get out of the industry as has happened in the past.  This has had serious social consequences for coastal communities.  Is there any way the spurdog industry could be started up again?  I understand there is some research going on to see will it go.  If it does that would give people with small boats a good opportunity to stay in the industry. </p></speech>

In truth, I do not know.  This is my first voyage.  The advice of officials in the Department and engagement with colleagues paints a grim picture.  Looking at previous impact assessments I do not think anything was quite as severe as this in terms of the proposals for several species of significant value, particularly the prawns.  They are one of the most valuable stocks up for negotiation at council.  I honestly do not know.  A great deal of work has gone into preparation for this in consultation with other member states where we might forge strategic alliances and work to deliver the best possible outcomes.  It is a very challenging area.</p> <p>  Deputy Ferris asked about spurdog.  The advice is that it is significantly overfished.  It is a long living and slow to recover fishery.  There is a proposal for a small scientific fishery for 2017 and the details need to be worked out.  The scientific evidence would not support the views the Deputy is putting forward.</p></speech>

It is gravely concerned about the state of spurdog.  The second point is spurdog is notorious for its ability to aggregate.  A fisher could be out and catch no spurdog and in the next trawl come across a huge shot of spurdog.  That would imply there is plenty of spurdog but by the nature of the beast, they are easily caught in big shoals.  Overall, however, there are very serious concerns about the state of the stock of spurdog.  As the Minister said, they are very vulnerable to overfishing because they are long lived.</p></speech>

I have been in every port and have spoken to people at the coalface.  The scientific evidence does not take into account the people who are fishing it.  I have had a problem for a long time with scientific evidence because it is not based on the experience of people who are part of the industry.  I am told, and I have no reason to doubt it, that spurdog are thick on the ground.</p></speech>

In that case we can allow some level of fishing to take place then do a scientific evaluation to see with the local fishermen whether what ICES says stands up.  We could certainly do that.</p></speech>

Hake preferences and prawns are not applicable because when the hake preferences were negotiated in the 1980s prawns were not considered an important enough fishery to be covered by it and it would be impossible at this stage to have the scope of hake preferences extended to other species.  There is huge resistance, even though it is one of the instruments in our tool box for getting the best possible outcome.  It is very resistant and is not even a guaranteed card to play but extending it to Nephrops would not be possible.</p> <p>  Brexit is in many respects a different debate to the one we are having today.  Bearing in mind in the context of the referendum, as Deputy Pringle knows better than most, the expectations of the fishing community in the UK were elevated higher than those of any other community, if the UK were to leave with its territorial waters and jurisdiction over them I fail to see an opportunity.  We catch 38% by volume and 36% by value of the effort of the Irish fishing fleet in the UK territorial waters.  If we are displaced from that by the stroke of a pen when Brexit negotiations conclude we and all others who fish in those territorial waters will move into smaller waters chasing a finite resource.  That can only have calamitous consequences for us.  I raised the longstanding fishing practices of the Irish fishing fleet over generations last week when I met Secretary of State, Andrea Leadsom, on Brexit related matters in the UK.</p><p>While she prefaced her remarks by saying that these matters are subject to negotiation between the UK and the European Union, she did acknowledge traditional fishing practices.  This obviously raises the Voisinage issues, which were also discussed and on which we hope to have progress.  I brought a memo to Government today on drafting legislation.  If possible, I hope to have that legislation published before Christmas and, with the assistance of Members, to have that legislation passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas early in the new year.  Brexit is an enormous challenge, particularly if the UK decides to go and take for its exclusive use its own territorial waters.</p><p> Deputy Ferris also raised the issue of bass.  This is an issue of the scientific evidence as well.  All that is left is the angling opportunity for bass, which is restricted.  There is no commercial fishery and unlikely to be for quite some time, based on the science.</p></speech>

They will appreciate that it is a very technical area.  I welcome the input from members and all the stakeholders.  Last Friday in Clonakilty, I had a very useful engagement with all the producer organisations, POs, and the environmental pillar.  That was an important voice also.  Ultimately all stakeholders have a fundamental interest in ensuring the viability and sustainability of the industry.  That is based on science and sometimes the science does not tell us what we would like to hear, but we ignore it at our peril.  Obviously we feed our science into the deliberative process through the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES.  I understand Ireland has been a member of that council almost since the foundation of the State.  Its job is to provide a rational basis for the level of fishing that is sustainable.</p><p>We have some issues with it and argue on those points, but the industry itself acknowledges the evidence on quotas in certain areas.  For example, it agreed to restrict the fishing of nephrops in the Porcupine seabight several years ago.  As a consequence, stocks in the area have returned and there is a proposal to double the outtake in the next year.  That will be a help, although there is a proposal for an overall 9% reduction.</p><p> There are other areas of science that we do not dispute and where fisheries will be closed.  If we overfish, we run the risk of doing permanent damage to fishing opportunities in the industry.  That industry is located on the periphery.  If fisheries go, there are not many alternative enterprises available to people.  It is my ambition to deliver the best possible outcome for the industry in what are seen as challenging circumstances.</p><p> I thank the committee for facilitating this engagement.</p></speech>

I am joined by Mr. Liam Dunne, chairman of the IFA grain committee; growers Mr. David O'Brien and Mr. Jim O'Regan from Cork; Mr. John Daly from Galway; and Mr. Fintan Conway, also of the IFA.</p> <p>  I do not need to tell the committee that 2016 has been a disastrous year for grain farmers.  We are into the fourth consecutive year of low grain prices, a situation that is not sustainable.  The majority of tillage farms generated negative incomes in 2016, and the Teagasc outlook conference confirmed that the net average margin on tillage farms in 2016 was minus &euro;130 per hectare.  The figure for the bottom third of tillage farmers is minus &euro;440 per hectare.  Consequently, many cereal farmers will have to subsidise heavily their production costs with their direct payments.  If one considers the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, one sees that by 2019 these direct payments will have reduced by 8%.  This is not sustainable.  These important issues need to be addressed to ensure a viable tillage sector that can prosper into the future.</p> <p>  The fundamental problem is low to negative margins caused by low grain prices and rising input costs.  On the price side, the IFA was instrumental in setting up a system of forward selling in order to mitigate income and price volatility.  However, forward selling opportunities, affording a margin over production costs, have been few and far between, such is the scale of the downturn in grain prices over the past number of years.  The exceptional yields in 2015 somewhat counterbalanced the low prices received but, unfortunately, many of the growers affected this year, particularly in Cork and Donegal, did not achieve these exceptional yields in 2015.  In addition, a number of growers in some coastal areas of Cork and Kerry lost winter crops due to the sea scald and had to resow early this spring.  The reality is that poor margins for the past four years have left tillage farmers across the country, particularly in these areas, with severe financial losses.</p> <p>  Tillage farmers have suffered a severe income drop of between &euro;70 million and &euro;80 million in 2016 due to a combination of factors, all of which are aggravating this already serious income crisis: reduced production in 2016 in excess of 400,000 tonnes; the reduction in oilseed and protein crop yields; lower grain and protein prices, reducing basic payments; and higher input and capital costs.  Without political intervention and action on a number of fronts, Ireland's tillage sector is in imminent danger of collapse, with major implications for the entire livestock sector and our world-renowned drinks industry.</p> <p>  Many tillage farmers face severe financial hardship, such was the scale of crop losses experienced this harvest by individual growers in parts of a number of counties, including Cork, Kerry, Galway, Roscommon, Longford, Mayo and Donegal.  I am sure the growers here with me will outline the difficulties and losses in their counties in the questions and answers to follow.  Met &Eacute;ireann data for these areas show that incessant rain of over 25 days, high relative humidity of 20 days and a lingering sea mist in some coastal areas for much of September impacted severely on crops essentially west of a line from south Cork to Donegal.  I have personally visited a number of these farms and witnessed these difficulties first hand.  We in IFA have also held a number of meetings with growers in their counties.  The IFA is conducting a comprehensive survey of farmers affected in these regions and we are working very closely with Teagasc and the grain trade.  Our figures indicate that individual growers have experienced crop losses running from 25% to 50%, with straw loss averaging about 50%.  Some individual cases with significantly higher losses have come to our attention.  Full details of our crop losses assessment are being prepared and will be presented to the Minister, Deputy Creed, and Commissioner Hogan in Brussels.  The IFA raised the income crisis in the grain sector at a meeting we had with the committee last September.  In addition, we have outlined the serious losses of grain farmers to the Minister on a number of occasions and have taken the case to Commissioner Hogan's office in Brussels.  Farmers in these areas are at their wits end, not having experienced conditions like this since the mid-1980s or, in the case of younger farmers, never in their lifetime.  Many farmers to whom I have spoken, especially in the past week or two, given that all the bills are coming in at the moment, fear repossession of their machinery.  It is critical that an aid package is secured and put in place for these growers as a matter of urgency, given the dire financial situation in which many of them find themselves through no fault of their own.</p> <p>  Our aid package proposal is that the Government provide direct funding support to farmers who have been affected by the severe crop loss in 2016.  The IFA is clear that the new working capital loan facility secured in the budget will help and have a positive role to play in some farms in the year ahead.</p><p>The IFA is clear that the new working capital loan facility, as secured in the budget, has a positive role to play on some farms in the year ahead but we are clear that for the farmers who have suffered crop related weather losses, direct funding support is urgently required.  This could be provided with direct compensation payments of up to &euro;15,000, reflected in the state aid <i>de minimis</i>ceiling.<br/><br/>For the tillage sector at large, it is vitally important to implement the IFA action plan, which we presented to the Minister, Deputy Creed, at the national tillage forum, to address the serious and deepening income crisis growers are facing.  The details of the IFA action plan include the introduction of a specific crop-loss aid package for the tillage sector targeted at the affected farmers.  It also involves the establishment of a feed certification scheme supporting sustainable agricultural production.  The scheme would maximise the use of native grain and proteins in Irish livestock rations in support of Irish growers; ensure that harmful weed seeds such as black grass and sterile brome, etc., are not inadvertently imported into the country; and increase the use of native grain and Irish malt in the production of Irish whiskies and artisan and craft beers.  The action plan also proposes the abolition of tariffs and anti-dumping duties on fertiliser imports as fertilisers now account for 30% to 40% of variable production costs.  The IFA has undertaken a major campaign at European level to eliminate duties and tariffs on fertilisers which would deliver annual savings of up to &euro;1 billion to European farmers and between &euro;50 million and &euro;70 million to Irish farmers.  I am heading to Brussels again in the morning to advance this campaign.<br/><br/>The action plan also proposes a review by the EU competition authority of the cost of plant protection products which are priced significantly lower to growers in other regions across the world; increased funding to allow for the expansion of the protein crop area eligible to receive the full coupled payment; and the immediate roll-out of the TAMS investment programme.  Working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the IFA has put forward a comprehensive set of proposals for TAMs in the tillage sector and we are pushing for the scheme to be opened as soon as possible.  Finally, the action plan proposes a reduction in the burden of compliance for greening and the introduction of a meaningful renewables heat incentive scheme that will enable growers to generate a viable alternative income stream from the sale of biomass crop residues.<br/><br/>The Irish cereal sector is in grave danger of falling into terminal decline unless immediate and decisive action is taken to reverse the dramatic fall in incomes.  Since 2012, the Irish cereal area has fallen by over 100,000 acres and this trend will accelerate unless there is a dramatic turnaround in fortunes for grain growers.  This will also have ramifications for the sustainability of our livestock and drinks manufacturing sectors.  I am looking for the strong support of this committee in seeking an immediate aid package for the relatively small number of growers who have suffered devastating losses this harvest.  In addition, I am also seeking the support of the members for action to address the deepening income crisis in the tillage sector.  Prompt action is needed by all stakeholders to support Ireland's vitally important tillage sector.</p></speech>

I welcome them here.  It is a pity that we have to be here at this stage.  It is the first week of December and the fact that tillage farmers are in crisis is old news and something that should have been dealt with a long time ago.  The reason we are here is because the crisis continues.  Those farmers who have lost significant proportions of their crops may be in a minority category, but they are still facing bills, they still have no cashflow and the pressure is still mounting with no sign of relief.  I have raised this issue on numerous occasions during Oral Questions to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine as well as on the floor of the D&aacute;il with the Taoiseach, but their heels have been very firmly stuck in on the recognition of the need for a crisis fund for those who have lost their crops.  The proposal in regard to the low interest rate for SBCI has a role to play in supporting agriculture by driving down interest rates, but it is a very specific role, not an answer.  Debt is not an answer for those who have lost their crops and simply do not have cashflow this year.  For that proportion of tillage farmers who have lost their crops, a crisis fund is required.  This has been done before.  It was done in 2009 and 2010 for the horticulture sector and it can be done again.</p><p>Certainly, the IFA has the support of Fianna F&aacute;il.  Deputies Cahill and O'Keeffe are here today as well.  I have had representations from members of the parliamentary party right along the west coast who have been talking to constituents who are very much affected.  We will certainly keep the pressure on.  All members of the committee raised this with the Minister when he was here.  The potential exists within the state aid <i>de minimus</i>rules to support this.  The fact that a loan fund has been set up does not exclude the possibility of a crisis fund to meet the needs of those farmers who are in crisis.  There is also scope within the current budget of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine do to it, but the absence so far has been one of will and a recognition of the fact that a fund is needed to support farmers.  The IFA has put forward a comprehensive range of proposals today and we will certainly support them but the key measure for those in particular crisis is a fund.</p><p>The extent to which farmers have been leaving the industry over the last three to five years has been outlined clearly.  The profitability has not been there.  We are already a net importer of cereals, which is one of our few areas of net import, and we need to protect the cereal growers we have.  To do that, we must ensure that those who are in an unprecedented crisis this autumn receive the crisis funding they need to tide them over and get them through this particular year.  The IFA has our full and continued support.  In terms of any resolution going forward from the committee today, we are full square behind the IFA request for a crisis fund to support those in need.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.96" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1386" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016120600002#Q00400"><p>This is not the first time I have spoken on this issue.  I raised it with the Commissioner when he came to town a few months ago and I have also raised it in the Seanad on several occasions.  I come from Minane Bridge, County Cork, which is three miles from the sea and this issue affected most of my neighbours, colleagues and friends.  There are two issues really.  One was the weather in September, which involved a sea fog that failed to lift for three or four weeks, and, where people had winter cereals, there was an unfortunate level of devastation regarding salt burning to an extent which had not been seen in many years.  Those issues, compounded by poor prices, high moisture and a lack of straw on the ground, made the tillage sector in my part of the world very dysfunctional and drove down incomes.  It has been an unbelievable year for tillage and it is a crisis without a shadow of a doubt.  When one looks at the figures the IFA has produced that anything up to 4,000 tonnes has been lost, it is clear that there will be a significant downward impact on incomes, which is a huge issue for the industry.  As I have stated previously, the tillage industry is on the verge of collapse if we do not do something.  That is my view having listened to neighbours and friends in my part of the world.  They cannot sustain what they lost in the last four years.  The forward selling proposal and prices for next year may not mean any improvement according to the Teagasc reports issued over the last few weeks.  The industry is under fierce pressure going forward.</p> <p>  One often hears that the dairy man will do well if the tillage man goes.</p><p>That is not the case because the dairy man depends on the tillage man, we need the straw and need that ground regarding peas and kale.  We need each other and need it to be interactive so we can all survive in what is a tough job.  There is no point saying it is not.  To my knowledge, and I am open to correction, this only affects some 400 farmers and affects areas such as south Cork, maybe south Kerry and up the west coast of Ireland.  There is a little bit of education required around this event.  It was an unusual event and it only happened in very specific areas.  It did not happen everywhere and telling the story, even to my own colleagues is a big issue, because people do not realise that this unusual weather event lasted for the month of September from the south side of Cork city to Cork Harbour.  That takes a little bit of education.  That part of the world is the main grain growing part of Cork.  It is an event about which not every member of every party is aware happened.  Even when coming to this debate today there was a question mark over what it is all about and we need to get that message out there.  Hopefully this debate will go a fair way to actually getting the information out.</p><p> Going forward, we need to invoke whatever powers we have to put pressure on the Minister and the Commissioner.  When I questioned the Minister on this issue a few months ago his solution was that we could use the low interest loans to help the grain industry.  I realise that the low interest loans are available for the grain industry but I do not think borrowing ourselves out of this is the appropriate way for the 400 or so farmers who are so unfortunately affected.  We need to go to the Minister and see what can be done.  If we must we should go to the EU and I have no issue in sending a delegation from this committee to the EU if required.  Something must be done as it was an unusual event and it will have a major and crippling effect on the grain industry in my part of the world if we do not do anything to solve the problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.98" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016120600002#R00200"><p>I thank Mr. Joe Healy and all the representatives here today from the Irish Farmers' Association.  This issue has been around for quite some time.  We are all very conscious of it.  I met with some of the growers from my own end of the world.  On Sunday evening I was at a table with one of them.  The reality is that it is not affecting every grower.  It must be recognised that we are talking about a minority within the grain and cereal growers in the State.  That minority probably numbers somewhere close to 400.  I am aware of the action plan that has been set out and many of the elements of the plan could be described as being medium-term objectives such as one would like to see in the future, but the first item on the list is the one we really need to have now, which is an aid package for farmers.  If there are 400 or so farmers, at an average of &euro;12,000 each, then the amount of money we are talking about is approximately &euro;5 million.  It is not a huge chunk of money  in terms of the budgets being dealt with by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in the context of a vital industry.  As other contributors have said, it is not just the grain industry.  It is interconnected to every other part of the agriculture sector, to our food production and to the whiskey and beer industries, which are produced and exported very well by Ireland.  The fact that all those things are so interconnected means that we must ensure the grain industry survives, lasts and moves forward.  The example is often given of industries that fell away in the past such as the sugar industry.  It left a huge hole for so many growers in the State when it was taken away overnight.  If the sugar industry was still here it would be an advantage because it is the similar type of grain growers who would also be growing the beets.  The problem we have here is that somehow there is a block to recognising that this issue requires money.  It does not require a loan nor does it require tea and sympathy.  It requires money on the table.  This is what needs to happen as quickly as possible.  In fairness, any time we talk to the Minister he understands the issue.  We are, however, inclined to blame the officials in his Department, and I know there are some present today, but we will not blame them for everything.  At the end of the day the Minister has the decision to make, and that is why he is there.  He needs to make that decision and put the money in place to ensure the grain industry does not fall and go by the wayside, the way other industries have in the past.</p> <p>  The industry representatives have the full support of this committee in what it they are seeking to do.  It goes beyond just the first item on the action plan list for an aid package to be put in place.  It is also about the other elements of the list which are for medium term objectives which should not be lost if an aid package comes.  These objectives also need to be looked at so the industry can be in a position next year, or the year after, where a buffer can be created and if another situation arises such as the bad weather crisis of this year we will not be looking for an aid package then.  As the other contributors have said, the industry representatives have the full support of this committee in getting the issue resolved.  I am not sure what we can do.  It was suggested to bring the matter to the EU but while we all have a good relationship with the Minister, Deputy Creed the buck stops there.  It will be his decision and he needs to step up to the mark and make that decision as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I especially welcome my own fellow county man Mr. Fintan Conway.  I note the president of the IFA had not mentioned that Mr. Conway is from Westmeath.  That is important for me.</p><p>The disastrous events of the last year or so are just bringing to the surface the ongoing sequence of events over the last four or five years.  This issue is just coming to an apex.  Last year's yields disguised many things and I am not surprised that the weather conditions actually accelerated this whole problem.  The problem is obviously very pronounced in the south and the western seaboard but let us not forget that it also has a midlands dimension, for example in Roscommon, Longford and Westmeath.  There are a dozen farmers in Westmeath who are in a similar situation.  It is right across the State and it is about 400 farms.  We raised it with the Minister fairly aggressively at an earlier meeting here today and indicated that &euro;4.5 million or &euro;5 million would be the type of money that would deal with the problem.</p><p>However, the Minister may be starting at the wrong end by talking about the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and the loans available.  This is not a matter of loans because people are already in debt.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland may be very good next year at dealing with merchant credit, which can be very costly, and in giving us money at cheaper rates.  While this would help, it will not alleviate this problem.  This needs addressing immediately and requires meaningful interaction or the exodus of grain farmers from the industry will accelerate.  That would be the end of it.  This would have a knock-on effect, as my colleagues have said, not just for the grain and cereal industry.  It will also affect the brewing and malting industry and everywhere else; the whole place will collapse.  This is of grave importance.  We argued with the Minister about the <i>de minimis</i>ceiling and such matters today and we indicated to him that perhaps it should be reviewed.  Help should be sought when the IFA president is in Brussels tomorrow.  It would be worth exploring because Ireland is small in the overall pool and if we are to get some EU assistance then we must make friends with the big ones - the French and the Polish - who must also be suffering in other ways.</p><p>We must work in that way, hopefully, and assuming we are successful in securing some sort of a crisis aid package for the industry at national level and with EU support, then we could address some of the matters that were raised, especially by Liam Dunne, the IFA's grain chairman over the last five years.  These concerns include the abolition of tariffs and the duties on fertiliser and they must become a major focus.  I agree with Deputy Martin Kenny that while we need to address the immediate concern, we need also look to the medium term as there will be an ongoing crisis in the tillage area, and particularly in grain farming, if we do not take proactive steps.  Some farmers have lost more than 40% and 50% of their yield.  I know of some farmers who have been wiped out altogether in the current year of adversity.  Straw has been a disaster and the perverse situation is that the price of any straw available has gone through the roof.</p><p>This is typical.  When demand exceeds supply, farmers are getting robbed at the other end when trying to buy straw, the price of which has gone through the roof, which is adding insult to injury.</p><p> It is a major issue for individual farmers.  We have raised it with the Minister today and we also raised it in September and followed it through.  I would be interested in finding out from some of the individual farmers about their own losses in this area and what steps this committee can take to try to assist their campaign to secure an aid package at national level.  At European level we need to make sure the Commissioner takes full cognisance of the situation, and I know they have already impressed some of these points on him.  When will this IFA survey be available, given I am sure it will be informative and instructive in regard to how to proceed from here?</p></speech>

The IFA is undertaking a survey of the number of farmers involved.  Is there a rough breakdown of those who own the land, those who rent the land and that type of information?  There are a number of different issues.  There is a short-term issue with those who have been affected by the bad weather.  I believe there are also medium-term and long-term issues, and an open discussion is needed in the tillage sector about where the sector is going in the short, medium and long term.  That is probably a different discussion and one that will take longer than today's meeting.  Mr. Healy might highlight some of these points.</p></speech>

It is good that all of the speakers agree with us on the immediate need for a crisis fund.  There is absolute acknowledgement of the depth of the crisis for the people affected.  To be fair to the speakers, the figure of 400 they are talking about is also the figure we are talking about, given the information we have collected.  Moreover, there is acknowledgement of the knock-on effect on the other sectors.</p> <p>  Perhaps Deputy Penrose's fellow countryman, Fintan Conway, did not mention Westmeath because he spends so much time working in every county and in the farm centre that he spends less time in Westmeath than anywhere else.</p></speech>

We used the five-year average yield because that gives a balanced figure.  There is a significant loss of yield of up to 70% in some cases.  We are still waiting for detailed forms to come back from some counties but we have in excess of 200 to hand with very detailed crop information on yield loss.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.106" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Dunne" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016120600002#S00700"><p>It would appear that 60% of the land affected is owned and 40% is rented.  Many of the growers involved are relatively small because that is the nature of farming in the western sector, and these growers are growing crops on their own land.  In the past couple of years, when growers have been running very tight margins and depending on good yields to compensate for poor prices, they have always been worried that the year will come when the yields do not work and the prices are poor.  That is what has happened to these people.  It is a once in 30 year event as far as weather is concerned, and has not been seen since the 1980s.  I was very taken aback when I went down to some of the fields in Galway and Roscommon in September.  As members will know, our sense of smell makes for the strongest memories, and I had not got that smell of rotting grain in a field since 1985.  I have to admit I was quite taken aback and shaken by it.  It is horrible to be out in a crop that is literally rotting under one's feet.  Those people are in very serious difficulty.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.107" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David O'Brien" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016120600002#S00800"><p>We have heard about the number of farmers and the total figures for tonnes lost but the specifics are a lot more serious.  I had one field of grain that I harvested at 1 tonne to the acre at 30.2% moisture, for which I got &euro;97.50 a tonne.  There were probably three bales of straw per acre, so the total income was probably &euro;120 per acre.  Everybody knows where the costs are, so that is a reflection of crops that were severely affected.  One could look at averages among the 400 growers, but we have to think of the growers who suffered that kind of loss on a large proportion of their grain.  A cheap interest loan next year is no good.  Who is a going to loan a grower money on the basis of this year's accounts and income, with everybody knowing that the income from next year will be needed 100% to run the show next year?  If we were in the dairy business, with the increasing milk price there would be confidence and hope that we could borrow and ride this one out over a number of years.  However, the forward price for grain is showing nothing that suggests we can achieve this.</p> <p>  That is why our number one issue is a crisis fund to solve the current problem.  It is very heartening to hear every committee member who has spoken on the issue recognise the problem.  However, the question I will be asked when I go back to west Cork tomorrow is, "What did they say they will do for you?" or "What are we going to get?"  We are in the run-in to Christmas and the situation for these growers is that their single payment has come and gone and there are still large bills to be paid.  That is the reality.  The next income is next year's harvest.  That is the situation most of these people are living in and it is why we are here today.  It is urgent that we get a pool of money.  It is not a big number of growers so it is not a big a pool of money that is required to solve it, but for the people affected, it is essential.  I would like to get feedback as to how strong a case the committee can put for us and what we can go back to west Cork and tell our people about where this is going and how confident we are the committee can deliver something for us.</p></speech>

What we can do is probably limited enough.  We can make recommendations and we can support the growers but, as was said earlier, tea and sympathy is not going to get them money on the table tomorrow morning.  From that point of view, what we can do is limited.  Obviously, support is very important, and in terms of how to go about getting a package put in place, we would support the growers' cause.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.109" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim O'Regan" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016120600002#S01000"><p>I am in a unique position in that I farm in the north in Kilkenny and also east of Cork city, so I can give a perfect example of what went wrong in the area near the south coast and up the west as well.  In 2015, if a grower was harvesting less than 4 tonnes to the acre in any area north of the River Blackwater, he would be asked what he did wrong and how come he had such poor yields.  At the same time, yields on the south coast were what I would call "Mr. Average" yields of 3 tonnes to 3.5 tonnes to the acre, compared with 4 tonnes to 6 tonnes per acre further north.  To move on to the autumn of 2015, we sowed our crops - winter barley, winter wheat and winter oats - and they emerged in fabulous condition.</p><p>Everything seemed perfect until the turn of Christmas and we went into the beginning of 2016.  We had horrendous storms on the south west coast and on the west coast.  It was what is described as a dry storm.  The salt spray was blown in off the sea onto the crops.  If it was a storm with rain it would have washed the salt off the plant, but it stayed on the plant.  Consequently, it burned the plant.  It burned most of it out.  In fairness to Teagasc at the time, its view was that even the crops that survived would not perform.  How right Teagasc was.  Even the crops that survived did not perform.  It was damage due to the salt burn.  Farmers, I suppose, as typical farmers will do, tried to save their crops in every way possible.  They sprayed trace elements.  They sprayed foliar feed in every way to try and save the crop, but alas, in many cases we failed.</p><p> We had a very wet spring in the south and the planting of the 2016 spring crops went very late.  The problem was possibly starting there again.  We went into the harvest of 2016, and there is where I can give the perfect example.  Every bit of cereals that I had east and north of Cork city were harvested, wrapped up and bailed in perfect condition for the All-Ireland Hurling Final on 3 September and the growers south west of the city and along the west coast were not even able to commence.  I would say would not have found five tillage farmers from south Cork at the all-Ireland ploughing match, on 26 or 27 of September.  Where were they?  They were out trying to salvage their crops, and I mean "salvage".  I spoke at the Minister's forum on the tillage sector here a month ago and I said that the tillage sector on the south coast was on a life-support machine.  The committee members all know what a life-support machine is.  It is on death's knell.</p><p> We move forward from there.  We have engaged in considerable lobbying of public representatives, quite a few of whom are here today.  We had a meeting in Kinsale on Thursday evening last.  There was a grower there who is one of the best growers in Ireland with excellent tillage land.  He sold his produce for &euro;89 a tonne.  That is what he got.  He salvaged it.  The questions those growers put to us were, "How can we pay our bills?  What will we use to pay our bills between here and Christmas?"  They simply cannot pay them.</p><p> Those growers need an immediate aid package.  This loan is fine over the next five years  and we welcome it but those growers need an immediate aid package to tide them over until next year.  There is precedent here for this.  In the winter of 2009-10, there was a lot of frost damage done to the vegetable and potato sectors.  There was an aid package put in place at that stage for that sector.  In 2013-14, we had Storm Darwin.  It damaged farm-owned forest on the Cork-Limerick-Tipperary border and there was an aid package put in place.  How come an aid package cannot be put in place for growers who suffered similar weather damage?  Is there something about being a cereal farmer that one is condemned to being a second-class citizen?</p><p> It is no longer acceptable that tillage farmers can be treated like dirt.  Aid can be secured for other sectors.  If there is a price drop in a produce, we can go to Europe and get support for it.  For example, there was a grant system announced 12 months ago and &euro;400 million was allocated for every other sector bar a tillage farmer.  How come the tillage farmers were left outside the door in that?</p><p> The Minister made a presentation here today on the greyhound sector - we were in the Visitors Gallery listening to it - and he used an important phrase.  It is a phrase that I have heard time and time again over the past few months.  All the tillage farmers ask for is to be treated fairly.  The Minister said he had to have "a level playing pitch".  All we want is a level playing field.  That is what we ask for.  It is our right.  Whether it is grant aid, dairy aid or anything else, if there is aid being provided to one sector of Irish farming it should be provided to all.</p><p> I will give an example of my own situation.  I have a young son at home farming, just married and taking over the farm in time.  His next-door neighbour is a young dairy farmer.  They went to national school and second level school together.  After second level, one studied dairying and the other did tillage, and both of them got their green certificates.  How come it is the position that the dairy farmer can get a grant aid for a rotary milking parlour and my son cannot qualify for a grant to buy three basic tools on a tillage farm, such as a sprayer, a combination unit for sowing and a spreader to spread fertiliser?  Those are three basic tools.  They should be included and if they are not we are effectively saying that tillage farmers are not equal and are not entitled to the same level of aid.  If they are not included, they are being put at a competitive disadvantage to their next-door neighbour and that, basically, is immoral.</p><p> To turn to the value of our sector, for too long the tillage or cereal sector has been looked upon as the provider of a cheap feed policy.  We must move away from the cheap feed policy.  We, in the south, have been pushing for something.  We googled something last night.  There is, on that list, a distilling sector right around the country, virtually in every county up the west coast and down the east coast.  Some of the most prominent ones are in my own county.  We are the providers of the raw material for that.  I attended a Bord Bia seminar recently in Cork where Mr. Aidan Cotter, a most respected gentleman, made a presentation.  What is the prize product within Bord Bia presently?  Irish whiskey is first.  That is the number one growing product.  If tillage farmers are given a fair opportunity we can ride out the storm but first, there has to be immediate aid for the farmers affected.</p><p> We provide the raw material for three prime products for export presently, namely, the whiskey sector, the micro-beer sector and Flahavan's.  Flahavan's is a perfect example in that I supply a lot of quality oats to it.  These are niche products.  Those sectors will die if we are allowed die.  Look what happened to our beet sector.  It was thrown away for 30 pieces of silver and as the gentleman here stated, we are moaning the loss of it ever since.</p></speech>

There are two issues here.  There is the problem in the grain sector, which is ongoing for a number of years, involving poor prices and the drop in the single farm payment.  There are income issues.  Last year, the record grain harvest disguised some of the income problems.  Then there is the immediate problem of the 400 farmers who, due to horrific weather conditions, have lost most of their crop.  When we are making the points, we should divorce the two issues.</p> <p>  The grain sector, as Mr. O'Regan stated, is most important for a number of other sectors in the country.  We have lost our beet sector.  If one goes back to the fodder crisis we had a couple of years ago, we ended up importing hay from the UK.  If we had held our beet sector, that would never have happened because the by-products of the beet sector would have filled that gap.  I grew up in a town where there was a sugar beet factory and I recall the smell of the pulp in the morning, the employment it created, etc.  We lost that sector.  If we do not mind ourselves, we will loose our grain sector as well.  Acreage has dropped significantly and straw prices have gone through the roof.  I suppose the yield of straw was back.</p><p>It shows how important the by-products of the grain industry are to the agriculture sector.  We need to have a hard look at where our cereal sector is going.</p><p> The points have been well made about the immediate problem of establishing a crisis fund.  There are precedents in the horticulture and forestry sectors and there was a fund when EU exports to Russia were banned.  A huge fund was put in place for eastern European farmers to compensate them for the loss of that market.  We had a robust exchange with the Minister earlier.  Deputy McConalogue made it crystal clear that low interest loans should not prevent the setting up of a crisis fund.  If I learned one thing today, I learned that.  Hiding behind a low interest loan scheme to prevent a crisis fund is not correct.  The two can operate in tandem.  That is a foundation to work on and that is what we have to do.  These farmers have a cashflow crisis with no income coming in.  The amount being sought in the overall context is not huge.  The ball is firmly back in the Minister's court and this has to be delivered on.  Mr. Healy said he was going to Brussels in the morning about different issues, but pressure has to put on there as well.  At the end of the day, there is an obligation on the Minister to deliver for these 400 farmers.</p><p> The co-operative I supply milk to is a significant purchaser of grain.  Any crop sown this winter has been sown on merchant credit.  The low interest loan has a part to play in the grain industry going forward but it has to be divorced from the crisis in Cork and along the western seaboard.  As Deputy McConalogue said, we will maintain maximum pressure.  The debate is going on for a few months and we have not made progress with the Minister.  Earlier, he was steadfast that the cheap loans will be in place by the end of January and that was all the comfort he gave to grain growers.  That is not enough and every opportunity we get, whether it is in the D&aacute;il or at this committee, we will do our maximum to keep the pressure on.  We are going to Brussels tomorrow to meet officials over the next two days.  We will raise the issue and see the response from the Commission.  One hopes there will be a chink of light to see how this fund can be delivered because fair play is good play.  If other sectors got it, why should grain farmers not get it?</p><p> Mr. Healy raised the issue of exclusion from the previous targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS.  We have to get into these issues to establish where the grain sector is going.  A debate on the future of the sector and the very important part it plays in different industries might be the subject of another meeting.  Bord Bia representatives made a presentation to the committee a few weeks ago.  Cereal growers are a cornerstone of what the board is trying to do with a number of products and we have to do something to protect the growers.  We have lost enough acreage and we have to move to protect the industry.  When the IFA is lobbying, it should divorce the hardship fund from the crisis.  Both have to be dealt with politically and they are very important to the association as a lobbyist.  It looks like another crisis in 2017 as we sit here in the final month of 2016.  Our grain industry will need material help to get over this crunch.  It would be a shame to let it go and we have to do whatever we can whenever we can to highlight it.</p></speech>

The committee will make as strong a representation as it can to the Minister to get a hardship fund in place.  It is clear from all the contributions that the issue has gone on too long at this stage and it needs to be addressed.  Has the IFA had any response to its action plan from the Government?  What feedback is the association getting on it?  Has it had discussions with distillers about native grain and malt for the production of whiskey and what feedback has it had from them on sustaining native grain through them?</p> <p>  With regard to the tariff and anti-dumping duties at European level, is the Government supporting the IFA on that?  Will Mr. Healy comment on whether the EU competition authority will examine that issue?  These are medium to long-term solutions but getting the hardship fund in place is the primary issue initially to keep things ticking over.</p></speech>

I thank the IFA representatives for their presentation.  I have visited many farms in west Cork that are in serious difficulty since September.  I raised on many occasions in the D&aacute;il through Leaders' Questions and parliamentary questions to the Minister the difficulties that grain farmers have been experiencing but, to date, other than the offer of low interest loans, which means kicking the can down the road, nothing concrete has been offered such as a cereal aid package for the survival of our grain farmers.  I have also requested the MEPs from Ireland South to support the case for the compensation of these farmers.  It is a sector that is discriminated against for some reason.  Many Deputies and Senators have been pushing this issue for the past three months and something is preventing the Minister from making a decision that makes a great deal of sense.  Precedents were set in the horticulture sector in 2009, the forestry sector in 2013 with the replanting arrangements and the dairy sector in 2015.</p> <p>  I have witnessed the devastation in west Cork and along the west coast.  Will Mr. O'Regan outline the losses coastal grain farmers have suffered this year?  The winter grain crop has to be resown because of the weather.  Salt and storm damage then hit the crop and wiped out much of it, with it having to be replaced by a spring crop.  Will he quantify the cost of the resowing, the overall loss of the winter barley crop, the cost of resetting, and the loss suffered in the autumn?  Will grain growers survive this year's bad weather without compensation?  Will they be forced out of business?  Does the industry have a future?</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Healy and the various IFA tillage sector representatives.  They have my support.  I am coming at this from a different angle because I want to know where we go next.  I have been fighting on this issue for almost ten months.  Farmers in Whitegate and Churchtown South in my constituency have taken a double hit with crop damage.  As Mr. O'Regan said, a sea mist created a salt drift and destroyed the crop.  These farmers replanted most of these fields again with a spring crop and were prepared to take a hit with reduced yields, but there was more bad weather and, therefore, they took a double hit.  Everyone has referred to solutions.  I have a case full of correspondence with the previous Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I tried to fight the case on behalf of these farmers on the basis that it was as serious a welfare issue as those who were flooded.  I could have two farmers in south County Cork.  One is a beef farmer with a shed in place and the neighbour has his winter grain sown.</p><p>On welfare grounds, the farmer with the cattle shed gets a few bob to refurbish the premises but what about the welfare of the farmer who lost his crop?</p><p> I have done some research and came across the provisions for vegetable growers put in place by the then Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, in the Government before last.  I put a parliamentary question to the Minister on this issue, Parliamentary Question No. 510 of 11 October 2016, and I had to go back to the Ceann Comhairle for a proper answer.  The Minister had said there was leeway and that gives me hope, but I am concerned he is trying to subsume tillage problems into one big issue.  I spoke about this at a stakeholders' meeting on 5 October.  I am frightened for the man who has no money for 2017, having suffered a substantial loss of income.  I an worried that his problems are falling on deaf ears and I had hoped the Minister would be stronger on this issue.  There are big farmers in the tillage sector but many are family farmers.  The previous Minister said, four or five years ago, that if they cannot handle the tillage sector they should get into milk.  I thought that was a very bad thing to say.  Farmers have stuck with it, though, and Deputy Charlie McConalogue raised a Topical Issue matter on 5 October in the D&aacute;il, on the same day as he was meeting stakeholders.  The Minister replied, "Until we have a full picture, I will not jump into making any hasty announcements regarding the measures we might consider appropriate".  I hope he is still so minded.  Teagasc figures are still not fully in and I am hoping that we have not shut the door on this issue.</p><p> The price of grain is a disaster but other areas of the farm sector have benefited from it.  These farms are genuine operators.  I spoke to some in east Cork, in the areas of Whitegate, Churchtown South and Ballycotton, who have taken advantage of the good weather and planted winter grain again this year.  I hope the Minister does not think farmers who sowed winter grain last year, and got caught out, should have learned their lesson.  Winter grain has been sowed here for many years and Teagasc will confirm that.</p><p> The Minister announced the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland to lend money at low interest rates, which is good if a person can repay his loans.  Any farmer would try to take advantage of this facility but there is only so much to go around.  When applications are made to banks the priority will be those in the dairy sector, whose milk has gone up in price, and in beef where the product is guaranteed, though the price fluctuates.  Tillage is being seriously neglected.  I am asking for advice as I have a caseful of documentation but I have been stonewalled in every attempt to find a solution so far.  I hope that the power of this committee and the IFA will force the Minister to listen.  </p></speech>

That is welcome and I hope it will be rolled out in the new year.  We also lobbied to ensure that tillage farmers would be included in the loan scheme, which was not the case initially.  I hear the views of different members, and of the IFA, but tillage farmers have not been left out.  The Minister said there would be an ongoing review of the farmers who applied for it so that no sector dominated, and that is the right thing to do.</p></speech>

I have met with a number of people in the past seven or eight weeks who have practically lost their income for the year.  I have met with the local IFA leadership and have been very well briefed.  Everything that has been said today is consistent with what I have seen with my own two eyes, and heard from those people.  It is very worrying that 400 family farmers have lost their income for the year.  I might be on my own on this but I do not accept for one minute that low-interest loans are the solution.  In fact, I think they could contribute to the problem.  If there is no aid package people will borrow money to pay debts for a year and I am very sceptical about it.  There must be no other outcome than an aid crisis package to the 400 people who are in this situation through no fault of their own but because the elements militated against them.</p> <p>  There should be no ambiguity in any political party or among Independents about their support for those farmers.  This is an equality situation.  There are precedents going back to 2009, 2010 and 2013.  If this is not delivered it will be a violation of the equality of the people in our agricultural sector.  An agreed message from the committee to the Minister should go out, clear and strong, that an aid package must be made available forthwith to alleviate the suffering of cereal farmers at this time.  The situation requires equality of treatment in line with precedents.  The Government has to live up to equality demands and there should be no ambiguity.  It must not be pushed down the road with low-interest loans because without an aid package things will be made worse.  It involves a small number of farmers and a small amount of money but a big impact on local economies, families and communities.</p><p>They deserve our support and I have no doubt it will be forthcoming.</p></speech>

I have had the opportunity to discuss the issue with a number of people locally who have been hit directly by it.  They are very stressed and very much at a loss on the issue.  I have also discussed it with my party colleagues, who have been highlighting it to the Minister as well.  While there are only 400 farms affected, there are 400 families, I would expect, behind each of those.  We should not lose sight of the fact that family incomes are affected by this.  As Mr. Healy pointed out, it is an unusual weather situation and a once-in-30-years event.  If it was a flooding event, it would be very visible.  It would be apparent on the ground, carried on the news and so on.  In this situation, however, the weather came, did the damage and went away.  The damage remained and farmers were left picking up the pieces for some time afterwards.  There is also the fact that the people and families that have been hit are scattered all along the western coast or the Wild Atlantic Way.</p> <p>  It really needs to be hammered home with the Minister that while low-interest borrowing might be of help, it does not prevent a crisis.  What is really needed is a crisis fund.  It would be an awful injustice if one type of farming was able to benefit from a crisis fund while another enterprise, such as tillage, was not able to access something similar.  That is what we need to keep the focus on.  That would surely be a decision for the Minister.  While I am sure there would be influence from Europe in supporting him or not, it is ultimately a decision for the Minister.  That is where we need to keep the focus to ensure that he provides a direct crisis fund to the families that have been hit by this.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Regan made a very good point.  It is a separate issue, but we also need to keep the focus on the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, for tillage.  There is inequality between one enterprise, in which he was able to build an automated milking parlour, and the tillage enterprise, which is not allowed access to the scheme.  That is another day's issue, but one that needs to be highlighted as well.</p> <p>  I wish to ask Mr. Healy about the survey he carried out.  He has clarified that he expects to have final results on it over the next ten days.  He has a fairly substantial batch of information already after receiving 200 out of 400 responses.  Are there emerging patterns in that information regarding the scale of the loss to each individual?  Are we looking at many large losses or a whole load of small losses?  I ask the witness to clarify the emerging patterns on that.  With 200 out of 400 responses received, he has fairly substantial information already.</p> <p>  Go raibh maith agat, Cathaoirleach, for allowing me the opportunity to contribute, even though I am not a full member of the committee.</p></speech>

To give an example of an analysis of the prices I saw earlier in the year, when &euro;115 was mentioned as a green price at the very start, an independent analysis said that even in the perfect year, at three and a half tonnes to the acre, allowing for &euro;40 for straw, a farmer on his own land stood to lose &euro;58 per acre.  I ask the committee to keep that in mind when Mr. O'Brien talks about having to sell one field of corn or barley at 30.2% moisture for &euro;97.50 at one tonne to the acre.  That gives some idea of the size of the losses.</p> <p>  Mr. Conway might now talk about the emerging patterns that Deputy Aindrias Moynihan asked about.</p></speech>

In terms of the crop loss, it varies from 30% to 70%.  However, there is no trend by area or by county because farmers a couple of miles away could have harvested while a next door neighbour bombed out.  It was very much dependent on when the crop was ripe and whether the farmer had the machine to cut it.  The crop loss was extremely variable within localities, which we have not seen before.  In 1985 and 1986, I was involved in the early days of the grain trade.  That time, the problem was across every farm in every area.  However, this year it is just in particular areas.  Liam beside me could bomb out, Joe could have cut his crop and Jim could have bombed out as well.  What happened on farms was very variable, very localised and very individualised.  It was very unusual.  We have been talking to the French, who are in a similar situation.  Their loss was probably on a more geographically widespread basis.  It was a similar situation in which one farm might have bombed out and another might have saved 50% to 80% of crops.  It was a very unusual weather event.  I have only seen it once before.</p></speech>

Are there outstanding payments to the merchants, the contractors or whoever else, or have they been paid?  Where are the big stumbling blocks?  Will that be a part of the survey or is it actually just about the amount of land involved and how much of it is owned or rented?  What level of detail will there be in the survey?</p></speech>

What is the situation with Teagasc putting figures together to help the IFA's case?  Has the IFA been talking to Teagasc and has the latter been helpful in putting together the summary of the issues that exist?  If Teagasc were involved, that report would be very helpful to this committee.  I still believe that we need to go to the Minister and probably to Europe to get something sorted.

Essentially, what they look at is the five-year trend yield and then they establish what the yield loss is, etc.  The figures that are normally used invariably come from the likes of Teagasc or some other body across Europe.  In this case, Teagasc has identified the costings involved.  They are very transparent.  The best and only way to focus on that is to used an established body like Teagasc.  We have used the norms that the insurance industry use to establish the loss.</p></speech>

I remember cutting corn in 1985.  We used to cut wheat at night and barley during the day.  At that time, we had only half the combine power we have now.  In 1985, along with the contractors, we managed to cut every acre of corn that was to be cut.  This year, we did not.  I have never ever seen crops in the state they were this year over such a vast area.  I uploaded photographs onto the iPad today to show the committee how bad it was.  I have never seen it before.  My father said that he had never in his life experienced a situation whereby we did not get the corn cut.  However, this year, we did not.</p> <p>  We welcome the low-interest loans, but they are not the solution to our problem.  We need a cash injection to pay the bills.  Merchants are ringing looking for their payment for their input for the year.  The basic payment for the single farm is gone but the bills still are not paid.  Bills remain outstanding.  There is another chunk of the single payment hopefully coming this week, but there will still be substantial bills outstanding after this year.  This year comes after three average harvests.  There was no reserve coming into this year.  Now here we are, with the weather crisis having inflicted losses of between 30% and 100%.  We cut farms of sizes ranging from 10 acres to 400 acres and there was not one that did not experience losses.</p><p>That is just in grain.  There were 50% losses in straw alone in our area.  There is high demand for straw in our area because, while there are not that many tillage farmers, the dairy and beef farmers constantly need straw.  They are frustrated that we were unable to supply it.</p><p> As far back as the ploughing championships, we met the Minister, Deputy Creed, who told us that we would have to go to Europe.  About three weeks ago, an IFA delegation went to Brussels where we met Mr. Tom Tynan.  His exact words were: "Stay knocking on Kildare Street until you get it."  He said that at the time there was no traction in Europe unless the French got on board.  When the French got on board time had rolled on, however, so they do not have as much support in the European Parliament now as they would have had at the time of the harvest.  Therefore, their support is being watered down.</p><p> We met with Deputies McConalogue and Cahill earlier and I must commend them for the way they targeted the Minister, Deputy Creed, for the necessary crisis funding.  I was in the Visitors Gallery and they really did give it their all.  Unless we receive support from every politician to get this over the line, the tillage industry will be on a slippery slope, especially in the western corridor from Cork to Donegal.  It cannot be sustained so we need a cash injection to get us out of this hole.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Regan has a couple of questions to answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.137" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim O'Regan" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016120600002#X00300"><p>The cost of replanting per acre, based on Teagasc figures, would be about &euro;120.  Approximately 200 growers are affected in the D&aacute;il constituency of Cork South-West, which is more or less from Senator Lombard's area out to Mizen Head.  It is a strong tillage area as the Senator knows, including Kinsale where tillage is concentrated, and consequently a huge number of growers are affected.</p> <p>  I was asked if those growers have a future but I am afraid the answer is "no", unless an aid package is put in place.  As the IFA president, Mr. Healy said, costs are almost &euro;400 an acre while income is just over &euro;100.  There is no hope for those growers, so I ask everyone in this committee room to consider them.  How will they face Christmas?  It is a nightmare situation for them.  I was also asked whether there was a future, and there is.  We have some of the best tillage farmers and land in Europe.  There is a future if we are treated fairly and the industry is given a fair run for its money.  Deputies O'Keeffe and Michael Collins sent me a note on farms and I spoke to some of their constituents last night.  They have the cream of land down in the Whitegate area, but they got wiped out this year by weather damage, through no fault of their own.  It is a one in 30-year cycle.  Every politician, regardless of party, should put their shoulder to the wheel.  Aid can be obtained if there is a will to make the effort.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.141" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Dunne" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016120600002#X00700"><p>Mr. O'Regan is right.  There will only be a future if these people get support.  If they do not, then a large proportion of this area will go out to grass.  That means that a large proportion of the grain and straw produced in these areas, which are closest to the market place and where transport costs are low, will be lost.  In addition, stubble ground takes up a huge amount of slurry and municipal waste after the crops.  Under the Nitrates Directive we need another 50% of land for pig slurry and another 25% or 30% for chicken layer.  A reduction will cause problems in that respect.  We have already seen straw losses.</p> <p>  If the ground producing straw is lost in future we will have another problem due to an uneven balance in the supply and demand for straw.  My neighbours and I will certainly not complain if the price of straw stays up, but if one is running along the margins one will run into severe problems in some years with a consequent fodder crisis again.  I do not want to see tillage land being lost in the west of Ireland.  It may not be obvious to many people, but biodiversity is required in such areas, instead of having all grass we also badly need cereals.</p> <p>  I will briefly run through the remaining questions.  Deputy Pringle asked what progress was being made with the medium-term items on our list.  We raised all these issues at the forum.  As regards the use of native grains in rations, a lot of the mills have taken on board the lessons learned since our visit to the seaside during the summer.  There will be further talks with many of them in order to put a scheme in place.  We could do with departmental support on that.</p> <p>  As regards the importation of harmful weed seeds, that really is down to the Department.  I am sure that many members of the committee watch the Australian TV programme "Nothing to Declare", so they will clearly know how strict those authorities are on what can be brought in.  All grains imported from outside Ireland need to be screened in order to solve the problem simply.</p> <p>  As regards native grains in whiskey and beer, the brewers and distillers have told us they will become more involved with malt and barley growers, and will give them more support.  We welcome that but we also need this committee's support.</p> <p>  There is serious resistance on the Continent to the abolition of tariffs on fertiliser imports.  One may ask why, given that European farmers are also buying fertilisers.  The structure of farming on the Continent is quite different, however, because most cereal growers there are within large co-ops, on an even larger scale than our dairy farmers and Glanbia here.  Those continental co-ops are often owners or part-owners of fertiliser companies.  They are producing fertiliser themselves and supplying it to their own farmers.  In addition, there is a profit dividend which goes back to the growers.  It is a totally different structure from ours, so we are being left out on a limb.  We are certainly not on a level playing field where fertiliser is concerned.</p> <p>  As regards the competition authority and plant protection products, we see a major problem coming down the line with Brexit.  The British are one of our allies when it comes to negotiations on plant protection, including price and availability, but if they quit the system we will be left out on a limb.  We are very worried about it.  After Brexit, we could and most probably will see genetically modified products being grown in the UK, right on our doorstep.  Some of that could easily be filtered back in here.</p> <p>  It is down to the Minister to sort out the expansion of the protein area in Brussels and get us an answer.  He should give us a chance to expand that a little further.  We have grown fully into what was asked of us and we will continue to do so if we can.</p> <p>  We would like to see the immediate roll-out of TAMS, and we mean now.  We know from our talks with Department officials that they are practically ready for this.  It is up to the Minister to announce it . We would hope to see an announcement before Christmas.  We think that is possible and it should be done.  A lot of equipment will be available to all sizes of tillage farmers, including quite small equipment that will be useful to many people whose incomes are under severe pressure.</p> <p>  We have a simple request concerning a reduction in the burden of compliance with greening, which would solve the three-crop rule problem, that is, equivalence.  Through a GLAS, one can be allowed to grow one crop provided that one supplies green cover.  The issue at the moment is that Brussels is insisting on 100% green cover.  As it is, however, one is allowed to grow 75% of one crop, so one is only talking about the extra 25%.  Therefore, that green cover should be 25%.</p><p>We have a very small number of farmers who are trying to grow 100% green cover.  It is almost impossible.  That small change would make a substantial difference for all the growers along the coast.  They could grow just the one crop, a spring crop, where the barley is needed and there is a market for it, rather than growing crops for which there is not a market.  We have asked the previous and current Ministers as well as raising it repeatedly in Brussels.  It is a small, simple change and we do not seem to be able to effect it.</p></speech>

It seems to be that it is kicked back and forth.  They say 100% and we and the officials ask for 25%.  We have to leave it back to the committee and the Minister to try to sort that out.  We will keep pushing it.</p> <p>  On the renewable heat incentive, give us the opportunity to grow other crops to supply energy that would not have to be imported and we will do it.  That is all we ask.  We can do it.  Given the opportunity to grow something that has a profit, why we would continue to grow grain, which has very minimal profit in it, when we could grow something else which would be of benefit and reduce imports?  All we need is a chance to do that and we would take it up willingly.</p></speech>

As a Kerry Deputy, I am fully aware of the issues and I have in my parish and constituency many of those 400 farmers who are affected.  The issue is very real for us in Kerry.</p><p>I apologise if the following has been said already.  I remember during the very severe frost of a number of years ago, probably 2010 or 2011, that there was a complete wipeout of the crop of the vegetable growers in north Dublin and a fund was found for them, and deservedly so.  They received an aid package that got them out of the turmoil they were in during that particular year.  If it is good enough for Dublin, it is good enough for the west.</p><p>I ask that we convey to the Minister that there is cross-party support for this fund.  It can be found.  If it was given then, it could be applied <i>pro rata</i>in this case and we could get a very quick decision, which is what is needed.  I fully support the delegation.  There is always a fund and if it can be found for one, it should be found for all others.  We should treat everyone equally and I would like to see that applied to the tillage and grain growers of the west.</p></speech>

As can be seen, there is consensus.  What we need to do as a committee is issue a report in the next couple of days.  I hope the delegation members can feed into it any information they have from the survey as soon as they have it because that is very important.  There are different figures, for example, Deputy Brassil saying there are 400 in his parish, so we need to get final figures to see where we are going.  We will issue a report to the Minister.</p> <p>  There has to be a European element to this as well because that is very important.  We will copy the report to the Commission.  There may be a need for a committee delegation to Brussels.  I know the witnesses are going there tomorrow and it is important they keep banging away on that drum, irrespective of what others may have said in recent weeks.  The drum needs to be banged, so to speak, over there as well as here and both feed into the one, as it were.  I thank the delegation for attending the meeting today.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the support of all on the committee.  We have had words at this meeting, but what we need is action.  The word "no" is not an option for the farmers in difficulty.  Their desperation was hammered home to me today by a man who owns six acres of land, who has rented 180 acres of land and who has salvaged less than 50% of the crop.  For that man, "no" is not an option.  The power exists.  The fund can, will and should be found for such people.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2016120600002#B00300"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to present this request for a technical Supplementary Estimate for 2016 in which I am seeking the committee's approval to use savings on the Department's Vote to fund other desired expenditure.  As these proposed transfers and expenditure involve significant changes to the original 2016 voted allocations, I believe it is important to seek the committee's input and approval.  Specifically, this technical Supplementary Estimate will transfer &euro;20 million of savings in certain areas of the Vote to bring forward expenditure commitments due in 2017 under the World Food Programme, WFP, and also transfer a further &euro;13.9 million of other savings to fund the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, agriculture cashflow support loan scheme, which I announced in budget 2017 in October.</p> <p>  The &euro;33.9 million current funds required would be transferred from various subheads where, due to changed circumstances, savings have emerged, most notably in the administrative budget pay and non-pay subheads, the fisheries fleet decommissioning scheme which is not yet in place, the seafood development programme, technical costs associated with the operation of European Union, EU, schemes, the green low carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, training, research, the early retirement scheme and the food safety animal health and welfare programme.  </p> <p>  In 2015, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform lifted the moratorium on recruitment and delegated responsibility for managing my Department's human resources to the Secretary General.  This removed the numbers threshold my Department operated under during the moratorium and provided flexibility to recruit and deploy resources subject to adherence to specified pay ceilings.  My Department's management board continually assesses our critical business needs and our human resources division works closely with our recruitment partners, the Public Appointments Service, PAS, to fill those needs.  </p> <p>  The recruitment process has been slower than we would have liked, due mainly to the significant pressure on the PAS system from across the public sector.  To date in 2016, my Department has recruited 110 new staff across a range of skills sets.  Our aim is to build the Department's resource levels to 3,200 by the end of 2017 with the right mix of skills, experience and competences to ensure we continue to deliver a high quality service.  The delay in the recruitment process will give rise to a saving of approximately &euro;13.5 million in the 2016 payroll allocation.  A further &euro;1 million will be saved over various non-pay subheads under the administrative budget in the Department.</p> <p>  Our seafood sector is worth in the region of &euro;850 million annually to our economy and I am aiming to achieve &euro;1 billion in sales by 2020.  A key driver of this increase will be the &euro;240 million European maritime and fisheries fund, EMFF, operational programme which was officially launched in January 2016.  Schemes under the programme will assist seafood enterprises to sustainably grow their production, add value to our seafood exports and create much needed employment in our coastal communities. </p> <p>  I made some &euro;36 million available in 2016 for the EMFF operational programme in the budgets of my Department and its agencies to get the new schemes up and running.  However, there are some savings this year as schemes roll out.  There will be a saving in region of &euro;8.5 million on Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM's, 2016 current expenditure budget primarily because a proposed fleet decommissioning scheme did not start this year. </p> <p>  There will also be some &euro;1.5 million current savings on other EMFF budgets managed by my Department.  These savings identified this year will not affect the overall budget available for the seafood sector under the EMFF operational programme as these investments will occur over the later years of the programme.  To demonstrate my continued commitment to the EMFF operational programme, I have made available an increased budget of &euro;43 million, up from this year's amount of &euro;36 million, for the EMFF in 2017 across the budgets of my Department and its agencies. </p> <p>  It is also anticipated that savings of just over &euro;2.5 million will be achieved in the animal health and welfare area due to reduced instance of disease.  These savings are expected in the tuberculosis, TB, eradication area, where the generally positive situation in TB has been maintained.  However, I know difficulties continue in some areas and we cannot be complacent about the future.  Expenditure on the control of horses scheme is also lower this year than anticipated </p> <p>  There will be savings of some &euro;2.5 million under the agri-environmental scheme specifically in the training allocation under GLAS and some &euro;3 million will be saved under the subhead for market support and clearance of accounts which covers potential financing costs associated with the operation of common agricultural policy, CAP, schemes and also the costs associated with the land parcel identification scheme, LPIS, upgrade project.  Other savings are in the early retirement scheme and research grants where the drawdown of funding following awards made under the most recent research call has been slightly slower than expected.</p> <p>  Overall, these current expenditure savings amount to some &euro;33.914 million and these savings, with the committee's approval, will be transferred to the World Food Programme area.  The additional &euro;20 million provided for the WFP in this Supplementary Estimate represents an advance payment of next year's commitment under Ireland's strategic partnership agreement with the WFP.  This earlier disbursement is at the request of the WFP&rsquo;s executive director, who has written to inform me that this funding will make a significant contribution that will enhance the WFP's capability to plan its interventions and better address the many growing humanitarian crises around the world.</p> <p>  My Department leads on Ireland's engagement with the UN's World Food Programme.  The WFP is the largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide and is funded exclusively from voluntary contributions.  It is responsible for the delivery of food assistance to the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world and feeds 80 million of the most malnourished people in 80 countries.  It works in partnership with other UN and international organisations, non-governmental organisations, NGOs, civil society and the private sector to enable communities and countries to meet their own food needs. </p> <p>  The WFP also plays a significant role in the UN's global campaign for zero hunger, and is at the forefront of dealing with the migration crisis.  This contribution will help save lives and support food security and nutrition and rebuild livelihoods in fragile settings.  Ireland has a strategic partnership agreement with the WFP which doubles Ireland's core annual multilateral contribution to the WFP to &euro;20 million for the years 2016 to 2018.  This follows a commitment that Ireland made at last year's Expo Milan event to support WFP.  This funding, while generally targeted at the WFP's emergency and protracted relief operations, is provided on an un-earmarked basis which gives the WFP the flexibility to plan and target this funding in the most strategic, efficient and effective manner.</p> <p>  While this increased commitment is provided on an un-earmarked basis for the reasons I have outlined, it represents a key element of the Government's enhanced and increased response to the ongoing refugee crisis associated with the conflict in Syria.  In particular, it is a significant part of Ireland's contribution to the EU's response to this refugee crisis.</p><p>This contribution enables life-saving assistance for people living on the front lines of hunger, conflict and climate change and reaffirms Ireland's role as one of the World Food Programme's most engaged partners.  Ireland's multi-annual commitment facilitates effective assistance for hungry and malnourished people, particularly in regions devastated by war.<br/><br/>Some &euro;13 million of savings identified will be used for the agriculture cash flow support loan scheme that I announced on budget day.  In September this year, in response to market difficulties being experienced by milk producers and farmers in other livestock sectors, the European Commission made a package of exceptional adjustment aid measures available to members under Regulation (EU) 2016/1613, including an allocation to Ireland of just over &euro;11 million.  The &euro;13.9 million of the Vote savings identified will be used to provide additional funding for loans for livestock sectors and a parallel product to be made available under <i>de minimis</i>state aid to all other farmers, particularly those involved in tillage and horticulture.  This innovative scheme will primarily provide loans to enable farmers to pay down expensive forms of credit, such as merchant credit and other short-term credit facilities like overdrafts, improve management of their cash flow and reduce the cost of short-term borrowings.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, aims to make these loans available in the market by the end of January 2017.  The scheme, with total funding of &euro;150 million, will support highly-flexible loans for up to six years for amounts of up to &euro;150,000 at an interest rate of 2.95%.  This rate will represent a significant saving for farmers when compared with other forms of unsecured short-term finance currently available.  The loans will be flexible, with interest-only facilities of up to three years.  Normal lending assessment criteria will apply, although as the loans will be unsecured, it will facilitate a more straightforward application process.<br/><br/>I announced earlier this month that the SBCI had invited financial institutions to take part in the agriculture cash flow support loan scheme and a number of applications were submitted by the closing date of 25 November.  These will now be the subject of a formal approval process to be completed in the coming weeks, with the outcome to be announced at the start of the new year.  I encourage farmers to consider their cash flow and borrowing position now, and if appropriate to their circumstances to be prepared to apply for these loans when they become available.<br/><br/>This is a technical Supplementary Estimate and the savings outlined will be used to fund both the World Food Programme and the SBCI agricultural cash flow support loan scheme.  I earnestly recommend this Supplementary Estimate to the committee for support.  I am happy to respond to any questions members may wish to pose.</p></speech>

I will make two points to the Minister.  "Underspend" would be the wrong word to use regarding the tuberculosis scheme, with  &euro;2.5 million saved as a result of the lower number of reactors.  I raised this matter recently with the Minister.  In the dairy sector in particular, a couple of depopulations have occurred.  By the time these farmers repopulate their herds, on foot of the changed environment in dairy markets, the price of replacement stock will be greatly increased in comparison with the price at the time of depopulation.  A herd may be fully depopulated at the end of October, when cows are at the end of the lactation year and a farmer must repopulate in March and April, when dairy cow prices are at a premium.  People in this position would probably see a differential of between 30% or 35% when it comes to repopulation.  This would amount to &euro;400 or &euro;500 per cow and when a herd has been fully depopulated, it would create financial hardship.</p> <p>  When a person's herd is fully depopulated and is out for a period of four to six months, for example, and there is a market discrepancy when animals are being bought, there should be some mechanism for compensating that farmer.  When the scheme was introduced, the principle was that if, for example, 120 cows were lost, the farmer would be able to replace them like for like when restrictions were lifted.  At the back end of this year, dairy cow prices were at a low ebb, valuations were done and farmers whose herds have been depopulated received a certain price.  I am not saying that the valuations were wrong but when the farmers involved seek to repopulate their herds in March, they will be seriously out of pocket.  As there is an underspend, could the issue of restocking farmers' herds be considered?  Could there be some equalisation in respect of the valuations received by these farmers?</p> <p>  We all know the hardship endured by grain farmers as a result of the 2016 harvest.  Before this meeting, I met a group of dairy farmers with a proposal seeking &euro;3 million in compensation for the hardship endured due to the loss of crops and straw.  To underline the scarcity of straw in this country, prices have doubled in the past month.  Farmers are worst hit only in December but by the time March comes around, straw will be as scarce as a hen's teeth.  We have spare money and although the World Food Programme project for which it is earmarked is worthy of investment, could some of those funds be diverted to these farmers?  As a result of the exceptional circumstances with the weather, they only salvaged part of their crops and lost all their straw.  They have suffered significant losses.  They are looking for &euro;3 million for 400 farmers, which works out at &euro;7,500 per farmer.  It would do something to ease their cash flow crisis.  We have the money so should we not look at allocating some of it in the way I am suggesting?  We have done it before for horticulture farmers and it was done when there was wind damage to forestry as well.  With the Russian export ban, the European Union put much money into eastern Europe.  The &euro;20 million is spare in the budget so could &euro;3 million be allocated to grain farmers.  It is not much when we consider the hardship they have suffered.</p></speech>

Not alone have farmers lost all their crops but the Minister knows that since approximately 2012, more than 100,000 acres has been lost from the grain sector.  That trend is likely to continue in view of what happened in the past year, with negative margins prevailing.  Everybody has lost &euro;150 to &euro;200 per hectare or even more if we add in the loss of straw, as described by Deputy Cahill.  As everyone lost straw, there will be much demand for the limited straw that is available, meaning the prices will increase.  Some farmers lost up to 50% of their yield and some individuals even lost more.  The farmers in the western seaboard counties of Mayo, Galway, Kerry, Donegal, Longford, Roscommon and Cork were affected.  In my county, approximately 14 or 15 farmers were fairly significantly impeded.</p> <p>  I know that these farmers are seeking a particular direct aid scheme and the Minister will probably look to work through the scheme he has devised for the SBCI.  The loans with rates of less than 3% applying would be a huge help when it comes to merchant credit and short-term financial facilities.  It is of some use but it is far down the line.  The applications for the cash flow support loan scheme must be evaluated and I hope the process will not be slow.  It should not be as there are only four or five applications.  I worry about the bureaucracy as people might not be happy with the i's being dotted and the t's crossed; they go back to rerun the show in a circular fashion.  This better be done by January.  The Minister gave some very eloquent presentations, which I acknowledge.  I know the mushroom industry will be covered by the SBCI scheme but it is a case of live horse, get grass.  The mushroom industry has been under pressure for the past three months.  Most mushroom farmers want to get over the hump now and know if they do, they will survive to be competitive in future.</p><p>Brexit will not last forever, notwithstanding that my original view was that it would take five years.  That might now be a conservative view, which highlights the uncertainty.  The Minister's proposal regarding the SBCI is a good idea.  Some of this money will create further capacity.  Am I correct that he will use it in that regard?  If it only took &euro;3 million to help grain farmers, they would be in big trouble otherwise.  I appeal to the Minister to do something with greater immediacy than what is planned with the SBCI income cash support.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.160" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2016120600002#D00200"><p>I thank the Deputies for their questions.  With regard to Deputy Cahill's question about the TB compensation scheme, the savings will be &euro;1.5 million, not &euro;2.5 million.  Those savings are as a consequence of the fact that we made provision on the basis of trends and expectations and, fortunately, the incidence of the disease reduced from 3.25% of herds to 3.18%.  Though the number of herds is down, there was a slight increase in the overall number of TB reactors.  The provision made for drawdown has not been reached and that is something to celebrate.  The scheme is working well.</p><p>The Deputy asked about individual farmers and the compensation scheme.  I understand his point and we have discussed it both formally and informally, but the problem is that the scheme was designed in consultation with the farming organisations and modifications to it only took place recently.  I cannot vary the terms of the scheme for an individual holding but I take the Deputy's point.  It depends on timing.  We face into a spring in which the indications are milk prices will increase and, as a consequence, the price of spring heifers dairy cows will increase.  I accept that will make it more costly for somebody who has been depopulated to re-enter the market.  The scheme was devised in consultation with the farming organisations but it comes up for review.  It is not written on tablets of stone but, unfortunately, the most recent modifications were only signed off in the early days of my tenure.  It will be up for review again and, by that stage, the individual whose circumstances the Deputy has raised will have moved on but my Department keeps the scheme under constant review and the issue will be raised in consultations with the farming organisations.</p><p>Both Deputies raised the issue of grain farmers.  I am acutely conscious of this because I have met them in my own constituency.  I have met farm organisations representatives also in counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim and I understand the points they have made.  I concur with Deputy Penrose regarding the scarcity of straw.  There is little feed value in any straw as a consequence of the weather.  There was a perfect storm in many respects in the endeavours to get in the harvest.  When this issue was raging in the autumn, I undertook post-harvest to convene a stakeholders meeting.  All the relevant bodies were represented, including the farm organisations and the millers.  One of the interesting issues raised by the farmers and the merchants, in particular, was access to affordable finance.  One of the startling observations made by a miller was that 80% of spring barley is sold on merchant credit, which is one of the most expensive forms of credit that farmers use.  This issue was raised by every farm organisation in the context of the recent budget.  We faced a scenario where we had &euro;11.1 million in funding coming from Europe as a result of the July package, which was available for livestock both in the dairy and beef sectors.  We felt that if we spread that between 100,000 livestock farmers, it would make no meaningful or significant contribution to the difficulties they faced.</p><p>Given the common thread among all organisations, including those representing tillage farmers, was access to affordable finance, we examined how we could provide matching funds.  We put more than matching funds by providing &euro;14 million to extend the availability of the loan scheme not just to livestock farmers, but to the tillage sector as well.  The product with a &euro;150,000 maximum loan, low interest rate and other terms is not available anywhere else and that is well documented.  We extended the scheme under <i>de minimis</i>state aid rules to the tillage sector because there is a framework under which we are permitted to put assistance from the Exchequer into a particular sector.  We availed of the maximum liberty available to extend the scheme.  Where somebody avails of the maximum loan, that is the equivalent over three years of the &euro;15,000 threshold available under state aid rules.  That is not the solution for everybody who faces this difficulty but it will help some farmers in making decisions.  I appreciate time has moved on and most of them have made decisions to plan for winter barley or spring barley.  The scheme will make that more affordable.</p><p>There are other significant issues in the industry, not least the fact that 50% of the crop is grown on rented land, which is a major cost and which is questionable in the context of the viability of these enterprises.  Farmers are paying top dollar and that land is being chased by other enterprises, particularly grass and dairy farmers.  Individual farmers have to weigh up the affordability issue.  The grain sector is critical.  I would hate to see people exiting the sector in droves because the herd is expanding, particularly in the dairy sector, which will bring its own demand for ruminant feed.  However, the sector has to be based on a solid economic rationale.  One of the many issues is access to affordable finance and we have done something that is allowed under state aid rules.  I have extended the knowledge transfer programme, which was only available to the beef and dairy sectors previously, to the tillage sector.  I will announce in January the detail of the tillage TAMS.  I am open to keeping this issue under observation but limited resources are available and, equally, there is a legal framework which I cannot breach in respect of state aid rules.  I have exercised some of the discretion we have in that regard through the SBCI lending scheme.</p><p>In response to Deputy Penrose, Mr. Nick Ashmore attended a recent meeting of the Beef Forum where he confirmed that the January date for the scheme is still on target.  The call for partners, including the pillar banks which have responded, went out recently to roll out the scheme.  As the Deputy said, it will be made available to the mushroom sector.</p><p>This will help the mushroom sector, but Brexit produces very difficult circumstances.  Some businesses have gone to the wall already.  In the budget, we also increased the funding available under the capital grants scheme run by my Department for the mushroom sector and we fund the mushroom producer organisations.</p><p> I think that addresses some of the questions raised.</p></speech>

I apologise for the delay in my arrival.  I have a few points to raise.  I am conscious that I missed the Minister's opening statement, but regarding his identification of the &euro;33 million he is reallocating, the second largest reallocation seems to relate to Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Proportionally, the amount involved is quite large in terms of Bord Iascaigh Mhara's budget, at 21%, and he is now proposing to reallocate it by means of the Supplementary Estimate.  I ask him to elaborate on the 21% reduction in the figure for Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  A fleet decommissioning  that is due to take place has not yet started but it seems to form part of the figure.  Is that the entirety of it?  If not, what else is involved?</p> <p>  My colleagues raised with the Minister the issue of the tillage sector and the pressure under which it finds itself, but it is particularly important to re-emphasise this.  I have raised the matter in the D&aacute;il with the Minister and the Taoiseach.  Unfortunately, at Question Time last week, the Minister indicated very definitively that there will be no crisis fund for the tillage farmers.  It is very much a minority of tillage farmers, but many among that minority have lost a significant proportion of their crop and are in a very difficult financial position as a result, particularly on the back of the past three years when the sector was not profitable.  This is a real issue.  The Minister indicated that those affected will be eligible for the SBCI loan fund.  However, this simply does not meet the needs of that identified minority of tillage farmers.  The Minister and the Government need to reconsider this matter and find funding which can be used to support those who are in dire need and experiencing cash flow pressures.  The committee will meet representatives of the tillage sector later but this issue is of the utmost importance now.</p> <p>  Regarding the updated Estimates published last week, at that stage the Department was &euro;222 million behind profile for the year.  A significant proportion, &euro;177 million, of that was recurrent and &euro;45 million was capital.  A significant part of this seems to be due to the fact that GLAS payments have not been processed.  Can the Minister elaborate on this?  I received a number of calls from constituents who have not got their GLAS payments and who have been informed-----</p></speech>

Regarding a potential additional underspend, can the Minister indicate whether there will be - or, at this stage, whether his Department envisages there to be - an underspend at the end of the year in respect of his Department's Vote?  If so, what will be the amount involved?  As already indicated, last week the amount stood at &euro;222 million.  What does the Minister project the figure might be at this point?  How much of this is due to the processing of payments being delayed as a result of IT or administrative difficulties within the Department?</p> <p>  Regarding the SBCI fund in respect of which the Minister has submitted this Supplementary Estimate today, can he elaborate further on exactly how this will work in terms of the State and EU allocations?  To what purpose exactly will the &euro;24 million be put?  Will it be loaned directly to farmers or is it there to insure the risk for the banks?  If the latter is the case, does the Minister expect that a significant proportion of the &euro;24 million may not be spent but will simply be there as insurance and that it may be recirculated at a later date for further use?  Exactly what is the structure of this and how will it work?</p></speech>

I would have thought that extra funding would be required for research and training in light of Brexit and at a time when we are seeking to access more and more markets and when increasing numbers of students want to enter third-level education?  Does the reduction relate to a different fund or is it to this fund?</p></speech>

Regarding his persistent line of prosecution that we are underspending on the rural development programme, the reality is that we are behind profile on it.  As a result of the fact that GLAS payments are made in December, we will have our spending under GLAS on target by the end of the month.  All those awaiting GLAS payments know that they are issued in December.</p><p>Regarding the crisis fund, I appreciate the points the Deputy raises in respect of the tillage sector.  As I said earlier, I met the chairman of Donegal IFA while on a visit to the county and I understand the issues raised.  However, even if I had an open amount of resources, I am legally constrained by state-aid rules in the context of what I can do.  Given that access to affordable finance was a common thread in the views expressed at the stakeholders' forum and in all the pre-budget submissions we received from farmers' organisations and others, we thought it a reasonable proposition to use the <i>de minimis</i>provision that exists under state-aid rules to leverage the &euro;150 million loan fund at much more affordable interest rates than previously.  We have used the latitude we have under state-aid rules, that is, the <i>de minimis</i>provision.  If somebody draws down the maximum SBCI loan over a three-year period - I appreciate that not everybody will do so - he or she will avail of the maximum <i>de minimis</i>provisions available from the EU.</p><p>Deputy McConalogue also made the point that the &euro;7.5 million relating to Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, seems to be the largest savings figure.  He referenced the decommissioning scheme.  The &euro;7.5 million is significant to BIM and does relate to decommissioning.  There is a saving of approximately &euro;500,000 in pay in BIM.  Overall, however, the largest headline saving in my Department, interestingly, is on the administrative side, at &euro;13.5 million, on the basis of intended recruitment of additional staff because of the embargo for several years and voluntary redundancies on top of that.  We have a number of emerging gaps in the skill set required in the Department.  Due to the fact that - within a controlled framework - some latitude was granted to State agencies and Departments to hire additional staff last year, the Public Appointments Service was busier than usual.  Therefore, anticipated recruitment of additional staff in 2016 did not take place and there is a saving of about &euro;13.5 million as a result.</p><p>Regarding the SBCI and the purpose of the &euro;25 million, which consists of &euro;14 million in Exchequer and &euro;11 million in EU funding, it has gone into leveraging the fund.  There is approximately &euro;100 million in European investment funding and in the region of &euro;50 million in SBCI funding.</p><p>The sum of &euro;25 million is in the context of a subsidy to the interest rate that farmers will pay and a guarantee against first losses.  The provision makes the fund more affordable for anyone who avails of it.  The purpose of the &euro;25 million is to make sure that the product is more affordable.</p><p> The reason for the scheme is evident when one considers the Q1 Central Bank report of 2016 as it made reference to the cost of finance in Ireland relative to other EU member states.  The report clearly shows that other countries had access to more affordable finance.  If I recall the detail correctly, Austria led the way with products available at 2.2% and Ireland had a significantly higher rate.  The provision of &euro;25 million does something to address the matter.  I hope, as a consequence, it will force more competition in the market not just from the pillar banks but from other players to make finance more affordable for farmers.  </p><p> Recently Deputy Cahill and I attended a meeting in Limerick with the ICMSA.  On that occasion a farmer said that the KBC Bank was offering a product at the same interest rate.  I do not know whether he or she compared similar products.  If it is the case then the step is welcome.  </p><p> I ask the Chairman to repeat his question.</p></speech>

Harvest 2020 included a target of 100 specialist dairy farm managers per year to graduate from a Teagasc scheme but only 25 entrants per year apply for the scheme.  To elaborate on a point made by the Chairman, surely we should increase the training fund rather than have an underspend.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned that State aid rules prevent him from giving a specialist allocation to grain farmers following the grain crisis.  How did we get over the same problem for the horticultural group?  When forestry was savaged by high winds a significant payment per hectacre was given to the owners of the forestry.  The EU provided &euro;450 million to farmers in eastern Europe when the ban on exports to Russia was introduced.  How were we able to get around the State rules for the horticultural and forestry sectors but cannot circumvent the rules now?</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to clarify whether there will be an underspend in his Department's projections come 31 December in terms of budget 2016.  We have debated the rural development programme a number of times, particularly the overall envelope for the seven year cap for GLAS.</p><p>I wish to specifically refer to the Department's 2016 budget.  The Minister has stated that the current underspend will be reallocated into the Supplementary Estimate.  Aside from that.  Does he expect all funds to be spent by the end of 2016?  Do the Department's figures show an underspend at this point? </p><p>In respect of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, funding and the &euro;24 million that Europe and this Supplementary Estimate is putting towards the &euro;150 million loan fund, the Minister has indicated that the &euro;24 million of EU and domestic funding will go towards two aspects.  First, interest rate amelioration or funding part of the reduced interest rate that farmers can avail of and, second, the funding will ensure against first loss.  I ask the Minister to flesh out how these initiatives will work.  What proportion of the &euro;24 million has been dedicated towards reducing the interest rate?  Will the banks receive payment from the &euro;24 million to provide a lower interest rate?  I ask the Minister to explain the matter and the insurance part.</p><p>I have another question on the &euro;24 million.  Once the loan fund is finished and runs its course - and if there are no significant losses to be borne by the State or banks do not have to be recompensed due to no guarantee being required from individual lenders to the banks, if there are not sufficient losses to be covered - will a good proportion of the &euro;24 million be returned to the State for further use?  If so, will it fund further financial instruments afterwards?  </p><p>I support the point made by Deputy Cahill about the <i>de minimis</i>rule.  The Minister has given the impression that tillage farmers and farming organisations did not ask for credit or a crisis fund.  He took the main theme to be that they wanted loans.  I got a different reaction from the farming organisations.  I remember that they asked for a crisis fund when the crisis took hold.  The farming organisations quite clearly called for a crisis fund.  I ask the Minister to clarify the matter.  </p><p>As much as &euro;20 million of the Supplementary Estimate will go towards the UN World Food Programme that is not due until next year.  Does that mean that the &euro;20 million the Minister planned to spend on WFP next year will be available in the 2017 budget for other purposes?  Is the money in addition to what will be spent next year?  </p></speech>

We are not talking about savings in the Teagasc budget in terms of the Supplementary Estimate.  The savings on the research side do not have anything to do with Teagasc.  They are calls that the Department makes for funding it has available for various research projects.  Once it makes an allocation or contract to the successful bidder for the funding the drawdown is then in the hands of the successful applicant, subject to certain terms and conditions.  As I have identified here, the successful applicants have not triggered the drawdown yet but the allocations have been made.  The funding has been made available under what is known as the Food Institutional Research Measure, FIRM, and the Research Stimulus Fund, RSF, allocations.  They are not savings in the Teagasc budget.</p><p>On the issue of circumventing State aid rules, if it is an EU initiative as it would have been in other schemes then State aid rules do not apply.  The Commission has made allocations previously.  In terms of the SBCI fund we have invested &euro;14 million of Exchequer funding and availed of the latitude available under the <i>de minimis</i>rules to include a sector that was not included in the July package when the Commission made &euro;11 million available to the livestock sector.</p><p>I can quote Deputy McConalogue chapter and verse as proof that all of the farming organisations raised the issue of affordable finance.

It has been suggested we are not supporting a French initiative in this area for some reason, but that is not the case.  There is no substance or truth in that suggestion.  A specific provision of &euro;11.1 million has been made for the livestock sector within the &euro;150 million loan scheme fund to be administered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.

What we are reallocating is current expenditure in 2016.  As we have flagged previously, there will be an underspend in other areas of capital budgets such as TAMS.  We issued TAMS approvals and farmers applied in good faith.  This has been a particularly difficult year for those involved in some of the schemes, including on the dairy side and in the livestock sector.  The profile of claims for grant approval coming through suggests much of the work has not been done in 2016 for prudent financial reasons.  Obviously, these entitlements will be honoured in 2017.  For example, there are some savings on the Haulbowline remediation project, a legacy issue for the Government that landed in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The funding provided for Cork County Council for the project from the Department's capital allocation has not been drawn down.  The expected drawdown has not happened in some other areas of the capital funding scheme, including TAMS.  The complete profile on the capital side will not be apparent until the end of the year, but we will make it available when we have it.</p></speech>

It could not have anticipated it.  In 2015 there were big yields but low margins in the tillage sector.  That covered a multitude.  However, there has been a total collapse in 2016, particularly on the western seaboard, from Deputy Charlie McConalogue's county down.  It has even stretched to County Longford and across the midlands.  Surely it is not beyond the Department to make a particular case to the European Commission.  The case that needs to be made is that this problem requires an input and the Commission should play a role in that regard.  The impact of weather events on our potential means that they rank among the extraordinary <i>force majeure</i>events.  If farmers in the sector have lost on average &euro;25,000 per annum, or &euro;100,000 in the past four years or so, where is this going to go?  Will there be a grain sector?  This will have huge knock-on effects on other areas also.  I refer not only to the cattle, beef, sheep and milk industries but also to those involved in malting, etc.  Can we not claim exceptional circumstances in this context?  I understand the Minister's point about working capital.  Certainly, a rate of 2.95% is an awful lot better than what has been available.  It is a little over one third of what was being charged by some of the commercial banks for a while.  We had better be careful to acknowledge that it is helpful.  Can the Minister not stretch it?  I made a similar suggestion when I was looking for something different for the mushroom industry.  Like Deputy Charlie McConalogue, I understood the farming organisations were looking for a particular crisis fund of up to &euro;15,000 per farmer that could be distributed.  Perhaps I was wrong in that understanding.  Perhaps they have two ways of submitting things.  I might have been wrong in how I interpreted the matter.</p></speech>

To be fair, all of them have raised with me the specific issue in the tillage sector.  Unfortunately, I am constrained on two fronts.  First, I do not have an endless amount of resources because I used what scope I had to invest in the loan fund.  Second, I am legally constrained by the <i>de minimis</i>rules in the aid I can provide.  Although the tillage sector is important in the context of our agricultural activity, we are a relatively small player at EU level.  There has not been a clamour from the major grain growing states, particularly France, Poland, Hungary and Romania, for a rescue package.  If that happens, we will certainly hitch our wagon to that momentum.  There is no evidence, however, that a realistic campaign by the major grain growing countries for a compensation package is under way.  I appreciate that there has been a very difficult global tillage scenario for a number of years.  The bumper harvests that have been accompanied by downward pressures on prices are having a spillover effect.</p></speech>

I would also like him to clarify specifically that no direct payments to the banks to cover the cost of the reduced interest rate will be made from the &euro;24 million being provided for the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland fund.  In addition, will he clarify clearly the restraints imposed on the tillage sector by the <i>de minimis </i>rules?  How much leeway is available to the sector?  Is it available to the sector as a whole?  Are there limits to the support that can be given to each individual tillage farmer?  I understand the Minister's point about resources, but I remind him that &euro;20 million which was due to be paid to the World Food Programme next year is now to be paid this year.  My guess is that this &euro;20 million will not have to come out of next year's budget.  I suggest it could potentially have been used this year to support the tillage sector.  Will the Minister crystallise exactly what the <i>de minimis</i>rule restraints are in this regard?  Why is flexibility not being shown on a crisis fund specifically dedicated towards farmers who have lost crops?</p><p>Why could the Minister not have used some of the &euro;20 million this year to support those farmers who were in an awful financial way as a result of the year they had?</p></speech>

As a general rule, there is a prohibition in Europe on a state bailing out any particular sector or giving it an advantage relative to its other competitors across the EU.  Whether it is dairy, beef or tillage, we could not, even if we had the resources, give a specific capital injection or assistance because it would be deemed illegal under current EU trading regulations.  That is the general rule.  We cannot offer that state aid.  There is an exception to that in certain circumstances, referred to as &quot;<i>de minimus</i>&quot; provisions whereby one can provide a certain amount of it.  Under the SBCI loan scheme, a farmer drawing the maximum loan would reach the <i>de minimus</i>threshold of assistance the State can give over a three-year period.</p></speech>

Therefore, under <i>de minimus</i>rules, the Minister would not be prevented from using some of the underspend in this year's current budget to provide a crisis fund to the tillage sector.</p></speech>

The same farmer just would not be able to avail of it twice.  A farmer in crisis because he or she lost the crop who avails of the crisis fund would therefore be debarred from availing of the loan fund.  Just to be clear, my view from what we have just teased out is that there is nothing under the <i>de minimus</i>rules which prevents the Minister from providing a crisis fund to the tillage sector.  The only condition for anyone who avails of such a crisis fund is that he or she would not also be able to avail of the loan fund.</p></speech>

In terms of the limited resources we have, we have put some &euro;14 million into the loan fund.  I based it on the basis that this was one of the asks.  I appreciate that there were a whole host of things, but I do not have an endless supply of funds, so I availed of what was there.  I have engaged with the farm organisations and they have asked post the budget for something to be done on the tillage side.  We have specifically made provision that some of them will avail of in the context of the SBCI loan fund.  They have also asked, to be fair, on the beef side for &euro;200 per suckler cow, which is a &euro;200 million bailout.  There is no shortage of asks.  There is an ask for a further bailout on the horticulture side.  There are limits on the <i>de minimus</i>aid we can provide and we took the decision to go down the loan fund route.</p></speech>

It is an honour to have been invited to appear before this committee.  I consider this an ideal moment to be here because, as members know, a few weeks ago on 16 November the Commission adopted the autumn package that launches the economic policy co-ordination cycle for 2017.  In addition, only a few days previous to that, on 9 November, the Commission released the autumn forecast.  It is, therefore, a good occasion to discuss issues related with the main policy messages of the Commission to the EU and the euro area, as aggregate entities, and especially for Ireland.  I have learned that the recent reform of the budgetary process in Ireland gives the Parliament a more prominent role in the formation and scrutiny of budgetary proposals.  This is an important development which will enhance transparency and ownership of the fiscal framework in Ireland.  It also gives more sense to my presence before the committee to discuss a broad range of issues linked to economic policies in the euro area and Ireland, including budgetary policies.</p> <p>  I will start by briefly introducing the autumn package where the Commission presents, every year, the economic and social priorities for the European Union in the year ahead.  The package starts the 2017 cycle of economic governance, the European semester, and assesses the euro area member states' draft budgetary plans for 2017.  The package builds on the Commission's 2016 autumn forecast that was released on 9 November.  The core document, where the Commission's sets those priorities, is the annual growth survey.  This year, the Commission calls on member states to redouble their efforts along the virtuous triangle of economic policy; re-launching investment, pursuing structural reforms and ensuring responsible fiscal policies.</p><p>Emphasis is placed on the need to stimulate more inclusive growth and to strengthen competitiveness, innovation and productivity.</p><p> The annual growth survey signals that Europe is experiencing a fragile but relatively resilient and job-intensive recovery.  Its GDP is now higher than before the crisis.  Unemployment is decreasing and investment is growing again.  However, there is no room for complacency.  Some of the tailwinds that have supported the recovery so far are fading.  The legacies of the crisis, notably the social impact, through high unemployment as well as high levels of public and private debt, and the share of non-performing loans, are still far reaching.</p><p> Similar to last year, the policy guidance in the annual growth survey is accompanied by the recommendations on economic policy of the euro area, which are also part of the autumn package.  The fiscal part of the recommendations reflect the main conclusions of a new communication on the euro area's fiscal stance.</p><p> I wish to say a few words on the communication.  The communication starts by recognising that, albeit resilient, the economic recovery is weak and inflation remains well below the 2% target.  In that context, the Commission is calling for a moderately expansionary fiscal stance for the euro area.  It is what the document calls a positive fiscal stance.  The positive fiscal stance refers to both the supportive, that is, expansionary, direction that fiscal policy should take overall and to the quality - I put the emphasis on that - of the composition of the adjustment in terms of repartition of efforts across countries and of the types of expenditure or tax cuts, or both, behind it.  The findings of this communication are reflected in the fiscal aspects of the recommendations on the economic policy of the euro area that also refer to productivity, labour markets, banking union and they also depend on economic and monetary union.</p><p> Another document which is part of the package is the alert mechanism report, AMR, which is also an integral tool of the European semester, which aims to prevent or address macroeconomic imbalances.  The goal is to promote the smooth functioning of the economies of the member states and to prompt the right policy responses within the so-called macroeconomic imbalances procedure.  Based on the analysis in the AMR, the Commission has concluded that in this European semester cycle, 13 countries, including Ireland, will be covered by an in-depth review because imbalances were identified in the analysis presented in the report on the basis of the agreed scoreboard.</p><p> In the previous European semester cycle, imbalances were identified for Ireland in the financial sector, private and public sector debt, and high external liabilities.  The current alert mechanism report highlights similar issues.  Therefore, the Commission considers it would be useful to examine further the persistence of imbalances or their unwinding.  The Commission will present the conclusions of the in-depth reviews as part of its annual country reports in early 2017.</p><p> The analysis and opinion contained in the autumn package are based on the main findings of the Commission's 2016 autumn forecast.  I would summarise the main messages for Ireland as following.  Irish GDP growth surged in 2015, mainly driven by the operations of some multinationals, with little impact on the domestic economy, but underlying economic activity also grew strongly by 4% to 5%.  Domestic demand is projected to expand at robust rates, although risks have increased, also due to the UK referendum.  Employment growth and the continued recovery of wages are forecast to support private consumption over the forecast horizon.  The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 7.6 % in 2018, thanks to continued job creation and despite sizeable population growth.  The contribution of net exports to GDP growth is forecast to be negative this year but to recover in line with global trade over the forecast horizon.  The structural deficit is expected to remain broadly stable in 2016 and to improve gradually by 2018.  The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline to 71.9 % in 2018, contingent on robust GDP growth and primary budget surpluses of more than 1.5 % of GDP per year in 2016 and 2017.</p><p> If I can have another minute, I wish to say a few words on the Commission's opinion on the draft budgetary plan of Ireland, which is currently under the preventative arm and subject to the transitional debt rule.  The Commission has concluded that the budgetary plans for Ireland are broadly compliant with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact, SGP.</p><p> It should be borne in mind that the Commission recalls that the Government's decision to use a large part of volatile, and therefore still uncertain, corporate tax intakes to allocate additional expenditure in 2016 is not in line with Council recommendations of July, in the context of the European semester, which ask Ireland to use windfall gains from better than expected economic and financial conditions to accelerate the deficit and debt reduction.</p><p> After putting on the table this large variety of issues in terms of Ireland and the EU, I will stop here and am ready for a fruitful discussion.  I thank the committee for its invitation and for the attention of members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.222" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1335" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016120600002#C00200"><p>I have a number of questions.  I welcome the delegation from the Commission.  However, I find a contradiction at the heart of the presentation.  Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay spoke of the need to have a moderately expansionary fiscal stance and he said the Commission wants this to happen, yet when we introduced a budget that is expansionary, it was criticised because we did not put the gains we have made into debt reduction.  We were not allowed to have any fiscal expansion.</p> <p>  Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay spoke about the social impact of the crisis and many of the expenditure aspects of the budget are directed towards addressing that impact.  The Commission invited the authorities to take necessary measures to ensure compliance with the SGP.  Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay also spoke about the high level of debt, yet he ignored the role the Commission had as a member of the troika in setting that debt by not giving us any leeway around bondholders and bank debt in particular.  Our hands were tied in terms of expansionary fiscal measures that the Commission otherwise called for.  Could he address the contradiction?</p> <p>  The presentation made by Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay is very like the budget presented by the Government in that it is a Brexit-free zone.</p><p>He spoke about positive tail winds, but the decision by Britain to exit the European Union is a gale on our doorstep.  What impact does Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay believe this will have in 2017 and what short-term impact does he believe it will have on our figures?  Is the Commission willing to assist us in dealing with this impact, given that we are the only country on the front line of this major happening?</p><p> In September, the President of the Commission, Mr. Juncker, spoke about the need for capital expansion and the need to be flexible about the rules on capital expenditure.  We have major capital deficits in this country, which will be addressed during a capital review in 2017.  Will Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay put meat on the President's proposals on relaxing the rules for capital expenditure in particular?</p></speech>

I will try to address the so-called contradiction.  I remind the Deputy the Commission communication refers to the fiscal policy stance in the euro area.  The Commission began by analysing the economic cycle in the euro area.  It sees aggregate growth in the euro area as resilient but still low.  It also sees that inflation clearly remains below 2% and that monetary policy in the euro area has already reached the zero lower bound.  Nominal interest rates are zero, which means there is not much room for manoeuvre in monetary policy.</p> <p>  At the same time, the Commission sees aggregate domestic demand in the euro area as still weak.  On this basis, the Commission considers the fiscal policy stance in the euro area should be positive, which means in those member states with room for expansion in fiscal policy it should be expansionary and positive.  In considering the fiscal policy stance of other member states, the Commission also considers the composition of the adjustment, which is the distribution of the adjustment in various countries, so that countries with fiscal policy space which have reached the medium-term objective and have low levels of debt have room to extend fiscal policy, but countries which have not yet achieved the medium-term objective and have high levels of debt, and countries still in excessive deficit, should be broadly compliant.  This is the case for Ireland.  Countries in the corrective arm should continue to consolidate.  Where the level of deficit in public finances remains unaffected, the Commission advocates for less extortionate taxes, broadening tax bases and increasing the relative weight of investment.  This is what the Commission communication states.</p> <p>  With regard to Ireland, the Commission considers Ireland's budgetary plans are broadly compliant.  There are some risks, as the expenditure benchmark may not be fully in line with our recommendations, but Ireland is broadly compliant.  We must take into account the growth rates for Ireland and the euro area are very different.  For Ireland, we project growth at 3.6% a year and 3.5% the year after.  For the euro area, the projection is still 1.5%.  With regard to the cyclical position of the country, without entering into a discussion on calculating the output gap, there is consensus the output gap for Ireland is already positive.  This means there are risks in principle of over hitting it, which means Ireland does not need to put in place expansionary fiscal policies.  In my view, there is no contradiction because we state what the fiscal policy stance of the euro area should be, but we also differentiate between the respective cyclical positions of countries.  In this sense, I would not say there are contradictions.</p> <p>  With regard to flexibility, the Commission published a communication in January 2015, and the Council adopted a commonly agreed position on flexibility and clarified the rules under which there could be some flexibility in investment which is equivalent to structural reform.  We use the structural reform clause of the Stability and Growth Pact to allow for temporary deviations from the adjustments to the medium-term objective to invest more or enhance investment.  The Council stated this clause would apply only to countries with negative growth or a very large negative output gap.  These are the conditions and the Council allows for some deviation.  I can go through the details if the committee wishes, but I would not like to cover all of the issues in this reply.</p> <p>  With regard to what we predict for next year, the entire euro area has been affected by the tail winds.  Of course next year the tail winds may disappear, and therefore we must prepare our economies to be more resilient and ready to adjust to the new conditions.  We can deal with other issues later.</p></speech>

All we know is there was a referendum in which the people of the UK voted to leave the EU.  We also know that after the referendum there was a serious depreciation of the pound.  There was also quite a strong initial temporary impact on the stock markets but they recovered.</p><p>The only stocks on which this had a more permanent impact were those in the banking sector, and that was not only in this country but also in the UK.  It impacted on almost every type of bank almost everywhere in Italy because it was a factor from the beginning of the year.  Apart from that, the stock markets have recovered completely and the impact on risk premium, in particular for this country, was almost non-existent.  What has remained after the referendum is a weaker pound.</p><p> Brexit is another process.  We do not know the structure of the relationships that will exist between the UK and the EU after Britain exits the negotiations because the negotiations have not started.  There are no negotiating positions until Article 50 is activated, which lies only in the hands of the UK Government or authorities.  I do not know if that is something that has to be decided internally in the context of the UK authorities.  It is up to the UK to activate Article 50, and until it is activated, the UK is an EU member state and nothing changes except that we know now that the pound is weaker.  We know that perhaps there will be some impact in terms of confidence in the currency, which will affect mainly investment in the UK, but we have incorporated that in forecasts concerning  the UK.  There are some issues linked mainly to the weaker pound that could favour exports from the UK to the rest of the euro area and make exports from the euro area to the UK more expensive.  Such effects are not yet visible but we have incorporated them in the autumn forecast.  I would like to make clear that we have not incorporated any impact of Brexit simply because we do not know when the Article 50 will be activated.  We do not know how long the negotiations will last.  We know they will have to conclude within two years at most following the activation of Article 50.  We do not know what the structure of the relationships between the UK and the rest of the EU will be after Brexit.  Therefore, we do not know whether we will move to having a Norwegian model or to the World Trade Organization, WTO, rules.</p></speech>

We cannot wait for Article 50 because we export &euro;13.6 billion worth of products to the UK.  In the first six months of 2017, which we are discussing here, many contracts which were negotiated in the first six months of 2016 will be renegotiated on the basis of the new relationship with sterling.  That is impacting on our food and manufacturing industries.  Approximately 40% of our exports are to the UK market.  There are concerns about jobs, and the taxes that accrue from them are essential to our fiscal position in 2017.  Many issues will directly hit us in 2017.  What is the Commission's position on that?  What work has it done to assist or encourage the Irish Government to prepare for that better than it has?</p></speech>

We have taken into account the possible impacts of a weaker pound in our forecasts concerning Ireland.  However, there is also the strength of domestic demand in Ireland together with the fact that it depends on the UK but now its markets in the euro area as a whole and in the rest of world are more important than the UK market.  Therefore, if we have, as we set out in our forecasts, an expanding global economy in terms of global trade, Ireland will benefit.  There will be some sectoral impacts, but as a whole, we see a recovery in Irish exports compared with 2016.</p></speech>

The first one is the Structural Funds and the second one is the contribution to the European fund for strategic investment in terms of capital.  Those contributions are not out of the pack because they affect the level of expenditures but they are considered one-offs, which means they do not feature in the calculations of the structural balance.</p></speech>

He has not commented on the disaster that has happened in Italy, one of the largest member states, and the general sense that the euro is under serious threat.  We are talking as if the euro is very strong and the only weakness is sterling, but I am surprised no comment has been made about the current situation, namely, the state of matters in Italy and the general lack of confidence in the euro that is creeping in.  There does not seem to be anybody, in European terms, making any effort to improve morale in terms of enhancing confidence in our currency.  I find this quite extraordinary.</p></speech>

In explaining that the Commission is proposing an expansionary fiscal policy stance, I said the reasons for that are that growth is low, inflation has not picked up and domestic demand is weak.  Those are the reasons the Commission is proposing that those member states with high current account surpluses should provide support to improve domestic demand.  I am not saying that everything is perfect in Europe and the only weaknesses are on the side of the pound.  The Commission has clearly recognised that growth and activity in the euro area is weak.  This is the reason the Commission has adopted the communication on an expansionary fiscal stance for the euro area.</p></speech>

People in this State would have read the headlines, namely, that the Commission has done a turnaround, austerity is over and now it is all about expansion, which will affect this country.  Regarding the Commission's statement on an expansionary fiscal stance two weeks ago, will Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay confirm that it will have no impact on Ireland's stance, that we will still have the same amount of fiscal space next year, that this will be the total amount, and that the Commission's position does not allow us to go beyond that?</p></speech>

The first type is countries that have reached the medium-term objective or have overachieved the medium-term objective, implying also that their debt levels are low.  In the communication and in its proposal for a recommendation for economic policies in the euro area, the Commission recommends that these countries should use the fiscal space to support aggregate domestic demand.  For countries which have not yet reached the medium-term objective, the Commission says that these countries should be broadly compliant, which is the case for Ireland.  For the countries that are still in the corrective, which means that they still have an excessive deficit, such as France, Spain and Portugal, the Commission says that they should first reduce the excessive deficit.  That is what the Commission communication says.  There is another aspect which-----</p></speech>

That is the position of the Commission.  If the committee allows it, I would like to refer to an aspect of this communication that is perhaps even more important in the case of Ireland.  It is about the composition of the adjustment and the quality of public finances.  In those cases in which there is no need for an expansionary fiscal policy simply because the country is growing above potential, the Commission is saying that the country has to, on the one hand, reduce possible distortional effects of taxation which cast an impact on potential growth.  On the other hand, the country should enhance the composition of expenditures to make this composition more growth-friendly.  We should invest in more physical infrastructure and human knowledge capital.  That is what the Commission is also recommending for countries like Ireland in which growth is already above potential.  The idea is to increase potential but not to go for a cyclical expansion because the cycle of the cyclical position is already-----</p></speech>

We know that the budget 2017 assessment is broadly complaint in the view of the Commission.  When we look deeper into that, the Commission's view is that the country is showing indications of overheating.  However, that does not necessarily mean that the country stops spending.  What it does mean is that it needs to spend in different ways.  Instead of cyclical year-on-year increases in expenditure or tax cuts, what should happen is investment in the long term, for example, capital investment in roads, housing, health centres and hospitals.  Is that what the Commission is saying?</p></speech>

It is precisely not only about the stabilisation needs and whether the output gap is positive and at risk of overheating, but also about the consolidation need that member states have.  For instance, Ireland, given its high level of public debt, has a consolidation need.  If we look at the countries at which this recommendation was directed, Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, they are countries that, according to the Commission's assessment, have a negative output gap at the moment and no fiscal consolidation need.  We were really looking into both dimensions when we made this recommendation.  Given the high level of public debt that remains, Ireland still has a consolidation need.</p></speech>

What the Commission is basically saying is to use the expenditure available to deal with that issue, which is investing in the long term rather than tax cuts or short-term expenditure.</p></speech>

Before we move on from the type of expenditure that we should have, I am sure the Commission is looking beyond the economic data, or maybe it is not.  We have huge challenges in this State.  There has been an investment drought here both in the private and public sector for the past decade.  Our capital investment has gone from about &euro;10 billion down to &euro;4 billion.  There are serious cracks now starting to appear.  They are going to become more and more obvious and visible.  We are going to see massive congestion in our infrastructure and roads, particularly around Dublin city and elsewhere, within the next short period.  Our population is continually increasing.  While we went through a terrible period of migration, we are going to see it reverse very quickly.</p> <p>  In my view, the fiscal rules are going to be changed because they are unworkable and because we know that countries are breaking them willy-nilly, to the point that the Germans are calling for the Commission to be sacked and for the role to be given over to another agency of Europe, but we will leave that to one side.  Let us forget about budget 2017.  Budget 2018 for this country has a fiscal space of about &euro;600 million.  We have a crisis in terms of housing, health and a serious problem in infrastructure.  I appreciate the fact we have a high level of debt that has only reduced because the economy has improved.  However, the volume of debt is continually increasing.  At a time when the country can borrow at the lowest it will ever likely be able to borrow at, is it not nearly criminal that we are not investing in the long-term health of our nation by borrowing at this time, building the infrastructure, and making sure that we have houses that can house the homeless and those on waiting lists?  How does the Commission in any way rectify that or allow for it to happen at this point?</p></speech>

If debt is already high, increasing it may increase the country's vulnerability.  To address this, a government uses the idea of a rainy day fund.  It uses extraordinary revenues to reduce debt levels and vulnerability to, for example, volatility in international markets.  The situation is far from stable for some countries.  For Ireland, the impacts of risk premia in recent months have been almost zero.  Other countries, however, have been vulnerable and others can become so.  What is a stable situation can become unstable in, for example, two years.</p><p> I wish to refer to an important issue.  We must consider the revenue side.  We have to ensure an adequate composition of expenditure and a tax base that is broad enough to be stable.  The narrower our tax base, the more unstable our revenues.  Our debts and interest rates increase and our revenue base decreases.  That is not new to this or other countries.</p></speech>

My final question is on volatility in the tax base, with a particular focus on corporation tax, which Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay mentioned.  He has met Professor John McHale and our Minister, so these conversations are being had by the Commission, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, and the Department of Finance.  This is not a new issue.  We have an above average percentage of corporation tax receipts.  Ours is approximately 15% whereas the European average is approximately 10%.  There has been a major surge in recent years.  The Department and Revenue officials tell us that it is permanent.  We have a significant concentration, in that ten companies pay 40% of all corporation tax.  That figure increased from 20% just over ten years ago.</p> <p>  Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay has a bird's eye view across Europe.  Does any other country have such a concentration of taxation receipts in the hands of so few?  He, the IMF and IFAC have stated that there is a vulnerability from our corporation tax receipts.  Is that vulnerability related to their level or their concentration?  Where does our vulnerability rank?</p></speech>

To what did 2015 revision of GDP lead and by whom was it driven?  It was driven by this small number of multinationals that book a series of operations, including intangible assets, in Ireland.  The gross value added, including profits, that they booked in Ireland increased by 20% or more.  Decisions of multinationals are driven by global production factors, but these factors can change and multinationals can move.  In this case, these extraordinary revenues could be used to create a rainy day fund and reduce the debt and deficit.</p> <p>  The November budgetary data that were released yesterday drew my attention.  All revenue targets seemed to have been achieved, but mainly because of corporate taxes.  Consider VAT.  Usually, it is a more stable base, but its revenue target was underachieved.</p></speech>

I mentioned how we would make capital investment.  Given that capital investment does not commit itself each year, would it not be appropriate to use those increases in corporation tax by investing in capital?  Doing that would break the European rules, however.</p></speech>

They are relatively stable.  The projects are one-offs.  To build a bridge, one needs two or three years, but the level of public investment is not a one-off.  There is a minimum of public investment in Ireland.  It is reaching 2% of GDP again.  The total level is a permanent expenditure and is not a one-off.  Therefore, we should not use windfalls to finance public investment.</p></speech>

In Spain, for example, GDP is growing quickly, but its deficit is high and, therefore, debt is not being reduced.  This is not because of whether countries have windfalls.  There are a number of reasons.  There is a new Government in Spain and it is still reverting the situation.  It is in the process of consolidating public finances.  I would not like to refer to a specific country, but what happens depends on the extent to which the deficit trajectory is downward and the denominator is rising.</p></speech>

Surely it flies in the face of the perceived economic wisdom of years to advocate the paying down of debt when interest rates are so low that money can be acquired so cheaply by member states.  Excluding London, which will be excluded from the EU anyway shortly, Dublin is the most expensive city in the EU in which to rent a home.  When this identifiable and significant bottleneck exists in our economy, we should be in a position as a member state to prioritise it for public and private investment and there should be significantly more leeway than there is under the rules to allow us to tackle the problem.</p><p>In the case of the housing sector, the important point is to overcome all the barriers concerning supply.</p></speech>

On the one hand, the State has to find stable revenue sources which is important.  On the other, even if today the State borrows money at low interest rates, in the future when interest rates go up, the State's debt will also balloon.  The burden of the debt will depend on the future interest rates.  The higher the debt, the higher the interest payments will be in the future.  One does not borrow all the debt for, say, 20 years or 50 years.  A small fraction of the debt is at a long-term rate but the rest of the debt has to be refinanced in the short term.</p></speech>

Are the alert mechanism reports picking this up?  Will those reports include Brexit and its uncertainty?  It will affect Ireland more than other country and it should come into the imbalance scorecard.  Other states, such as Portugal, Greece and Italy, have specific circumstances which should give them more leeway in the fiscal rules.</p></speech>

On the one hand, when we talk about monetary policy and the diminishing industrial base, we are talking about two different matters.  One is about monetary policy which is about a commodity.  It is the right policy.  I would not like to comment on monetary policy because the European Central Bank is fully independent.  The other problem the Deputy is referring to is, perhaps, an issue of competitiveness.  It is to what extent productivity in certain countries is too low compared to the level of wages.  Accordingly, these countries are losing competitiveness and, in turn, are losing certain industrial activities in which labour costs are important.  This is totally different from the monetary policy stance.</p> <p>  Concerning the leeway in the current circumstances, for countries in which GDP growth is not strong, the monetary policy is most adequate for them simply because growth is low and, therefore, monetary policy is accommodated.  The problem is not with monetary policy but, for some countries, the need to enact the structural reforms which enhance productivity and, therefore, allow for high living standards.</p> <p>  There is uncertainty around Brexit.  We do not even know when Article 50 will be activated, how it will be activated and how the negotiating process will work.</p></speech>

We do not know what will happen.  I do not believe this is a question of investing more and even less a question of increasing public debt.  It is a question of being resilient and being ready for structural adjustments.  It is a question more of enhancing the structural resilience of the economy.  In certain countries where growth is low but debt is high, fiscal stimulus will not do the job.</p></speech>

The economic logic was that the economy was overheating and, therefore, one cannot buck all of the real correction and one has to overcorrect.  Due to the fact that logic was applied, we missed our target which meant a convergence margin was applied which shrank our fiscal space considerably.  The argument from all the economists this committee met was that Ireland's economy is not actually overheating.  We are at nearly 8% unemployment and there is still potential growth.  It was explained to the committee that the calculation was based on a ten-year rolling average of unemployment.  As Ireland's unemployment through the crash had been so high, if one applied a ten-year rolling average, it looks like Ireland is at full employment or, indeed, past full employment at 8%.  Clearly, it is not.  No economist would suggest Ireland's economy is overheating based on an unemployment rate of 8%.</p> <p>  Accordingly, we found ourselves heavily penalised because the accuracy of a rule which no one would defend was applied to Ireland.  Does the Commission have a view on that?  When we put it to the Irish authorities, the answer was that is the rule and we have to use the ten-year rolling average unemployment and, as such, we are deemed to be overheating.  Accordingly, we are deemed to have missed our target and the fiscal space has been contracted significantly by applying the convergence margin.  When the rules, to which we have signed up, are not lined up with reality, should the Commission still insist on applying them?</p><p>The Commission should still insist on applying them.</p><p> I will ask my questions one at a time.</p></speech>

One concerns the way in which we calculate the output graph and potential output.  This is based on a commonly agreed methodology.  There is a technical group within the EFC which is chaired by Mr. McCarthy, an Irish official.  We apply the same methodology to all of the countries in order to have an analysis of the cyclical positions which is comparable across all countries.  We use the production method and we have a way to calculate the multifactoral productivity and capital stock.  This is very complex, technically speaking but at the same time, the methodology is very transparent.  All countries can see exactly how the calculations are made.  This is the way we measure the cyclical position of the different countries.  In the case of Ireland in particular the calculations were made on the basis of the budgetary plans one year ago.  At that time, we did not know about the revision that took place concerning 2015 and the various adjustments that had to be made.  Last year we saw the output gap closing very quickly.  This year we still have very high output gaps.  In some cases, the output gaps are positive.  In the case of Ireland, the output gap will start to close in 2018 or later.</p> <p>  This methodology also allows us to calculate the structural balances, that is, the parts of developments in the balance which are not due to the cyclical evolutions, that is, due to the fact that if one grows faster, one has more taxes, less unemployment and therefore, less expenditure.  These cyclical fluctuations or impacts on the budget are netted out from our calculations of the structural balance which are made on the basis, in turn, of our calculations of the output gap and potential GDP.</p> <p>  This is one indicator that we use in order to determine to what extent the fiscal stance in the country is appropriate, taking into account the debt levels and the distance towards the medium-term objective, MTO.  We have used another indicator which is the expenditure benchmark.  This is related to the ten year average of potential growth.  We never use these two indicators in a totally mechanical way.  We make what we call a nominal assessment in order to understand better the underlying factors concerning the changes in the structural balance and the structural expenditure.  That is, the expenditures net of discretionary tax changes.  We never use this in an automatic or mechanical way.  We always look at all of these factors.  We examine the cyclical position of the economy, the distance with respect to what we have defined as the MTO which ensures that there is enough room in front of cyclical fluctuations.  We also look at expenditures net of expenditure finance through EU funds and net of cyclical expenditures, for instance, of unemployment and net of interest payments and discretionary changes in tax revenues and how these have evolved compared to potential growth - not potential growth for one year but over a number of years.  </p> <p>  Finally, this is why our assessments may change although we have to take into account that the benchmarks are frozen either in 2015 or 2016.  We even reduce the possibility of more cyclical or annual fluctuations.  I do not think that it is a question of saying that we have this indicator and then we change completely.  We have a rather stable analysis.</p></speech>

I am not sure it was answered in terms of whether any EU country is actually paying down debt.  The answer given related to ratios.  I am interested in finding out if any country is actually reducing the euro amount of debt.</p> <p>  One element of Ireland's debt is the promissory notes which arose out of a deal that was done between the Irish State, the Irish Central Bank and the European Central Bank.  Approximately &euro;20 billion remains to be paid.  At an EU level, that is a small amount but scaled up for Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay's country, Spain, it would be about &euro;170 billion or scaled up for Germany it would be about &euro;400 billion.  Given the size of Ireland's economy, a &euro;20 billion debt is very significant.  The debt was incurred at the insistence of Mr. Jean Claude Trichet, who told our Minister for Finance that a bomb would go off in Dublin if he considered burden sharing with private sector investors in private banks.  I believe it to be odious debt, legally and therefore, challengeable.  This promissory note debt is attached solely and exclusively to two dead banks, namely Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, in which the State had no stake or guarantee in place.  The State was essentially forced, in the face of a very serious threat by the then President of the ECB, Mr. Jean Claude Trichet, to pay this money down.  The State wrote an I.O.U which was then subsequently turned into these promissory notes.  Does the Commission believe, in the spirit of reducing debt and in the spirit of social fairness, that Ireland has a case to make to have this debt reduced?  Would the Commission be sympathetic to the argument that a &euro;20 billion is still a serious amount of debt that would, if it were in Germany, amount to &euro;400 billion?  It is an IOU against two dead banks that have been prosecuted for illegal behaviour and for which the State had provided no guarantees.  The State was essentially forced to bail them out by Mr. Trichet.  Is there a case to be made that the Commission would support?  Is there a case for burden sharing or - if one were a monetary purist, as many of the German authorities are - setting it at 0% for 200 years?  In the latter instance, inflation would essentially get rid of it but we would not have to tear it up.  </p></speech>

There is an apparent contradiction in the advice given.  I ask the witnesses to provide some advice in this regard.  On one hand, Mr. Martinez-Mongay states that Ireland should not expand fiscally, while, on the other, he has identified major investment shortcomings in research and development, transport, housing, general capital infrastructure and so forth, a point on which I agree with him.  How does he think Ireland should solve this problem if he recommends that we stay steady fiscally but states that we need serious investment.  What is the Commission's view on how to meet both these requirements?</p></speech>

This is one possibility.  Another possibility, as I said, is to broaden the tax bases, which will bring more future, even current, revenues.  If revenues are increased, there is the possibility to increase expenditures without affecting the deficit.</p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners believe that these revenues, these receipts, were not exceptional and that changes made in particular to the Irish corporation tax system a few years ago and improvement in the economic activity of the country would mean that these receipts would come in regardless.  We have seen evidence from the Revenue Commissioners in this regard, and they have spoken elsewhere about the matter.  I also refer to the fact that since the budget, the Exchequer return figures from last week, with which the witnesses are no doubt familiar, show that income tax receipts are almost &euro;1 billion ahead of schedule, VAT is &euro;500 million ahead of schedule and corporation tax is &euro;500 million ahead of schedule.  Does this not put paid to the witnesses' argument that this was an exceptional once-off increase in revenues?  Rather, as the year has progressed, income tax in particular has performed much more strongly.  It is not a once-off windfall tax.  Is it not, therefore, the case that the criticism of the budget is not well founded at this juncture?</p></speech>

We refer to the fact that tax revenues in some cases are growing exceptionally because part of the tax bases which are not very stable are growing exceptionally.  We must distinguish between permanent increases in taxes, cyclical increases in taxes and exceptional increases in taxes.  This implies a very detailed and rigorous analysis of the developments in the tax bases and tax rates and, therefore, the ability in this case to identify which taxes or which tax bases are more volatile.  The more volatile tax bases are associated with the production of the most volatile tax revenues.  As a result, some of them can be exceptional.  Our recommendation is, once these exceptional revenues have been identified, to allocate in order to reduce the deficit and, therefore, the debt.</p></speech>

With us are Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession and Mr. Brendan Crowley from the Department of Finance and Ms Kate Levey and Ms Yvonne Quirke from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  The committee will be briefed on the package of EU proposals for the proposed common consolidated tax base.  They are significant proposal for Ireland and all other EU member states.  Therefore, it is incumbent on the joint committee to engage on the proposals and come to a considered position.  To assist us, the officials from the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners will outline the proposals and their implications for Ireland, as they see them.  This will be followed by a briefing by Mr. Bert Zuijdendorp from the European Commission who will explain the technical aspects of the proposals.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.314" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120600002#B00300"><p>I am the principal officer in the business tax unit of the Department of Finance.  I thank the joint committee for its invitation to attend the meeting.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Brendan Crowley, who handles the Department&rsquo;s international tax files.  I am also joined by two colleagues from the Revenue Commissioners, Ms Kate Levey, principal officer in the EU branch of the international division, and Ms Yvonne Quirke, also from Revenue&rsquo;s international division.</p> <p>  On 25 October the European Commission published a package of tax measures, containing three distinct legislative proposals.  The first is an anti-tax avoidance directive to deal with hybrid mismatches.  These are situations in which a particular instrument or entity goes untaxed because of differing tax treatment in different jurisdictions.  The directive is at an advanced stage and was discussed at this morning's meeting of ECOFIN.  Ireland supports the work on this directive which mirrors the work done at OECD level.</p> <p>  The second proposal seeks to improve dispute resolution mechanisms within the European Union.  Ireland is supportive of this proposal which will be helpful in resolving disputes in a timely way under tax treaties.  This will improve certainty within the system and  be good for business and tax authorities.  My Revenue colleague, Ms Levey, will say a little more about this proposal.</p> <p>  The third element is the proposal for a common consolidated corporate tax base which I understand is the main focus of this discussion.  Strictly, the Commission has made two proposals.  The first is a proposal for a common tax base, TB, which is to be discussed in its own right as a &ldquo;double C&rdquo; TB.  The Commission has made a second proposal on consolidation &ndash; a &ldquo;treble C&rdquo; TB &ndash; which is intended to be negotiated if and when a common base is agreed to.</p> <p>  A common corporate tax base would consist of agreed rules for how a company calculated its taxable profits in each member state.  The member state would then apply its own tax rate to these profits.  It would replace the entire existing corporate tax system for large companies with a whole new set of rules for how their taxable profits would be calculated.  The proposal for a common tax base is, by necessity, very complex.  Each member state currently applies different rules to what income is taxable, which deductions are allowed, which credits are given, etc.  Ireland currently has a very wide tax base, while some member states have narrow bases.</p> <p>  The second stage of the process, consolidation, involves how profits are attributed to each country in the European Union.  A common base would give countries common rules for how to calculate profits, but it would not impact on where the profits and, therefore, taxing rights would be attributed.  Currently, member states use OECD transfer pricing rules in determining how profits are attributable to each country.  Under the transfer pricing rules, one looks at where the real value-added activities happen and attributes a proportionate share of the profits to these activities.  Consolidation would replace the transfer pricing approach within the European Union with a formula for dividing profits among member states.  The formula would be based on where sales happened, where staff were located and where a company&rsquo;s assets were.  Under this formula each corporate group&rsquo;s total EU profits would be added together and divided among countries.  The country concerned would then tax the profits attributed to it at its corporate tax rate.  Consolidation would not legally impact on a country's tax rate, but it would have a significant impact on how much tax was paid in each member state.  The impact assessment published by the Commission states the CCCTB can lift growth in the European Union by up to 1.2%, but it is silent on the impact on growth in member states individually.</p> <p>  How does the new CCCTB proposal compare to the previous one?  The CCCTB proposal has a long history.  It dates back to 2001 when the Commission first put it forward as long-term, comprehensive measure to reform corporate tax rules within the European Union.  The concept was discussed at ECOFIN and technical working group meetings from 2004 and the Commission published a detailed proposal in 2011 which would be superseded by the new proposal.  With a proposal such as the CCCTB proposal which has been debated publically and at length for many years, it is perhaps tempting for us to simply reheat our old analysis and pick up where we left off.  However, it is important that we consider it anew and with fresh eyes, given that the proposal includes some important differences when compared to its predecessor.</p> <p>  The separation of a common base from the more problematic issue of consolidation is significant.  This is a separation which Ireland has supported since its Presidency.  Most significantly, adhering to the CCCTB proposal would be mandatory for multinational companies with a group turnover of more than &euro;750 million, whereas adhering to the 2011 proposal was optional for all companies.  The new proposal allows smaller companies to opt in to the CCCTB rules or remain taxable under our existing corporate tax rules.  This would require Ireland to operate two corporate tax systems side by side, namely, the CCCTB rules for large companies and a domestic system for smaller companies that did not opt to adhere to the CCCTB rules.</p> <p>  While the consolidation aspect of the proposal is broadly similar to the 2011 version, there are a number of substantial technical differences in the design of the proposed common base.  For example, allowance for growth and investment is included in the new proposal which effectively allows a business to claim a tax deduction for equity investment in the business.  Additionally, under the common base proposal, an enhanced research and development deduction is proposed of between 25% and 100% of qualifying research and development expenditure.</p> <p>  It is also important to recognise that there have been significant changes on the corporate tax landscape since the previous proposal was published in 2011.  Since 2011 the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process has been launched and 15 comprehensive BEPS reports were published in October 2015.  The implementation of the BEPS reports is under way at national and international level, including through the EU anti-tax avoidance directive.  The business environment has also changed considerably since 2011.  The profile of taxpayers in Ireland will naturally have changed in the past five years.  This is also true of the broader international environment, in which issues such as Brexit and US tax reform are part of the backdrop to our assessment of the CCCTB proposal.</p> <p>  How is the CCCTB proposal different from our existing system?  A focus of our work since the proposal was published has been comparing the common base proposed by the Commission to the existing Irish corporate tax base.  There are some significant technical differences.  In some areas the proposed common tax base is likely to be significantly narrower than the existing Irish tax base.  For example, the CCCTB proposal allows much broader rules for deducting business expenses, for example, business client entertainment expenses which are not deductible in Ireland would be 50% deductible under the common base proposals.  There are broad exemptions for foreign income earned by Irish companies, a new tax deduction for equity investment - the allowance for growth and investment that I mentioned - while the anti-avoidance rules are less specific across all aspects of the base.</p> <p>  As I said, under the Commission's proposals there is a super deduction for research and development expenditure, which would raise a question about the continuation of our best-in-the-class research and development tax credit.  The Commission's proposals do not appear to distinguish between trading and non-trading profits, nor do they include separate tax treatment for capital gains.  This raises a question about whether we would get to keep our 25% rate for non-trading profits or our 33% capital gains tax rate.</p><p>Neither the Minister for Finance nor the Government has taken a position on CCCTB at this point.  As with any complex proposal, at this stage it is appropriate that officials would undertake a detailed analysis to understand the implications for Ireland and to inform our advice on Ireland's negotiating position.  Some preliminary work is under way in the Department and the Revenue Commissioners, but we will consider commissioning a more detailed analysis if we feel it is necessary.  Obviously, this is a Commission proposal that requires the unanimous approval of all 28 member states.  There are months of detailed technical analysis and negotiation ahead, during which the proposal is likely to change shape.  We will engage constructively with this process as things progress.</p><p> The new CCCTB represents a significant proposal that warrants careful consideration and analysis.  That work is now under way and will take some time.  We are happy to assist the committee with its deliberations and to answer its questions.</p></speech>

I will use this short opening statement to outline Revenue's role in tax policy and to highlight briefly the elements of the Commission package that focus specifically on the administration of the tax system, which is Revenue's core business.</p> <p>  In addition to our administrative role, Revenue assists the Department of Finance in the formulation of tax policy by providing advice and technical tax expertise.  Our experience of administering the tax system enables us to advise, in particular, on the practicalities of proposed measures, including avoidance and evasion risks in particular and how they might be mitigated.  As regards our international role, Revenue participates in discussions on a broad range of tax and customs matters at fora such as the EU, the OECD and the World Customs Organisation, contributing to the formulation of broader international tax policy.</p> <p>  Each of the three proposals put forward by the European Commission will be discussed in detail at the relevant Council working group at the EU.  Revenue participates in these discussions with our colleagues from the Department of Finance, providing the necessary support on technical and administrative implications.  In the event the directives are agreed, Revenue will also have an important role in transposing tax directives into domestic legislation.</p> <p>  With regard to the European Commission's package, the proposal to address hybrid mismatches and the two draft directives proposing the CCCTB are predominantly policy-related and my colleague from the Department of Finance, Mr. Hession, has outlined the main features of each.  I want to briefly highlight one particular administrative aspect of the consolidation proposal.  Under this proposal, multinational groups would deal with a single tax administration in the EU, referred to as the principal tax authority or one stop shop.  This would be based in the member state where the parent company of the group is resident for tax purposes, and if the overall parent company is outside of the EU it would be based in the member state of an alternative nominee within the group.  While the consolidation element of the proposal will not be brought forward for discussion unless or until the common base is agreed, Revenue will have a particular focus on this administrative aspect.</p> <p>  The third element of the package, the proposed directive on double taxation dispute resolution mechanisms in the EU, aims to improve dispute resolution between tax authorities in situations of double taxation of business income.  By way of background, double taxation arises when tax is imposed on the same income by two or more countries.  Double tax treaties between two countries set out the taxing rights of each jurisdiction in an effort to avoid such double taxation.  "Competent authority" is a term used in tax treaties.  It refers to the body responsible for trying to resolve any issues or disputes that arise with the applicable treaty.  In Ireland, Revenue is the competent authority.  Due to an increase in the complexity of international trade, there has been an increase in the number of disputes being referred to competent authorities in recent years.  While most disputes can be resolved by considering the relevant treaty directly, double taxation may still remain where two countries disagree on the interpretation or application of a treaty provision.</p> <p>  The OECD and the EU have focused for a number of years on improving what are referred to as the mutual agreement procedures in tax treaties, commonly referred to as MAPS, in an effort to improve dispute resolution processes.  Arbitration is one of the most powerful tools for dispute resolution in circumstances where tax authorities fail to reach agreement.  Mandatory binding arbitration gives taxpayers a guarantee that their case will be resolved within a set period.  As a result, taxpayers and their representatives are advocating the introduction of mandatory binding arbitration.  Ireland has already expressed support for the OECD BEPS initiative, which would see mandatory binding arbitration under double tax treaties introduced next year.  In addition, the existing EU arbitration convention already provides for a mandatory binding arbitration mechanism in the narrower category of transfer pricing disputes between EU member states.  The European Commission has now put forward this proposed directive to improve existing arbitration convention mechanisms in terms of access for taxpayers, coverage, timeliness and conclusiveness.</p> <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s role in negotiating disputes with other countries is important to ensure the appropriate allocation of profits between Ireland and our treaty partners.  In budget 2015, the Minister for Finance provided for increased resources for Revenue's competent authority function to ensure we are equipped to deal effectively with disputes with other tax authorities and we welcome any improvements to the international framework for addressing such issues, including the proposed directive.</p> <p>  We are happy to assist the committee in any way we can in its consideration of the corporate tax reform package presented by the Commission.</p></speech>

Mr. Hession stated that preliminary work is under way to assess the impact of the revised CCCTB proposal.  Is there an emerging view in the Department on the implications for Ireland by way of corporation tax receipts?  We expect to receive approximately &euro;7.5 billion in receipts this year.  With regard to the attractiveness of Ireland as a location for inward investment, is there an emerging view on the revised proposals from the Department?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.318" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronan Hession" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120600002#C00400"><p>Our initial view is that the base proposed is narrower than our own base.  With regard to quantifying this, we have not got as far as being able to put a figure on it.  Looking at the analysis provided, which is already in the public domain, the Commission's analysis sees a reduction in corporation tax of 0.14% of GDP.  This is in its impact assessment.  Overall, the Commission sees it as a marginally positive result because, under its analysis, some buoyancy comes out of that but it also sees a negative impact on corporation tax receipts.</p> <p>  In its publication yesterday, which draws heavily on the earlier analysis carried out by Ernst &amp;amp; Young in 2011, the ESRI sees an impact on foreign direct investment of -4.6% and on corporation tax receipts of -5.7%.  When we combine this with the impact of Brexit, it shows an effective output of -1.5%.  We take these as useful inputs to our analysis.  We will do our own work on it with Revenue and, if necessary, get figures done.  It is a very complex proposal with many aspects and we need to go through them to fully assess how we believe it will fully affect corporation tax receipts.  The analysis in the Ernst &amp;amp; Young report, the Commission's own analysis and the ESRI is that it would have a negative impact on corporation tax receipts for Ireland.  This does not surprise us.</p></speech>

The first element relates to the base.  Mr. Hession made the point that for Ireland it would result in a narrower base.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.320" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronan Hession" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120600002#C00600"><p>Yes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.321" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120600002#C00700"><p>Despite much of the rhetoric, we have a broad base with regard to the calculation of taxable profits but we apply a relatively low rate of 12.5% to the base.  Mr. Hession has given as number of examples of how the calculation of the base would differ under these proposals than under existing corporation tax law.  There appears to be quite a significant difference in the base.  Before we look at the attribution of the profits across countries, if the taxable base is smaller, we are already at a disadvantage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.322" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronan Hession" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120600002#C00800"><p>It would seem so.  There are other aspects we need to examine such as, for example, the research and development provision.  The common base is different to the research and development tax credit.  We think it would be less attractive for firms therefore there may not be as big a cost.  The allowance for growth and investment is a new provision, which would be a tax cost.  Our expectation is there would be a tax cost because this is significantly narrower.</p><p>In addition, it is difficult to forecast what will come out in the negotiations or the interplay between the different aspects of this proposal and other proposals already on the table.  One of the difficulties, and the reason I said in my opening statement that we would not just reheat our previous analysis, is that we have already made many commitments at the OECD table and at EU level.  For example, the anti-tax avoidance directive was agreed during the summer.  The tax avoidance elements of the proposed CCCTB directive, broadly speaking, largely import the anti-tax avoidance directive.  This includes the provisions on control for our company rules, on interest deductibility and on hybrids, to which I referred.  There is a kind of interplay of all the different aspects so that it is difficult to make a net judgment but our expectation is that the base in the case of the CCCTB would be narrower than that in the CCTB.</p></speech>

Mr. Hession outlines three elements: where sales happen, where staff are located and where companies' assets are.  Is there a weighting of these different elements in the formula?  Regarding the first element, Ireland is such a small market that we will not make much of an impact.  Regarding the second, many multinationals provide employment here.  What is the assessment of how Ireland would fare when it comes to the allocation of the base, that is, the allocation of taxable profits across Europe?</p></speech>

The weighting between the three components is one third, one third and one third in terms of labour, assets and sales.  The previous EY analysis was that Ireland would be a loser in this formula.  In fact, I think in some categories, such as employment, we were shown to be the biggest loser.</p></speech>

The principal tax authority is the country in which the parent of the group is resident.  In addition, if the parent is ultimately outside the EU, the group members within the CCTB can nominate a group that would be the head for those purposes.  Therefore, potentially more than those 50 taxpayers about which we spoke are located in a particular member state, but the Deputy is right that the formulary apportionment basically means that there are different factors now determining where tax is paid.</p></speech>

As he said, it has been in the ether for the past 15 years or so, but there seems to be renewed momentum behind it now.  It was published last October.  Where does he expect it will go from here?  What is the timeline for the Irish Government and the Department of Finance to adopt a position from an Irish perspective on these proposals?</p></speech>

The Slovak Presidency has prioritised this as distinct from the CCCTB components.  It will be for the next presidencies, Maltese and then Estonian, to determine their priorities.  I expect there will be some focus from the Maltese Presidency on dispute resolution, but the CCCTB will go in parallel with this.  Much analysis is being carried out in other member states of how it affects their bases, revisiting what position these Governments will take.  For now, there is not huge visibility of where the member states will go or the appetite for this.  Because of the questions surrounding subsidiarity and reasoned opinions, it is the parliaments that are probably dealing with this issue ahead of some of the governments.  My expectation is that this will proceed cautiously through the next few presidencies.  As I said, we are doing preliminary work with our colleagues in the Revenue Commissioners, and once we get to a certain point, we need to carry out an assessment of whether we need a more specialist piece of work, which we may have to commission from outside, to give us the kind of breakdowns we feel we need to feed into policy makers.</p></speech>

One might get the impression that it is the second C of the abbreviation, consolidation, that will cause the greatest issues in Ireland's case.  However, what is being proposed under the first C of the common base is as alarming from the point of view of sovereignty.  Could Mr. Hession explain what a common income tax base would look like?  Would it involve a common set of tax credits and tax reliefs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.342" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronan Hession" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120600002#D02000"><p>Essentially, that is correct.  It would mean that companies above the threshold, that is, large companies with group turnover of more than &euro;750 million, would operate under the common European rules regarding their tax bases, the kinds of reliefs that would be available, how losses are handled and what kind of accounting principles work.  Such companies would work to that common set of rules.  Companies below this threshold can opt into this if they wish, but it is optional for them.  The previous proposal in 2011 was optional for everybody.  The two significant differences are, first, that participation is mandatory above the threshold and, second, that the consolidation element will be considered after a base, if a base is agreed.  Consolidation was considered alongside a tax base during discussions on the earlier proposal, whereas work on the two elements is now being carried out in sequence.  Our initial focus is on the base, which, as I say, forms part of a European set of common rules for these larger companies.</p></speech>

It certainly is an early challenge that has been identified in the context of any kind of potential savings or efficiencies it is argued the CCCTB might bring about.  Running two parallel systems has that downside.</p></speech>

Running two systems in parallel brings with it a particular administrative burden.  Introducing new legislation, which would entirely replace our existing corporation tax system for a particular cohort of companies, would also bring with it uncertainties.  We have much case law on which we rely for the interpretation of our existing legislation.  This has been built up over a number of years.  As that would not be there with the new legislation, there certainly would be a bedding-down period regarding the introduction of the new system and an ongoing issue in applying the two sets in parallel.</p></speech>

From Ireland's point of view, going back to our own hosting of the presidency, the preference in Ireland has always been to separate those two issues.  Consolidation is by far the more problematic of the two.  In terms of the base, it would make more sense to discuss that in its own right.  The actual splitting of the proposals is a positive from our point of view.  That is not to say the Government would necessarily buy into the argument for a common base.  It will wait to hear the analysis of the impact on the base and what sort of questions that raises for Ireland's competitiveness.  I do not want to come across as unduly negative.  It is my Department of Finance training to be sceptical about new proposals in general.  At a high level, the first of the two stated objectives of this proposal is to tackle tax avoidance.  The Government is publicly on board with tackling tax avoidance.  The tax avoidance elements in the directive were previously agreed earlier this year and Ireland played a very active part in that.  In terms of easing the compliance burden for business, it is something that is worthy as an objective.  The Revenue Commissioners rates very highly on that internationally.  In terms of ease of doing business and filing returns, it is top of the league in Europe and fifth or sixth in the world.  That has always been something Ireland has taken very seriously.  As high level objectives, the Government has supported those and continues to support them.  It is just a question of whether this is the right way to further those two objectives.</p></speech>

That is the statutory tax rate.  That is what they have to pay.  What tax they owe elsewhere in the world and whether it is getting paid in other jurisdictions will remain a question for those other jurisdictions.  Under the common base, they can look within the European Union but obviously the tax affairs of international companies that have business activities broader than the EU fall to be considered by other jurisdictions.</p></speech>

In 2011, the D&aacute;il decided that the proposal then from the EU and the CCCTB was not in line with those principles and adopted a reasoned opinion.  It stated five detailed reasons why this was the case.  Does the Department or the revenue Commissioners have a view now as to whether the new proposals make any of those arguments less valid?</p></speech>

It is a very important question that we have to pose with regard to any new European proposal.  In this case it is a question of whether more can be achieved by member states acting collectively than can be achieved individually.</p> <p>  The second question is whether the proportionality test is passed.  In other words, does it go as far as the treaties require and no further.  There is a balanced judgment call there.  We have to do our own analysis to see where we land and what sort of advice we give to the Minister on it.  What we have seen at OECD level is that we can acknowledge that these problems require lots of countries to work together.  They cannot be solved by unilateral action alone.  Whether that requires a directive or a common base comes back to the proportionality point.  Outside the European Union, a lot of the OECD reforms have been delivered either through changes via tax treaties or sometimes just guidelines or best practice standards.  There is that question.</p> <p>  The broader issue of tackling tax avoidance is acknowledged in the previous directive that was agreed in June, the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive.  Member states can come together and make a meaningful difference through a directive.  To a large extent that issue was dealt with in that directive.  It has been carried over to this one but we do not see a huge amount of additional anti-tax avoidance content here in this published proposal beyond what was agreed previously in June.  The Commission would argue that by having a common base and common rules it makes the system more transparent and more difficult to arbitrage.  We would have to see whether that is the case.  It is somewhat hypothetical, given we do not have a live common based example we can compare it to.</p></speech>

I would be surprised if adopting a common base in itself was to defeat tax avoidance entirely.  What we have had over the last number of years is a recognition at OECD level and beyond, to a much broader cohort of about 100 countries, that the rules as they are currently formulated leave tax planning opportunities and that it needs to be tightened up.  That is really what the BEPS reports were about.  Ireland has always been very positive about that process and very sensitive about the fact we have a very new international consensus on this and the importance of implementing that in order to address the problem of tax planning.  We have to always be sensitive that at EU level we do not risk undermining that consensus or put in place a rival regime that would somehow frustrate the reforms we have already got.  There is a balance there and I am sure when we come to discuss this among member states in more detail there will be an attempt to try to strike that right balance.</p></speech>

The proposal does not affect the 12.5% rate and the Government has a firm position on it.  The question that was posed previously in the analysis by Ernst &amp;amp; Young was that if this affects the base, does it not put the Government in the situation where it has to increase the rate to compensate.  What the Ernst &amp;amp; Young analysis found was that in Ireland's case, because of the sensitivity of our rate, it would not be an effective solution.  Its analysis said even if the Government was to compensate with a rate, the impact on investment and FDI, etc., would be negative and therefore it was not an answer that a country like Ireland could turn to.  The Government has been absolutely clear that the 12.5% rate will not be affected by this.  We have a genuine question about that because we have other rates in Ireland.  In Ireland we make a distinction between trading profits, which are taxed at 12.5%, and non-trading profits of passive income, interest, royalties, dividends, etc., which are taxed at 25%.  It is not clear to us where our 25% rate sits in all this or indeed out 33% capital gains rate.  It could just be a clarification point from the Commission.</p></speech>

It is great to have the detail in terms of what is proposed and what the Department is thinking on this.  We have a question to answer on the issue of subsidiarity and proportionality.  We answered that question as a parliament in 2011.  My colleague asked Mr. Hession a question in that context.  He mentioned that the easy thing to do would be to look at what was done in 2011.  While there have been changes to the CCCTB, its premise is still the same.  Has Mr. Hession reviewed the reasoned opinion by the D&aacute;il on the five reasons?</p></speech>

I am asking about this in order to go through some of the issues.  It is stated that it is not established by the Commission's proposals or impact assessment that 27 different national corporate tax systems inherently impede the proper functioning of the internal market . In effect, the proposal would introduce a second parallel system for operation within each member state that would not improve the simplicity and efficiency of the corporate tax systems in the EU.  Is that something Mr. Hession would subscribe?</p></speech>

We are also mindful of the fact that we are not just talking about international tax planning within Europe.  There are still multifarious international tax systems that will remain in place and a lot of the tax planning that goes on is not necessarily within Europe, it takes place in other jurisdictions.  Therefore, one has to live with a certain degree of complexity.</p> <p>  I understand the motive behind the Commission's proposal for a common base.  It perhaps makes it more transparent and with consistent rules there is less scope for arbitrage.  That may be the case but, if it were to come into being, I would be surprised if it was impenetrable to tax planning.  As regards the administrative side or compliance cost, the Ernst &amp;amp; Young analysis felt those savings were overstated.</p></speech>

The Deputy said that the proposal has many similarities to a previous proposal.  The question for us is whether we have confidence in the multilateral nature of the agreement at that level.  That was not by way of agreeing a single legal instrument.  It involves a mix whereby countries need to implement some of it through legislation or country-by-country reporting, for example.  Others do so by best practice which in Europe we have taken to another step through legislation on the control of foreign company rules.  Others are just guidelines, which in our case we will import into our domestic law.  However, not every country will do that.</p> <p>  Our experience of that process, both in the negotiations that went on behind it and what has happened since, is that it has gained real traction.  Every time I attend OECD meetings there are more countries involved.  Those countries have heard warnings from the OECD which, put simply, mean, "If you're not at the table, you're on the menu."  They would realise, therefore, that there are risks to not participating.  That shows that, yes, one needs countries to work together to get these solutions, but does that necessarily mean having a common base?  Obviously, a common base is not part of the OECD view.  Their view is that one could get the results without going quite that far.  Some of that reflects the nature of compromise negotiations .</p></speech>

The reason I asked that question is because it would be fair to say that the Commission's argument at the time was that it was too complex across 27 member states and it needed to be simplified.  However, the argument from the recent opinion is, "We don't agree with you in relation to that."  The thrust of it now for those who are trying to put forward this new version of CCCTB is that it is to deal with tax avoidance, tax evasion and the issue of the Apple case and other such cases.  It is to make it difficult for multinationals to avoid paying tax.  In my view, it is about trying to make the narrative suit the agenda, which has been there for a long time.</p> <p>  The fourth reason set out in the reasoned opinion stated, "Yet the proposal would legislate to effectively redistribute the EU corporate tax base among member states based on new allocation factors."  The main weakness not addressed in the proposal or impact assessment is why would the 27 member states legislative for such an unequal policy outcome?  Does Mr. Hession believe that still stands today from the analysis done within the Department?</p></speech>

When one looks at the analysis and the number of countries where the graph is below the x-axis compared with those where it is above, it is difficult to see where the momentum will come for an agreement.  Essentially, members states will be surrendering significant portions of their base in service of an abstract principle unless they feel that there is some greater motive at stake - in this case, if they feel it is necessary to weed out tax avoidance and this was the only way to do it.  What compromises that argument is that the anti-tax avoidance elements of this directive have already been agreed.  Therefore, having agreed to the anti-tax avoidance directive, we could not argue that those elements bring subsidiarity because we have already gone as far as signing up to that.  Carrying them in here bolsters the characterisation of this directive as being an anti-tax avoidance one.  However, in terms of additional added value it is difficult to see it based on those components, aside from what I have already said about a common base making it more transparent.  Having common rules flushes out what would otherwise be tax avoidance schemes and arbitrage between differences.</p></speech>

It stated, "No EU legislation should be proposed that indirectly impacts on national sovereignty as a means of remedying any negative financial impact that flows therefrom."  Whether we agree or disagree with it, this is an issue of national sovereignty, as Senator Conway-Walsh said.  If we were to deal with this from an income tax point of view, we would be saying to the European Commission that it can set the bands or tax credits available to workers across the State.  That is basically giving it away.  We would always be allowed to apply the 20% and 40% rates, but it gives them the authority to change all the rules that affect us, which are really important.  If the bands or reliefs are changed we will end up paying more or less tax.  Is this not a sovereignty issue at its core?  We will be handing power to the Commission - not for the first time because of VAT and other areas - for authority over the country's corporate tax system.</p></speech>

I guess they would say, "Do you want to pool your sovereignty with the other countries?"  This is not going to happen unless Ireland signs up to it, and changing the directive later would require Ireland's agreement on unanimity.  Not to put words in the Commission's mouth, they would probably say that this is a proposition.  They certainly have the right of initiative.  It would be true that in future Finance Bills - and I had the pleasure of being here with the Minister for the recent Finance Bill - that a lot of the tax issues around these larger companies would not be discussed in this room on Committee State.  They would be dealt with at European level, so in that sense the role of the D&aacute;il and Seanad - where we have Committee Stage tomorrow - would be much reduced for those companies above the threshold or the smaller ones that opt in - they would no longer be dealt with under the domestic rules.  The point made to Ireland would be, "That only happens if you decide to pool your sovereignty with the other countries, and decide that you are going to agree unanimously for that to happen."  The Deputy began his contribution by referring back to the nub of the discussion here which is around reasoned opinion.  On the proportionality point, does it go as far as the treaty requires and no further, or is it a step beyond that?  That is the question that needs to be answered on proportionality.  Unquestionably, however, the net result of this is that we are agreed that a significant amount of tax policy will be decided at European level, albeit with Ireland at the table exercising its vote in the context of unanimity.</p></speech>

The first thing I would say is that unanimity will be required in future directives.  Provision is being made for the Commission to issue technical standards where some of the detail is spelled out.  The committee may be familiar with such standards in the financial services area.  There is always a delicacy in areas like tax about what is technical and what is policy.  During a discussion on a recent Finance Bill, it was largely impossible to distinguish where a policy issue became a technical issue and where a technical issue became a policy issue.  Such details are important in terms of the feasibility, workability or effect of a proposal.  The Commission has a role in this area that it did not have in respect of tax files before now.  I think my colleague, Mr. Crowley, wants to add something.</p></speech>

This is a different process that does not require unanimity.  It is limited to technical points, as Mr. Hession said.</p></speech>

As the ESRI publication draws on the 2011 proposal, we are not comparing the same things.  We will stick with table 39, if Mr. Hession does not mind, because it is based on the Commission's assessment of the current proposal.  It suggests that if this proposal goes through, Ireland's corporate tax receipts will decrease by 0.14% of GDP but there will be increases in receipts from labour taxes, consumption taxes and taxes on bonds, dividends and capital gains.  It states that our overall tax revenue, which is really what we are interested in, would increase marginally by 0.02% of GDP.  The Commission's view, therefore, is that the effect of this proposal on our tax receipts would basically be neutral.  It would lead to marginal reduction of the overall tax revenues of states across Europe.  Does the Department agree with the figures that have been presented by the Commission?  Does it agree that this proposal, as identified by the European Commission's joint research centre, would broadly be tax-neutral if it were to be introduced in this State because there would be a reduction of 0.14% of GDP in corporate tax receipts but that would be offset by other taxes?</p></speech>

We generally like to get under the bonnet of such figures to have a look at them.  It strikes us that one of the differences between 2011 and now is that we now have fiscal rules.  If we proposed to reduce taxes while claiming that the buoyancy in the economy meant that such a reduction would pay for itself, ordinarily we would not be allowed to do that under fiscal rules.  I reiterate that we have not had a technical engagement with the Commission.  We will need to do that to understand the analysis.  Perhaps it is not what it appears from our reading of it.  If we were to come back to the Commission with our figures, tell it that we were reducing our base for some other reason and argue that it would be cost-neutral overall because it would lead to a bounce in the economy, I am not sure we would be given the discretion to do that.  It is an interesting piece of analysis.  The part of it dealing with the reduction in the base is certainly consistent with what other commentators like the ESRI and Ernst &amp;amp; Young have said.  I am not sure about the buoyancy of results element of it.  In the run-up to budgets, my job involves hearing from many people who ask us to make a tax change that they say will pay for itself.  When we hear that in the Department, we know it is a common argument that is often made.  We like to look at the tax element on its own.  Under the fiscal rules, there is a discipline around us having to do that.  I think we will have to engage.  I am not going to dispute it or dismiss it.  In fairness to the Commission, it has done the analysis and we should try to understand its perspective in the first instance.</p></speech>

We often look at how they use the law, the extent to which they might avail of loopholes in the law and where legislative amendments might be required.

Germany might be taxing the sales receipts in respect of those violins as would Ireland.  Ireland has a tax treaty with other countries and on the basis of the tax treaty, one shares the taxing rights between the two countries to make sure that the same income is not taxed twice.</p></speech>

Previously the proposal was painfully slow.  This year tax files have moved extraordinary quickly, but they tend to be the tax files that had some basis in the OECD process.  The essential principles have been agreed so I do not expect that pace will carry through to the CCCTB.  To a large extent it will depend on the next two presidencies; Malta will take over the Presidency in the new year and then Estonia follows and they have the job of prioritising files, deciding on the pacing of discussions.  It depends on the extent to which they push it or prioritise other files.  Our expectation is that the Maltese may look to have some unfinished business from the day's ECOFIN.  There is an Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, ATAD, which has to do with hybrid mismatches and that will carry on to their Presidency.  They will have to finish that.  I know they have an interest in the dispute resolution mechanism but they will indicate their priorities in a pacing ahead of their Presidency or early in their Presidency.  Given the complexity, this would be a profound change for any member state that member states will want to carefully consider each aspect to it before agreeing anything.  I think it will be handled cautiously.  I do not expect it to go at the same pace as other files that were dealt with this year.</p></speech>

When the package was announced, which after all was only five weeks ago, it is still reasonably fresh, the immediate priority was to deal with the hybrid mismatches.  There is a sense from those who are favourably disposed towards the directive to see things move quickly and not get bogged down.  I think the intention from the Commission's point of view is to separate the base out on consolidation to make sure it does not get bogged down in more difficult issues that there can be some progress on the base first of all.  It is really very hard to tell.  To some extent this is not a policy work stream, it is a very political process.  There is a negotiation that has to happen.  It depends on the extent to which member states are starting on the same page.  Initial indications are some member states are quite negative about it, so we will see how that feeds into the pace.</p></speech>

If one is talking about targeted tax measures for disadvantaged areas, generally speaking that is not allowed under State aid rules, unless it is below certain thresholds.  I would expect that if there was a very targeted measure, companies below that threshold would not be targeted, that is types of companies called pre-CCCTB.  I think we would have initiatives in the finance Bill to do with the farming, marine sectors and so on, which are below the necessary thresholds for State aid purpose and generally would not be targeted at the large companies that are caught here.</p> <p>  It is hard to answer the question in the abstract, but I would not expect CCCTB and regional development to have a bigger rap</p></speech>

I expect if that vulnerability is in the directive and if the directive were to progress to agreement, that type of manipulation of business to get around the threshold would be addressed.  We have similar rules about anti-fragmentation to ensure that groups do not separate themselves and keep themselves below the threshold.  That is a reasonably common feature of tax codes that one would make sure that where a threshold bites at a particular point, that there is no way of laying around with the threshold artificially.</p></speech>

We will digest it and we will come back.</p> <p>  As we begin to digest it, we can see what a big departure it is from what we have and I do not think that any Irish official or politician would see the previous analysis on this what it mean for base, for our CT receipts, for FDI and so on would jump to a very quick positive result.  It is often the case in policy, that one must defer taking a rigid opinion because it compromises one's analysis.  We have to maintain professional scepticism which is not a negativity.  We always have to put ourselves in a position and ask whether we are fully persuaded of the merits of something.</p></speech>

That is not consistent with being an apologist for tax avoidance.</p><p> Analysis of the previous proposal and the Commission's initial figures, which we have yet to discuss in full with the Commission, indicate that it will eat into our tax base.  If that turns out to be true, our understanding of the fiscal rules is that will have to be paid for some other way by a cutback in services or taxes raised elsewhere.  The analysis in 2011 was that increasing the rate would not deliver that.  We have to be mindful that we are going into this with an open mind but not an empty mind.

The Revenue Commissioners have provided a table showing that each worker of that 1% is associated with &euro;7.7 million worth of corporation tax which if they were paying 12.5% - being generous to them &ndash; means that they are generating &euro;62 million in profits.

Profits are being booked in Ireland and tax is being paid on them at a relatively low level that is unlikely to have been made here.  Are workers at the top ten companies in Ireland really making &euro;62 million in profit a year for their companies or, and this is precisely what in my understanding the CCCTB aims to address, are profits being booked in Ireland that are not made here?</p></speech>

It is important to know that corporation tax receipts in Ireland are 8.3% of total tax revenue, equivalent to 2.5% of gross domestic product, GDP.  Both of those are within half a percentage point of the average for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, countries.  We collect the same proportion of corporation tax when compared with total tax revenue and GDP as do other jurisdictions.</p> <p>  In respect of the CCCTB, formulary apportionment and how it operates, there are two competing philosophies about how to allocate profits between different countries.  On the one hand, there is the OECD and the "arm's length principle", which seeks to identify where value add is generated.  It is often generated by relatively low numbers of people where, for example, it is focused on research and development or high value-add types of activity.  On the other hand, there is the formulary apportionment, which is divided by staff assets and sales.  The difference between consolidation and the current international OECD rules for allocating profits between jurisdictions is that under consolidation, the biggest markets, the jurisdictions where the most sales are made, will capture a proportionally higher amount of the revenue regardless of where the value-added activity took place.  </p></speech>

It is also, however, clear that companies are able to take advantage of the fact that there is no common way of assessing corporation tax.  I get the impression that Revenue and the Department of Finance have not made any assessment of the impact this would have on tax revenue.  If the top 20 corporations paid 43% of corporation tax, presumably they all would be over the &euro;750 million threshold.  Presuming they were, have we an estimate of what that would cost the Exchequer?</p></speech>

We are doing a preliminary analysis.  We may need to commission more detailed work on that.  The Commission's published view is that the impact on corporation tax receipts would be a reduction of 0.14% which, based on 2014 figures, was approximately &euro;250 million.  It foresees a buoyancy effect from the CCCTB and sees the overall proposal as being tax neutral.  The publication by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, yesterday draws quite heavily on the analysis by Ernst &amp;amp; Young in 2011 which stated that foreign direct investment, FDI, would be reduced by 4.6% and corporation tax receipts by 5.7%.  There were further impacts outlined in the new Ernst &amp;amp; Young analysis that GDP would be negatively affected by 1.4% and employment by 1.3%.  The effect would be greatest on Ireland.  The analysis that has come out so far, whether from the Commission, the ESRI or Ernst &amp;amp; Young, points to a negative effect on corporation tax receipts.  The Commission argues that it expects a buoyancy effect that would neutralise that.  I am not an expert on the fiscal rules but my understanding is that ordinarily, if we were to introduce a new tax expenditure we would not be allowed to pay for it by buoyancy measures.  We would have to find the money upfront.</p></speech>

If it is part of a multinational group that operates throughout the EU and will now be subject to the CCCTB, the Deputy is correct, its profits will be allocated on a different basis throughout the whole of the EU, including that sales factor that has a particular impact on us.</p><p>Therefore, more of the profits will be allocated outside Ireland and less profit will benefit from the 12.5% rate.  This would make Ireland comparatively less attractive.</p><p> Incentives such as the research and development tax credit are designed to increase the amount of research and development.  Incentives like that will disappear.  The ability to differentiate by way of particular tax incentives will disappear under the CCCTB.

The OECD has been very clear that it does not have a difficulty with tax competition but that it does have a difficulty with harmful tax competition.  The harmful measures identified in the OECD's work are subject to scrutiny at international level.  Countries have a sovereign right to choose their own tax rate and the OECD recognises that.  In fairness to the Commission, it also recognises that in its proposal.  It is very clear that it is not providing for harmonisation of rates.  We need to be fair to it on that point.</p></speech>

Tax competition is harmful for public services and for tax revenue across the world.  The only winners from the ideology of tax competition are the corporations that get away with not paying tax.</p> <p>  If there were CCCTB, with a threshold of &euro;750 million plus or an arrangement right across the board, would it have a negative impact on accountancy firms and corporate tax lawyers, of whom there are quite a few in Ireland?  Would it diminish their ability to advise companies on getting the best possible tax deals within the European Union?  Obviously, it would not affect matters outside the European Union.</p></speech>

It may be that there would be more competition between the European offices of the big four firms.  I refer to a common knowledge pool.  When the OECD published the BEPS report, it issued its own questions and answers and addressed formulary apportionment, which is the mechanism used on the CCCTB.  It made the point that we do not know what the tax planning opportunities would be under that.  Certainly, it is possible to criticise the existing system because there is no tax planning around it.  It is untested.  I said earlier that I would be surprised if a common base were impenetrable in respect of tax planning.</p> <p>  It is worth bearing in mind that the issue of advisers, etc., is the subject of a separate initiative at EU level in terms of mandatory disclosure of tax planning regimes.  Ireland is one of the few countries that has that already domestically.  We have already been supported in principle in that.  Separate to the way companies pay tax or the way governments behave in a tax base, the role of advisers is up for discussion.  That derives from action 13 of the BEPS report.  There is more to be said there in terms of how they behave.  I do not believe it is necessarily a point that the Commission has identified in favour of the CCCTB.  One could infer from its belief that it reduces compliance costs that it envisages a lesser role for tax advisers, but I am putting words in its mouth somewhat in that regard.</p></speech>

Many of the points have been covered.  We are referring to a corporate tax base and there were references to income tax.  It has nothing to do with income tax at all.</p> <p>  May I make a point that follows on from that of Deputy Paul Murphy?  What is proposed will not necessarily eliminate or reduce tax avoidance, which is also known by some people as tax planning opportunities.  That will still occur as much or as little as before.  Is there no reason why CCCTB itself would change that?</p></speech>

The point I was making earlier, which is not a criticism of the proposal, is that many of the measures were already in the anti-tax avoidance directive.  Their implementation is not contingent on this proposal.  The Commission can speak for itself but I guess it would say that agreeing a common base with common rules brings greater simplicity and transparency and, therefore, less opportunity for arbitrage.</p> <p>  An open question from the Department's point of view concerns the fact that international tax co-operation on this goes far beyond EU borders.  The OECD inclusive framework now includes approximately 100 countries so we are dealing with everywhere, including North America, South America, Africa and the Far East.  We are reminded of how small Europe is when we go to the meetings.  Much of the tax planning that has become notorious is not purely within EU borders.  The OECD reports were trying, in a very meticulous and surgical way, to identify the various weaknesses that existed and to find very targeted measures to shut them down.  There was an amazing amount of international consensus on that.  We would always have a concern if doing something different or new at EU level were in some way to slow down the momentum of those reforms.  That is something of which we would be mindful.</p></speech>

It is almost a mathematical equation in that if the base is narrowed and the rate is not changed &ndash; we do not want to change the rate &ndash; we will effectively be collecting less, even if the other rules were left before going near the sales location, or the location of assets or the payroll.  If one narrows the base at 12.5%, one will be taxing less than one was taxing before.  Is that a fair point?</p></speech>

The Ernst &amp;amp; Young analysis carried out about five years ago suggested that even if Ireland were to increase the rate to compensate, it would not work.  Our foreign direct investment and investment environment is too sensitive to the rate.  It would be self-defeating.  We have to do our own analysis of what we think the effect would be.  At present, we have older analyses that we can certainly talk about for now until we get our figures together.  We have the Commission's own analysis, into which we have yet to dig with it.  One factor that is different now is that we have the fiscal rules.  There is external disciplining of how we run a balanced budget in that if it were to eat into the base, it would have to be paid for.  That would mean either raising other taxes or scaling back the ambition in public expenditure.</p></speech>

That is obviously a big step.  All EU member states but one are at the OECD table and signed up to the arm's-length principle.  This is an extremely technical area.  Introducing formulary apportionment would not be a complete replacement because the other arrangement would still operate for third countries.

Significantly, the multinational companies are in Ireland to be part of the EU.  In some cases they are selling outside the EU as well.  The staff, including labour and payroll, could be or may not be a major part of it.  Let us consider the location of the assets.

Let us consider the previous analysis and what we are seeing now.  I have yet to see analysis suggesting that it is positive in terms of revenue, especially in terms of corporation tax.  It is one of those files.  We have had several EU files in the past year, as well as international tax proposals.  We have discussed them in terms of tax principles and the correct design.  To some extent, in this case it comes down to the money.  What would the impact be on the base of a country like Ireland?  Could Ireland afford it?</p> <p>  Having said that, we are having this conversation using data from other people.  I am not suggesting that we have the right answer compared with others.  However, we believe the onus is on those of us in the Department, along with our colleagues in Revenue, to undertake the analysis and put forward our figures.  It goes different ways.  Ms Levey made the point about how the treatment of research and development under the common base is in some ways less generous than it is now in Ireland.  There is a net figure but there will be pluses and minuses within that.  There will be negotiations and naturally, every country will arrive at the table seeking to push the elements favourable to it and to exclude other elements.  What we have now is a starting point.  What we have learned from experience is that there will be a process of negotiation.  Obviously, we will have to box clever in that negotiation in terms of how we put across the Irish case.</p></speech>

It is a pleasure to be here today.  On 25 October 2016, the Commission proposed a package of legislative proposals which included two proposals for a relaunched common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, that is, a proposal on the common tax base and a proposal on consolidation, alongside a dispute resolution mechanism for double taxation and an amendment to the anti-tax avoidance directive, to address hybrid mismatches.  Today, I will focus mainly on the CCCTB proposals, which are the centrepiece of the package.</p> <p>  For the European Commission, the CCCTB is the epitome of what we perceive as a corporate tax system for the future.  The relaunched CCCTB initiative reflects an effort to bring together the policy priorities for business facilitation and the need for fairer taxation in a globally integrated economy that operates within open markets.  The Commission first proposed the CCCTB in 2011 with a view to enhancing the Internal Market for businesses.  However, the magnitude of the project led Council negotiations to stall.  In the meantime, the idea of a CCCTB continued receiving support from the European Parliament, businesses and stakeholders around Europe.  In its 2015 action plan on corporate taxation, the Commission announced its intention to relaunch the CCCTB.  The relaunch of the CCCTB initiative is structured as a staged approach which will consist of two steps.  Member states will first need to build and capitalise on the extensive technical work that has already been accomplished on the rules for the tax base and, only when this framework is secured, touch upon the more complex aspect of consolidation.  It is important to bear in mind that for the European Commission, the CCCTB project remains a single one and that the two steps are inextricably linked.  I should also clarify from the outset that the CCCTB stays away from the issue of tax rates.  The context of the proposal does not reach further than the calculation of the tax base.  The common rules do not interfere with the determination of the tax liability and national budgetary priorities of member states.  </p> <p>  The most notable change in the re-launched CCCTB is that it will be mandatory for all EU companies in financial accounting groups with consolidated group revenues of more than &euro;750 million.  Non-qualifying companies - those below &euro;750 million - may still opt for the rules of the common base or CCCTB, as the case may be, subject to certain conditions.  They will have to meet the conditions to be within the scope of the directives.  The mandatory scope primarily serves the objective of fairer taxation.  It aligns the CCCTB with the policy priority for clamping down on the opportunities for tax avoidance but only targets those who possess the resources to engage in such practices.  This is why it is limited to larger multinational groups with a consolidated revenue exceeding &euro;750 million.  As already mentioned by our colleagues just now, these are the same companies which are subject to the country-by-country reporting between tax administrations, a proposal which was agreed by the Council earlier this year.  </p> <p>  I will not go into too much detail on the CCCTB.  I would, however, like to give an overview of how this system works, especially for those who are not familiar with it.  I will then briefly present some of the specific new elements introduced by the relaunch.  The first step in applying the CCCTB is the calculation of the individual tax bases.  For the companies that form part of the CCCTB group, tax bases will be calculated according to a common set of rules, which will be provided for in the directives.  The next step is that all results are added up by the principal tax authority to create a consolidated tax base for the group in the EU.  This means that loss-making results of one company of one member state are automatically set off against the taxable profits of others in the same group.  The tax return will be filed in one member state.  This is the so-called one-stop shop.  The advantage of a common base is there will be no transfer pricing formalities within the group.  The principal authority will apply the apportionment formula to distribute the consolidated tax base across the group.  Taxable revenues are allocated to each company of the group based on the weight of the three factors.  They are assets, labour and sales by destination, which each account for one third of the formula.  As already mentioned, member states are and remain free to set tax rates on their taxable shares individually.  </p> <p>  There are a number of important new elements in the proposals.  One concerns research and development.  The treatment of research and development has always been rather generous under the CCCTB.  The proposal of 2011 provided for full deductibility of research and development costs in the year in which they were incurred.  There is therefore no capitalisation and depreciation of research and development over a number of years.  This basic regime has been retained under the relaunched proposals with the exception of immovable property.  We included it in the initial 2011 proposal but one of the results of the discussions with member states was that it was better to leave this element of the immediate deduction out of the treatment of research and development.  In addition, the relaunched rules on the common tax base provide for a so-called super-deduction whereby research and development costs up to the first &euro;20 million receive an extra deduction of 50%.  In total, there will be a deduction of 150% of the costs.  For amounts above &euro;20 million, the extra deduction is 25%.  In that case, the deduction will be 125% in total.  </p> <p>  Innovative startups are entitled to an enhanced super-deduction which allows them to deduct up to 200% of their research and development costs for amounts up to &euro;20 million.  We went for a rule that supports innovation and the actual research and development activity itself.  This is contrary to intellectual property, IP, boxes, where one looks at the income coming from an already developed asset.  Our rule promotes the employment and the fact that research is being undertaken.  Given that most of research and development costs involve payroll, our rule should be expected to bring forth considerable benefits in terms of jobs and growth.  By giving larger-scale deductions for costs up to &euro;20 million, the research and development incentive will give a boost to smaller companies with limited research and development budgets to allow them to grow.  It will therefore encourage the creation and expansion of young, innovative enterprises.</p> <p>  The second new element in the CCCTB proposals is the allowance for growth and investment, AGI.  This is an adjustment mechanism for neutralising the debt bias in current tax systems.  It will put debt financing and equity financing on an equal footing.  The rule is entirely in line with the objectives of the capital markets union and is aimed to discourage excessive indebtedness and so bring greater stability to companies and therefore also to the union.  The AGI will reward companies that strengthen their financing structures by boosting their equity base.  In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises that often struggle to secure loans should be expected to reap the benefits from this rule.  The AGI framework is designed in such a way as to prevent cascading effects in the deductibility of what is commonly referred to as notional interest.</p><p>We have taken measures to ensure the system cannot be abused, for example, by excluding participations.  Where there is a parent company with a subsidiary, we have made sure the parent company cannot claim the notional interest deduction for the capital of the subsidiary because that is capital from which a deduction should be claimed at the level of the subsidiary.</p><p> A final element is a temporary cross-border loss relief with recapture mechanisms.  This is a cash flow facility to make up for the absence of cross-border consolidation at the first stage.  The repercussions of this facility are, however, contained by a series of anti-tax abuse measures.  For example, there will be automatic recapture of relief after five years if the subsidiary has not returned to profit in the meantime.</p><p> The CCCTB, common consolidated corporate tax base, can offer many benefits to Irish businesses, particularly in terms of tax certainty and simplicity for Irish-based multinationals which operate in other member states.  These benefits, combined with Ireland's 12.5% rate, would enhance Ireland's competitiveness, not reduce it.  Foreign investors and cross-border businesses are keen to have the CCCTB in place.  They are among our strongest supporters.  Ireland's primary concern is with consolidation.  The two-step approach means that once the common base is secured, we can give full focus to finding an approach to consolidation that all member states can accept.  In any case, with unanimity, Ireland can feel secure that its views will be taken on board before the final CCCTB is agreed.  It would send an important signal in the EU and internationally if Ireland were to constructively engage on this file.</p></speech>

I cannot see how these proposals are not encroaching on member state competence over taxation.  The Commission is essentially seeking to rewrite our entire corporation tax code.  It tells us the rate is a matter for Ireland but the rate will apply to something determined by these common rules.  Once the base is agreed, the allocation of profits will again be determined by EU-wide rules, if these proposals were introduced.  How is this not an encroachment on the core competence of member states over the issue of taxation?</p> <p>  There is a long-standing argument, based on analysis, that overall this is a big negative for Ireland in terms of our corporation tax receipts and our attractiveness as a country for inward investment.  Will the delegation address this?  When it comes to the consolidation and allocation of profits across the EU, the three factors will be one third, one third, one third.  One of them is sales by destination.  Ireland will rank close to a statistical zero on that one third, given the scale of the Irish market in the EU.  This is the basis on which profits will be allocated across different member states.</p> <p>  How does the delegation deal with the issue of competence and the argument, backed up by analysis, that this is a negative for Ireland?  It seems to me that it is a matter of time before the Irish Government will repeat its previous position that it is not in favour of this.</p></speech>

Otherwise, we would not have proposed it.  We believe our proposals are entirely in line with, and in the spirit of, subsidiarity and proportionality.  It is important to keep in mind that what we do is make proposals.  It is for member states to either adopt or reject these proposals.  In the tax area, they do so in unanimity.  There are checks and balances to ensure that anything that is agreed at EU level carries the support of all member states, including Ireland.  On that score, I do not believe we would have any concerns that anything we propose would encroach on member states' sovereignty.</p> <p>  On the perceived negative effects for Ireland, I would be a bit cautious not to draw the conclusion too rapidly.  We will carefully need to listen to what the effects on individual member states will be.  When we present proposals, we look at their impact on the 28 member states.  What we did not do in this case was drill down to the level of the individual member states because our modelling does not allow that in any great detail.  This is also a matter in which member states will need to be engaged.  To drill down to the level of member states, one needs the kind of information that only member states can provide, such as tax files.  Member states are best placed to provide that information.  We are happy to do that analysis with them.</p> <p>  On the figures presented in the impact assessment, it is important to note the system is designed to be tax neutral.  Broadly, this is the case.  There may be minor pluses or minuses but when one looks at the grand total, they are designed to be neutral.  We saw the figures mentioned in the newspapers and they were used as the basis for the ESRI report referred to in the previous discussions.  There are probably a few caveats to be made.  The figures used here were used in the study carried out by the Irish Government and Ernst &amp;amp; Young in the context of the first CCCTB proposal in 2011.  This was based on figures from 2008 and it may be slightly outdated by now.  This an area in which we might want to compare notes to see how the figures compare to those used in our impact assessment.  Moreover, the effects measured on the CCCTB are from the 2011 proposal.  There are some fundamental changes in the relaunched proposal with method, the two-step approach and scope.  The new proposal also means the CCCTB will be mandatory for certain groups of taxpayers, which was not the case in the 2011 proposal.  The new proposal has new features such as research and development incentives and allowance for growth and investment, while it has been strengthened with the integration of all the elements of the anti-tax avoidance directive.  All these changes were not factored into the study carried out before.  We need to be cautious in using the figures related to the previous proposal to assess the impact of the current proposal on any member state.</p><p>We were very happy to compare notes with member states in carrying out these analyses of what the new proposals mean for them.</p><p> On the allocation and as mentioned already, there are three factors.  If one looks at member states, one will see that certain factors will be more relevant for some than for others.  It is clear, for example, that for member states with large domestic markets, the factor of sales by destination would be more important than for smaller member states.  In the case of Ireland, the other two factors, namely, capital and payroll, would be considerable.  I would not speculate on the outcome because this is something that we will still need to discuss with the member states.  I certainly would not jump to the conclusion that because Ireland has a relatively small domestic market, the formula will always work to the disadvantage of Ireland and other member states in a similar position.  If this was the case and if that was the outcome of the discussions with member states, then I am sure that there will be further discussions on whether this is the right formula and the right weighting for each of the different factors.  Of course, we are very open to having that discussion with the member states.</p><p> I should add that the formula is not something we have invented in the Commission.  It is a formula that has already been used for over 100 years in the United States of America because it has a system of formulary apportionment.  There are similar formulary apportionment systems applied in other countries around the world, including Canada and Switzerland.  In that sense, what we are proposing is not a complete novelty.  It is a system that is already in force in several places today.</p></speech>

The Commission issued a fact sheet entitled Questions and Answers on the package of corporate tax reforms on 25 October 2016.

As regards harmful tax competition, the EU has a long track record of discussions about and efforts to remove harmful tax practices in the EU.  I refer in particular to the work of the code of conduct group which started in the late 1990s.  That group has, over the years, rolled back harmful features of member states' preferential regimes in more than 100 cases, some of which involved Ireland.  Virtually all member states have their share of harmful preferential regimes that were rolled back.<br/><br/>On the question of whether we consider Ireland, in the current context, as a country involved in harmful tax questions, I do not think the answer is &quot;Yes&quot;.  No, this is not the case.  Have we had issues with certain preferential regimes in the past?  Yes, we have but in this respect Ireland is certainly not unique.  We have looked at all member states and have found fault in most.  All we can say is that in this respect we are in a much better place now than we were ten or 15 years ago.</p></speech>

If the rationale is transactional costs and so forth for smaller companies that cannot avail of this kind of tax avoidance in any event, why would some opt to engage in it?</p></speech>

We know from studies that on average their tax burden is substantially lower than that of small and medium sized enterprises.  The focus on multinationals above &euro;750 million is a pragmatic one.  It catches the most relevant population of companies in terms of those that are most likely to engage in aggressive tax planning.  According to our figures, worldwide there are some 6,000 multinational enterprises which would fall under the scope of the proposal, that is, which have a turnover of more than &euro;750 million, out of which some 3,500 are EU based.  We are looking at a manageable population but still a very relevant one.  I will ask my colleague to provide information on the share of total profits in the EU.</p></speech>

It shows the corresponding share of unconsolidated turnover in the EU.  It shows the relevance of the groups for cross-border activities.  The &euro;750 million group, in terms of purely domestic turnover and purely domestic activities, has the lowest percentage from the group turnover.</p></speech>

Ireland has been a very constructive partner in our discussions, even on the 2011 proposal.  I should stress that those discussions were at the technical level, however.  They never reached the level of political decision-making.  It has always been made clear, not just by Ireland but by other member states as well, that engagement and active participation in technical discussions was without prejudice to the political appreciation of these proposals.  In that context, it is early days.  We have just issued our proposal and have had a first presentation by Commissioner Moscovici to the ECOFIN Council, where first reactions were broadly positive or at least there were no member states standing up and saying that they would never accept this.  It is still early days and we know, of course, that when we start discussing the details of these proposals, that concerns will be raised and positions will be expressed by the different member states.  We are very much looking forward to those discussions.</p> <p>  The ECOFIN Council has already adopted some first conclusions on the package, that is, on the CCCTB as well as on the anti-tax avoidance, ATA, ll and dispute resolution proposals.  At least in regard to the CCCTB proposals it has asked the incoming presidencies to continue to work on them.  There has been an invitation to the Maltese and Estonian presidencies to work on these files during their terms.  It is very important that these proposals do not just land on the nearest shelf but that there is actually an active debate on them at the Council.</p></speech>

That is simply not true because the witness is saying that if this measure goes through one of Ireland's tax rates is gone; it is either the 25% non-trading income or the 12.5%.  One of them is gone because two rates cannot exist.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

It is not right and it treats this committee and the people who attend the committee with disrespect.  Mr. Zuijdendorp should have come to the committee to say that he wanted to make it clear that if the CCCTB is accepted by all the member states then one of the existing rates for corporations in this State will no longer apply.  Is that the accurate version of what he attempted to say earlier?</p></speech>

Deputy Doherty is assuming that the CCCTB will replace the existing Irish corporate tax regime, which is not an assumption that is in our proposals.  It is entirely left up to member states to decide whether they will have two parallel tax systems in place.  The proposal provides that member states have to introduce the CCCTB and that it will be mandatory for certain groups of companies.  The proposals do not say that member states should do away with their existing national corporate tax systems.</p></speech>

Exactly.  With respect, Mr. Zuijdendorp is trying it again.  We know there is going to be a parallel system.  There will be the existing system for companies that have the threshold of below &euro;750 million and there will be the CCCTB, which means that one of the rates under the existing tax law will have to go.  A bit of honesty is required in this debate.  It is important.  If the State decides to go down this direction, or not, then it needs to do so with its eyes wide open.  Many of the issues people have with the European Union and where it is going is going are around this type of nonsense.  We are big people.  The Commission should sit down and explain this is what will apply, this is how it will work, this is what it will mean, instead of unelected Commission officials coming here and telling us not to worry, the rates are fine.  The rates are not fine.  If a State agrees to CCCTB - for the companies that are included either mandatorily or by opting in, only one rate will be allowed to apply.  This is a fundamental change.  One can argue whether or not one wants that, but it is a fundamental difference in how we tax corporations in the State.  How will the Commission treat capital gains?  Will it be one rate also?</p></speech>

We used a general equilibrium model that is quite good at assessing the effects of tax reform on the group of 28 member states, but it is less accurate when it comes to pinpointing the exact consequences for each individual member state.  This is simply because the model does not allow for that kind of differentiation.  These figures, and the CCCTB's intentions, are to be budgetary neutral.  That there may be a small plus or minus is more an effect of the model than an actual reflection of what might happen in practice.  It is also important to note that there are certain things that are not captured by a model.  These are quite significant elements.  For example, it does not capture the effect of the new measures that we are introducing, the effect of the research and development deduction or the effect of the allowance for growth and investment.  It also does not capture the effect that the application of anti-tax avoidance measures may have on the taxable revenues.  We can assume that it should have a positive effect but we cannot model for it and therefore have not included it.</p></speech>

I am finding it difficult to hear some of the previous exchanges we had with Revenue, but I believe it talked about 50 companies in Ireland would fall under the CCCTB proposal as mandatory.  Of those 50 companies has the Commission received from Revenue a detailed list of their taxable profits and how they are applied? What type of data set is the Commission putting in to its model? Whatever the model is, what figures are we talking about? We have had reports in the past that talked about effective tax rates and in particular a company that produced widgets, which is similar to no company in Ireland.  It all depends on what figures are being put in to the model.  Can Mr. Zuijdendorp explain to the committee where the Commission got the data and is it real data from some of a sample of the 50 companies?</p></speech>

I welcome the delegation.  It has been stated that multinational groups will deal with a single tax administration within the EU, a principal tax authority that will be a one-stop-shop.  However, the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, will have the ability to drive every parent company out of the EU.  If the parent company is outside the EU, it can then go to whichever member state in which it decides to have a business.  It can go to a country with a low tax system or the most favourable taxation system.  Parent companies will leave the EU wholesale because they will be able to decide in which country they will be taxed favourably through the one-stop-shop.</p></speech>

In terms of the allocation of profits, it does not matter under the CCCTB where a company files its tax returns.  That it may file in a member state with a low tax rate is of no consequence, given that the member state may only get a small share of the allocated profits.  Having the main taxpayer in that member state does not mean that profits will be taxed at its favourable rate.  The effect of applying the formula is that it does not matter where a company files its tax returns, as the allocation of profits is not decided on that basis, but on the basis of where its assets, payroll and-----</p></speech>

I am referring specifically to Ireland, which has a small open economy.  We survive on exports.  We have a population of approximately 5 million people.

What would happen in that case?</p></speech>

We believe that a formula is a better measure of ensuring that profits are taxed where they are generated than the current practices based on transfer pricing, which allow for a far greater degree of shifting profits to where they may be taxed at a lower rate rather than where they have been generated.</p></speech>

The base erosion and profit shifting measures are extremely important and that is why we support them and why we have proposals to introduce them in the EU but they address the consequences of base erosion and profit-shifting.  The CCCTB addresses the problem at the root, so we believe it is more effective.</p></speech>

This has been around since the year dot.  It is like an old model of a car that the manufacturer keeps bringing out year after year.  It will never sell.  How will a multinational based in Ireland that makes a large proportion of its sales in the UK be taxed under the CCCTB if Brexit - as proposed and signposted - happens and Britain is outside the EU?  That is a major question in an Irish context.</p></speech>

If we are talking about relations with a third country, then that still continues to apply.</p></speech>
