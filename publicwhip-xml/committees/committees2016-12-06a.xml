    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1268" speakername="Pat Deering" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2016120600002#B00200"><p>I remind members and those in the Public Gallery to make sure their mobile phones are completely switched off.</p> <p>  This meeting has been convened to consider a Supplementary Estimate relating to Vote 30 - Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which was referred by the D&aacute;il to the committee on 22 November 2016 with an instruction to report back to the D&aacute;il no later than 8 December 2016.  On behalf of the committee I welcome the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed.  I also welcome officials from the Department and thank them for the briefing material that has been circulated to the committee.  </p> <p>  The format for today's meeting is as follows: the Minister will give a brief address to the committee after which members who indicate they want to speak will have the opportunity to make a brief response, if they wish.  We can then consider the Supplementary Estimate.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  </p> <p>  I remind members that in accordance with Standing Orders, discussion should be confined to the items constituting the Supplementary Estimate only.  I ask members if possible please to indicate the subhead they are referring to when they make a contribution.  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2016120600002#B00300"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to present this request for a technical Supplementary Estimate for 2016 in which I am seeking the committee's approval to use savings on the Department's Vote to fund other desired expenditure.  As these proposed transfers and expenditure involve significant changes to the original 2016 voted allocations, I believe it is important to seek the committee's input and approval.  Specifically, this technical Supplementary Estimate will transfer &euro;20 million of savings in certain areas of the Vote to bring forward expenditure commitments due in 2017 under the World Food Programme, WFP, and also transfer a further &euro;13.9 million of other savings to fund the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, agriculture cashflow support loan scheme, which I announced in budget 2017 in October.</p> <p>  The &euro;33.9 million current funds required would be transferred from various subheads where, due to changed circumstances, savings have emerged, most notably in the administrative budget pay and non-pay subheads, the fisheries fleet decommissioning scheme which is not yet in place, the seafood development programme, technical costs associated with the operation of European Union, EU, schemes, the green low carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, training, research, the early retirement scheme and the food safety animal health and welfare programme.  </p> <p>  In 2015, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform lifted the moratorium on recruitment and delegated responsibility for managing my Department's human resources to the Secretary General.  This removed the numbers threshold my Department operated under during the moratorium and provided flexibility to recruit and deploy resources subject to adherence to specified pay ceilings.  My Department's management board continually assesses our critical business needs and our human resources division works closely with our recruitment partners, the Public Appointments Service, PAS, to fill those needs.  </p> <p>  The recruitment process has been slower than we would have liked, due mainly to the significant pressure on the PAS system from across the public sector.  To date in 2016, my Department has recruited 110 new staff across a range of skills sets.  Our aim is to build the Department's resource levels to 3,200 by the end of 2017 with the right mix of skills, experience and competences to ensure we continue to deliver a high quality service.  The delay in the recruitment process will give rise to a saving of approximately &euro;13.5 million in the 2016 payroll allocation.  A further &euro;1 million will be saved over various non-pay subheads under the administrative budget in the Department.</p> <p>  Our seafood sector is worth in the region of &euro;850 million annually to our economy and I am aiming to achieve &euro;1 billion in sales by 2020.  A key driver of this increase will be the &euro;240 million European maritime and fisheries fund, EMFF, operational programme which was officially launched in January 2016.  Schemes under the programme will assist seafood enterprises to sustainably grow their production, add value to our seafood exports and create much needed employment in our coastal communities. </p> <p>  I made some &euro;36 million available in 2016 for the EMFF operational programme in the budgets of my Department and its agencies to get the new schemes up and running.  However, there are some savings this year as schemes roll out.  There will be a saving in region of &euro;8.5 million on Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM's, 2016 current expenditure budget primarily because a proposed fleet decommissioning scheme did not start this year. </p> <p>  There will also be some &euro;1.5 million current savings on other EMFF budgets managed by my Department.  These savings identified this year will not affect the overall budget available for the seafood sector under the EMFF operational programme as these investments will occur over the later years of the programme.  To demonstrate my continued commitment to the EMFF operational programme, I have made available an increased budget of &euro;43 million, up from this year's amount of &euro;36 million, for the EMFF in 2017 across the budgets of my Department and its agencies. </p> <p>  It is also anticipated that savings of just over &euro;2.5 million will be achieved in the animal health and welfare area due to reduced instance of disease.  These savings are expected in the tuberculosis, TB, eradication area, where the generally positive situation in TB has been maintained.  However, I know difficulties continue in some areas and we cannot be complacent about the future.  Expenditure on the control of horses scheme is also lower this year than anticipated </p> <p>  There will be savings of some &euro;2.5 million under the agri-environmental scheme specifically in the training allocation under GLAS and some &euro;3 million will be saved under the subhead for market support and clearance of accounts which covers potential financing costs associated with the operation of common agricultural policy, CAP, schemes and also the costs associated with the land parcel identification scheme, LPIS, upgrade project.  Other savings are in the early retirement scheme and research grants where the drawdown of funding following awards made under the most recent research call has been slightly slower than expected.</p> <p>  Overall, these current expenditure savings amount to some &euro;33.914 million and these savings, with the committee's approval, will be transferred to the World Food Programme area.  The additional &euro;20 million provided for the WFP in this Supplementary Estimate represents an advance payment of next year's commitment under Ireland's strategic partnership agreement with the WFP.  This earlier disbursement is at the request of the WFP&rsquo;s executive director, who has written to inform me that this funding will make a significant contribution that will enhance the WFP's capability to plan its interventions and better address the many growing humanitarian crises around the world.</p> <p>  My Department leads on Ireland's engagement with the UN's World Food Programme.  The WFP is the largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide and is funded exclusively from voluntary contributions.  It is responsible for the delivery of food assistance to the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world and feeds 80 million of the most malnourished people in 80 countries.  It works in partnership with other UN and international organisations, non-governmental organisations, NGOs, civil society and the private sector to enable communities and countries to meet their own food needs. </p> <p>  The WFP also plays a significant role in the UN's global campaign for zero hunger, and is at the forefront of dealing with the migration crisis.  This contribution will help save lives and support food security and nutrition and rebuild livelihoods in fragile settings.  Ireland has a strategic partnership agreement with the WFP which doubles Ireland's core annual multilateral contribution to the WFP to &euro;20 million for the years 2016 to 2018.  This follows a commitment that Ireland made at last year's Expo Milan event to support WFP.  This funding, while generally targeted at the WFP's emergency and protracted relief operations, is provided on an un-earmarked basis which gives the WFP the flexibility to plan and target this funding in the most strategic, efficient and effective manner.</p> <p>  While this increased commitment is provided on an un-earmarked basis for the reasons I have outlined, it represents a key element of the Government's enhanced and increased response to the ongoing refugee crisis associated with the conflict in Syria.  In particular, it is a significant part of Ireland's contribution to the EU's response to this refugee crisis.</p><p>This contribution enables life-saving assistance for people living on the front lines of hunger, conflict and climate change and reaffirms Ireland's role as one of the World Food Programme's most engaged partners.  Ireland's multi-annual commitment facilitates effective assistance for hungry and malnourished people, particularly in regions devastated by war.<br/><br/>Some &euro;13 million of savings identified will be used for the agriculture cash flow support loan scheme that I announced on budget day.  In September this year, in response to market difficulties being experienced by milk producers and farmers in other livestock sectors, the European Commission made a package of exceptional adjustment aid measures available to members under Regulation (EU) 2016/1613, including an allocation to Ireland of just over &euro;11 million.  The &euro;13.9 million of the Vote savings identified will be used to provide additional funding for loans for livestock sectors and a parallel product to be made available under <i>de minimis</i>state aid to all other farmers, particularly those involved in tillage and horticulture.  This innovative scheme will primarily provide loans to enable farmers to pay down expensive forms of credit, such as merchant credit and other short-term credit facilities like overdrafts, improve management of their cash flow and reduce the cost of short-term borrowings.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, aims to make these loans available in the market by the end of January 2017.  The scheme, with total funding of &euro;150 million, will support highly-flexible loans for up to six years for amounts of up to &euro;150,000 at an interest rate of 2.95%.  This rate will represent a significant saving for farmers when compared with other forms of unsecured short-term finance currently available.  The loans will be flexible, with interest-only facilities of up to three years.  Normal lending assessment criteria will apply, although as the loans will be unsecured, it will facilitate a more straightforward application process.<br/><br/>I announced earlier this month that the SBCI had invited financial institutions to take part in the agriculture cash flow support loan scheme and a number of applications were submitted by the closing date of 25 November.  These will now be the subject of a formal approval process to be completed in the coming weeks, with the outcome to be announced at the start of the new year.  I encourage farmers to consider their cash flow and borrowing position now, and if appropriate to their circumstances to be prepared to apply for these loans when they become available.<br/><br/>This is a technical Supplementary Estimate and the savings outlined will be used to fund both the World Food Programme and the SBCI agricultural cash flow support loan scheme.  I earnestly recommend this Supplementary Estimate to the committee for support.  I am happy to respond to any questions members may wish to pose.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2016120600002#C00200"><p>It is grand that there is spare money available.  I will make two points to the Minister.  "Underspend" would be the wrong word to use regarding the tuberculosis scheme, with  &euro;2.5 million saved as a result of the lower number of reactors.  I raised this matter recently with the Minister.  In the dairy sector in particular, a couple of depopulations have occurred.  By the time these farmers repopulate their herds, on foot of the changed environment in dairy markets, the price of replacement stock will be greatly increased in comparison with the price at the time of depopulation.  A herd may be fully depopulated at the end of October, when cows are at the end of the lactation year and a farmer must repopulate in March and April, when dairy cow prices are at a premium.  People in this position would probably see a differential of between 30% or 35% when it comes to repopulation.  This would amount to &euro;400 or &euro;500 per cow and when a herd has been fully depopulated, it would create financial hardship.</p> <p>  When a person's herd is fully depopulated and is out for a period of four to six months, for example, and there is a market discrepancy when animals are being bought, there should be some mechanism for compensating that farmer.  When the scheme was introduced, the principle was that if, for example, 120 cows were lost, the farmer would be able to replace them like for like when restrictions were lifted.  At the back end of this year, dairy cow prices were at a low ebb, valuations were done and farmers whose herds have been depopulated received a certain price.  I am not saying that the valuations were wrong but when the farmers involved seek to repopulate their herds in March, they will be seriously out of pocket.  As there is an underspend, could the issue of restocking farmers' herds be considered?  Could there be some equalisation in respect of the valuations received by these farmers?</p> <p>  We all know the hardship endured by grain farmers as a result of the 2016 harvest.  Before this meeting, I met a group of dairy farmers with a proposal seeking &euro;3 million in compensation for the hardship endured due to the loss of crops and straw.  To underline the scarcity of straw in this country, prices have doubled in the past month.  Farmers are worst hit only in December but by the time March comes around, straw will be as scarce as a hen's teeth.  We have spare money and although the World Food Programme project for which it is earmarked is worthy of investment, could some of those funds be diverted to these farmers?  As a result of the exceptional circumstances with the weather, they only salvaged part of their crops and lost all their straw.  They have suffered significant losses.  They are looking for &euro;3 million for 400 farmers, which works out at &euro;7,500 per farmer.  It would do something to ease their cash flow crisis.  We have the money so should we not look at allocating some of it in the way I am suggesting?  We have done it before for horticulture farmers and it was done when there was wind damage to forestry as well.  With the Russian export ban, the European Union put much money into eastern Europe.  The &euro;20 million is spare in the budget so could &euro;3 million be allocated to grain farmers.  It is not much when we consider the hardship they have suffered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2016120600002#C00300"><p>It is clear that the position regarding grain farmers is one of great concern.  Not alone have farmers lost all their crops but the Minister knows that since approximately 2012, more than 100,000 acres has been lost from the grain sector.  That trend is likely to continue in view of what happened in the past year, with negative margins prevailing.  Everybody has lost &euro;150 to &euro;200 per hectare or even more if we add in the loss of straw, as described by Deputy Cahill.  As everyone lost straw, there will be much demand for the limited straw that is available, meaning the prices will increase.  Some farmers lost up to 50% of their yield and some individuals even lost more.  The farmers in the western seaboard counties of Mayo, Galway, Kerry, Donegal, Longford, Roscommon and Cork were affected.  In my county, approximately 14 or 15 farmers were fairly significantly impeded.</p> <p>  I know that these farmers are seeking a particular direct aid scheme and the Minister will probably look to work through the scheme he has devised for the SBCI.  The loans with rates of less than 3% applying would be a huge help when it comes to merchant credit and short-term financial facilities.  It is of some use but it is far down the line.  The applications for the cash flow support loan scheme must be evaluated and I hope the process will not be slow.  It should not be as there are only four or five applications.  I worry about the bureaucracy as people might not be happy with the i's being dotted and the t's crossed; they go back to rerun the show in a circular fashion.  This better be done by January.  The Minister gave some very eloquent presentations, which I acknowledge.  I know the mushroom industry will be covered by the SBCI scheme but it is a case of live horse, get grass.  The mushroom industry has been under pressure for the past three months.  Most mushroom farmers want to get over the hump now and know if they do, they will survive to be competitive in future.</p><p>Brexit will not last forever, notwithstanding that my original view was that it would take five years.  That might now be a conservative view, which highlights the uncertainty.  The Minister's proposal regarding the SBCI is a good idea.  Some of this money will create further capacity.  Am I correct that he will use it in that regard?  If it only took &euro;3 million to help grain farmers, they would be in big trouble otherwise.  I appeal to the Minister to do something with greater immediacy than what is planned with the SBCI income cash support.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2016120600002#D00200"><p>I thank the Deputies for their questions.  With regard to Deputy Cahill's question about the TB compensation scheme, the savings will be &euro;1.5 million, not &euro;2.5 million.  Those savings are as a consequence of the fact that we made provision on the basis of trends and expectations and, fortunately, the incidence of the disease reduced from 3.25% of herds to 3.18%.  Though the number of herds is down, there was a slight increase in the overall number of TB reactors.  The provision made for drawdown has not been reached and that is something to celebrate.  The scheme is working well.</p><p>The Deputy asked about individual farmers and the compensation scheme.  I understand his point and we have discussed it both formally and informally, but the problem is that the scheme was designed in consultation with the farming organisations and modifications to it only took place recently.  I cannot vary the terms of the scheme for an individual holding but I take the Deputy's point.  It depends on timing.  We face into a spring in which the indications are milk prices will increase and, as a consequence, the price of spring heifers dairy cows will increase.  I accept that will make it more costly for somebody who has been depopulated to re-enter the market.  The scheme was devised in consultation with the farming organisations but it comes up for review.  It is not written on tablets of stone but, unfortunately, the most recent modifications were only signed off in the early days of my tenure.  It will be up for review again and, by that stage, the individual whose circumstances the Deputy has raised will have moved on but my Department keeps the scheme under constant review and the issue will be raised in consultations with the farming organisations.</p><p>Both Deputies raised the issue of grain farmers.  I am acutely conscious of this because I have met them in my own constituency.  I have met farm organisations representatives also in counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim and I understand the points they have made.  I concur with Deputy Penrose regarding the scarcity of straw.  There is little feed value in any straw as a consequence of the weather.  There was a perfect storm in many respects in the endeavours to get in the harvest.  When this issue was raging in the autumn, I undertook post-harvest to convene a stakeholders meeting.  All the relevant bodies were represented, including the farm organisations and the millers.  One of the interesting issues raised by the farmers and the merchants, in particular, was access to affordable finance.  One of the startling observations made by a miller was that 80% of spring barley is sold on merchant credit, which is one of the most expensive forms of credit that farmers use.  This issue was raised by every farm organisation in the context of the recent budget.  We faced a scenario where we had &euro;11.1 million in funding coming from Europe as a result of the July package, which was available for livestock both in the dairy and beef sectors.  We felt that if we spread that between 100,000 livestock farmers, it would make no meaningful or significant contribution to the difficulties they faced.</p><p>Given the common thread among all organisations, including those representing tillage farmers, was access to affordable finance, we examined how we could provide matching funds.  We put more than matching funds by providing &euro;14 million to extend the availability of the loan scheme not just to livestock farmers, but to the tillage sector as well.  The product with a &euro;150,000 maximum loan, low interest rate and other terms is not available anywhere else and that is well documented.  We extended the scheme under <i>de minimis</i>state aid rules to the tillage sector because there is a framework under which we are permitted to put assistance from the Exchequer into a particular sector.  We availed of the maximum liberty available to extend the scheme.  Where somebody avails of the maximum loan, that is the equivalent over three years of the &euro;15,000 threshold available under state aid rules.  That is not the solution for everybody who faces this difficulty but it will help some farmers in making decisions.  I appreciate time has moved on and most of them have made decisions to plan for winter barley or spring barley.  The scheme will make that more affordable.</p><p>There are other significant issues in the industry, not least the fact that 50% of the crop is grown on rented land, which is a major cost and which is questionable in the context of the viability of these enterprises.  Farmers are paying top dollar and that land is being chased by other enterprises, particularly grass and dairy farmers.  Individual farmers have to weigh up the affordability issue.  The grain sector is critical.  I would hate to see people exiting the sector in droves because the herd is expanding, particularly in the dairy sector, which will bring its own demand for ruminant feed.  However, the sector has to be based on a solid economic rationale.  One of the many issues is access to affordable finance and we have done something that is allowed under state aid rules.  I have extended the knowledge transfer programme, which was only available to the beef and dairy sectors previously, to the tillage sector.  I will announce in January the detail of the tillage TAMS.  I am open to keeping this issue under observation but limited resources are available and, equally, there is a legal framework which I cannot breach in respect of state aid rules.  I have exercised some of the discretion we have in that regard through the SBCI lending scheme.</p><p>In response to Deputy Penrose, Mr. Nick Ashmore attended a recent meeting of the Beef Forum where he confirmed that the January date for the scheme is still on target.  The call for partners, including the pillar banks which have responded, went out recently to roll out the scheme.  As the Deputy said, it will be made available to the mushroom sector.</p><p>This will help the mushroom sector, but Brexit produces very difficult circumstances.  Some businesses have gone to the wall already.  In the budget, we also increased the funding available under the capital grants scheme run by my Department for the mushroom sector and we fund the mushroom producer organisations.</p><p> I think that addresses some of the questions raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2016120600002#E00200"><p>I thank the Minister and his officials for attending.  I apologise for the delay in my arrival.  I have a few points to raise.  I am conscious that I missed the Minister's opening statement, but regarding his identification of the &euro;33 million he is reallocating, the second largest reallocation seems to relate to Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Proportionally, the amount involved is quite large in terms of Bord Iascaigh Mhara's budget, at 21%, and he is now proposing to reallocate it by means of the Supplementary Estimate.  I ask him to elaborate on the 21% reduction in the figure for Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  A fleet decommissioning  that is due to take place has not yet started but it seems to form part of the figure.  Is that the entirety of it?  If not, what else is involved?</p> <p>  My colleagues raised with the Minister the issue of the tillage sector and the pressure under which it finds itself, but it is particularly important to re-emphasise this.  I have raised the matter in the D&aacute;il with the Minister and the Taoiseach.  Unfortunately, at Question Time last week, the Minister indicated very definitively that there will be no crisis fund for the tillage farmers.  It is very much a minority of tillage farmers, but many among that minority have lost a significant proportion of their crop and are in a very difficult financial position as a result, particularly on the back of the past three years when the sector was not profitable.  This is a real issue.  The Minister indicated that those affected will be eligible for the SBCI loan fund.  However, this simply does not meet the needs of that identified minority of tillage farmers.  The Minister and the Government need to reconsider this matter and find funding which can be used to support those who are in dire need and experiencing cash flow pressures.  The committee will meet representatives of the tillage sector later but this issue is of the utmost importance now.</p> <p>  Regarding the updated Estimates published last week, at that stage the Department was &euro;222 million behind profile for the year.  A significant proportion, &euro;177 million, of that was recurrent and &euro;45 million was capital.  A significant part of this seems to be due to the fact that GLAS payments have not been processed.  Can the Minister elaborate on this?  I received a number of calls from constituents who have not got their GLAS payments and who have been informed-----</p></speech>

Regarding a potential additional underspend, can the Minister indicate whether there will be - or, at this stage, whether his Department envisages there to be - an underspend at the end of the year in respect of his Department's Vote?  If so, what will be the amount involved?  As already indicated, last week the amount stood at &euro;222 million.  What does the Minister project the figure might be at this point?  How much of this is due to the processing of payments being delayed as a result of IT or administrative difficulties within the Department?</p> <p>  Regarding the SBCI fund in respect of which the Minister has submitted this Supplementary Estimate today, can he elaborate further on exactly how this will work in terms of the State and EU allocations?  To what purpose exactly will the &euro;24 million be put?  Will it be loaned directly to farmers or is it there to insure the risk for the banks?  If the latter is the case, does the Minister expect that a significant proportion of the &euro;24 million may not be spent but will simply be there as insurance and that it may be recirculated at a later date for further use?  Exactly what is the structure of this and how will it work?</p></speech>

I would have thought that extra funding would be required for research and training in light of Brexit and at a time when we are seeking to access more and more markets and when increasing numbers of students want to enter third-level education?  Does the reduction relate to a different fund or is it to this fund?</p></speech>

Regarding his persistent line of prosecution that we are underspending on the rural development programme, the reality is that we are behind profile on it.  As a result of the fact that GLAS payments are made in December, we will have our spending under GLAS on target by the end of the month.  All those awaiting GLAS payments know that they are issued in December.</p><p>Regarding the crisis fund, I appreciate the points the Deputy raises in respect of the tillage sector.  As I said earlier, I met the chairman of Donegal IFA while on a visit to the county and I understand the issues raised.  However, even if I had an open amount of resources, I am legally constrained by state-aid rules in the context of what I can do.  Given that access to affordable finance was a common thread in the views expressed at the stakeholders' forum and in all the pre-budget submissions we received from farmers' organisations and others, we thought it a reasonable proposition to use the <i>de minimis</i>provision that exists under state-aid rules to leverage the &euro;150 million loan fund at much more affordable interest rates than previously.  We have used the latitude we have under state-aid rules, that is, the <i>de minimis</i>provision.  If somebody draws down the maximum SBCI loan over a three-year period - I appreciate that not everybody will do so - he or she will avail of the maximum <i>de minimis</i>provisions available from the EU.</p><p>Deputy McConalogue also made the point that the &euro;7.5 million relating to Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, seems to be the largest savings figure.  He referenced the decommissioning scheme.  The &euro;7.5 million is significant to BIM and does relate to decommissioning.  There is a saving of approximately &euro;500,000 in pay in BIM.  Overall, however, the largest headline saving in my Department, interestingly, is on the administrative side, at &euro;13.5 million, on the basis of intended recruitment of additional staff because of the embargo for several years and voluntary redundancies on top of that.  We have a number of emerging gaps in the skill set required in the Department.  Due to the fact that - within a controlled framework - some latitude was granted to State agencies and Departments to hire additional staff last year, the Public Appointments Service was busier than usual.  Therefore, anticipated recruitment of additional staff in 2016 did not take place and there is a saving of about &euro;13.5 million as a result.</p><p>Regarding the SBCI and the purpose of the &euro;25 million, which consists of &euro;14 million in Exchequer and &euro;11 million in EU funding, it has gone into leveraging the fund.  There is approximately &euro;100 million in European investment funding and in the region of &euro;50 million in SBCI funding.</p><p>The sum of &euro;25 million is in the context of a subsidy to the interest rate that farmers will pay and a guarantee against first losses.  The provision makes the fund more affordable for anyone who avails of it.  The purpose of the &euro;25 million is to make sure that the product is more affordable.</p><p> The reason for the scheme is evident when one considers the Q1 Central Bank report of 2016 as it made reference to the cost of finance in Ireland relative to other EU member states.  The report clearly shows that other countries had access to more affordable finance.  If I recall the detail correctly, Austria led the way with products available at 2.2% and Ireland had a significantly higher rate.  The provision of &euro;25 million does something to address the matter.  I hope, as a consequence, it will force more competition in the market not just from the pillar banks but from other players to make finance more affordable for farmers.  </p><p> Recently Deputy Cahill and I attended a meeting in Limerick with the ICMSA.  On that occasion a farmer said that the KBC Bank was offering a product at the same interest rate.  I do not know whether he or she compared similar products.  If it is the case then the step is welcome.  </p><p> I ask the Chairman to repeat his question.</p></speech>

Harvest 2020 included a target of 100 specialist dairy farm managers per year to graduate from a Teagasc scheme but only 25 entrants per year apply for the scheme.  To elaborate on a point made by the Chairman, surely we should increase the training fund rather than have an underspend.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned that State aid rules prevent him from giving a specialist allocation to grain farmers following the grain crisis.  How did we get over the same problem for the horticultural group?  When forestry was savaged by high winds a significant payment per hectacre was given to the owners of the forestry.  The EU provided &euro;450 million to farmers in eastern Europe when the ban on exports to Russia was introduced.  How were we able to get around the State rules for the horticultural and forestry sectors but cannot circumvent the rules now?</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to clarify whether there will be an underspend in his Department's projections come 31 December in terms of budget 2016.  We have debated the rural development programme a number of times, particularly the overall envelope for the seven year cap for GLAS.</p><p>I wish to specifically refer to the Department's 2016 budget.  The Minister has stated that the current underspend will be reallocated into the Supplementary Estimate.  Aside from that.  Does he expect all funds to be spent by the end of 2016?  Do the Department's figures show an underspend at this point? </p><p>In respect of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, funding and the &euro;24 million that Europe and this Supplementary Estimate is putting towards the &euro;150 million loan fund, the Minister has indicated that the &euro;24 million of EU and domestic funding will go towards two aspects.  First, interest rate amelioration or funding part of the reduced interest rate that farmers can avail of and, second, the funding will ensure against first loss.  I ask the Minister to flesh out how these initiatives will work.  What proportion of the &euro;24 million has been dedicated towards reducing the interest rate?  Will the banks receive payment from the &euro;24 million to provide a lower interest rate?  I ask the Minister to explain the matter and the insurance part.</p><p>I have another question on the &euro;24 million.  Once the loan fund is finished and runs its course - and if there are no significant losses to be borne by the State or banks do not have to be recompensed due to no guarantee being required from individual lenders to the banks, if there are not sufficient losses to be covered - will a good proportion of the &euro;24 million be returned to the State for further use?  If so, will it fund further financial instruments afterwards?  </p><p>I support the point made by Deputy Cahill about the <i>de minimis</i>rule.  The Minister has given the impression that tillage farmers and farming organisations did not ask for credit or a crisis fund.  He took the main theme to be that they wanted loans.  I got a different reaction from the farming organisations.  I remember that they asked for a crisis fund when the crisis took hold.  The farming organisations quite clearly called for a crisis fund.  I ask the Minister to clarify the matter.  </p><p>As much as &euro;20 million of the Supplementary Estimate will go towards the UN World Food Programme that is not due until next year.  Does that mean that the &euro;20 million the Minister planned to spend on WFP next year will be available in the 2017 budget for other purposes?  Is the money in addition to what will be spent next year?  </p></speech>

We are not talking about savings in the Teagasc budget in terms of the Supplementary Estimate.  The savings on the research side do not have anything to do with Teagasc.  They are calls that the Department makes for funding it has available for various research projects.  Once it makes an allocation or contract to the successful bidder for the funding the drawdown is then in the hands of the successful applicant, subject to certain terms and conditions.  As I have identified here, the successful applicants have not triggered the drawdown yet but the allocations have been made.  The funding has been made available under what is known as the Food Institutional Research Measure, FIRM, and the Research Stimulus Fund, RSF, allocations.  They are not savings in the Teagasc budget.</p><p>On the issue of circumventing State aid rules, if it is an EU initiative as it would have been in other schemes then State aid rules do not apply.  The Commission has made allocations previously.  In terms of the SBCI fund we have invested &euro;14 million of Exchequer funding and availed of the latitude available under the <i>de minimis</i>rules to include a sector that was not included in the July package when the Commission made &euro;11 million available to the livestock sector.</p><p>I can quote Deputy McConalogue chapter and verse as proof that all of the farming organisations raised the issue of affordable finance.  One of the farming organisations would have preferred if the &euro;11 million was ring-fenced entirely for a specific subset of the livestock sector.  We took the view that it was not-----</p></speech>

There are no proposals from the French authorities or the Commission that we have not supported, but we have not seen any prospect of a Commission rescue package for the tillage sector emerging at European Council level.  I ask the Deputy to believe me what I say we would be in the vanguard if such a package were to be made available.  It has been suggested we are not supporting a French initiative in this area for some reason, but that is not the case.  There is no substance or truth in that suggestion.  A specific provision of &euro;11.1 million has been made for the livestock sector within the &euro;150 million loan scheme fund to be administered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  A further &euro;4 million has been ringfenced for the non-livestock sector, including tillage.  We have to monitor its drawdown to ensure each sector will receive the appropriate amount.

What we are reallocating is current expenditure in 2016.  As we have flagged previously, there will be an underspend in other areas of capital budgets such as TAMS.  We issued TAMS approvals and farmers applied in good faith.  This has been a particularly difficult year for those involved in some of the schemes, including on the dairy side and in the livestock sector.  The profile of claims for grant approval coming through suggests much of the work has not been done in 2016 for prudent financial reasons.  Obviously, these entitlements will be honoured in 2017.  For example, there are some savings on the Haulbowline remediation project, a legacy issue for the Government that landed in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The funding provided for Cork County Council for the project from the Department's capital allocation has not been drawn down.  The expected drawdown has not happened in some other areas of the capital funding scheme, including TAMS.  The complete profile on the capital side will not be apparent until the end of the year, but we will make it available when we have it.</p></speech>

It could not have anticipated it.  In 2015 there were big yields but low margins in the tillage sector.  That covered a multitude.  However, there has been a total collapse in 2016, particularly on the western seaboard, from Deputy Charlie McConalogue's county down.  It has even stretched to County Longford and across the midlands.  Surely it is not beyond the Department to make a particular case to the European Commission.  The case that needs to be made is that this problem requires an input and the Commission should play a role in that regard.  The impact of weather events on our potential means that they rank among the extraordinary <i>force majeure</i>events.  If farmers in the sector have lost on average &euro;25,000 per annum, or &euro;100,000 in the past four years or so, where is this going to go?  Will there be a grain sector?  This will have huge knock-on effects on other areas also.  I refer not only to the cattle, beef, sheep and milk industries but also to those involved in malting, etc.  Can we not claim exceptional circumstances in this context?  I understand the Minister's point about working capital.  Certainly, a rate of 2.95% is an awful lot better than what has been available.  It is a little over one third of what was being charged by some of the commercial banks for a while.  We had better be careful to acknowledge that it is helpful.  Can the Minister not stretch it?  I made a similar suggestion when I was looking for something different for the mushroom industry.  Like Deputy Charlie McConalogue, I understood the farming organisations were looking for a particular crisis fund of up to &euro;15,000 per farmer that could be distributed.  Perhaps I was wrong in that understanding.  Perhaps they have two ways of submitting things.  I might have been wrong in how I interpreted the matter.</p></speech>

To be fair, all of them have raised with me the specific issue in the tillage sector.  Unfortunately, I am constrained on two fronts.  First, I do not have an endless amount of resources because I used what scope I had to invest in the loan fund.  Second, I am legally constrained by the <i>de minimis</i>rules in the aid I can provide.  Although the tillage sector is important in the context of our agricultural activity, we are a relatively small player at EU level.  There has not been a clamour from the major grain growing states, particularly France, Poland, Hungary and Romania, for a rescue package.  If that happens, we will certainly hitch our wagon to that momentum.  There is no evidence, however, that a realistic campaign by the major grain growing countries for a compensation package is under way.  I appreciate that there has been a very difficult global tillage scenario for a number of years.  The bumper harvests that have been accompanied by downward pressures on prices are having a spillover effect.</p></speech>

I would also like him to clarify specifically that no direct payments to the banks to cover the cost of the reduced interest rate will be made from the &euro;24 million being provided for the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland fund.  In addition, will he clarify clearly the restraints imposed on the tillage sector by the <i>de minimis </i>rules?  How much leeway is available to the sector?  Is it available to the sector as a whole?  Are there limits to the support that can be given to each individual tillage farmer?  I understand the Minister's point about resources, but I remind him that &euro;20 million which was due to be paid to the World Food Programme next year is now to be paid this year.  My guess is that this &euro;20 million will not have to come out of next year's budget.  I suggest it could potentially have been used this year to support the tillage sector.  Will the Minister crystallise exactly what the <i>de minimis</i>rule restraints are in this regard?  Why is flexibility not being shown on a crisis fund specifically dedicated towards farmers who have lost crops?</p><p>Why could the Minister not have used some of the &euro;20 million this year to support those farmers who were in an awful financial way as a result of the year they had?</p></speech>

As a general rule, there is a prohibition in Europe on a state bailing out any particular sector or giving it an advantage relative to its other competitors across the EU.  Whether it is dairy, beef or tillage, we could not, even if we had the resources, give a specific capital injection or assistance because it would be deemed illegal under current EU trading regulations.  That is the general rule.  We cannot offer that state aid.  There is an exception to that in certain circumstances, referred to as &quot;<i>de minimus</i>&quot; provisions whereby one can provide a certain amount of it.  Under the SBCI loan scheme, a farmer drawing the maximum loan would reach the <i>de minimus</i>threshold of assistance the State can give over a three-year period.</p></speech>

Therefore, under <i>de minimus</i>rules, the Minister would not be prevented from using some of the underspend in this year's current budget to provide a crisis fund to the tillage sector.</p></speech>

The same farmer just would not be able to avail of it twice.  A farmer in crisis because he or she lost the crop who avails of the crisis fund would therefore be debarred from availing of the loan fund.  Just to be clear, my view from what we have just teased out is that there is nothing under the <i>de minimus</i>rules which prevents the Minister from providing a crisis fund to the tillage sector.  The only condition for anyone who avails of such a crisis fund is that he or she would not also be able to avail of the loan fund.</p></speech>

In terms of the limited resources we have, we have put some &euro;14 million into the loan fund.  I based it on the basis that this was one of the asks.  I appreciate that there were a whole host of things, but I do not have an endless supply of funds, so I availed of what was there.  I have engaged with the farm organisations and they have asked post the budget for something to be done on the tillage side.  We have specifically made provision that some of them will avail of in the context of the SBCI loan fund.  They have also asked, to be fair, on the beef side for &euro;200 per suckler cow, which is a &euro;200 million bailout.  There is no shortage of asks.  There is an ask for a further bailout on the horticulture side.  There are limits on the <i>de minimus</i>aid we can provide and we took the decision to go down the loan fund route.</p></speech>

He could use the &euro;5 million freed up to put a crisis fund in place this autumn for tillage farmers, which is more than Teagasc and the farming organisations estimate is required to support those in the tillage sector who have lost crops.

It is an honour to have been invited to appear before this committee.  I consider this an ideal moment to be here because, as members know, a few weeks ago on 16 November the Commission adopted the autumn package that launches the economic policy co-ordination cycle for 2017.  In addition, only a few days previous to that, on 9 November, the Commission released the autumn forecast.  It is, therefore, a good occasion to discuss issues related with the main policy messages of the Commission to the EU and the euro area, as aggregate entities, and especially for Ireland.  I have learned that the recent reform of the budgetary process in Ireland gives the Parliament a more prominent role in the formation and scrutiny of budgetary proposals.  This is an important development which will enhance transparency and ownership of the fiscal framework in Ireland.  It also gives more sense to my presence before the committee to discuss a broad range of issues linked to economic policies in the euro area and Ireland, including budgetary policies.</p> <p>  I will start by briefly introducing the autumn package where the Commission presents, every year, the economic and social priorities for the European Union in the year ahead.  The package starts the 2017 cycle of economic governance, the European semester, and assesses the euro area member states' draft budgetary plans for 2017.  The package builds on the Commission's 2016 autumn forecast that was released on 9 November.  The core document, where the Commission's sets those priorities, is the annual growth survey.  This year, the Commission calls on member states to redouble their efforts along the virtuous triangle of economic policy; re-launching investment, pursuing structural reforms and ensuring responsible fiscal policies.</p><p>Emphasis is placed on the need to stimulate more inclusive growth and to strengthen competitiveness, innovation and productivity.</p><p> The annual growth survey signals that Europe is experiencing a fragile but relatively resilient and job-intensive recovery.  Its GDP is now higher than before the crisis.  Unemployment is decreasing and investment is growing again.  However, there is no room for complacency.  Some of the tailwinds that have supported the recovery so far are fading.  The legacies of the crisis, notably the social impact, through high unemployment as well as high levels of public and private debt, and the share of non-performing loans, are still far reaching.</p><p> Similar to last year, the policy guidance in the annual growth survey is accompanied by the recommendations on economic policy of the euro area, which are also part of the autumn package.  The fiscal part of the recommendations reflect the main conclusions of a new communication on the euro area's fiscal stance.</p><p> I wish to say a few words on the communication.  The communication starts by recognising that, albeit resilient, the economic recovery is weak and inflation remains well below the 2% target.  In that context, the Commission is calling for a moderately expansionary fiscal stance for the euro area.  It is what the document calls a positive fiscal stance.  The positive fiscal stance refers to both the supportive, that is, expansionary, direction that fiscal policy should take overall and to the quality - I put the emphasis on that - of the composition of the adjustment in terms of repartition of efforts across countries and of the types of expenditure or tax cuts, or both, behind it.  The findings of this communication are reflected in the fiscal aspects of the recommendations on the economic policy of the euro area that also refer to productivity, labour markets, banking union and they also depend on economic and monetary union.</p><p> Another document which is part of the package is the alert mechanism report, AMR, which is also an integral tool of the European semester, which aims to prevent or address macroeconomic imbalances.  The goal is to promote the smooth functioning of the economies of the member states and to prompt the right policy responses within the so-called macroeconomic imbalances procedure.  Based on the analysis in the AMR, the Commission has concluded that in this European semester cycle, 13 countries, including Ireland, will be covered by an in-depth review because imbalances were identified in the analysis presented in the report on the basis of the agreed scoreboard.</p><p> In the previous European semester cycle, imbalances were identified for Ireland in the financial sector, private and public sector debt, and high external liabilities.  The current alert mechanism report highlights similar issues.  Therefore, the Commission considers it would be useful to examine further the persistence of imbalances or their unwinding.  The Commission will present the conclusions of the in-depth reviews as part of its annual country reports in early 2017.</p><p> The analysis and opinion contained in the autumn package are based on the main findings of the Commission's 2016 autumn forecast.  I would summarise the main messages for Ireland as following.  Irish GDP growth surged in 2015, mainly driven by the operations of some multinationals, with little impact on the domestic economy, but underlying economic activity also grew strongly by 4% to 5%.  Domestic demand is projected to expand at robust rates, although risks have increased, also due to the UK referendum.  Employment growth and the continued recovery of wages are forecast to support private consumption over the forecast horizon.  The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 7.6 % in 2018, thanks to continued job creation and despite sizeable population growth.  The contribution of net exports to GDP growth is forecast to be negative this year but to recover in line with global trade over the forecast horizon.  The structural deficit is expected to remain broadly stable in 2016 and to improve gradually by 2018.  The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline to 71.9 % in 2018, contingent on robust GDP growth and primary budget surpluses of more than 1.5 % of GDP per year in 2016 and 2017.</p><p> If I can have another minute, I wish to say a few words on the Commission's opinion on the draft budgetary plan of Ireland, which is currently under the preventative arm and subject to the transitional debt rule.  The Commission has concluded that the budgetary plans for Ireland are broadly compliant with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact, SGP.</p><p> It should be borne in mind that the Commission recalls that the Government's decision to use a large part of volatile, and therefore still uncertain, corporate tax intakes to allocate additional expenditure in 2016 is not in line with Council recommendations of July, in the context of the European semester, which ask Ireland to use windfall gains from better than expected economic and financial conditions to accelerate the deficit and debt reduction.</p><p> After putting on the table this large variety of issues in terms of Ireland and the EU, I will stop here and am ready for a fruitful discussion.  I thank the committee for its invitation and for the attention of members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.74" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1335" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016120600002#C00200"><p>I have a number of questions.  I welcome the delegation from the Commission.  However, I find a contradiction at the heart of the presentation.  Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay spoke of the need to have a moderately expansionary fiscal stance and he said the Commission wants this to happen, yet when we introduced a budget that is expansionary, it was criticised because we did not put the gains we have made into debt reduction.  We were not allowed to have any fiscal expansion.</p> <p>  Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay spoke about the social impact of the crisis and many of the expenditure aspects of the budget are directed towards addressing that impact.  The Commission invited the authorities to take necessary measures to ensure compliance with the SGP.  Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay also spoke about the high level of debt, yet he ignored the role the Commission had as a member of the troika in setting that debt by not giving us any leeway around bondholders and bank debt in particular.  Our hands were tied in terms of expansionary fiscal measures that the Commission otherwise called for.  Could he address the contradiction?</p> <p>  The presentation made by Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay is very like the budget presented by the Government in that it is a Brexit-free zone.</p><p>He spoke about positive tail winds, but the decision by Britain to exit the European Union is a gale on our doorstep.  What impact does Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay believe this will have in 2017 and what short-term impact does he believe it will have on our figures?  Is the Commission willing to assist us in dealing with this impact, given that we are the only country on the front line of this major happening?</p><p> In September, the President of the Commission, Mr. Juncker, spoke about the need for capital expansion and the need to be flexible about the rules on capital expenditure.  We have major capital deficits in this country, which will be addressed during a capital review in 2017.  Will Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay put meat on the President's proposals on relaxing the rules for capital expenditure in particular?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.76" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Carlos Mart&iacute;nez Mongay" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016120600002#D00200"><p>I thank Deputy Calleary for his questions.  I will try to address the so-called contradiction.  I remind the Deputy the Commission communication refers to the fiscal policy stance in the euro area.  The Commission began by analysing the economic cycle in the euro area.  It sees aggregate growth in the euro area as resilient but still low.  It also sees that inflation clearly remains below 2% and that monetary policy in the euro area has already reached the zero lower bound.  Nominal interest rates are zero, which means there is not much room for manoeuvre in monetary policy.</p> <p>  At the same time, the Commission sees aggregate domestic demand in the euro area as still weak.  On this basis, the Commission considers the fiscal policy stance in the euro area should be positive, which means in those member states with room for expansion in fiscal policy it should be expansionary and positive.  In considering the fiscal policy stance of other member states, the Commission also considers the composition of the adjustment, which is the distribution of the adjustment in various countries, so that countries with fiscal policy space which have reached the medium-term objective and have low levels of debt have room to extend fiscal policy, but countries which have not yet achieved the medium-term objective and have high levels of debt, and countries still in excessive deficit, should be broadly compliant.  This is the case for Ireland.  Countries in the corrective arm should continue to consolidate.  Where the level of deficit in public finances remains unaffected, the Commission advocates for less extortionate taxes, broadening tax bases and increasing the relative weight of investment.  This is what the Commission communication states.</p> <p>  With regard to Ireland, the Commission considers Ireland's budgetary plans are broadly compliant.  There are some risks, as the expenditure benchmark may not be fully in line with our recommendations, but Ireland is broadly compliant.  We must take into account the growth rates for Ireland and the euro area are very different.  For Ireland, we project growth at 3.6% a year and 3.5% the year after.  For the euro area, the projection is still 1.5%.  With regard to the cyclical position of the country, without entering into a discussion on calculating the output gap, there is consensus the output gap for Ireland is already positive.  This means there are risks in principle of over hitting it, which means Ireland does not need to put in place expansionary fiscal policies.  In my view, there is no contradiction because we state what the fiscal policy stance of the euro area should be, but we also differentiate between the respective cyclical positions of countries.  In this sense, I would not say there are contradictions.</p> <p>  With regard to flexibility, the Commission published a communication in January 2015, and the Council adopted a commonly agreed position on flexibility and clarified the rules under which there could be some flexibility in investment which is equivalent to structural reform.  We use the structural reform clause of the Stability and Growth Pact to allow for temporary deviations from the adjustments to the medium-term objective to invest more or enhance investment.  The Council stated this clause would apply only to countries with negative growth or a very large negative output gap.  These are the conditions and the Council allows for some deviation.  I can go through the details if the committee wishes, but I would not like to cover all of the issues in this reply.</p> <p>  With regard to what we predict for next year, the entire euro area has been affected by the tail winds.  Of course next year the tail winds may disappear, and therefore we must prepare our economies to be more resilient and ready to adjust to the new conditions.  We can deal with other issues later.</p></speech>

All we know is there was a referendum in which the people of the UK voted to leave the EU.  We also know that after the referendum there was a serious depreciation of the pound.  There was also quite a strong initial temporary impact on the stock markets but they recovered.</p><p>The only stocks on which this had a more permanent impact were those in the banking sector, and that was not only in this country but also in the UK.  It impacted on almost every type of bank almost everywhere in Italy because it was a factor from the beginning of the year.  Apart from that, the stock markets have recovered completely and the impact on risk premium, in particular for this country, was almost non-existent.  What has remained after the referendum is a weaker pound.</p><p> Brexit is another process.  We do not know the structure of the relationships that will exist between the UK and the EU after Britain exits the negotiations because the negotiations have not started.  There are no negotiating positions until Article 50 is activated, which lies only in the hands of the UK Government or authorities.  I do not know if that is something that has to be decided internally in the context of the UK authorities.  It is up to the UK to activate Article 50, and until it is activated, the UK is an EU member state and nothing changes except that we know now that the pound is weaker.  We know that perhaps there will be some impact in terms of confidence in the currency, which will affect mainly investment in the UK, but we have incorporated that in forecasts concerning  the UK.  There are some issues linked mainly to the weaker pound that could favour exports from the UK to the rest of the euro area and make exports from the euro area to the UK more expensive.  Such effects are not yet visible but we have incorporated them in the autumn forecast.  I would like to make clear that we have not incorporated any impact of Brexit simply because we do not know when the Article 50 will be activated.  We do not know how long the negotiations will last.  We know they will have to conclude within two years at most following the activation of Article 50.  We do not know what the structure of the relationships between the UK and the rest of the EU will be after Brexit.  Therefore, we do not know whether we will move to having a Norwegian model or to the World Trade Organization, WTO, rules.</p></speech>

We cannot wait for Article 50 because we export &euro;13.6 billion worth of products to the UK.  In the first six months of 2017, which we are discussing here, many contracts which were negotiated in the first six months of 2016 will be renegotiated on the basis of the new relationship with sterling.  That is impacting on our food and manufacturing industries.  Approximately 40% of our exports are to the UK market.  There are concerns about jobs, and the taxes that accrue from them are essential to our fiscal position in 2017.  Many issues will directly hit us in 2017.  What is the Commission's position on that?  What work has it done to assist or encourage the Irish Government to prepare for that better than it has?</p></speech>

We have taken into account the possible impacts of a weaker pound in our forecasts concerning Ireland.  However, there is also the strength of domestic demand in Ireland together with the fact that it depends on the UK but now its markets in the euro area as a whole and in the rest of world are more important than the UK market.  Therefore, if we have, as we set out in our forecasts, an expanding global economy in terms of global trade, Ireland will benefit.  There will be some sectoral impacts, but as a whole, we see a recovery in Irish exports compared with 2016.</p></speech>

The first one is the Structural Funds and the second one is the contribution to the European fund for strategic investment in terms of capital.  Those contributions are not out of the pack because they affect the level of expenditures but they are considered one-offs, which means they do not feature in the calculations of the structural balance.</p></speech>

He has not commented on the disaster that has happened in Italy, one of the largest member states, and the general sense that the euro is under serious threat.  We are talking as if the euro is very strong and the only weakness is sterling, but I am surprised no comment has been made about the current situation, namely, the state of matters in Italy and the general lack of confidence in the euro that is creeping in.  There does not seem to be anybody, in European terms, making any effort to improve morale in terms of enhancing confidence in our currency.  I find this quite extraordinary.</p></speech>

In explaining that the Commission is proposing an expansionary fiscal policy stance, I said the reasons for that are that growth is low, inflation has not picked up and domestic demand is weak.  Those are the reasons the Commission is proposing that those member states with high current account surpluses should provide support to improve domestic demand.  I am not saying that everything is perfect in Europe and the only weaknesses are on the side of the pound.  The Commission has clearly recognised that growth and activity in the euro area is weak.  This is the reason the Commission has adopted the communication on an expansionary fiscal stance for the euro area.</p></speech>

People in this State would have read the headlines, namely, that the Commission has done a turnaround, austerity is over and now it is all about expansion, which will affect this country.  Regarding the Commission's statement on an expansionary fiscal stance two weeks ago, will Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay confirm that it will have no impact on Ireland's stance, that we will still have the same amount of fiscal space next year, that this will be the total amount, and that the Commission's position does not allow us to go beyond that?</p></speech>

The first type is countries that have reached the medium-term objective or have overachieved the medium-term objective, implying also that their debt levels are low.  In the communication and in its proposal for a recommendation for economic policies in the euro area, the Commission recommends that these countries should use the fiscal space to support aggregate domestic demand.  For countries which have not yet reached the medium-term objective, the Commission says that these countries should be broadly compliant, which is the case for Ireland.  For the countries that are still in the corrective, which means that they still have an excessive deficit, such as France, Spain and Portugal, the Commission says that they should first reduce the excessive deficit.

With regard to Ireland, which is in the middle, having not met the medium-term objective and being in the preventative programme, the Commission statement does not allow us to increase the fiscal space available to us.  Is the Commission recommending that we use the fiscal space available to us in next year's budget?</p></speech>

The witness responded to one of my colleague's questions and he stated that Ireland should not have an expansionary fiscal policy because there are indications that the country could be overheating.

That is the position of the Commission.  If the committee allows it, I would like to refer to an aspect of this communication that is perhaps even more important in the case of Ireland.  It is about the composition of the adjustment and the quality of public finances.  In those cases in which there is no need for an expansionary fiscal policy simply because the country is growing above potential, the Commission is saying that the country has to, on the one hand, reduce possible distortional effects of taxation which cast an impact on potential growth.  On the other hand, the country should enhance the composition of expenditures to make this composition more growth-friendly.  We should invest in more physical infrastructure and human knowledge capital.  That is what the Commission is also recommending for countries like Ireland in which growth is already above potential.  The idea is to increase potential but not to go for a cyclical expansion because the cycle of the cyclical position is already-----</p></speech>

We know that the budget 2017 assessment is broadly complaint in the view of the Commission.  When we look deeper into that, the Commission's view is that the country is showing indications of overheating.  However, that does not necessarily mean that the country stops spending.  What it does mean is that it needs to spend in different ways.  Instead of cyclical year-on-year increases in expenditure or tax cuts, what should happen is investment in the long term, for example, capital investment in roads, housing, health centres and hospitals.  Is that what the Commission is saying?</p></speech>

It is precisely not only about the stabilisation needs and whether the output gap is positive and at risk of overheating, but also about the consolidation need that member states have.  For instance, Ireland, given its high level of public debt, has a consolidation need.  If we look at the countries at which this recommendation was directed, Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, they are countries that, according to the Commission's assessment, have a negative output gap at the moment and no fiscal consolidation need.  We were really looking into both dimensions when we made this recommendation.  Given the high level of public debt that remains, Ireland still has a consolidation need.</p></speech>

Before we move on from the type of expenditure that we should have, I am sure the Commission is looking beyond the economic data, or maybe it is not.  We have huge challenges in this State.  There has been an investment drought here both in the private and public sector for the past decade.  Our capital investment has gone from about &euro;10 billion down to &euro;4 billion.  There are serious cracks now starting to appear.  They are going to become more and more obvious and visible.  We are going to see massive congestion in our infrastructure and roads, particularly around Dublin city and elsewhere, within the next short period.  Our population is continually increasing.  While we went through a terrible period of migration, we are going to see it reverse very quickly.</p> <p>  In my view, the fiscal rules are going to be changed because they are unworkable and because we know that countries are breaking them willy-nilly, to the point that the Germans are calling for the Commission to be sacked and for the role to be given over to another agency of Europe, but we will leave that to one side.  Let us forget about budget 2017.  Budget 2018 for this country has a fiscal space of about &euro;600 million.  We have a crisis in terms of housing, health and a serious problem in infrastructure.  I appreciate the fact we have a high level of debt that has only reduced because the economy has improved.  However, the volume of debt is continually increasing.  At a time when the country can borrow at the lowest it will ever likely be able to borrow at, is it not nearly criminal that we are not investing in the long-term health of our nation by borrowing at this time, building the infrastructure, and making sure that we have houses that can house the homeless and those on waiting lists?  How does the Commission in any way rectify that or allow for it to happen at this point?</p></speech>

If debt is already high, increasing it may increase the country's vulnerability.  To address this, a government uses the idea of a rainy day fund.  It uses extraordinary revenues to reduce debt levels and vulnerability to, for example, volatility in international markets.  The situation is far from stable for some countries.  For Ireland, the impacts of risk premia in recent months have been almost zero.  Other countries, however, have been vulnerable and others can become so.  What is a stable situation can become unstable in, for example, two years.</p><p> I wish to refer to an important issue.  We must consider the revenue side.  We have to ensure an adequate composition of expenditure and a tax base that is broad enough to be stable.  The narrower our tax base, the more unstable our revenues.  Our debts and interest rates increase and our revenue base decreases.  That is not new to this or other countries.</p></speech>

My final question is on volatility in the tax base, with a particular focus on corporation tax, which Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay mentioned.  He has met Professor John McHale and our Minister, so these conversations are being had by the Commission, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, and the Department of Finance.  This is not a new issue.  We have an above average percentage of corporation tax receipts.  Ours is approximately 15% whereas the European average is approximately 10%.  There has been a major surge in recent years.  The Department and Revenue officials tell us that it is permanent.  We have a significant concentration, in that ten companies pay 40% of all corporation tax.  That figure increased from 20% just over ten years ago.</p> <p>  Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay has a bird's eye view across Europe.  Does any other country have such a concentration of taxation receipts in the hands of so few?  He, the IMF and IFAC have stated that there is a vulnerability from our corporation tax receipts.  Is that vulnerability related to their level or their concentration?  Where does our vulnerability rank?</p></speech>

To what did 2015 revision of GDP lead and by whom was it driven?  It was driven by this small number of multinationals that book a series of operations, including intangible assets, in Ireland.  The gross value added, including profits, that they booked in Ireland increased by 20% or more.  Decisions of multinationals are driven by global production factors, but these factors can change and multinationals can move.  In this case, these extraordinary revenues could be used to create a rainy day fund and reduce the debt and deficit.</p> <p>  The November budgetary data that were released yesterday drew my attention.  All revenue targets seemed to have been achieved, but mainly because of corporate taxes.  Consider VAT.  Usually, it is a more stable base, but its revenue target was underachieved.</p></speech>

I mentioned how we would make capital investment.  Given that capital investment does not commit itself each year, would it not be appropriate to use those increases in corporation tax by investing in capital?  Doing that would break the European rules, however.</p></speech>

They are relatively stable.  The projects are one-offs.  To build a bridge, one needs two or three years, but the level of public investment is not a one-off.  There is a minimum of public investment in Ireland.  It is reaching 2% of GDP again.  The total level is a permanent expenditure and is not a one-off.  Therefore, we should not use windfalls to finance public investment.</p></speech>

In Spain, for example, GDP is growing quickly, but its deficit is high and, therefore, debt is not being reduced.  This is not because of whether countries have windfalls.  There are a number of reasons.  There is a new Government in Spain and it is still reverting the situation.  It is in the process of consolidating public finances.  I would not like to refer to a specific country, but what happens depends on the extent to which the deficit trajectory is downward and the denominator is rising.</p></speech>

Surely it flies in the face of the perceived economic wisdom of years to advocate the paying down of debt when interest rates are so low that money can be acquired so cheaply by member states.  Excluding London, which will be excluded from the EU anyway shortly, Dublin is the most expensive city in the EU in which to rent a home.  When this identifiable and significant bottleneck exists in our economy, we should be in a position as a member state to prioritise it for public and private investment and there should be significantly more leeway than there is under the rules to allow us to tackle the problem.</p><p>In the case of the housing sector, the important point is to overcome all the barriers concerning supply.</p></speech>

On the one hand, the State has to find stable revenue sources which is important.  On the other, even if today the State borrows money at low interest rates, in the future when interest rates go up, the State's debt will also balloon.  The burden of the debt will depend on the future interest rates.  The higher the debt, the higher the interest payments will be in the future.  One does not borrow all the debt for, say, 20 years or 50 years.  A small fraction of the debt is at a long-term rate but the rest of the debt has to be refinanced in the short term.</p></speech>

Are the alert mechanism reports picking this up?  Will those reports include Brexit and its uncertainty?  It will affect Ireland more than other country and it should come into the imbalance scorecard.  Other states, such as Portugal, Greece and Italy, have specific circumstances which should give them more leeway in the fiscal rules.</p></speech>

On the one hand, when we talk about monetary policy and the diminishing industrial base, we are talking about two different matters.  One is about monetary policy which is about a commodity.  It is the right policy.  I would not like to comment on monetary policy because the European Central Bank is fully independent.  The other problem the Deputy is referring to is, perhaps, an issue of competitiveness.  It is to what extent productivity in certain countries is too low compared to the level of wages.  Accordingly, these countries are losing competitiveness and, in turn, are losing certain industrial activities in which labour costs are important.  This is totally different from the monetary policy stance.</p> <p>  Concerning the leeway in the current circumstances, for countries in which GDP growth is not strong, the monetary policy is most adequate for them simply because growth is low and, therefore, monetary policy is accommodated.  The problem is not with monetary policy but, for some countries, the need to enact the structural reforms which enhance productivity and, therefore, allow for high living standards.</p> <p>  There is uncertainty around Brexit.  We do not even know when Article 50 will be activated, how it will be activated and how the negotiating process will work.</p></speech>

This uncertainty is a significant factor for us which is already impacting on us.</p></speech>

We do not know what will happen.  I do not believe this is a question of investing more and even less a question of increasing public debt.  It is a question of being resilient and being ready for structural adjustments.  It is a question more of enhancing the structural resilience of the economy.  In certain countries where growth is low but debt is high, fiscal stimulus will not do the job.</p></speech>

The economic logic was that the economy was overheating and, therefore, one cannot buck all of the real correction and one has to overcorrect.  Due to the fact that logic was applied, we missed our target which meant a convergence margin was applied which shrank our fiscal space considerably.  The argument from all the economists this committee met was that Ireland's economy is not actually overheating.  We are at nearly 8% unemployment and there is still potential growth.  It was explained to the committee that the calculation was based on a ten-year rolling average of unemployment.  As Ireland's unemployment through the crash had been so high, if one applied a ten-year rolling average, it looks like Ireland is at full employment or, indeed, past full employment at 8%.  Clearly, it is not.  No economist would suggest Ireland's economy is overheating based on an unemployment rate of 8%.</p> <p>  Accordingly, we found ourselves heavily penalised because the accuracy of a rule which no one would defend was applied to Ireland.  Does the Commission have a view on that?  When we put it to the Irish authorities, the answer was that is the rule and we have to use the ten-year rolling average unemployment and, as such, we are deemed to be overheating.  Accordingly, we are deemed to have missed our target and the fiscal space has been contracted significantly by applying the convergence margin.  When the rules, to which we have signed up, are not lined up with reality, should the Commission still insist on applying them?</p><p>The Commission should still insist on applying them.</p><p> I will ask my questions one at a time.</p></speech>

One concerns the way in which we calculate the output graph and potential output.  This is based on a commonly agreed methodology.  There is a technical group within the EFC which is chaired by Mr. McCarthy, an Irish official.  We apply the same methodology to all of the countries in order to have an analysis of the cyclical positions which is comparable across all countries.  We use the production method and we have a way to calculate the multifactoral productivity and capital stock.  This is very complex, technically speaking but at the same time, the methodology is very transparent.  All countries can see exactly how the calculations are made.  This is the way we measure the cyclical position of the different countries.  In the case of Ireland in particular the calculations were made on the basis of the budgetary plans one year ago.  At that time, we did not know about the revision that took place concerning 2015 and the various adjustments that had to be made.  Last year we saw the output gap closing very quickly.  This year we still have very high output gaps.  In some cases, the output gaps are positive.  In the case of Ireland, the output gap will start to close in 2018 or later.</p> <p>  This methodology also allows us to calculate the structural balances, that is, the parts of developments in the balance which are not due to the cyclical evolutions, that is, due to the fact that if one grows faster, one has more taxes, less unemployment and therefore, less expenditure.  These cyclical fluctuations or impacts on the budget are netted out from our calculations of the structural balance which are made on the basis, in turn, of our calculations of the output gap and potential GDP.</p> <p>  This is one indicator that we use in order to determine to what extent the fiscal stance in the country is appropriate, taking into account the debt levels and the distance towards the medium-term objective, MTO.  We have used another indicator which is the expenditure benchmark.  This is related to the ten year average of potential growth.  We never use these two indicators in a totally mechanical way.  We make what we call a nominal assessment in order to understand better the underlying factors concerning the changes in the structural balance and the structural expenditure.  That is, the expenditures net of discretionary tax changes.  We never use this in an automatic or mechanical way.  We always look at all of these factors.  We examine the cyclical position of the economy, the distance with respect to what we have defined as the MTO which ensures that there is enough room in front of cyclical fluctuations.  We also look at expenditures net of expenditure finance through EU funds and net of cyclical expenditures, for instance, of unemployment and net of interest payments and discretionary changes in tax revenues and how these have evolved compared to potential growth - not potential growth for one year but over a number of years.  </p> <p>  Finally, this is why our assessments may change although we have to take into account that the benchmarks are frozen either in 2015 or 2016.  We even reduce the possibility of more cyclical or annual fluctuations.  I do not think that it is a question of saying that we have this indicator and then we change completely.  We have a rather stable analysis.</p></speech>

I am not sure it was answered in terms of whether any EU country is actually paying down debt.  The answer given related to ratios.  I am interested in finding out if any country is actually reducing the euro amount of debt.</p> <p>  One element of Ireland's debt is the promissory notes which arose out of a deal that was done between the Irish State, the Irish Central Bank and the European Central Bank.  Approximately &euro;20 billion remains to be paid.  At an EU level, that is a small amount but scaled up for Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay's country, Spain, it would be about &euro;170 billion or scaled up for Germany it would be about &euro;400 billion.  Given the size of Ireland's economy, a &euro;20 billion debt is very significant.  The debt was incurred at the insistence of Mr. Jean Claude Trichet, who told our Minister for Finance that a bomb would go off in Dublin if he considered burden sharing with private sector investors in private banks.  I believe it to be odious debt, legally and therefore, challengeable.  This promissory note debt is attached solely and exclusively to two dead banks, namely Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, in which the State had no stake or guarantee in place.  The State was essentially forced, in the face of a very serious threat by the then President of the ECB, Mr. Jean Claude Trichet, to pay this money down.  The State wrote an I.O.U which was then subsequently turned into these promissory notes.  Does the Commission believe, in the spirit of reducing debt and in the spirit of social fairness, that Ireland has a case to make to have this debt reduced?  Would the Commission be sympathetic to the argument that a &euro;20 billion is still a serious amount of debt that would, if it were in Germany, amount to &euro;400 billion?  It is an IOU against two dead banks that have been prosecuted for illegal behaviour and for which the State had provided no guarantees.  The State was essentially forced to bail them out by Mr. Trichet.  Is there a case to be made that the Commission would support?  Is there a case for burden sharing or - if one were a monetary purist, as many of the German authorities are - setting it at 0% for 200 years?  In the latter instance, inflation would essentially get rid of it but we would not have to tear it up.  </p></speech>

Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay holds a very senior position within the Commission and now that we have moved to the European semester, he and his team have an influence on our budget.  With respect, if he comes before the Irish Parliament and states that we should pay down the debt, he should probably know whether any other country in Europe is doing so.</p></speech>

Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay has stated categorically to the committee that we should use windfall taxes to pay down debt.  This has nothing to do with a ratio; this is about a total quantum of debt owed.  The Chairman asked whether any other country in Europe is doing this, and my understanding of Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay's answer is that he does not know.</p></speech>

I am making the simple point that the recommendation to do this is a very big call to make because we are in the middle of a housing crisis, a homelessness crisis and a child poverty crisis and we are still recovering.

There is an apparent contradiction in the advice given.  I ask the witnesses to provide some advice in this regard.  On one hand, Mr. Martinez-Mongay states that Ireland should not expand fiscally, while, on the other, he has identified major investment shortcomings in research and development, transport, housing, general capital infrastructure and so forth, a point on which I agree with him.  How does he think Ireland should solve this problem if he recommends that we stay steady fiscally but states that we need serious investment.  What is the Commission's view on how to meet both these requirements?</p></speech>

This is one possibility.  Another possibility, as I said, is to broaden the tax bases, which will bring more future, even current, revenues.  If revenues are increased, there is the possibility to increase expenditures without affecting the deficit.</p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners believe that these revenues, these receipts, were not exceptional and that changes made in particular to the Irish corporation tax system a few years ago and improvement in the economic activity of the country would mean that these receipts would come in regardless.  We have seen evidence from the Revenue Commissioners in this regard, and they have spoken elsewhere about the matter.  I also refer to the fact that since the budget, the Exchequer return figures from last week, with which the witnesses are no doubt familiar, show that income tax receipts are almost &euro;1 billion ahead of schedule, VAT is &euro;500 million ahead of schedule and corporation tax is &euro;500 million ahead of schedule.  Does this not put paid to the witnesses' argument that this was an exceptional once-off increase in revenues?  Rather, as the year has progressed, income tax in particular has performed much more strongly.  It is not a once-off windfall tax.  Is it not, therefore, the case that the criticism of the budget is not well founded at this juncture?</p></speech>

We refer to the fact that tax revenues in some cases are growing exceptionally because part of the tax bases which are not very stable are growing exceptionally.  We must distinguish between permanent increases in taxes, cyclical increases in taxes and exceptional increases in taxes.  This implies a very detailed and rigorous analysis of the developments in the tax bases and tax rates and, therefore, the ability in this case to identify which taxes or which tax bases are more volatile.  The more volatile tax bases are associated with the production of the most volatile tax revenues.  As a result, some of them can be exceptional.  Our recommendation is, once these exceptional revenues have been identified, to allocate in order to reduce the deficit and, therefore, the debt.</p></speech>

I thank the joint committee for its invitation to attend the meeting.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Brendan Crowley, who handles the Department&rsquo;s international tax files.  I am also joined by two colleagues from the Revenue Commissioners, Ms Kate Levey, principal officer in the EU branch of the international division, and Ms Yvonne Quirke, also from Revenue&rsquo;s international division.</p> <p>  On 25 October the European Commission published a package of tax measures, containing three distinct legislative proposals.  The first is an anti-tax avoidance directive to deal with hybrid mismatches.  These are situations in which a particular instrument or entity goes untaxed because of differing tax treatment in different jurisdictions.  The directive is at an advanced stage and was discussed at this morning's meeting of ECOFIN.  Ireland supports the work on this directive which mirrors the work done at OECD level.</p> <p>  The second proposal seeks to improve dispute resolution mechanisms within the European Union.  Ireland is supportive of this proposal which will be helpful in resolving disputes in a timely way under tax treaties.  This will improve certainty within the system and  be good for business and tax authorities.  My Revenue colleague, Ms Levey, will say a little more about this proposal.</p> <p>  The third element is the proposal for a common consolidated corporate tax base which I understand is the main focus of this discussion.  Strictly, the Commission has made two proposals.  The first is a proposal for a common tax base, TB, which is to be discussed in its own right as a &ldquo;double C&rdquo; TB.  The Commission has made a second proposal on consolidation &ndash; a &ldquo;treble C&rdquo; TB &ndash; which is intended to be negotiated if and when a common base is agreed to.</p> <p>  A common corporate tax base would consist of agreed rules for how a company calculated its taxable profits in each member state.  The member state would then apply its own tax rate to these profits.  It would replace the entire existing corporate tax system for large companies with a whole new set of rules for how their taxable profits would be calculated.  The proposal for a common tax base is, by necessity, very complex.  Each member state currently applies different rules to what income is taxable, which deductions are allowed, which credits are given, etc.  Ireland currently has a very wide tax base, while some member states have narrow bases.</p> <p>  The second stage of the process, consolidation, involves how profits are attributed to each country in the European Union.  A common base would give countries common rules for how to calculate profits, but it would not impact on where the profits and, therefore, taxing rights would be attributed.  Currently, member states use OECD transfer pricing rules in determining how profits are attributable to each country.  Under the transfer pricing rules, one looks at where the real value-added activities happen and attributes a proportionate share of the profits to these activities.  Consolidation would replace the transfer pricing approach within the European Union with a formula for dividing profits among member states.  The formula would be based on where sales happened, where staff were located and where a company&rsquo;s assets were.  Under this formula each corporate group&rsquo;s total EU profits would be added together and divided among countries.  The country concerned would then tax the profits attributed to it at its corporate tax rate.  Consolidation would not legally impact on a country's tax rate, but it would have a significant impact on how much tax was paid in each member state.  The impact assessment published by the Commission states the CCCTB can lift growth in the European Union by up to 1.2%, but it is silent on the impact on growth in member states individually.</p> <p>  How does the new CCCTB proposal compare to the previous one?  The CCCTB proposal has a long history.  It dates back to 2001 when the Commission first put it forward as long-term, comprehensive measure to reform corporate tax rules within the European Union.  The concept was discussed at ECOFIN and technical working group meetings from 2004 and the Commission published a detailed proposal in 2011 which would be superseded by the new proposal.  With a proposal such as the CCCTB proposal which has been debated publically and at length for many years, it is perhaps tempting for us to simply reheat our old analysis and pick up where we left off.  However, it is important that we consider it anew and with fresh eyes, given that the proposal includes some important differences when compared to its predecessor.</p> <p>  The separation of a common base from the more problematic issue of consolidation is significant.  This is a separation which Ireland has supported since its Presidency.  Most significantly, adhering to the CCCTB proposal would be mandatory for multinational companies with a group turnover of more than &euro;750 million, whereas adhering to the 2011 proposal was optional for all companies.  The new proposal allows smaller companies to opt in to the CCCTB rules or remain taxable under our existing corporate tax rules.  This would require Ireland to operate two corporate tax systems side by side, namely, the CCCTB rules for large companies and a domestic system for smaller companies that did not opt to adhere to the CCCTB rules.</p> <p>  While the consolidation aspect of the proposal is broadly similar to the 2011 version, there are a number of substantial technical differences in the design of the proposed common base.  For example, allowance for growth and investment is included in the new proposal which effectively allows a business to claim a tax deduction for equity investment in the business.  Additionally, under the common base proposal, an enhanced research and development deduction is proposed of between 25% and 100% of qualifying research and development expenditure.</p> <p>  It is also important to recognise that there have been significant changes on the corporate tax landscape since the previous proposal was published in 2011.  Since 2011 the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process has been launched and 15 comprehensive BEPS reports were published in October 2015.  The implementation of the BEPS reports is under way at national and international level, including through the EU anti-tax avoidance directive.  The business environment has also changed considerably since 2011.  The profile of taxpayers in Ireland will naturally have changed in the past five years.  This is also true of the broader international environment, in which issues such as Brexit and US tax reform are part of the backdrop to our assessment of the CCCTB proposal.</p> <p>  How is the CCCTB proposal different from our existing system?  A focus of our work since the proposal was published has been comparing the common base proposed by the Commission to the existing Irish corporate tax base.  There are some significant technical differences.  In some areas the proposed common tax base is likely to be significantly narrower than the existing Irish tax base.  For example, the CCCTB proposal allows much broader rules for deducting business expenses, for example, business client entertainment expenses which are not deductible in Ireland would be 50% deductible under the common base proposals.  There are broad exemptions for foreign income earned by Irish companies, a new tax deduction for equity investment - the allowance for growth and investment that I mentioned - while the anti-avoidance rules are less specific across all aspects of the base.</p> <p>  As I said, under the Commission's proposals there is a super deduction for research and development expenditure, which would raise a question about the continuation of our best-in-the-class research and development tax credit.  The Commission's proposals do not appear to distinguish between trading and non-trading profits, nor do they include separate tax treatment for capital gains.  This raises a question about whether we would get to keep our 25% rate for non-trading profits or our 33% capital gains tax rate.</p><p>Neither the Minister for Finance nor the Government has taken a position on CCCTB at this point.  As with any complex proposal, at this stage it is appropriate that officials would undertake a detailed analysis to understand the implications for Ireland and to inform our advice on Ireland's negotiating position.  Some preliminary work is under way in the Department and the Revenue Commissioners, but we will consider commissioning a more detailed analysis if we feel it is necessary.  Obviously, this is a Commission proposal that requires the unanimous approval of all 28 member states.  There are months of detailed technical analysis and negotiation ahead, during which the proposal is likely to change shape.  We will engage constructively with this process as things progress.</p><p> The new CCCTB represents a significant proposal that warrants careful consideration and analysis.  That work is now under way and will take some time.  We are happy to assist the committee with its deliberations and to answer its questions.</p></speech>

I will use this short opening statement to outline Revenue's role in tax policy and to highlight briefly the elements of the Commission package that focus specifically on the administration of the tax system, which is Revenue's core business.</p> <p>  In addition to our administrative role, Revenue assists the Department of Finance in the formulation of tax policy by providing advice and technical tax expertise.  Our experience of administering the tax system enables us to advise, in particular, on the practicalities of proposed measures, including avoidance and evasion risks in particular and how they might be mitigated.  As regards our international role, Revenue participates in discussions on a broad range of tax and customs matters at fora such as the EU, the OECD and the World Customs Organisation, contributing to the formulation of broader international tax policy.</p> <p>  Each of the three proposals put forward by the European Commission will be discussed in detail at the relevant Council working group at the EU.  Revenue participates in these discussions with our colleagues from the Department of Finance, providing the necessary support on technical and administrative implications.  In the event the directives are agreed, Revenue will also have an important role in transposing tax directives into domestic legislation.</p> <p>  With regard to the European Commission's package, the proposal to address hybrid mismatches and the two draft directives proposing the CCCTB are predominantly policy-related and my colleague from the Department of Finance, Mr. Hession, has outlined the main features of each.  I want to briefly highlight one particular administrative aspect of the consolidation proposal.  Under this proposal, multinational groups would deal with a single tax administration in the EU, referred to as the principal tax authority or one stop shop.  This would be based in the member state where the parent company of the group is resident for tax purposes, and if the overall parent company is outside of the EU it would be based in the member state of an alternative nominee within the group.  While the consolidation element of the proposal will not be brought forward for discussion unless or until the common base is agreed, Revenue will have a particular focus on this administrative aspect.</p> <p>  The third element of the package, the proposed directive on double taxation dispute resolution mechanisms in the EU, aims to improve dispute resolution between tax authorities in situations of double taxation of business income.  By way of background, double taxation arises when tax is imposed on the same income by two or more countries.  Double tax treaties between two countries set out the taxing rights of each jurisdiction in an effort to avoid such double taxation.  "Competent authority" is a term used in tax treaties.  It refers to the body responsible for trying to resolve any issues or disputes that arise with the applicable treaty.  In Ireland, Revenue is the competent authority.  Due to an increase in the complexity of international trade, there has been an increase in the number of disputes being referred to competent authorities in recent years.  While most disputes can be resolved by considering the relevant treaty directly, double taxation may still remain where two countries disagree on the interpretation or application of a treaty provision.</p> <p>  The OECD and the EU have focused for a number of years on improving what are referred to as the mutual agreement procedures in tax treaties, commonly referred to as MAPS, in an effort to improve dispute resolution processes.  Arbitration is one of the most powerful tools for dispute resolution in circumstances where tax authorities fail to reach agreement.  Mandatory binding arbitration gives taxpayers a guarantee that their case will be resolved within a set period.  As a result, taxpayers and their representatives are advocating the introduction of mandatory binding arbitration.  Ireland has already expressed support for the OECD BEPS initiative, which would see mandatory binding arbitration under double tax treaties introduced next year.  In addition, the existing EU arbitration convention already provides for a mandatory binding arbitration mechanism in the narrower category of transfer pricing disputes between EU member states.  The European Commission has now put forward this proposed directive to improve existing arbitration convention mechanisms in terms of access for taxpayers, coverage, timeliness and conclusiveness.</p> <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s role in negotiating disputes with other countries is important to ensure the appropriate allocation of profits between Ireland and our treaty partners.  In budget 2015, the Minister for Finance provided for increased resources for Revenue's competent authority function to ensure we are equipped to deal effectively with disputes with other tax authorities and we welcome any improvements to the international framework for addressing such issues, including the proposed directive.</p> <p>  We are happy to assist the committee in any way we can in its consideration of the corporate tax reform package presented by the Commission.</p></speech>

Mr. Hession stated that preliminary work is under way to assess the impact of the revised CCCTB proposal.  Is there an emerging view in the Department on the implications for Ireland by way of corporation tax receipts?  We expect to receive approximately &euro;7.5 billion in receipts this year.  With regard to the attractiveness of Ireland as a location for inward investment, is there an emerging view on the revised proposals from the Department?</p></speech>

With regard to quantifying this, we have not got as far as being able to put a figure on it.  Looking at the analysis provided, which is already in the public domain, the Commission's analysis sees a reduction in corporation tax of 0.14% of GDP.  This is in its impact assessment.  Overall, the Commission sees it as a marginally positive result because, under its analysis, some buoyancy comes out of that but it also sees a negative impact on corporation tax receipts.</p> <p>  In its publication yesterday, which draws heavily on the earlier analysis carried out by Ernst &amp;amp; Young in 2011, the ESRI sees an impact on foreign direct investment of -4.6% and on corporation tax receipts of -5.7%.  When we combine this with the impact of Brexit, it shows an effective output of -1.5%.  We take these as useful inputs to our analysis.  We will do our own work on it with Revenue and, if necessary, get figures done.  It is a very complex proposal with many aspects and we need to go through them to fully assess how we believe it will fully affect corporation tax receipts.  The analysis in the Ernst &amp;amp; Young report, the Commission's own analysis and the ESRI is that it would have a negative impact on corporation tax receipts for Ireland.  This does not surprise us.</p></speech>

The first element relates to the base.  Mr. Hession made the point that for Ireland it would result in a narrower base.</p></speech>

Mr. Hession has given as number of examples of how the calculation of the base would differ under these proposals than under existing corporation tax law.  There appears to be quite a significant difference in the base.  Before we look at the attribution of the profits across countries, if the taxable base is smaller, we are already at a disadvantage.</p></speech>

There are other aspects we need to examine such as, for example, the research and development provision.  The common base is different to the research and development tax credit.  We think it would be less attractive for firms therefore there may not be as big a cost.  The allowance for growth and investment is a new provision, which would be a tax cost.  Our expectation is there would be a tax cost because this is significantly narrower.</p><p>In addition, it is difficult to forecast what will come out in the negotiations or the interplay between the different aspects of this proposal and other proposals already on the table.  One of the difficulties, and the reason I said in my opening statement that we would not just reheat our previous analysis, is that we have already made many commitments at the OECD table and at EU level.  For example, the anti-tax avoidance directive was agreed during the summer.  The tax avoidance elements of the proposed CCCTB directive, broadly speaking, largely import the anti-tax avoidance directive.  This includes the provisions on control for our company rules, on interest deductibility and on hybrids, to which I referred.  There is a kind of interplay of all the different aspects so that it is difficult to make a net judgment but our expectation is that the base in the case of the CCCTB would be narrower than that in the CCTB.</p></speech>

Mr. Hession outlines three elements: where sales happen, where staff are located and where companies' assets are.  Is there a weighting of these different elements in the formula?  Regarding the first element, Ireland is such a small market that we will not make much of an impact.  Regarding the second, many multinationals provide employment here.  What is the assessment of how Ireland would fare when it comes to the allocation of the base, that is, the allocation of taxable profits across Europe?</p></speech>

The weighting between the three components is one third, one third and one third in terms of labour, assets and sales.  The previous EY analysis was that Ireland would be a loser in this formula.  In fact, I think in some categories, such as employment, we were shown to be the biggest loser.</p></speech>

I have a question for Ms Levey.  The selection of the principal tax authorities is determined by the jurisdiction in which the parented group is tax-resident.  Therefore, these proposals do not involve a change in the residency rules <i>per se</i>.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

If the consolidation aspect happens, the jurisdiction in which the company is resident is less significant.  Is that fair to say?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.190" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kate Levey" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120600002#D01600"><p>That is fair to say.  The principal tax authority is the country in which the parent of the group is resident.  In addition, if the parent is ultimately outside the EU, the group members within the CCTB can nominate a group that would be the head for those purposes.  Therefore, potentially more than those 50 taxpayers about which we spoke are located in a particular member state, but the Deputy is right that the formulary apportionment basically means that there are different factors now determining where tax is paid.</p></speech>

As he said, it has been in the ether for the past 15 years or so, but there seems to be renewed momentum behind it now.  It was published last October.  Where does he expect it will go from here?  What is the timeline for the Irish Government and the Department of Finance to adopt a position from an Irish perspective on these proposals?</p></speech>

The Slovak Presidency has prioritised this as distinct from the CCCTB components.  It will be for the next presidencies, Maltese and then Estonian, to determine their priorities.  I expect there will be some focus from the Maltese Presidency on dispute resolution, but the CCCTB will go in parallel with this.  Much analysis is being carried out in other member states of how it affects their bases, revisiting what position these Governments will take.  For now, there is not huge visibility of where the member states will go or the appetite for this.  Because of the questions surrounding subsidiarity and reasoned opinions, it is the parliaments that are probably dealing with this issue ahead of some of the governments.  My expectation is that this will proceed cautiously through the next few presidencies.  As I said, we are doing preliminary work with our colleagues in the Revenue Commissioners, and once we get to a certain point, we need to carry out an assessment of whether we need a more specialist piece of work, which we may have to commission from outside, to give us the kind of breakdowns we feel we need to feed into policy makers.</p></speech>

One might get the impression that it is the second C of the abbreviation, consolidation, that will cause the greatest issues in Ireland's case.  However, what is being proposed under the first C of the common base is as alarming from the point of view of sovereignty.  Could Mr. Hession explain what a common income tax base would look like?  Would it involve a common set of tax credits and tax reliefs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.194" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronan Hession" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120600002#D02000"><p>Essentially, that is correct.  It would mean that companies above the threshold, that is, large companies with group turnover of more than &euro;750 million, would operate under the common European rules regarding their tax bases, the kinds of reliefs that would be available, how losses are handled and what kind of accounting principles work.  Such companies would work to that common set of rules.  Companies below this threshold can opt into this if they wish, but it is optional for them.  The previous proposal in 2011 was optional for everybody.  The two significant differences are, first, that participation is mandatory above the threshold and, second, that the consolidation element will be considered after a base, if a base is agreed.  Consolidation was considered alongside a tax base during discussions on the earlier proposal, whereas work on the two elements is now being carried out in sequence.  Our initial focus is on the base, which, as I say, forms part of a European set of common rules for these larger companies.</p></speech>

It certainly is an early challenge that has been identified in the context of any kind of potential savings or efficiencies it is argued the CCCTB might bring about.  Running two parallel systems has that downside.</p></speech>

Running two systems in parallel brings with it a particular administrative burden.  Introducing new legislation, which would entirely replace our existing corporation tax system for a particular cohort of companies, would also bring with it uncertainties.  We have much case law on which we rely for the interpretation of our existing legislation.  This has been built up over a number of years.  As that would not be there with the new legislation, there certainly would be a bedding-down period regarding the introduction of the new system and an ongoing issue in applying the two sets in parallel.</p></speech>

From Ireland's point of view, going back to our own hosting of the presidency, the preference in Ireland has always been to separate those two issues.  Consolidation is by far the more problematic of the two.  In terms of the base, it would make more sense to discuss that in its own right.  The actual splitting of the proposals is a positive from our point of view.  That is not to say the Government would necessarily buy into the argument for a common base.  It will wait to hear the analysis of the impact on the base and what sort of questions that raises for Ireland's competitiveness.  I do not want to come across as unduly negative.  It is my Department of Finance training to be sceptical about new proposals in general.  At a high level, the first of the two stated objectives of this proposal is to tackle tax avoidance.  The Government is publicly on board with tackling tax avoidance.  The tax avoidance elements in the directive were previously agreed earlier this year and Ireland played a very active part in that.  In terms of easing the compliance burden for business, it is something that is worthy as an objective.  The Revenue Commissioners rates very highly on that internationally.  In terms of ease of doing business and filing returns, it is top of the league in Europe and fifth or sixth in the world.  That has always been something Ireland has taken very seriously.  As high level objectives, the Government has supported those and continues to support them.  It is just a question of whether this is the right way to further those two objectives.</p></speech>

It is a very important question that we have to pose with regard to any new European proposal.  In this case it is a question of whether more can be achieved by member states acting collectively than can be achieved individually.</p> <p>  The second question is whether the proportionality test is passed.  In other words, does it go as far as the treaties require and no further.  There is a balanced judgment call there.  We have to do our own analysis to see where we land and what sort of advice we give to the Minister on it.  What we have seen at OECD level is that we can acknowledge that these problems require lots of countries to work together.  They cannot be solved by unilateral action alone.  Whether that requires a directive or a common base comes back to the proportionality point.  Outside the European Union, a lot of the OECD reforms have been delivered either through changes via tax treaties or sometimes just guidelines or best practice standards.  There is that question.</p> <p>  The broader issue of tackling tax avoidance is acknowledged in the previous directive that was agreed in June, the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive.  Member states can come together and make a meaningful difference through a directive.  To a large extent that issue was dealt with in that directive.  It has been carried over to this one but we do not see a huge amount of additional anti-tax avoidance content here in this published proposal beyond what was agreed previously in June.  The Commission would argue that by having a common base and common rules it makes the system more transparent and more difficult to arbitrage.  We would have to see whether that is the case.  It is somewhat hypothetical, given we do not have a live common based example we can compare it to.</p></speech>

I would be surprised if adopting a common base in itself was to defeat tax avoidance entirely.  What we have had over the last number of years is a recognition at OECD level and beyond, to a much broader cohort of about 100 countries, that the rules as they are currently formulated leave tax planning opportunities and that it needs to be tightened up.  That is really what the BEPS reports were about.  Ireland has always been very positive about that process and very sensitive about the fact we have a very new international consensus on this and the importance of implementing that in order to address the problem of tax planning.  We have to always be sensitive that at EU level we do not risk undermining that consensus or put in place a rival regime that would somehow frustrate the reforms we have already got.  There is a balance there and I am sure when we come to discuss this among member states in more detail there will be an attempt to try to strike that right balance.</p></speech>

The proposal does not affect the 12.5% rate and the Government has a firm position on it.  The question that was posed previously in the analysis by Ernst &amp;amp; Young was that if this affects the base, does it not put the Government in the situation where it has to increase the rate to compensate.  What the Ernst &amp;amp; Young analysis found was that in Ireland's case, because of the sensitivity of our rate, it would not be an effective solution.  Its analysis said even if the Government was to compensate with a rate, the impact on investment and FDI, etc., would be negative and therefore it was not an answer that a country like Ireland could turn to.  The Government has been absolutely clear that the 12.5% rate will not be affected by this.  We have a genuine question about that because we have other rates in Ireland.  In Ireland we make a distinction between trading profits, which are taxed at 12.5%, and non-trading profits of passive income, interest, royalties, dividends, etc., which are taxed at 25%.  It is not clear to us where our 25% rate sits in all this or indeed out 33% capital gains rate.  It could just be a clarification point from the Commission.</p></speech>

It is great to have the detail in terms of what is proposed and what the Department is thinking on this.  We have a question to answer on the issue of subsidiarity and proportionality.  We answered that question as a parliament in 2011.  My colleague asked Mr. Hession a question in that context.  He mentioned that the easy thing to do would be to look at what was done in 2011.  While there have been changes to the CCCTB, its premise is still the same.  Has Mr. Hession reviewed the reasoned opinion by the D&aacute;il on the five reasons?</p></speech>

I am asking about this in order to go through some of the issues.  It is stated that it is not established by the Commission's proposals or impact assessment that 27 different national corporate tax systems inherently impede the proper functioning of the internal market . In effect, the proposal would introduce a second parallel system for operation within each member state that would not improve the simplicity and efficiency of the corporate tax systems in the EU.  Is that something Mr. Hession would subscribe?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.217" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronan Hession" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120600002#F00400"><p>I think, as Ms Levey said, from a Revenue point of view that is a bit of a headache in terms of how to run two parallel systems.  We are also mindful of the fact that we are not just talking about international tax planning within Europe.  There are still multifarious international tax systems that will remain in place and a lot of the tax planning that goes on is not necessarily within Europe, it takes place in other jurisdictions.  Therefore, one has to live with a certain degree of complexity.</p> <p>  I understand the motive behind the Commission's proposal for a common base.  It perhaps makes it more transparent and with consistent rules there is less scope for arbitrage.  That may be the case but, if it were to come into being, I would be surprised if it was impenetrable to tax planning.  As regards the administrative side or compliance cost, the Ernst &amp;amp; Young analysis felt those savings were overstated.</p></speech>

The Deputy said that the proposal has many similarities to a previous proposal.  The question for us is whether we have confidence in the multilateral nature of the agreement at that level.  That was not by way of agreeing a single legal instrument.  It involves a mix whereby countries need to implement some of it through legislation or country-by-country reporting, for example.  Others do so by best practice which in Europe we have taken to another step through legislation on the control of foreign company rules.  Others are just guidelines, which in our case we will import into our domestic law.  However, not every country will do that.</p> <p>  Our experience of that process, both in the negotiations that went on behind it and what has happened since, is that it has gained real traction.  Every time I attend OECD meetings there are more countries involved.  Those countries have heard warnings from the OECD which, put simply, mean, "If you're not at the table, you're on the menu."  They would realise, therefore, that there are risks to not participating.  That shows that, yes, one needs countries to work together to get these solutions, but does that necessarily mean having a common base?  Obviously, a common base is not part of the OECD view.  Their view is that one could get the results without going quite that far.  Some of that reflects the nature of compromise negotiations .</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.220" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120600002#F00700"><p>Yes.  The reason I asked that question is because it would be fair to say that the Commission's argument at the time was that it was too complex across 27 member states and it needed to be simplified.  However, the argument from the recent opinion is, "We don't agree with you in relation to that."  The thrust of it now for those who are trying to put forward this new version of CCCTB is that it is to deal with tax avoidance, tax evasion and the issue of the Apple case and other such cases.  It is to make it difficult for multinationals to avoid paying tax.  In my view, it is about trying to make the narrative suit the agenda, which has been there for a long time.</p> <p>  The fourth reason set out in the reasoned opinion stated, "Yet the proposal would legislate to effectively redistribute the EU corporate tax base among member states based on new allocation factors."  The main weakness not addressed in the proposal or impact assessment is why would the 27 member states legislative for such an unequal policy outcome?  Does Mr. Hession believe that still stands today from the analysis done within the Department?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.221" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronan Hession" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120600002#F00800"><p>Yes.  When one looks at the analysis and the number of countries where the graph is below the x-axis compared with those where it is above, it is difficult to see where the momentum will come for an agreement.  Essentially, members states will be surrendering significant portions of their base in service of an abstract principle unless they feel that there is some greater motive at stake - in this case, if they feel it is necessary to weed out tax avoidance and this was the only way to do it.  What compromises that argument is that the anti-tax avoidance elements of this directive have already been agreed.  Therefore, having agreed to the anti-tax avoidance directive, we could not argue that those elements bring subsidiarity because we have already gone as far as signing up to that.  Carrying them in here bolsters the characterisation of this directive as being an anti-tax avoidance one.  However, in terms of additional added value it is difficult to see it based on those components, aside from what I have already said about a common base making it more transparent.  Having common rules flushes out what would otherwise be tax avoidance schemes and arbitrage between differences.</p></speech>

It stated, "No EU legislation should be proposed that indirectly impacts on national sovereignty as a means of remedying any negative financial impact that flows therefrom."  Whether we agree or disagree with it, this is an issue of national sovereignty, as Senator Conway-Walsh said.  If we were to deal with this from an income tax point of view, we would be saying to the European Commission that it can set the bands or tax credits available to workers across the State.  That is basically giving it away.  We would always be allowed to apply the 20% and 40% rates, but it gives them the authority to change all the rules that affect us, which are really important.  If the bands or reliefs are changed we will end up paying more or less tax.  Is this not a sovereignty issue at its core?  We will be handing power to the Commission - not for the first time because of VAT and other areas - for authority over the country's corporate tax system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-06a.223" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronan Hession" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120600002#F01000"><p>That is heavy stuff for a technocrat like myself.  I guess they would say, "Do you want to pool your sovereignty with the other countries?"  This is not going to happen unless Ireland signs up to it, and changing the directive later would require Ireland's agreement on unanimity.  Not to put words in the Commission's mouth, they would probably say that this is a proposition.  They certainly have the right of initiative.  It would be true that in future Finance Bills - and I had the pleasure of being here with the Minister for the recent Finance Bill - that a lot of the tax issues around these larger companies would not be discussed in this room on Committee State.  They would be dealt with at European level, so in that sense the role of the D&aacute;il and Seanad - where we have Committee Stage tomorrow - would be much reduced for those companies above the threshold or the smaller ones that opt in - they would no longer be dealt with under the domestic rules.  The point made to Ireland would be, "That only happens if you decide to pool your sovereignty with the other countries, and decide that you are going to agree unanimously for that to happen."  The Deputy began his contribution by referring back to the nub of the discussion here which is around reasoned opinion.  On the proportionality point, does it go as far as the treaty requires and no further, or is it a step beyond that?  That is the question that needs to be answered on proportionality.  Unquestionably, however, the net result of this is that we are agreed that a significant amount of tax policy will be decided at European level, albeit with Ireland at the table exercising its vote in the context of unanimity.</p></speech>

The first thing I would say is that unanimity will be required in future directives.  Provision is being made for the Commission to issue technical standards where some of the detail is spelled out.  The committee may be familiar with such standards in the financial services area.  There is always a delicacy in areas like tax about what is technical and what is policy.  During a discussion on a recent Finance Bill, it was largely impossible to distinguish where a policy issue became a technical issue and where a technical issue became a policy issue.  Such details are important in terms of the feasibility, workability or effect of a proposal.  The Commission has a role in this area that it did not have in respect of tax files before now.  I think my colleague, Mr. Crowley, wants to add something.</p></speech>

This is a different process that does not require unanimity.  It is limited to technical points, as Mr. Hession said.</p></speech>

As the ESRI publication draws on the 2011 proposal, we are not comparing the same things.  We will stick with table 39, if Mr. Hession does not mind, because it is based on the Commission's assessment of the current proposal.  It suggests that if this proposal goes through, Ireland's corporate tax receipts will decrease by 0.14% of GDP but there will be increases in receipts from labour taxes, consumption taxes and taxes on bonds, dividends and capital gains.  It states that our overall tax revenue, which is really what we are interested in, would increase marginally by 0.02% of GDP.  The Commission's view, therefore, is that the effect of this proposal on our tax receipts would basically be neutral.  It would lead to marginal reduction of the overall tax revenues of states across Europe.  Does the Department agree with the figures that have been presented by the Commission?  Does it agree that this proposal, as identified by the European Commission's joint research centre, would broadly be tax-neutral if it were to be introduced in this State because there would be a reduction of 0.14% of GDP in corporate tax receipts but that would be offset by other taxes?</p></speech>

We generally like to get under the bonnet of such figures to have a look at them.  It strikes us that one of the differences between 2011 and now is that we now have fiscal rules.  If we proposed to reduce taxes while claiming that the buoyancy in the economy meant that such a reduction would pay for itself, ordinarily we would not be allowed to do that under fiscal rules.  I reiterate that we have not had a technical engagement with the Commission.  We will need to do that to understand the analysis.  Perhaps it is not what it appears from our reading of it.  If we were to come back to the Commission with our figures, tell it that we were reducing our base for some other reason and argue that it would be cost-neutral overall because it would lead to a bounce in the economy, I am not sure we would be given the discretion to do that.  It is an interesting piece of analysis.  The part of it dealing with the reduction in the base is certainly consistent with what other commentators like the ESRI and Ernst &amp;amp; Young have said.  I am not sure about the buoyancy of results element of it.  In the run-up to budgets, my job involves hearing from many people who ask us to make a tax change that they say will pay for itself.  When we hear that in the Department, we know it is a common argument that is often made.  We like to look at the tax element on its own.  Under the fiscal rules, there is a discipline around us having to do that.  I think we will have to engage.  I am not going to dispute it or dismiss it.  In fairness to the Commission, it has done the analysis and we should try to understand its perspective in the first instance.</p></speech>

If the one-stop shop is to operate in respect of a company, that company's group must be paying corporation tax or filing its tax returns in one member state.  There is provision within the directive for member states to work together.  The competent authorities in each member state will have to work together if an audit of a company is required, for example.  If there is a dispute in respect of the amount of tax paid in another member state, the competent authority in that member state will be able to request an amended tax assessment from the principal tax authority.  The bottom line is that there will have to be a great deal of co-ordination and co-operation between the various member states in order for the one-stop shop concept to operate effectively.</p></speech>

Each member state would need to have a one-stop shop for the companies in its jurisdiction that are paying tax under the common EU rules.  The various one-stop shops would need to be able to talk to one another across borders in the event of disputes about the amounts of money being reported to the one-stop shop in Ireland or Belgium, for example, in respect of profits being made in Germany, for example.  It would be a brand-new system.  It would require a great deal of co-operation between the tax authorities in the various member states.  The directive makes provision for how audits should operate and for the role of member state courts in the event of disputes.</p></speech>

There are detailed reviews of how those companies are complying with tax law.  In practice, the largest companies have armies of accountants and lawyers who prepare those companies' tax returns in accordance with the law.  We often look at how they use the law, the extent to which they might avail of loopholes in the law and where legislative amendments might be required.  The short version of what I am trying to say is that Revenue's risk-based approach to audit deals with large companies in exactly the same way as smaller companies.</p></speech>

It can sometimes be taxed in both jurisdictions in respect of the same income.  Let me give an example of a company that manufactures violins in Ireland but sells them into the German market through a shop in Germany.  Germany might be taxing the sales receipts in respect of those violins as would Ireland.  Ireland has a tax treaty with other countries and on the basis of the tax treaty, one shares the taxing rights between the two countries to make sure that the same income is not taxed twice.</p></speech>

Previously the proposal was painfully slow.  This year tax files have moved extraordinary quickly, but they tend to be the tax files that had some basis in the OECD process.  The essential principles have been agreed so I do not expect that pace will carry through to the CCCTB.  To a large extent it will depend on the next two presidencies; Malta will take over the Presidency in the new year and then Estonia follows and they have the job of prioritising files, deciding on the pacing of discussions.  It depends on the extent to which they push it or prioritise other files.  Our expectation is that the Maltese may look to have some unfinished business from the day's ECOFIN.  There is an Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, ATAD, which has to do with hybrid mismatches and that will carry on to their Presidency.  They will have to finish that.  I know they have an interest in the dispute resolution mechanism but they will indicate their priorities in a pacing ahead of their Presidency or early in their Presidency.  Given the complexity, this would be a profound change for any member state that member states will want to carefully consider each aspect to it before agreeing anything.  I think it will be handled cautiously.  I do not expect it to go at the same pace as other files that were dealt with this year.</p></speech>

When the package was announced, which after all was only five weeks ago, it is still reasonably fresh, the immediate priority was to deal with the hybrid mismatches.  There is a sense from those who are favourably disposed towards the directive to see things move quickly and not get bogged down.  I think the intention from the Commission's point of view is to separate the base out on consolidation to make sure it does not get bogged down in more difficult issues that there can be some progress on the base first of all.  It is really very hard to tell.  To some extent this is not a policy work stream, it is a very political process.  There is a negotiation that has to happen.  It depends on the extent to which member states are starting on the same page.  Initial indications are some member states are quite negative about it, so we will see how that feeds into the pace.</p></speech>

If one is talking about targeted tax measures for disadvantaged areas, generally speaking that is not allowed under State aid rules, unless it is below certain thresholds.  I would expect that if there was a very targeted measure, companies below that threshold would not be targeted, that is types of companies called pre-CCCTB.  I think we would have initiatives in the finance Bill to do with the farming, marine sectors and so on, which are below the necessary thresholds for State aid purpose and generally would not be targeted at the large companies that are caught here.</p> <p>  It is hard to answer the question in the abstract, but I would not expect CCCTB and regional development to have a bigger rap</p></speech>

I expect if that vulnerability is in the directive and if the directive were to progress to agreement, that type of manipulation of business to get around the threshold would be addressed.  We have similar rules about anti-fragmentation to ensure that groups do not separate themselves and keep themselves below the threshold.  That is a reasonably common feature of tax codes that one would make sure that where a threshold bites at a particular point, that there is no way of laying around with the threshold artificially.</p></speech>

We will digest it and we will come back.</p> <p>  As we begin to digest it, we can see what a big departure it is from what we have and I do not think that any Irish official or politician would see the previous analysis on this what it mean for base, for our CT receipts, for FDI and so on would jump to a very quick positive result.  It is often the case in policy, that one must defer taking a rigid opinion because it compromises one's analysis.  We have to maintain professional scepticism which is not a negativity.  We always have to put ourselves in a position and ask whether we are fully persuaded of the merits of something.</p></speech>

That is not consistent with being an apologist for tax avoidance.</p><p> Analysis of the previous proposal and the Commission's initial figures, which we have yet to discuss in full with the Commission, indicate that it will eat into our tax base.  If that turns out to be true, our understanding of the fiscal rules is that will have to be paid for some other way by a cutback in services or taxes raised elsewhere.  The analysis in 2011 was that increasing the rate would not deliver that.  We have to be mindful that we are going into this with an open mind but not an empty mind.

It is important to know that corporation tax receipts in Ireland are 8.3% of total tax revenue, equivalent to 2.5% of gross domestic product, GDP.  Both of those are within half a percentage point of the average for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, countries.  We collect the same proportion of corporation tax when compared with total tax revenue and GDP as do other jurisdictions.</p> <p>  In respect of the CCCTB, formulary apportionment and how it operates, there are two competing philosophies about how to allocate profits between different countries.  On the one hand, there is the OECD and the "arm's length principle", which seeks to identify where value add is generated.  It is often generated by relatively low numbers of people where, for example, it is focused on research and development or high value-add types of activity.  On the other hand, there is the formulary apportionment, which is divided by staff assets and sales.  The difference between consolidation and the current international OECD rules for allocating profits between jurisdictions is that under consolidation, the biggest markets, the jurisdictions where the most sales are made, will capture a proportionally higher amount of the revenue regardless of where the value-added activity took place.  </p></speech>

It is also, however, clear that companies are able to take advantage of the fact that there is no common way of assessing corporation tax.  I get the impression that Revenue and the Department of Finance have not made any assessment of the impact this would have on tax revenue.  If the top 20 corporations paid 43% of corporation tax, presumably they all would be over the &euro;750 million threshold.  Presuming they were, have we an estimate of what that would cost the Exchequer?</p></speech>

We are doing a preliminary analysis.  We may need to commission more detailed work on that.  The Commission's published view is that the impact on corporation tax receipts would be a reduction of 0.14% which, based on 2014 figures, was approximately &euro;250 million.  It foresees a buoyancy effect from the CCCTB and sees the overall proposal as being tax neutral.  The publication by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, yesterday draws quite heavily on the analysis by Ernst &amp;amp; Young in 2011 which stated that foreign direct investment, FDI, would be reduced by 4.6% and corporation tax receipts by 5.7%.  There were further impacts outlined in the new Ernst &amp;amp; Young analysis that GDP would be negatively affected by 1.4% and employment by 1.3%.  The effect would be greatest on Ireland.  The analysis that has come out so far, whether from the Commission, the ESRI or Ernst &amp;amp; Young, points to a negative effect on corporation tax receipts.  The Commission argues that it expects a buoyancy effect that would neutralise that.  I am not an expert on the fiscal rules but my understanding is that ordinarily, if we were to introduce a new tax expenditure we would not be allowed to pay for it by buoyancy measures.  We would have to find the money upfront.</p></speech>

If it is part of a multinational group that operates throughout the EU and will now be subject to the CCCTB, the Deputy is correct, its profits will be allocated on a different basis throughout the whole of the EU, including that sales factor that has a particular impact on us.</p><p>Therefore, more of the profits will be allocated outside Ireland and less profit will benefit from the 12.5% rate.  This would make Ireland comparatively less attractive.</p><p> Incentives such as the research and development tax credit are designed to increase the amount of research and development.  Incentives like that will disappear.  The ability to differentiate by way of particular tax incentives will disappear under the CCCTB.  This is another reason why there might be an impact on foreign direct investment.</p></speech>

The OECD has been very clear that it does not have a difficulty with tax competition but that it does have a difficulty with harmful tax competition.  The harmful measures identified in the OECD's work are subject to scrutiny at international level.  Countries have a sovereign right to choose their own tax rate and the OECD recognises that.  In fairness to the Commission, it also recognises that in its proposal.  It is very clear that it is not providing for harmonisation of rates.  We need to be fair to it on that point.</p></speech>

Tax competition is harmful for public services and for tax revenue across the world.  The only winners from the ideology of tax competition are the corporations that get away with not paying tax.</p> <p>  If there were CCCTB, with a threshold of &euro;750 million plus or an arrangement right across the board, would it have a negative impact on accountancy firms and corporate tax lawyers, of whom there are quite a few in Ireland?  Would it diminish their ability to advise companies on getting the best possible tax deals within the European Union?  Obviously, it would not affect matters outside the European Union.</p></speech>

It may be that there would be more competition between the European offices of the big four firms.  I refer to a common knowledge pool.  When the OECD published the BEPS report, it issued its own questions and answers and addressed formulary apportionment, which is the mechanism used on the CCCTB.  It made the point that we do not know what the tax planning opportunities would be under that.  Certainly, it is possible to criticise the existing system because there is no tax planning around it.  It is untested.  I said earlier that I would be surprised if a common base were impenetrable in respect of tax planning.</p> <p>  It is worth bearing in mind that the issue of advisers, etc., is the subject of a separate initiative at EU level in terms of mandatory disclosure of tax planning regimes.  Ireland is one of the few countries that has that already domestically.  We have already been supported in principle in that.  Separate to the way companies pay tax or the way governments behave in a tax base, the role of advisers is up for discussion.  That derives from action 13 of the BEPS report.  There is more to be said there in terms of how they behave.  I do not believe it is necessarily a point that the Commission has identified in favour of the CCCTB.  One could infer from its belief that it reduces compliance costs that it envisages a lesser role for tax advisers, but I am putting words in its mouth somewhat in that regard.</p></speech>

Many of the points have been covered.  We are referring to a corporate tax base and there were references to income tax.  It has nothing to do with income tax at all.</p> <p>  May I make a point that follows on from that of Deputy Paul Murphy?  What is proposed will not necessarily eliminate or reduce tax avoidance, which is also known by some people as tax planning opportunities.  That will still occur as much or as little as before.  Is there no reason why CCCTB itself would change that?</p></speech>

The point I was making earlier, which is not a criticism of the proposal, is that many of the measures were already in the anti-tax avoidance directive.  Their implementation is not contingent on this proposal.  The Commission can speak for itself but I guess it would say that agreeing a common base with common rules brings greater simplicity and transparency and, therefore, less opportunity for arbitrage.</p> <p>  An open question from the Department's point of view concerns the fact that international tax co-operation on this goes far beyond EU borders.  The OECD inclusive framework now includes approximately 100 countries so we are dealing with everywhere, including North America, South America, Africa and the Far East.  We are reminded of how small Europe is when we go to the meetings.  Much of the tax planning that has become notorious is not purely within EU borders.  The OECD reports were trying, in a very meticulous and surgical way, to identify the various weaknesses that existed and to find very targeted measures to shut them down.  There was an amazing amount of international consensus on that.  We would always have a concern if doing something different or new at EU level were in some way to slow down the momentum of those reforms.  That is something of which we would be mindful.</p></speech>

It is almost a mathematical equation in that if the base is narrowed and the rate is not changed &ndash; we do not want to change the rate &ndash; we will effectively be collecting less, even if the other rules were left before going near the sales location, or the location of assets or the payroll.  If one narrows the base at 12.5%, one will be taxing less than one was taxing before.  Is that a fair point?</p></speech>

The Ernst &amp;amp; Young analysis carried out about five years ago suggested that even if Ireland were to increase the rate to compensate, it would not work.  Our foreign direct investment and investment environment is too sensitive to the rate.  It would be self-defeating.  We have to do our own analysis of what we think the effect would be.  At present, we have older analyses that we can certainly talk about for now until we get our figures together.  We have the Commission's own analysis, into which we have yet to dig with it.  One factor that is different now is that we have the fiscal rules.  There is external disciplining of how we run a balanced budget in that if it were to eat into the base, it would have to be paid for.  That would mean either raising other taxes or scaling back the ambition in public expenditure.</p></speech>

That is obviously a big step.  All EU member states but one are at the OECD table and signed up to the arm's-length principle.  This is an extremely technical area.  Introducing formulary apportionment would not be a complete replacement because the other arrangement would still operate for third countries.

Significantly, the multinational companies are in Ireland to be part of the EU.  In some cases they are selling outside the EU as well.  The staff, including labour and payroll, could be or may not be a major part of it.  Let us consider the location of the assets.

Let us consider the previous analysis and what we are seeing now.  I have yet to see analysis suggesting that it is positive in terms of revenue, especially in terms of corporation tax.  It is one of those files.  We have had several EU files in the past year, as well as international tax proposals.  We have discussed them in terms of tax principles and the correct design.  To some extent, in this case it comes down to the money.  What would the impact be on the base of a country like Ireland?  Could Ireland afford it?</p> <p>  Having said that, we are having this conversation using data from other people.  I am not suggesting that we have the right answer compared with others.  However, we believe the onus is on those of us in the Department, along with our colleagues in Revenue, to undertake the analysis and put forward our figures.  It goes different ways.  Ms Levey made the point about how the treatment of research and development under the common base is in some ways less generous than it is now in Ireland.  There is a net figure but there will be pluses and minuses within that.  There will be negotiations and naturally, every country will arrive at the table seeking to push the elements favourable to it and to exclude other elements.  What we have now is a starting point.  What we have learned from experience is that there will be a process of negotiation.  Obviously, we will have to box clever in that negotiation in terms of how we put across the Irish case.</p></speech>

It is a pleasure to be here today.  On 25 October 2016, the Commission proposed a package of legislative proposals which included two proposals for a relaunched common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, that is, a proposal on the common tax base and a proposal on consolidation, alongside a dispute resolution mechanism for double taxation and an amendment to the anti-tax avoidance directive, to address hybrid mismatches.  Today, I will focus mainly on the CCCTB proposals, which are the centrepiece of the package.</p> <p>  For the European Commission, the CCCTB is the epitome of what we perceive as a corporate tax system for the future.  The relaunched CCCTB initiative reflects an effort to bring together the policy priorities for business facilitation and the need for fairer taxation in a globally integrated economy that operates within open markets.  The Commission first proposed the CCCTB in 2011 with a view to enhancing the Internal Market for businesses.  However, the magnitude of the project led Council negotiations to stall.  In the meantime, the idea of a CCCTB continued receiving support from the European Parliament, businesses and stakeholders around Europe.  In its 2015 action plan on corporate taxation, the Commission announced its intention to relaunch the CCCTB.  The relaunch of the CCCTB initiative is structured as a staged approach which will consist of two steps.  Member states will first need to build and capitalise on the extensive technical work that has already been accomplished on the rules for the tax base and, only when this framework is secured, touch upon the more complex aspect of consolidation.  It is important to bear in mind that for the European Commission, the CCCTB project remains a single one and that the two steps are inextricably linked.  I should also clarify from the outset that the CCCTB stays away from the issue of tax rates.  The context of the proposal does not reach further than the calculation of the tax base.  The common rules do not interfere with the determination of the tax liability and national budgetary priorities of member states.  </p> <p>  The most notable change in the re-launched CCCTB is that it will be mandatory for all EU companies in financial accounting groups with consolidated group revenues of more than &euro;750 million.  Non-qualifying companies - those below &euro;750 million - may still opt for the rules of the common base or CCCTB, as the case may be, subject to certain conditions.  They will have to meet the conditions to be within the scope of the directives.  The mandatory scope primarily serves the objective of fairer taxation.  It aligns the CCCTB with the policy priority for clamping down on the opportunities for tax avoidance but only targets those who possess the resources to engage in such practices.  This is why it is limited to larger multinational groups with a consolidated revenue exceeding &euro;750 million.  As already mentioned by our colleagues just now, these are the same companies which are subject to the country-by-country reporting between tax administrations, a proposal which was agreed by the Council earlier this year.  </p> <p>  I will not go into too much detail on the CCCTB.  I would, however, like to give an overview of how this system works, especially for those who are not familiar with it.  I will then briefly present some of the specific new elements introduced by the relaunch.  The first step in applying the CCCTB is the calculation of the individual tax bases.  For the companies that form part of the CCCTB group, tax bases will be calculated according to a common set of rules, which will be provided for in the directives.  The next step is that all results are added up by the principal tax authority to create a consolidated tax base for the group in the EU.  This means that loss-making results of one company of one member state are automatically set off against the taxable profits of others in the same group.  The tax return will be filed in one member state.  This is the so-called one-stop shop.  The advantage of a common base is there will be no transfer pricing formalities within the group.  The principal authority will apply the apportionment formula to distribute the consolidated tax base across the group.  Taxable revenues are allocated to each company of the group based on the weight of the three factors.  They are assets, labour and sales by destination, which each account for one third of the formula.  As already mentioned, member states are and remain free to set tax rates on their taxable shares individually.  </p> <p>  There are a number of important new elements in the proposals.  One concerns research and development.  The treatment of research and development has always been rather generous under the CCCTB.  The proposal of 2011 provided for full deductibility of research and development costs in the year in which they were incurred.  There is therefore no capitalisation and depreciation of research and development over a number of years.  This basic regime has been retained under the relaunched proposals with the exception of immovable property.  We included it in the initial 2011 proposal but one of the results of the discussions with member states was that it was better to leave this element of the immediate deduction out of the treatment of research and development.  In addition, the relaunched rules on the common tax base provide for a so-called super-deduction whereby research and development costs up to the first &euro;20 million receive an extra deduction of 50%.  In total, there will be a deduction of 150% of the costs.  For amounts above &euro;20 million, the extra deduction is 25%.  In that case, the deduction will be 125% in total.  </p> <p>  Innovative startups are entitled to an enhanced super-deduction which allows them to deduct up to 200% of their research and development costs for amounts up to &euro;20 million.  We went for a rule that supports innovation and the actual research and development activity itself.  This is contrary to intellectual property, IP, boxes, where one looks at the income coming from an already developed asset.  Our rule promotes the employment and the fact that research is being undertaken.  Given that most of research and development costs involve payroll, our rule should be expected to bring forth considerable benefits in terms of jobs and growth.  By giving larger-scale deductions for costs up to &euro;20 million, the research and development incentive will give a boost to smaller companies with limited research and development budgets to allow them to grow.  It will therefore encourage the creation and expansion of young, innovative enterprises.</p> <p>  The second new element in the CCCTB proposals is the allowance for growth and investment, AGI.  This is an adjustment mechanism for neutralising the debt bias in current tax systems.  It will put debt financing and equity financing on an equal footing.  The rule is entirely in line with the objectives of the capital markets union and is aimed to discourage excessive indebtedness and so bring greater stability to companies and therefore also to the union.  The AGI will reward companies that strengthen their financing structures by boosting their equity base.  In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises that often struggle to secure loans should be expected to reap the benefits from this rule.  The AGI framework is designed in such a way as to prevent cascading effects in the deductibility of what is commonly referred to as notional interest.</p><p>We have taken measures to ensure the system cannot be abused, for example, by excluding participations.  Where there is a parent company with a subsidiary, we have made sure the parent company cannot claim the notional interest deduction for the capital of the subsidiary because that is capital from which a deduction should be claimed at the level of the subsidiary.</p><p> A final element is a temporary cross-border loss relief with recapture mechanisms.  This is a cash flow facility to make up for the absence of cross-border consolidation at the first stage.  The repercussions of this facility are, however, contained by a series of anti-tax abuse measures.  For example, there will be automatic recapture of relief after five years if the subsidiary has not returned to profit in the meantime.</p><p> The CCCTB, common consolidated corporate tax base, can offer many benefits to Irish businesses, particularly in terms of tax certainty and simplicity for Irish-based multinationals which operate in other member states.  These benefits, combined with Ireland's 12.5% rate, would enhance Ireland's competitiveness, not reduce it.  Foreign investors and cross-border businesses are keen to have the CCCTB in place.  They are among our strongest supporters.  Ireland's primary concern is with consolidation.  The two-step approach means that once the common base is secured, we can give full focus to finding an approach to consolidation that all member states can accept.  In any case, with unanimity, Ireland can feel secure that its views will be taken on board before the final CCCTB is agreed.  It would send an important signal in the EU and internationally if Ireland were to constructively engage on this file.</p></speech>

I cannot see how these proposals are not encroaching on member state competence over taxation.  The Commission is essentially seeking to rewrite our entire corporation tax code.  It tells us the rate is a matter for Ireland but the rate will apply to something determined by these common rules.  Once the base is agreed, the allocation of profits will again be determined by EU-wide rules, if these proposals were introduced.  How is this not an encroachment on the core competence of member states over the issue of taxation?</p> <p>  There is a long-standing argument, based on analysis, that overall this is a big negative for Ireland in terms of our corporation tax receipts and our attractiveness as a country for inward investment.  Will the delegation address this?  When it comes to the consolidation and allocation of profits across the EU, the three factors will be one third, one third, one third.  One of them is sales by destination.  Ireland will rank close to a statistical zero on that one third, given the scale of the Irish market in the EU.  This is the basis on which profits will be allocated across different member states.</p> <p>  How does the delegation deal with the issue of competence and the argument, backed up by analysis, that this is a negative for Ireland?  It seems to me that it is a matter of time before the Irish Government will repeat its previous position that it is not in favour of this.</p></speech>

Otherwise, we would not have proposed it.  We believe our proposals are entirely in line with, and in the spirit of, subsidiarity and proportionality.  It is important to keep in mind that what we do is make proposals.  It is for member states to either adopt or reject these proposals.  In the tax area, they do so in unanimity.  There are checks and balances to ensure that anything that is agreed at EU level carries the support of all member states, including Ireland.  On that score, I do not believe we would have any concerns that anything we propose would encroach on member states' sovereignty.</p> <p>  On the perceived negative effects for Ireland, I would be a bit cautious not to draw the conclusion too rapidly.  We will carefully need to listen to what the effects on individual member states will be.  When we present proposals, we look at their impact on the 28 member states.  What we did not do in this case was drill down to the level of the individual member states because our modelling does not allow that in any great detail.  This is also a matter in which member states will need to be engaged.  To drill down to the level of member states, one needs the kind of information that only member states can provide, such as tax files.  Member states are best placed to provide that information.  We are happy to do that analysis with them.</p> <p>  On the figures presented in the impact assessment, it is important to note the system is designed to be tax neutral.  Broadly, this is the case.  There may be minor pluses or minuses but when one looks at the grand total, they are designed to be neutral.  We saw the figures mentioned in the newspapers and they were used as the basis for the ESRI report referred to in the previous discussions.  There are probably a few caveats to be made.  The figures used here were used in the study carried out by the Irish Government and Ernst &amp;amp; Young in the context of the first CCCTB proposal in 2011.  This was based on figures from 2008 and it may be slightly outdated by now.  This an area in which we might want to compare notes to see how the figures compare to those used in our impact assessment.  Moreover, the effects measured on the CCCTB are from the 2011 proposal.  There are some fundamental changes in the relaunched proposal with method, the two-step approach and scope.  The new proposal also means the CCCTB will be mandatory for certain groups of taxpayers, which was not the case in the 2011 proposal.  The new proposal has new features such as research and development incentives and allowance for growth and investment, while it has been strengthened with the integration of all the elements of the anti-tax avoidance directive.  All these changes were not factored into the study carried out before.  We need to be cautious in using the figures related to the previous proposal to assess the impact of the current proposal on any member state.</p><p>We were very happy to compare notes with member states in carrying out these analyses of what the new proposals mean for them.</p><p> On the allocation and as mentioned already, there are three factors.  If one looks at member states, one will see that certain factors will be more relevant for some than for others.  It is clear, for example, that for member states with large domestic markets, the factor of sales by destination would be more important than for smaller member states.  In the case of Ireland, the other two factors, namely, capital and payroll, would be considerable.  I would not speculate on the outcome because this is something that we will still need to discuss with the member states.  I certainly would not jump to the conclusion that because Ireland has a relatively small domestic market, the formula will always work to the disadvantage of Ireland and other member states in a similar position.  If this was the case and if that was the outcome of the discussions with member states, then I am sure that there will be further discussions on whether this is the right formula and the right weighting for each of the different factors.  Of course, we are very open to having that discussion with the member states.</p><p> I should add that the formula is not something we have invented in the Commission.  It is a formula that has already been used for over 100 years in the United States of America because it has a system of formulary apportionment.  There are similar formulary apportionment systems applied in other countries around the world, including Canada and Switzerland.  In that sense, what we are proposing is not a complete novelty.  It is a system that is already in force in several places today.</p></speech>

As regards harmful tax competition, the EU has a long track record of discussions about and efforts to remove harmful tax practices in the EU.  I refer in particular to the work of the code of conduct group which started in the late 1990s.  That group has, over the years, rolled back harmful features of member states' preferential regimes in more than 100 cases, some of which involved Ireland.  Virtually all member states have their share of harmful preferential regimes that were rolled back.<br/><br/>On the question of whether we consider Ireland, in the current context, as a country involved in harmful tax questions, I do not think the answer is &quot;Yes&quot;.  No, this is not the case.  Have we had issues with certain preferential regimes in the past?  Yes, we have but in this respect Ireland is certainly not unique.  We have looked at all member states and have found fault in most.  All we can say is that in this respect we are in a much better place now than we were ten or 15 years ago.</p></speech>

We know from studies that on average their tax burden is substantially lower than that of small and medium sized enterprises.  The focus on multinationals above &euro;750 million is a pragmatic one.  It catches the most relevant population of companies in terms of those that are most likely to engage in aggressive tax planning.  According to our figures, worldwide there are some 6,000 multinational enterprises which would fall under the scope of the proposal, that is, which have a turnover of more than &euro;750 million, out of which some 3,500 are EU based.  We are looking at a manageable population but still a very relevant one.  I will ask my colleague to provide information on the share of total profits in the EU.</p></speech>

It shows the corresponding share of unconsolidated turnover in the EU.  It shows the relevance of the groups for cross-border activities.

Ireland has been a very constructive partner in our discussions, even on the 2011 proposal.  I should stress that those discussions were at the technical level, however.  They never reached the level of political decision-making.  It has always been made clear, not just by Ireland but by other member states as well, that engagement and active participation in technical discussions was without prejudice to the political appreciation of these proposals.  In that context, it is early days.  We have just issued our proposal and have had a first presentation by Commissioner Moscovici to the ECOFIN Council, where first reactions were broadly positive or at least there were no member states standing up and saying that they would never accept this.  It is still early days and we know, of course, that when we start discussing the details of these proposals, that concerns will be raised and positions will be expressed by the different member states.  We are very much looking forward to those discussions.</p> <p>  The ECOFIN Council has already adopted some first conclusions on the package, that is, on the CCCTB as well as on the anti-tax avoidance, ATA, ll and dispute resolution proposals.  At least in regard to the CCCTB proposals it has asked the incoming presidencies to continue to work on them.  There has been an invitation to the Maltese and Estonian presidencies to work on these files during their terms.  It is very important that these proposals do not just land on the nearest shelf but that there is actually an active debate on them at the Council.</p></speech>

That is simply not true because the witness is saying that if this measure goes through one of Ireland's tax rates is gone; it is either the 25% non-trading income or the 12.5%.  One of them is gone because two rates cannot exist.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Deputy Doherty is assuming that the CCCTB will replace the existing Irish corporate tax regime, which is not an assumption that is in our proposals.  It is entirely left up to member states to decide whether they will have two parallel tax systems in place.  The proposal provides that member states have to introduce the CCCTB and that it will be mandatory for certain groups of companies.  The proposals do not say that member states should do away with their existing national corporate tax systems.</p></speech>

Exactly.  With respect, Mr. Zuijdendorp is trying it again.  We know there is going to be a parallel system.  There will be the existing system for companies that have the threshold of below &euro;750 million and there will be the CCCTB, which means that one of the rates under the existing tax law will have to go.  A bit of honesty is required in this debate.  It is important.  If the State decides to go down this direction, or not, then it needs to do so with its eyes wide open.  Many of the issues people have with the European Union and where it is going is going are around this type of nonsense.  We are big people.  The Commission should sit down and explain this is what will apply, this is how it will work, this is what it will mean, instead of unelected Commission officials coming here and telling us not to worry, the rates are fine.  The rates are not fine.  If a State agrees to CCCTB - for the companies that are included either mandatorily or by opting in, only one rate will be allowed to apply.  This is a fundamental change.  One can argue whether or not one wants that, but it is a fundamental difference in how we tax corporations in the State.  How will the Commission treat capital gains?  Will it be one rate also?</p></speech>

We used a general equilibrium model that is quite good at assessing the effects of tax reform on the group of 28 member states, but it is less accurate when it comes to pinpointing the exact consequences for each individual member state.  This is simply because the model does not allow for that kind of differentiation.  These figures, and the CCCTB's intentions, are to be budgetary neutral.  That there may be a small plus or minus is more an effect of the model than an actual reflection of what might happen in practice.  It is also important to note that there are certain things that are not captured by a model.  These are quite significant elements.  For example, it does not capture the effect of the new measures that we are introducing, the effect of the research and development deduction or the effect of the allowance for growth and investment.  It also does not capture the effect that the application of anti-tax avoidance measures may have on the taxable revenues.  We can assume that it should have a positive effect but we cannot model for it and therefore have not included it.</p></speech>

I am finding it difficult to hear some of the previous exchanges we had with Revenue, but I believe it talked about 50 companies in Ireland would fall under the CCCTB proposal as mandatory.  Of those 50 companies has the Commission received from Revenue a detailed list of their taxable profits and how they are applied? What type of data set is the Commission putting in to its model? Whatever the model is, what figures are we talking about? We have had reports in the past that talked about effective tax rates and in particular a company that produced widgets, which is similar to no company in Ireland.  It all depends on what figures are being put in to the model.  Can Mr. Zuijdendorp explain to the committee where the Commission got the data and is it real data from some of a sample of the 50 companies?</p></speech>

The data we used came from the so-called core tax model.  They are real business data but we do not have the individual data on individual member states.  We do not know which of the 50 companies, or whatever number, of Irish multinationals would be covered by these data.

I welcome the delegation.  It has been stated that multinational groups will deal with a single tax administration within the EU, a principal tax authority that will be a one-stop-shop.  However, the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, will have the ability to drive every parent company out of the EU.  If the parent company is outside the EU, it can then go to whichever member state in which it decides to have a business.  It can go to a country with a low tax system or the most favourable taxation system.  Parent companies will leave the EU wholesale because they will be able to decide in which country they will be taxed favourably through the one-stop-shop.</p></speech>

In terms of the allocation of profits, it does not matter under the CCCTB where a company files its tax returns.  That it may file in a member state with a low tax rate is of no consequence, given that the member state may only get a small share of the allocated profits.  Having the main taxpayer in that member state does not mean that profits will be taxed at its favourable rate.  The effect of applying the formula is that it does not matter where a company files its tax returns, as the allocation of profits is not decided on that basis, but on the basis of where its assets, payroll and-----</p></speech>

That is incredible.  We are overcomplicating this.  Essentially, we are creating 27 tax bases and increasing bureaucracy and the costs on business.  A consolidated accounting profit in consolidated accounts is different from a CCCTB.  We are creating an extra layer of problems for a business.  There is no flexibility to deal with local and national issues.  Primary tax policy has to respond to those.  That is one of its main objectives with a view to delivering for the people in a state.  As such, the CCCTB would cause Ireland serious trouble.  We are sensitive to foreign direct investment and we want fair tax rules, but what I have heard today concerns me in that regard.</p></speech>

It is not our intention.  We have made that abundantly clear.</p><p>We would also be underestimating the intelligence of members states if we thought that by putting forward a proposal on the tax base, we would get them, by way of the backdoor, to harmonise their tax rates.

The Commission's proposal is based on one third of the assets, one third of the labour and one the third of the sales of a company.  The effective tax take of a smaller member state with a small domestic market that has a major level of exports will be down compared to that of a large member state with a large domestic market.  I am referring specifically to Ireland, which has a small open economy.  We survive on exports.  We have a population of approximately 5 million people.  We have a large multinational presence here exporting to European Union member states' markets.  Will small member states with their small-scale exports and small domestic markets not be disenfranchised compared to the large member states with large domestic markets?</p></speech>

With respect, the figures do not lie.  Mr. Zuijdendorp is saying that, effectively, one third of this common consolidated corporate tax base will be based around sales.  Let us consider the case of a company based in Ireland that makes 90% of its sales in Germany and only 2% in this country.  At present, the Irish Exchequer is collecting 100% off the profits of that company at 12.5%.  What will happen under the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB?</p></speech>

We believe that a formula is a better measure of ensuring that profits are taxed where they are generated than the current practices based on transfer pricing, which allow for a far greater degree of shifting profits to where they may be taxed at a lower rate rather than where they have been generated.</p></speech>

The base erosion and profit shifting measures are extremely important and that is why we support them and why we have proposals to introduce them in the EU but they address the consequences of base erosion and profit-shifting.  The CCCTB addresses the problem at the root, so we believe it is more effective.</p></speech>

This has been around since the year dot.  It is like an old model of a car that the manufacturer keeps bringing out year after year.  It will never sell.
