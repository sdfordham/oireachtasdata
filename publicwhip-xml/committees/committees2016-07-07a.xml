Apologies have been received from Deputy Marc MacSharry.</p> <p>  I welcome members to the first meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts of the Thirty-second D&aacute;il.  I am pleased to have been selected as Chairman.  I am committed to working with members to fulfil our remit.  We will hold approximately 300 publicly funded organisations to account on how public money is spent.  Our focus is to ensure that citizens get best services and value whereever possible and that all public moneys are well spent.  Our work is primarily historical in that we must examine spending that has already taken place.  The basic question we must ask is whether the money given to Departments and public bodies has been well spent.  From past experience we know the answer is not always "yes", but where past mistakes cannot be corrected, we must learn from them.  We must expect or demand that bodies examined by the committee recognise where things could have been done better and, more important, commit to the need to improve in the future.  We have an important role in ensuring this happens so that citizens get the best possible service.  </p> <p>  We will be calling witnesses here every week and we expect prompt and comprehensive answers from them.  If witnesses do not have the answer to hand when they appear in person, I will expect them to have an official who can obtain the relevant information and supply it to us before the end of the meeting.  In circumstances where they cannot provide the information before the end of the meeting, I expect they will answer the questions in writing within two weeks.  If this is not done, they will be brought back in person to answer why the information was not provided.  This will happen automatically four weeks after their first appearance before the committee.  This should ensure that questions are not left on the long finger.  That fact will be stated in the letter of invitation to the witnesses.  Having said that, witnesses will be treated fairly.  I encourage members to pass on their areas of interest to the Clerk in advance of a meeting so that witnesses can prepare in advance to respond to the questions.  This will lead to a more productive meeting.  We will allow for a general discussion after I take the first item on the agenda.</p></speech>

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>As this is the first meeting of the new Committee of Public Accounts, there are many new members and also some new Deputies.

In the previous D&aacute;il, particularly during its last year or so, I was concerned that obstacles were being put in the committee's way.  In some instances, it may have been legitimate, but in others I considered it to be overly conservative and cautious and a little obstructionist in investigating certain matters.</p> <p>  I congratulate the Chairman and the Vice Chairman on assuming their positions.  The work the committee does is important, in that we follow the money and are the voice of the citizen and taxpayer.  I hope we will be facilitated in doing that job within the boundaries of Standing Orders, good practice and procedure.  I hope we will not have a repeat performance of what happened in the last 12 months or so of the previous D&aacute;il when it became very difficult to pursue certain matters.  Many of the themes the committee will address are carry-overs from the previous D&aacute;il when we did good work.  The Chairman and the Vice Chairman have stewardship of the committee and I hope members will be supported and facilitated in asking questions on behalf of the public in a non-party political way so as to ensure we can get our work done.</p></speech>

We will revert to a general discussion on the work of the committee, but I now ask Mr. McCarthy to give a general overview and explain to members his role, particularly <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-07a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016070700002#C00600"><p>I will outline the matters about which the Chairman asked.  I will not get too technical or legalistic in dealing with them, but I should probably mention some of the legal constraints.  As most members probably know, I am appointed under Article 33 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, but my office and I operate mainly under the provisions of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 which is the core legislation.</p> <p>  The comptroller and auditor general functions are determined and defined in the Constitution.  The comptroller function relates to the release of funds from the Central Fund of the Exchequer.  It is a straightforward process.  The Department of Finance or the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, applies to my office for what is called a credit.  Assuming that we are satisfied there is a legal basis for either body to receive the funding, we agree to the release of the money from the Exchequer.  It does not take a large part of the resources of the office.  There are perhaps three or four staff in total engaged in it and it is not full time.  It probably works out at somewhere between a half-time and a whole-time equivalent staff member in a year.</p> <p>  The auditor general function is my office's primary function.  It involves the audit of accounts and financial statements of public bodies.  Members are probably familiar with that work.  It also involves the carrying out of value for money, VFM, examinations under section 9 of the 1993 Act or inspections which are carried out under section 8.  I can discuss these examinators and inspections further.</p> <p>  I am also required by law to report to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in particular ways and on particular matters.  I issue a report on each audit we carry out - the individual audit certificate attached to a set of financial statements.  Separately, there is a provision whereby I publish the appropriation accounts, the accounts of Departments in respect of the Votes for which they are responsible.  I am required to publish each year with them a report which is usually issued in September.  Since the two elements are locked together, everything must come at the same time because that is how the law requires it.</p> <p>  I can also issue special reports which may either relate to general matters that arise from the audits we conduct - for instance, if there is a common theme, I may report on a general matter - or VFM examinations or inspections.</p> <p>  I am specifically prohibited by the 1993 Act from commenting in my reports on policy matters.  Members will not find a reference to, or at least a comment on, policy.  We may point to the result of the implementation of policy, but members will not find a judgment on the merits of a policy.</p> <p>  Apart from the 1993 legislation, there is other legislation that makes me the auditor of certain entities and creates slightly different relationships in terms of accountability, for example, the Health Service Executive legislation, the NAMA legislation, the Central Bank legislation and the universities legislation.  While I am the auditor of the Central Bank, a limitation is placed in the legislation on the Central Bank's accountability that excludes the bank from accountability to the Committee of Public Accounts for its financial statements.  If I was to carry out a VFM examination of how the Central Bank spends its money, it would be within the parameters of the committee, but the bank is otherwise the subject of an unusual exclusion from the committee's remit.  There is a similar provision in the case of Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon which stems from the legislation underr which they were established.</p> <p>  In total, we audit approximately 290 sets of accounts or financial statements each year.  These funds and entities have a combined turnover of approximately &euro;200 billion.  Obviously, funds flow between them, but because they were set up as separate funds and entities, we must audit the two sides of transactions.</p><p> The number of funds and accounts that we audit is down from a peak of about 370 or 375.  That is due to the amalgamation and abolition of agencies and some consolidation of the accounting arrangements that are put in place, where perhaps what was a departmental fund is now absorbed in and it becomes a note of another set of financial statements.  At the moment, as I said, we have about 290 funds and entities. </p><p> There are two specific exclusions from my remit that the committee might wish to note.  The first is commercial semi-State bodies and their subsidiaries.  They do not come within my remit.  I do not carry out the financial audit of companies like CIE, Coillte, Bord G&aacute;is or RTE.  I do not have a remit to go in and carry out a value-for-money examination or an inspection in those and because of that, by extension, the Committee of Public Accounts is limited in its scope in calling them.  </p><p> The other area where I do not have a remit is local authorities.  Local authorities are audited by the Local Government Audit Service not by me.  Again, that has an implication for the business of the Committee of Public Accounts.  </p><p> On financial statements, I think it is something maybe to note and again I do not need to get too detailed about this.  Votes, most departmental funds and education and training board accounts are prepared on what is called a cash basis.  That is the accounts recognise cash received or cash issued in the period in which it issues or is received.  All the other accounts and entities prepare their accounts on what is called an accruals basis.  Essentially, transactions are recognised in the period to which they relate rather than the period in which they occur.  Effectively, apart from Votes, Department funds and the ETBs, one should expect to see the same kind of set of financial statements in a public body that one would expect in a private body.  Maybe one difference would be the level of disclosure.  There are guidelines issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on matters that should be disclosed in financial statements.  We encourage Departments and - maybe a little bit more than encourage - we push them to ensure they do comply with disclosure requirements.  Sometimes there can be a question as to whether it would be useful for there to be a disclosure of a particular matter.  We are quite strong in encouraging Departments to be as transparent as possible and to put as much information into the public domain as is relevant for the purpose of transparency about public business.</p><p> Organisationally, I am supported in the exercise of my functions by my office, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Technically, I am not part of the office and it is a separate entity.  I exist as an individual carrying out my functions but, as I said, I am supported by the office.  It is staffed by civil servants.  The office is headed by Andy Harkness who is the Secretary and Accounting Officer for the office.  He manages the Vote for the office.  He also acts as a director of audit and is involved in carrying out and overseeing audits, along with two other directors of audit. </p><p> Each of the directorates within my office has a mix of financial and reporting responsibilities.  They would have a grouping of financial statements, maybe within the areas of education,  health, etc.   We try to take a relatively vertical view so that we can understand better the business within individual sectors and that it is the same people who manage and carry out the audits in the health sector, the education sector, etc.    </p><p> My office employes a total of about 140 whole-time equivalent staff.  In terms of the breakdown, some 75% of the staff or about 105 people are engaged mainly in financial audit work.  Approximately 15% or 22 people would be engaged in reporting work and approximately 14 individuals or 10% are engaged in the provision of support services such as IT, the finance unit, HR and so on.  Within the staffing, 94 or 95 staff are qualified accountants and 40 would be pursuing accountancy studies at the moment.  All of the staff are based in Dublin but the staff do undertake extensive travel as part of the financial auditing of clients based outside Dublin.  A considerable number of our clients are located not just in Dublin but in all counties at this stage, I think.</p><p> Over the past number of years I have seconded, or my office has seconded, an individual staff member to the Committee of Public Accounts to act as a liaison officer.  Mr. Billy Carrie is my colleague and he is with me today.  I propose that he will be the liaison officer for the next year or so at least. </p><p> The core function of the liaison officer is to provide the Members with timely briefings on the key points in my reports or in the financial statements that are presented for the committee.  I am conscious how busy Members are and how little time there is in a week to prepare for a meeting.  I think that in the past maybe we have been producing, quite heavily, text-based presentations of information.  I am not sure that that is the best way to deliver information to Members.  I would like us to find, together, a way of getting the key information to Members in advance of meetings so that they are best placed to be able to carry out their function.  I hope that we will be able to find a way that is useful.  Mr. Carrie will be working with the clerk in trying to do that work.  We will try different things and see what works best.  Maybe different things work best for different Members and we are open to finding ways of making that work. </p><p> I thank the Chairman.  I am quite happy to take any questions on the matters that I have outlined.  </p></speech>

It is a matter of long standing that it is the Local Government Audit Service and it operates within the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government; it is a parallel.  Its audit is quite similar to the audit that we carry out and its remit, in general, very much mirrors our own.  Because of the reporting relationship between local authorities and the elected members locally, it is felt appropriate that the audit process would be targeted at a local level as well.</p> <p>  There is a development.  In the past three years we have had the appointment of an oversight committee, which is operational.  It oversees and looks for general trends in what is happening at local government level.  I think its second annual report is due out around now.  It is something that is discussed between the committee here and the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, when he appears.  As I said, it is enshrined in legislation.  Also, I think local government is enshrined in the Constitution as a separate level of government.  The audit arrangements mirror that and try to ensure that there is a line of accountability at local level that does not, if one likes, cut across what is happening at the committee.  It is a matter for the Legislature, I suppose to-----  </p></speech>

For example, we are working on a review of the arrangements for motor tax collection, some of which is collected centrally and paid into the local government fund and some of which is collected locally through motor tax offices.  We are co-operating with the Local Government Audit Service to present a report on it and I expect to complete it in the autumn.  We are trying to ensure audit arrangements follow the money to the greatest extent possible and that there are no grey areas or areas where something is failing at the edges of responsibility.</p></speech>

Apart from the annual accounts of the public bodies he oversees, I am curious about the value for money reports and the special reports.  By what process does the Comptroller and Auditor General select topics or subjects for the reports and what scope is there for the Committee of Public Accounts to request that he make a particular selection?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-07a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016070700002#E00400"><p>The way my role is set up in law is that I am independent in the choice of matters on which I report.  As I said earlier, 75% of the resources of my office are dedicated to financial audit work.  The amount of resource we have available for what is discretionary, the reporting side, is limited.  Given that we have to do the financial audits, this gets the first cut of resources.  It is always a struggle to have sufficient resources to investigate the matters I consider should be investigated.</p> <p>  In the main, we identify topics in two ways.  First, when carrying out the financial audit when we are inside organisations, we may find issues about which we are concerned.  If we see that a major capital project that has been running for a number of years is not making the progress it should, we would flag it as something we should consider for reporting.  We have a list of 140 to 160 issues that would potentially be something to examine, but it is impractical for us to get to all of them.  We have to make choices, and we make them on a rolling basis.</p> <p>  There is provision for the Committee of Public Accounts to communicate with me, as Comptroller and Auditor General, and draw a matter to my attention which I should consider.  The tradition in the past was that if the committee was minded that there was something important, it would be very difficult for me to say I was not going to do it, assuming it was in my area of responsibility.  Over the years, when matters have generated a certain amount of public interest or there has been ongoing public concern, I would have taken it into consideration in my choices about what was prioritised.  An example is when we examined the funding around SIPTU and training courses a number of years ago.  We carried out the examination because we felt we could assist with bringing information into the public domain.</p> <p>  I am happy to engage with the committee and understand what its concerns are.  Given that I am here every week, I listen to what members are asking and what the focus is.  I get an understanding from them, which reflects what is happening with citizens generally as to what is important and what is of concern.  We try to do work that speaks to those concerns, answers them and brings information which may be helpful to the committee and members of the public.</p></speech>

Will this affect any of the work in which we are involved?  What difficulties are there?  Do they impinge on the Comptroller and Auditor General doing his job in any way?  From talking to those who were members of the Committee of Public Accounts before and colleagues, I am conscious that the volume of information and data management here will be incredible.  I very much welcome and was taken by the fact that Mr. McCarthy is examining other ways in which to provide us with the information.  Could he elaborate on how he will do it?  We need to have the capacity to examine everything.  I presume Mr. McCarthy is talking about providing information in some format and then we can make a decision about whether we will dig deeper.  It would be helpful, and we can make our own decisions.  Could Mr. McCarthy elaborate on it?</p></speech>

Therefore, one is always trying to approach it from underneath.  We try to staff up as much as possible so we can use the maximum level of resources available to us.  While the limit is 165 members, we are operating at approximately 140.  Turnover in the office has increased during recent years.  For the past couple of years, the staff turnover has been approximately 13% to 14%, which is quite high.  It is difficult to maintain a workforce and have the right people in the right places at the right time.  It means we must invest a large amount of resource in training.  Mr. Billy Carrie has been heading up our training and professional development unit during recent years, and we constantly invest in it.  There is quite a demand for the skill set that many of our staff members have and they find opportunities outside.  This is what gives rise to the turnover.</p> <p>  We use two techniques to address some of the gaps.  We take in professional, qualified accountancy staff from agencies to slot in and fill places on the audit teams.  A challenge this may give us is that, very often, people coming from a private sector background may not have an appreciation of public sector issues and concerns.  Our audit goes considerably beyond a standard private sector audit.  We have much more emphasis on regularity matters, which is that transactions are done in accordance with the law, and, due to the interest of the Committee of Public Accounts, much more emphasis on governance and propriety matters.  We regularly report on those.  While drawing resources from outside is a short-term solution, a better solution is more permanent staff.</p> <p>  We contract out some of the work.  One of the features of the public sector is that almost all agencies operate on a calendar year accounting basis.  This means everybody finishes their accounting year in December and all the accounts are due for delivery to us in February, March and April, when we get a huge peak in demand for our work.  As well as contracting out and in, we try to manage this peak as best we can.  We are not always able to get to every entity in April or May.  Some have to be deferred until June or July, whereas we get the bigger, higher value accounts dealt with early on.  The bigger accounts include the Central Bank, National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and the Revenue.  We have managed to bring the finance accounts forward.</p><p>There are certain implications with respect to the way we are resourced and that has an effect on the delivery of financial statements to the committee.  It can expect to see smaller entities' accounts coming in later in the year rather than them all coming in together by the end of June.</p><p> On the issue of data management, I have learned the difficulty involved in getting briefing notes on briefing notes and telephone books are presented to me.  I have three folders of material with me today.  I sympathise with the challenge the committee has in preparing for these meetings.  The way in which everybody accesses information is changing.  We absorb information better now in a more visual way.  We are looking at ways of summarising information and at graphical ways to present text which will the give members information at their fingertips without forcing them to read pages of text to figure out what is going on.  That is just a suggestion.  That works for me but it may not work for the members, or it may some but not for others.  It could be that a face-to-face briefing between the members and Billie Carrie, where they would have a conversation with him before the meeting, might be best way to help them to quickly understand the key issues in a set of financial statements or in a report.  We will just have to see what works.  I am quite happy to get feedback from committee if it does not work for them or if they think something different would work.  We will try to find ways of assisting them.</p></speech>

I commend the Chairman and the Vice Chairman on their roles and wish them well in them over the next number of years.  We can have both options when it comes to getting information to the committee.  We can get the information in the way the committee got in the past but we could get a hybrid version of it where we could get more visual, shorter presentations and it would be up to us to dip deeper if we wanted to, although we would have to get full information.  That would be a good way to start and we could see how it works out.</p> <p>  On the question of the lines of demarcation and the issue of local government, I do not want to deal with the substantive issue as I will deal with that under item 4 of the work programme, which is the use of public private partnerships, PPPs, and how much State money is spent on PPPs.   The National Development Finance Agency is responsible for all PPPs over &euro;20 million and all PPPs generally, except in the areas of transport and local government.  A central unit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform chairs the steering committee and has responsibility for all PPPs.  Local government has developed a range of PPPs in all sorts of areas, ranging from waste to wastewater.  If it so wished, would it be possible for the committee to deal with PPPs, including local government, given that a central unit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has overall responsibility for PPPs?  I will deal with the substantive issue later under item 4.</p></speech>

For a number of years, we were collating information about liabilities under PPPs from central government offices and Departments for the audits for which we are responsible.  The Deputy mentioned the National Development Finance Agency and my understanding it that it assists Departments and local authorities on their projects but it is not responsible for them as such.  It is a technical unit.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has a PPP unit but it would probably not accept that it is directly responsible or accountable for individual projects.  It is responsible for the framework within which local authorities, State bodies and Departments engage in PPPs and so on.  Regarding the liabilities under PPPs, there is a case for perhaps more central collation and presentation of information about the projects.  A project in which there was specific interest at this committee was the Poolbeg incinerator project but the understanding was that it was outside the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  There is really no way around it.  I do not audit Dublin City Council, therefore, I cannot examine it.  I do not know how I can be more helpful to the committee on that.</p></speech>

I do not audit the general government debt; I audit the national debt, which is the borrowing undertaken by National Treasury Management Agency.  With respect to that borrowing, there is a set of financial statements which comes to the committee called the account of the national debt.  It is also incorporated into the finance accounts.  That is the limit of remit of the Committee of Public Accounts in regard to that.  If the liabilities are accounted outside that, my understanding is that it would not fall to the committee.</p></speech>

They are produced by the Department of Finance.  My personal view, and this is something I have recommended, is that the finance accounts could be expanded and improved but it is a matter for Committee of Public Accounts to engage with the Department of Finance on that.  The format of accounts generally in the pubic sector is a matter for the line Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I cannot decide that the structure and the level of disclosures in a set of financial statements should be different.  I have to work within the framework that is set by the relevant Ministers.  It is within the competency and the remit of the committee to look at the financial statements and to form a view, if the members are so minded, that those financial statements do not cover all of the information they think is appropriate to be in the public domain.  Were they look at the finance accounts the next time they appear before the committee, if they were to step back from them and consider them in terms of the level of information they give, they could ask if that the kind of information that needs to be in the public domain and what would they, as members of the committee, wish to recommend be changed.  They would then get a response from the relevant Minister.</p><p> Just to give an example, the finance accounts are a cash account and do not have a balance sheet so the liabilities and the assets of the State are not presented in the account of the Central Fund of the Exchequer.  The committee may decide it would like to see that and there would be a job of work involved in compiling it.  Back in 2012 or 2013, the IMF came in and had a look at the form of accounting and the structures for accounting and made recommendations about the necessity for a whole-of-government account and, if one likes, a more comprehensive view than the finance accounts give.  A project has commenced on that and I reported on it when it was starting out.  I envisage a further report giving a progress report on that project, which will come to the committee, probably not this year but perhaps next year.  It is a line of questioning and Deputies do not have to wait for a report.  Given that the project is under way, they could engage with the Secretary General of the Department of Finance on that when he appears.</p></speech>

A number of the questions I intended to ask have already been asked and answered.  On lines of communication, I presume the Comptroller and Auditor General will be in a position to provide us with the direct lines and methods of communication that have been available in the past.

On the Comptroller and Auditor General's point on the turnover of personnel, he is in the unique position of being fully aware that such turnover is currently fairly standard in the public sector because of the rising economy.  He correctly noted the expertise in his office and I have seen similar trends in many similar specialised departments recently.  The bottom line is the remuneration available in the public sector versus that in the private sector and the level of expertise in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That is regrettable.</p> <p>  While I do not wish to put words in his mouth, I am sure the Comptroller and Auditor General will freely admit that the use of agency staff is a sticking plaster in terms of what he is trying to achieve in his office.  While it may be useful for particular items, it is not necessarily the ideal scenario for the head of an office, such as Mr. McCarthy, in the long term.  I do not know whether this issue will be the subject of a debate next year as we wade through the work programme.</p> <p>  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for his presentation.  I ask him to forgive me as I did not have a chance to read it because it was sent after 7 o'clock last night.</p></speech>

As a new Deputy and member of the committee, I appreciate their appearance.  Deputy Farrell touched on the question I wanted to ask.  Having read some of the turgid legal texts from the past 20 years, I would find a summary of information very helpful, perhaps some form of <i>aide-m&eacute;moire</i>or precis, as Deputy Farrell noted.  This does not mean we cannot read everything but we would have the key points available to us.  That would be very important because members to whom I have spoken, some of whom are present, alluded to the fact that it takes a long time to read all the documentation.  I do not know who would provide a summary - perhaps the staff of the committee - or if the resources are available to do so but it would be very helpful.  This is a laborious process which takes a long time and I am in favour of simplifying matters rather than over-complicating them.  I thank Mr. McCarthy for his presentation which I found very helpful and beneficial.</p></speech>

As audits are carried out by different units within the organisation, it is impractical for me to give members a list of who is responsible for the different audits.  If members then telephoned the organisation, the list will have changed within a month and people will have changed responsibility.  In general, if Deputies have a query or wish to know something, they should contact Mr. Carrie.</p> <p>  I want to be careful here.  If any of the members feel they would like a more detailed presentation, we are willing and would be happy to have them come individually or perhaps in a group of two or three to our offices.  We could spend a morning working through the list of the accounts, showing members the accounts and audit certificates and talking about what we are trying to do.  That is an offer.  However, I know some members are very experienced and will certainly not need that kind of orientation.  We are more than happy to do this and we can send over a number of people.  We can organise that here and we will try to accommodate whatever works for members.  If they feel a summary will work, we will be happy to provide one.  Mr. Carrie will work ahead.  Once the programme is settled, it allows him to plan, get a piece together and set out the issues for members.  As I stated, we will try it and find out what works for individual Deputies and if something works better for somebody, we will try to accommodate that as well.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. McCarthy for his presentation.</p> <p>  I propose to address the issue of demarcation lines raised by Deputies Aylward and Cullinane from a different angle.  I seek clarity on this issue because the local government sector is responsible for the expenditure of hundreds of millions of euro.  I acknowledge what Mr. McCarthy said regarding the current auditing process and audit committees in the various counties.  However, these are very much focused on revenue streams.</p> <p>  I will address the capital expenditure side and the correlation between funding provided directly by Departments for capital schemes.  Some of the most substantive work done is the funding of capital schemes that come under a separate budget distinct from the revenue stream.  Housing schemes are about to become the subject of a strong focus because they will soon be delivered very rapidly, including in terms of land acquisition.</p> <p>  I note the number of Departments and agencies, including the Housing Agency, which the Comptroller and Auditor General audits.  In recent years, bad debts of tens of millions of euro generated by land acquisition have nearly bankrupted some councils.  These debts have been offloaded into the land aggregation scheme, LAG, to get them off the books of local authorities.  The debts arose when public funds were used in bad deals involving the acquisition of landbanks that could never have been developed.  These deals crucified councils because interest payments on them removed money from revenue streams that were to be allocated for public expenditure.  This issue comes under the remit of the Housing Agency, one of the bodies that are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  While I acknowledge Mr. McCarthy's point on approaching the issue from the local government side, there is significant scope for approaching it from the other side because all of the schemes are ultimately funded by a superior body, whether through the funding of loans by the Housing Agency or through the schemes that will be implemented on the ground by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I seek an explanation in this regard because large sums have been expended in an incorrect manner.  These must be examined because they have an impact on public funds and are not subject to an appropriate level of scrutiny under the current regime.</p></speech>

For the past six or seven years, one of the reports that we have included in the report that is published in September is an update on the flows of funds from central government to local authorities.  It is designed exactly to put a finger on how much money emanates from the Exchequer towards local authorities.  What we cannot do is go into the local authorities to find out how it is spent.  That is where the limit is put on us but we do exactly what the Deputy mentioned in that we identify the flows of funds.  Presenting that information is a complex process.  I feel that it is a form of report that the committee should be expecting from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government rather than from me.  It is absorbing resources on my part when it is the kind of information on which would be perfectly reasonable to expect the Department to give an overview report each year.  The point of the report we present each year is that it creates a context for this exact debate with the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p> <p>  We have also examined spending on water services, housing and grant schemes and we have considered the land aggregation scheme, LAG, and we have reported on same.  I can have Mr. Carrie forward those reports to the Deputy or the whole committee so as to show members the kind of work that we have done and to which we revert periodically.  However, we cannot do a report on the LAG every year.  It is not within our current level of resources.  There is scope for the committee to have an engagement with the Housing Agency and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government about the kinds of programme that they are funding.</p></speech>

One of my first questions was on resources but it has been asked and I will not repeat it.  However, I will address Mr. McCarthy's answer.  His office is functioning with 140 staff whereas its complement is 165.  Has Mr. McCarthy formed a view and gone to the Government concerning the number of staff he needs to do his job properly in light of the large number of bodies that his office examines?  Is it 290?</p></speech>

Half way through, it was suspended.  I never believed it to be a good idea.  I would appreciate the report that is being carried out and any update.  Some land was transferred into the body in Dublin at great cost, although I do not know what that cost was.  Certain loans have been taken while others have not.  I am lost as to where the value for money was in that scheme.</p> <p>  Who is monitoring the value for money of using agency staff and contracting out work as a result of a lack of staff?  Is it cost effective?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-07a.57" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016070700002#H00800"><p>On resources, the office's staffing level before the downturn and the 2008 crisis was approximately 175.  Every organisation had to take a cut in the circumstances.  Our staffing level was reduced to 165.  Although it fell to 150, it has been increased to 165.  The committee will recall that in addition, we were given NAMA, which is probably our largest audit, absorbing something in the region of seven to nine whole-time equivalent staff members in a year.  It is a significant change.</p> <p>  My predecessor and I took the view that, even though we believed that what we did delivered value for money, we could not in the circumstances be the first ones up asking for additional resources.  There were other significant service delivery demands, for example, teaching, hospitals and so on.  We did not believe that it would be appropriate for us to put ourselves forward as a special case in years past.</p> <p>  It is a disappointment to me that we are not producing more reporting work.  There is a great deal of potential for us to do it.  It is expensive and resource-intensive work.  Since it is a discretionary piece, our capacity to deliver the kinds of report that are helpful to the committee gets hit whenever we have a gap in resources.</p> <p>  In terms of the value to be had from using agency staff, we are always conscious of the cost, including relative cost, of engaging them.  We keep it under constant review.  During the downturn, people were let go from other organisations and became unemployed, which meant that there was a pool of talent from which we could draw at reasonable prices.  With the upturn in the economy of recent years, however, it is becoming more expensive.  Even within agency resources, the turnover has become more difficult to manage.  With the heat in the economy, we are probably getting to the stage at which it is less attractive for us to use agency staff.  On the other hand, it can be useful at a point in time.  We may need to consider other models for finding staff to plug those gaps, which is a constant challenge.  We interview people to determine whether they are suitable and we agree for them to start but because they are agency staff, they might get permanent job offers and be gone.  That can leave one with a planning problem if, for example, one is about to commence an audit.  Operationally, it is not ideal but it is better than having ever increasing delays in the completion of audits and the delivery and presentation of financial statements.</p> <p>  Regarding the land aggregation scheme, we have dealt with the issues that the Deputy raised about the two phases - the land aggregation and the stopping - in the report that I mentioned when answering Deputy Cassells.  We will let Deputy Connolly have the report.  It may answer some of the points that she raised.  As the Chairman suggested, the Secretary General may be in a position to update the report's information when he appears before the committee, giving the Deputy a fresher perspective.</p></speech>

Some are small and they might have a turnover of &euro;20,000, &euro;1 million, &euro;1.5 million or &euro;10 million.  They vary considerably.  For instance, the HSE has a substantial internal audit function but all public bodies are expected to have some internal audit function.  The smaller ones tend to contract it out and, therefore, they will use Mazars or Deloitte to carry out an internal audit programme that is set for them and reviewed by the audit committee within the organisation.  Their focus should be on the operation of the internal controls.  Our primary focus is on the true and fair view in the financial statements and the propriety and governance issues at a higher level but we expect internal audit to go in and look in detail at what happens within schemes, the payments systems and so on.</p> <p>  Where there is a well-established and professional internal audit function operating, we take into account the work they are doing when we plan our work.  We can place reliance, therefore, on the internal audit's work if we are satisfied that it is independent and professional and producing the right quality of work.  We tend to try to avoid a situation where if they have programmed a piece of work, we cut across it and do the same thing.  It is not an efficient use of resources.  We examine the work they have done, the areas they have covered and the findings and we look for the systemic implications of what they find.  That is the kind of thing we draw to the attention of the audit committee when we report and to management in a management letter and so on.  We also look to see that where internal audit has carried out an exercise, the organisation responds to the recommendations and implements them or changes the control regime in order that risks are closed off.  Our auditors meet regularly with internal audit personnel to try to understand their programme and their priorities and to a certain extent to assess and be satisfied that the internal audit function is meaningful to the operation of the organisation.</p></speech>

If any member or group of members wish to have a further discussion with his office, they should contact the secretariat and that can be arranged.</p> <p>  The committee continues from D&aacute;il to D&aacute;il and, therefore, there is a carryover of work from the previous D&aacute;il.  It does not have to re-established.  I wish to deal with correspondence, reports and statements since the last meeting, which was prior to the election, and our work programmes.  Issues relating to the HSE and Console will come under the work programme.  If members have queries on correspondence that has been circulated to them, we can defer it and come back to it at a subsequent meeting.  The secretariat produces a schedule, which is in the file.  For simplicity, we deal with three categories of correspondence.  Category A is correspondence and briefing relating to the subject meeting of a particular.  We will deal with the OPW next week.  Correspondence under this category will deal with the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of the OPW, briefing material from the OPW and the Comptroller and Auditor General's office or e-mails from the committee about the topic of the day.  We do not have such correspondence today because no external body is appearing before us.</p> <p>  Category B is correspondence from the Accounting Officers or Ministers as a follow-up to a meeting.  Regularly, information has to be supplied to us subsequently and we get correspondence which is filed under this category.  It is essentially correspondence from departmental sources.  Correspondence under both these categories is almost always published on the website.</p> <p>  Category C is correspondence from individuals about different issues and any other correspondence.  We decide whether to note it, forward it or investigate it, as the case may be.</p> <p>  No. 5b is a letter of clarification dated 16 February from Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport responding to the previous committee's request for information in respect of the compulsory purchase lands and goodwill payments to the 5,000 farmers who had permitted early access to their land as part of the roads programme.  Is it agreed to note that?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 6b is a letter dated 12 February from Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health, keeping the committee informed of developments in respect to the Irish Blood Transfusion Service pension fund.  We can note it and members are free to come back to it again.</p> <p>  No. 8b is a letter dated 23 February from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, providing follow-up information to the committee on two matters relating to Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, and Eircode.  The accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General but I was not aware that IFI is a rateable organisation similar to a local authority.  This was news to me when I read that.  If officials can establish the owner of some grounds where people fish, they can raise a commercial rate.  I never knew this and, worryingly, the letter states a rates bill is sent out once a year and if it is not paid, the organisation provides in full for it.  It is extraordinary that an organisation would write off unpaid commercial rates.  Will the Comptroller and Auditor General forward the most recent audit report for IFI to the secretariat?  I would like to come back to this issue because I was shocked to uncover that yesterday and I do not want to let it go.  There might be nothing untoward in this but it was news to me and I would like detailed information on this.</p><p> No. 12B is a letter from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE, responding to the committee and providing notes re legal advice regarding the ending of a residential care arrangement for an adult and also on training in open disclosure for certain members of staff that related to a particular lady called Grace.  The matter was dealt with extensively.  People asked what training the staff received in terms of the open disclosure of issues and we can note the reply.  If somebody has a personal interest in this matter then he or she should feel free to raise it again.  </p><p> Nos. 17B, 18B, 19B, 20B and 21B are minutes from the Minister and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They are responses to previous reports that we did.  The reports were on the Bytel project, the wards of court, the fishery harbour centres and a review of costs associated with undelivered capital projects and the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  We need to take a bit of time to consider the minutes and I would not just note them today.  </p></speech>

My first issue is the national paediatric or children's hospital.  It says that, in terms of the Mater site, there is post-project review being carried out by the Department in consultation or with input from the HSE, and with external support from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Also, the timescale for the completion of this work is June 2016 and that is the first report.</p> <p>  The second issue relates to the Thornton Hall site.  Again, the reply says that there is a working group in place, which will report back and is due to complete its work in April 2016.  Do these reports automatically come to us?  Do we have to ask for them to come to us?  Can we say that once the reports are finished they should come to us for consideration?   </p></speech>

I propose that we hold them over until next week's meeting for consideration and then decide what to do.  In order for people to understand what the Committee of Public Accounts does I shall outline what happens.  The Comptroller and Auditor General does a report on a particular issue and then we discuss it.  At the end of our discussions we may choose to do a report on our findings as a result and that goes to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We may have recommendations in our report and then there is a detailed response back from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Sometimes the Department agrees with our report.  We have received its reply from the last batch of reports the previous committee sent to it before the election.  I propose that we hold the reports over until next week in order that we have a chance to look at them in detail.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We will formally ask that the next report is sent to us.</p> <p>  I note a later item in the correspondence about the wards of court.  We will return to this matter as well.  We have the wards of court report and some people are not satisfied with the way it has gone.  There is quite a bit of work so we will come back to this individual item of correspondence as part of the review of the wards of court report.  The correspondence has been noted.</p> <p>  Category C refers to private or other individual correspondence received.  No. 1C, which can be viewed on the screen, is a letter from Neil Pakey, CEO, Shannon Commercial Enterprises.  The letter is dated 29 January and responds to matters raised by the committee.  He has confirmed that Shannon Commercial Properties is not a public body and, therefore, did not fall under the committee's remit in the first place.  He is saying that we should not have written to him.        </p></speech>

They are letters from Ms Anne Marie Caulfield, Private Residential Tenancies Board, enclosing copies of the correspondence between the PRTB and a private individual which was sent to us.  It is an issue that we followed up before.  The board has completed the circle and told us what we sent to the particular person.  We note the correspondence.</p> <p>  No. 3C is a letter dated 11 February from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills.  He responded to the committee's request for information on financial irregularities at An Mhodhscoil Limerick for a particular school project.  We note the correspondence.</p> <p>  The next item is a letter dated 16 February from Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  He responded to the committee's request for information on alleged unauthorised dumping on the R158 regional road upgrade.  It has been determined that this is being dealt with as a local authority matter and does not fall within the remit of the committee.  I ask that this item be held over because the EPA may have a role although I think the EPA is saying that it is the local authority.  I do not want to pass over this correspondence too quickly so we will hold it over until next week. </p> <p>  No. 7C is a letter dated 12 February from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, on a grievance an individual has with the Department arising from the finding of a prohibitive drug called Carbadox on his farm.  I understand that legal proceedings are ongoing and it is an individual case.  We will just note it and not pursue it any further. </p> <p>  No. 9C is a letter dated 29 February from Mr. Frank McLoughlin, chairperson of the audit committee, Meath County Council, in terms of a matter raised, in correspondence, by an individual to the committee regarding the awarding of a contract in 2004.  Again, local authorities do not come under our remit.  Has anybody had a chance to look at the correspondence?  Are Members happy to note it and move on?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 11C is from Mr. Tony O'Brien, Director General of the HSE, in terms of a lease of a property in Kells, County Meath.  The matter had been brought to a conclusion by the previous committee and Mr. O'Brien's letter is a final response to the matter.  Can we note the correspondence?  Agreed.  </p> <p>  No. 13C is a letter dated 9 May from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine responding to the committee's recommendations in terms of the seizure of animals from the farm of an individual.  As there are ongoing legal proceedings by the individual against the Minister and the Garda Commissioner on this matter I suggest that we note the correspondence.  </p></speech>

No. 14C relates to the adequacy of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's response to the recommendation of the committee's report on the wards of court.  As this relates to the minutes already discussed, I propose that we discuss the correspondence with the wards of court report separately next week.</p> <p>  No. 15C is a letter from Mr. Alan Farrell calling on the committee to commence a review of the charity Console.  This matter relates to the upcoming work programme.  I propose that we discuss it when we discuss the work programme in a couple of minutes.</p> <p>  No. 22C and 23C are two items of correspondence from an individual, the origin of which relates to an alleged wrongdoing by Horse Racing Ireland.  This handwritten letter has been referred to.  The individual has been in regular contact with the previous Committee of Public Accounts, several Departments, Deputies and Garda over a number of years.  As the correspondence is lengthy, I propose that we return to it in the near future for a comprehensive response.  That concludes correspondence.</p> <p>  The next item is reports and statements of accounts received since the last meeting.  I shall outline what this means in simple English.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General has said, he audits 289 organisations each year and many of the reports, are laid in the Oireachtas Library, on the completion of audit.</p><p>We formally note all of the accounts that have been laid in the Oireachtas Library.  The dates they were laid are listed.  They commence on 28 January 2016 up to the current date.  There is an observation beside those organisations as to whether there is a clear audit opinion or if there is an issue regarding the audit - sometimes there is regarding public service pensions.  It gives an indication of the size of the organisation and the accounting period involved.  We list the turnover so that people will know whether it is a &euro;100,000 organisation or a &euro;10 million organisation.  Do we have to note these individually?</p></speech>

The last item on that page is the Economic and Social Research Institute, a clear audit opinion.  Then there are issues there regarding deferred pensions.  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to explain that because it comes up regularly in public bodies.  This is a regular issue raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General about State bodies regarding their deferred pension funding.</p></speech>

It was in previous years under what was called FRS, financial reporting standard, 17.  That was the requirement.  What it essentially means is that in relation to the staff who work in an organisation in a particular year, an estimate is made of the value of the future pension they will get in respect of the work they do in a particular year.  It is quite technical.  It is probably overdone in a way in many of the financial statements where one could have five or six pages of notes in the financial statements in relation to how pensions are accounted for.  It is a very important economic cost and it is important that it is recognised.</p> <p>  Many of the members will probably be familiar with the concept of a pensions deficit in relation to organisations and private companies.  In the public sector, as well as recognising the liabilities, organisations usually recognise a matching funding asset so that it balances the liabilities.  The reason they do that is that in most cases in most public bodies there is guarantee or at least a statutory basis for the pension scheme, so the expectation is that the State will meet those pension liabilities in the future when they arise.  On that basis, public bodies usually recognise a matching asset.</p> <p>  With a number of organisations where they are charging for services, particularly with the universities where there are fees and so on, there is not a firm guarantee in relation to the amount that will be provided.  They will still recognise the matching asset but because there is not a guarantee underpinning it and because some of the funding may come from charges in the future, we draw attention to the fact that these are different.  A lot of these bodies will have recognised the liability and recognised a matching asset, which we would understand will be met and they would understand will be met in the future from their grant funding.  We draw attention to the exceptions.</p></speech>

People get it.  Regarding public sector bodies, if it was a private company, it would have to provide for a pension fund in its account.  However, because it is a public sector body, some take the view that there will be funding from the State in due course to cover this and so do not provide for the full liability in its accounts because it knows the State, because of the statutory situation, will pick up the pension liability for those publicly-----</p></speech>

It is in relation to an obligation on every public body to review the effectiveness of its controls every year.  This is stipulated in the code of practice of the governance of State bodies.  The requirement is that that review be carried out usually by the board of the body so that it is satisfied in a timely way that it has looked at the controls and that the controls are operating.</p> <p>  We draw attention to a situation where that review does not occur.  One sees that more regularly than may be satisfactory.  That is the formula.  If members look at the Railway Safety Commission, the review of effectiveness in 2014 of the system of internal financial control was only undertaken in September 2015, nine months after the year-end.  The problem is that if at that stage it identifies a control weakness, it is too late to do anything for 2015.  It needs to be done early and it needs to be done at the highest level of the organisation.</p></speech>

If it has done it and has done it in a timely way, we will not say anything about it.  It will be confirming in what is called its statement of internal financial control that it has complied and we do not draw attention to that.  The Deputy can take it that the body is confirming and we are satisfied that it did carry it out in a timely fashion with all the rest of them where there is a clear audit opinion.

Revenues from levies on plastic shopping bags and landfill of waste are paid into the fund, which supports the scheme for the purposes of prevention and reduction.  We will not discuss it now but I am just asking that we be conscious of the fact that the account is a separate one in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  We need to ask specifically about it because it does not come under the normal departmental Vote.  It is a separate fund.  We always have to remember to ask about that separately.</p></speech>

The obligation is on the Department.  Since this is what is called a departmental fund, the Department manages the fund.  It is the obligation of the Accounting Officer to submit the financial statements to the Oireachtas, and then it should come on the agenda here.</p> <p>  An issue we have raised in the past is delays in presentation, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform issued a circular in 2015, I believe, reminding Departments of the obligation to get their financial statements in quickly.  What one should expect is that once I have signed the certificate and presented it to the body, it should then present it to the Department within a month.  Unless it has to go to Government for noting, it should be presented by the Minister and his Department within two months of receipt.  The maximum period between the date of certification and the date of receipt is about three to three and a half months.  However, if one looks down through this list, one will see that there are bigger gaps.</p></speech>

It goes without saying the HSE representatives will be in specifically to discuss their 2015 accounts in the autumn.</p> <p>  There is a qualification in the HSE&rsquo;s account.  There is a significant level of non-competitive procurement and a lack of evidence of competitive procurement in regard to 30%, by value, of a sample of payments valued at &euro;29.6 million.  Note 9 to the accounts discloses the reversal of a provisional &euro;9 million in regard to compensation payable to suppliers from March 2013, when revised regulations on late payments commenced.  The provision was reversed on foot of legal advice received in March of that year.  It stated suppliers were not automatically entitled to such compensation.  Note 29 discloses a contingent liability in relation to compensation for late payment which may be claimed by suppliers.  Will Mr. McCarthy state whether that was a provision for late payment that does not have to be made?</p></speech>

When we completed the 2014 accounts, we identified that a change in the law in 2013 required it to pay the compensation without application by the suppliers.  We reported on that because the sums were quite large.  In 2014, a provision, a charge, was included on the income and expenditure account of &euro;9 million in respect of payments the organisation recognised it would be obliged to pay.  Subsequently it revised advice that it is not obliged to pay automatically but that it would be liable to pay it if an application were made by a supplier that received payment late.  What it has now in the 2015 accounts is a contingent liability.  I think the figure for contingent liability is approximately &euro;16 million, and it has a smaller provision, of perhaps &euro;1.5 million to &euro;2 million, charged in the account in the expectation that that is the amount it will pay.</p></speech>

Basically, a contract is put in place, perhaps for three years, and then it rolls and rolls, such that we are finding there are some contracts under which there could be six, eight or ten years of purchasing from the same supplier.</p><p>This blocks out other potential bidders to do the work.  We have reported on this on numerous occasions.  We always test to see if there is evidence of improvement.  For a number of years, we have had a sample basis with this level of non-competitive procurement.</p></speech>

I argue that when we discuss the work programme later, this is an issue to which we should return.  The committee has dealt with it before, but we must come back to it because the figure is way too high.  We are talking about hundreds of millions of euro.  Many companies have raised issues about procurement and the fairness of the system.  For me, this is an important issue to which Mr. McCarthy has drawn attention and we need to take cognisance of it.</p></speech>

I am aware of other Departments, albeit not on the same scale as the HSE, which have had a light shone on their practices.  I also agree with the Deputy on the need for further evaluation.  Within an annual budget of approximately &euro;14 billion, it is, frankly, alarming that a base sample of &euro;30 million in procurement shows an anomaly of 30%.  I suspect that a figure of several hundred million euro might be involved.  If there is a saving to be achieved for the taxpayer, it is something to be looked at.  There is a procedural question for the HSE to answer to the committee, given its role and, potentially, the health committee, given some of the work it does on the HSE.  It is something at which we should look as a priority, given the sums involved.</p> <p>  With regard to the discussion on late payment regulations, as somebody who worked in the profession for many years before I became involved in politics, the variances in Departments and the treatment of suppliers are, frankly, shocking.  I say this wearing my former credit manager and credit director hat.  I will not dwell on the legal variances, other than to say there should be one interpretation across Departments and it should apply to all Departments.  Several Departments write cheques on behalf of the State when it suits them.  I will not go into which Departments are involved, but it is the case.  Therefore, they avoid late payment fees in paying invoices.  A series of sectors need to be examined in this regard.  I appreciate that it is probably not the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General to standardise this practice, or perhaps it is.  Perhaps the legislation needs to be examined.</p></speech>

I suspect the Comptroller and Auditor General does not use English in a flippant manner and that any word used carries huge meaning.  Phrases such as "a significant level" and "a lack of evidence of competitive procurement" carry huge weight.  Why is it not surprising that this lack of competitive procurement has been found in the HSE?  It is not in the least surprising.  The public is exasperated, as are politicians, by this practice.  The significance of this is in the impact such practices have on the overall health spend.  Year in, year out, Ministers and Departments speak about the lack of funding for front-line services, but then we see this total disregard which goes to the very heart of the debate on health services.  For years we have had a scenario where health expenditure has increased but the delivery of services has moved the other way.  Is it any wonder, when we see this type of language used, reporting and analysis showing this continual scenario and practices such as this, that we do not have a better health service?  I agree with Deputy David Cullinane on the need for further analysis.  It is even more shocking that the Comptroller and Auditor General has stated this issue has been reported on on numerous occasions.  This shows that practices and attitudes do not change, but none of this is surprising when it comes to the HSE because it has been ongoing for years.  It is something that must be tackled.  Something is not right if the practices followed at its core are not changing.</p></speech>

There is a systemic problem in the HSE, but in fairness to it, it is taking steps to address it.  Because it is such a large organisation, it will take time to have an effect.  The HSE will give a more detailed account to the committee.</p> <p>  The issue at the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland involved a substantial amount during 2014.  On a turnover of &euro;7 million, there was a figure of almost &euro;1 million for non-competitive procurement of services, which was substantial.  As we go through the list, the committee will see that there are other organisations where this is a problem.</p> <p>  Aontacht Phobail Teoranta is a company that was established many years ago by the Eastern Health Board to provide sheltered facilities and workshops for people with disabilities.  It was absorbed into the HSE in December 2010 because it provided similar services directly.  Accounts will continue to be produced until the disposal of assets and liabilities has been completed, but  it is more or less non-operational as a company.  There is an "except for" audit opinion because, unusually for a company, it was not depreciating its assets.  It is a technical issue but on a very small scale.  I do not think there is substantial activity.  Having said that, the accounts must still be produced.</p><p>They must be completed and the company has to be wound up, and we will continue to be the auditor until such time as it is.</p></speech>

The Department should take some steps to ensure that the legislation is applied consistently.  We need a detailed note from the Department on why various Government bodies are interpreting it differently.</p> <p>  We will move on to the next page.  I do not know how much is left.  This page covers Institute of Technology, Tralee, and Maynooth University.  Somewhere along the line, we will invite a number of third level institutions to attend.  They are large institutions.</p></speech>

My understanding is that a number of institutes have significant deficits.  We need to consider this matter, as some of those deficits amount to millions of euro.  The Higher Education Authority, HEA, is working with them on putting containment plans in place and so on.  Some are involved in the process of becoming technological universities.  We must examine more deeply those that are running deficits while being part of such a process.</p> <p>  I received responses from a number of institutes of technology to parliamentary questions that I asked.  Some 85% of Waterford Institute of Technology's operating budget goes on pay.  Institutes are labour intensive by nature, but 85% is very high compared with other institutes.  Various institutes have problems, in that they have deficits while also having very little remaining in their operational budgets after pay.  This matter merits further scrutiny by the committee.  Historical issues at some institutes have been addressed by the committee, but there may still be a hangover from them.  There were issues in Waterford Institute of Technology.</p> <p>  As to the audit accounts, I am concerned about the levels of deficit, how sustainable they are and whether it is sustainable for some institutes to be run on the basis of 85% of their operational budgets being spent on pay.</p></speech>

Across the government sector, prepayment is generally not regarded as a good idea.  It is too risky unless careful controls are in place.  We have reported previously on prepayments in other organisations.  It is relatively unusual to see.  Normally, the level of prepayment in a set of financial statements is not particularly high.  I drew attention to this example because there was a loss as a result.</p></speech>

I have not examined that statistic as to how it compares.  With most public sector bodies, pay is a very substantial part of expenditure in any year.  As to how unusual Waterford would be at 85%, I cannot comment at the moment.</p> <p>  I should say that, along with our prohibition on commenting on policy in reports, we tend to regard the allocation of resources as something that is in the policy sphere, so I do not comment on it.

Sometimes, the sample may not be exactly representative, which occasionally prevents us from scaling up.  For instance, we might pick a particular class of goods or services to examine, but I draw attention wherever we identify more than &euro;500,000.  It is a blanket approach.  The idea is that, because there has been a problem with this in the public sector in general, there might be a small element that we identify in many organisations, but we do not need to draw attention to them.  The emphasis that we have placed on it reflects the concerns of the committee over the years and our drawing attention to it at the committee encourages public sector bodies to ensure that they use competitive processes to procure their goods and services.</p></speech>

A different case arises involving an advance payment of &euro;700,000.  I propose that the committee write directly to the institute of technology asking for detailed background information relating to: how the advance payment arose; the decisions made in respect of the payment; whether it was approved at board level; whether credit checks were carried out; who monitored progress; when this person became aware of issues surrounding the advance payment; and what action was taken in this regard.  I would like a full report on the matter.  We will start by asking for a written report but I am not excluding the option of inviting representatives from the Dublin Institute of Technology to come before the committee.  We will obtain a written report first and take the matter from there.</p> <p>  Members will note that we grouped all the educational establishments together in the schedule.  We will return to third-level educational establishments as a topic in the autumn.  Members will have this documentation in their files for future reference.  The next page starts with Ollscoil na h&Eacute;ireann Gaillimhe and finishes with University College Dublin.  After that, we have a page listing the education and training boards, including Donegal Education and Training Board and Dublin-D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board.  We will examine these as a group later.  The subsequent page lists institutions starting with Longford and Westmeath Education and Training Board and finishing with Louth and Meath Education and Training Board.  The list on the next page starts with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and finishes with the Grangegorman Development Agency.</p></speech>

The moral of the story relates to non-competitive tendering in third level institutes.  We can identify a couple of topics here that will be on our agenda for the autumn.  As I stated, we do not normally have such a large number of accounts.  However, six months of accounts have built up since the committee last met in January.  Normally, we would only deal with a handful of accounts.</p> <p>  We move on to the next item on the agenda, namely, the work programme.  The clerk has circulated a draft work programme for the period until the recess in two weeks.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has highlighted the public bodies on which he must focus.  As this is our first meeting, I took the liberty of ensuring we have some work lined up for the period until the end of July.  I hope members will approve this proposal retrospectively.  I chose the Office of Public Works because the Comptroller and Auditor General has just completed a special report - a value-for-money exercise on strategic planning for flood risk management - and officials from the Office of Public Works will be available to appear before the committee next week.  I do not have the details of the report but we will have a full discussion on the matter next week.</p></speech>

I took the liberty of trying to fill our agenda for this period in order that the committee has work scheduled.  I did not want to start scheduling our work today because we would not be able to make arrangements to meet officials by next Thursday.  We had to issue invitations in advance of today's meeting.  Next week, we will have officials from the Office of Public Works before the committee on 14 July and representatives of the Health Service Executive are scheduled to appear on 15 July.  We will discuss that in a moment.  Representatives of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, will appear on 21 July to discuss the latter's annual financial statement, Management of the National Debt.

The meeting will be timely, therefore, because the agency's accounts will have just been published.</p> <p>  On the meeting of 15 July, I will call Deputy Farrell in a moment on the Console issue on which we have received a letter.  It should be noted that Console is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the organisation does not come directly within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  While the matters in the public domain are very important and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement has commenced criminal investigations into the case, we will concentrate on the role of the committee.  My concern is the adequacy of the Health Service Executive's controls in respect of taxpayers' moneys the executive was disbursing and the funding of organisations such as Console.  The committee wrote to the HSE last week requesting information on several matters connected to this issue.  We requested: a copy of the service level agreement between the HSE and Console; a copy of the internal audit carried out by the HSE in respect of Console following the 2013 returns; a note on the shortcomings identified in the HSE systems and controls operated in that period to ensure Console and similarly funded organisations are governed in line with grant aid service level agreements; and a note on the action plan to improve controls to ensure that moneys given to HSE-funded organisations are used for purposes for which they have been given.  In addition, I included in the letter a reference to the issue of top-up payments, which was discussed by the committee on previous occasions in respect of several voluntary organisations funded under section 38 and section 39 agreements.</p> <p>  The St. John of God organisation has featured in public discussion recently.  This matter comes under the topic of top-up payments, which remains on our agenda as it was discussed at previous meetings.  I have asked the HSE to deal with the issue of Console and the top-up payments, which also relates to Console.  We will deal with other issues, including HSE competitive tendering, at a separate meeting.  We have a specific item to deal with on 15 July.</p></speech>

I believe we have enough to deal with in that respect.</p> <p>  A number of HSE documents were received yesterday afternoon.  These are considerable in volume and most were in hard copy and folder form, rather than in electronic form.  From that point of view, they are cumbersome.  Listening to the Comptroller and Auditor General, the service level agreements and similar documents should be available for publication.  The HSE has asked the committee not to publish any of the documentation before the meeting next Friday.  We have to arrange a mechanism to circulate these documents to members in advance of next Friday's meeting because they will have to familiarise themselves with and study them beforehand.  It is important to note, however, that they should not be made publicly available during the coming week.  The HSE has specifically made this request and we do not want to start our deliberations by failing to comply with a request.</p> <p>  On the internal audit report, the Comptroller and Auditor General indicated that studying these types of report is part of the normal work of the Health Service Executive audit.  As it follows directly from the HSE audit, the audit report falls directly within the remit of the committee.  I will take questions on the issue because some members will be concerned about some of the contents of the report.  Members will have read newspaper reports on the audit report.  None of this information has come from the committee, which only received the documents yesterday.  I confirm that they have not been circulated to members and that I have not yet had an opportunity to read them.</p></speech>

We have already mentioned that the Garda is carrying out investigations.  We are already aware that the matter is before the High Court.  We are also already aware that the Director of Corporate Enforcement is pursuing proceedings.  We want to ensure that nothing we say or do might compromise the work of those State bodies.  People will want them to do their work.  We will not do anything to cut across that.  From my point of view, first, it would be outside our remit and, second, we would not be treading on good ground if we attempted to bring anybody who was involved in Console directly before the committee. We will start with HSE and Tony O'Brien.  Mr. O'Brien is the custodian of the money he handed out to Console.  We will start by asking him, in the first instance, to account for the money he handed out.</p></speech>

I am very keen for the committee to do its job but I am also very keen to avoid duplication.  A series of investigations are taking place up to and including those being carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While we have a clear and defined role in monitoring the expenditure of public funds - clearly, that covers Console via the HSE - I am slightly reluctant to take it to the next stage or to examine the investigations into the investigations and matters of that nature.  That would be a waste of time and the resources available to us.  It would also be a duplication of the work.</p></speech>

Therefore, we should approach this issue carefully in terms of what we would be getting ourselves into.  I would hate for the committee to go down a road and end up looking at investigating those who are carrying out investigations and matters of that sort.  That has occurred in the past and I would prefer if it did not happen in this instance.  I was a member of the justice committee which, by and large, avoided issues of that nature.  On one particular occasion, however, it was not possible to avoid the issue.  In terms of members' time, the role of the committee and our interaction with the likes of the HSE, which, clearly, has a great number of questions to answer, the purpose of my correspondence was to begin the process.  However, matters have moved on since then.</p> <p>  On the St. John of God issue, obviously it falls very clearly within our remit.  Our discussions with the HSE on it in terms of the controls within the service level agreements for both sections 38 and 39 agencies need to examined by this committee.  There is also the matter of whether the legislation or statutory instruments governing those agencies need to be examined.  I am aware that the charity regulator would most likely have a role to play in some way with regard to both issues and there is the question of whether, as part of our discussions, there would be an opportunity for us to meet the regulator.  Deputy Madigan raised that issue earlier in the week.  It is certainly something at which the committee should look.</p></speech>

This committee should not try to supersede, interfere with or do the work of others, be it An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or anybody else.  It has already been articulated that there are limitations on us and on the Comptroller and Auditor General with regard to Console.  I fully accept that.  My understanding as to what we will be doing next is that we will be following the HSE money and we need to do so in that context.  We need to ensure that taxpayers' money was not being used in an inappropriate way because this is not the first time this has happened.  In fairness to the previous Committee of Public Accounts, an great deal of time was spent on these sections 38 and 39 organisations involving the expenditure of State money and taxpayers money and, unfortunately, what has come to light seems to be prevalent across many of these organisations.  A number of them have been at the centre of very serious issues.  This is a matter of major public concern, and we all accept that.  That should be our starting point next week and it is right that we would do it that way.  We are not trying to replicate anybody else's work but we have a job to do and we have a responsibility to follow taxpayers' money.  We must do so in a very clear and diligent manner and ensure that there has been no waste, to put it mildly, of taxpayers' money by any of these organisations.  Potentially much deeper issues will arise in respect of those organisations as the issue of State funding will arise in the discussions.  I agree with what has been said but we have a clear responsibility to taxpayers with regard to this issue and others that have arisen.</p></speech>

There is no point in providing cover in advance for guys to come in here next week and stonewall us.  We can read the remit in the letter for setting out the basis on which they will come forward and, as Deputy Cullinane said, following the money trail and examining the internal procedures that exist.  We are dealing with the HSE but this goes back to my earlier comments regarding a range of agencies throughout the country.  I concur with what Deputy Cullinane said but I do not want us to create a scenario where we are giving guys a blanket in advance before they come in and then they can just run the clock down and stonewall us with respect to  what we are trying to pursue.</p></speech>

I am aware that Part 4 of the legislation has not yet commenced but, from a public information perspective, it would be very useful to find out what powers it has under the statute in terms of probing the misuse of public funds or whatever by charities.  That is certainly something I would looking for the committee to do.</p></speech>

Her proposal would be useful and it would close the circle on this issue.  It would be helpful to fit that somewhere into our programme.  It would also be timely because part of the legislation has yet to be commenced.  Deputy Cassells and others made the point that as we speak here about what is one of the most talked about issues in Ireland, there is concern among the public about the use of taxpayers' money.  In addition, this issue has touched people in the sense that they are concerned on a number of levels, not only about how taxpayers' money is being spent but also about how their voluntary contributions are being spent, about the services being provided and about whether these will continue to be provided into the future.  There is a huge level of concern among the public about this issue.  We need to ensure that, as a committee representing taxpayers, we get to the bottom of this matter.  Then there are all the other issues that are ongoing in respect of the Garda and everything else.  We need to be very clear and direct regarding how the HSE is managing its service level agreements with these organisations.  There may be - I believe there are - other issues separate from how the money is being spent.  I am concerned that there may be issues regarding procurement, how services are being provided and the cost of those services as a result of the way contracts have been managed.</p><p>On the management of staff and not just in relation to payment, it is about the use of staff across a number of these organisations as well.  We need to dig into those sort of layers comprehensively so that the taxpayer has full knowledge of the bottom line and with what we are dealing here.  It is about the level of organisations, volume of issues within them and levels of funds.</p><p> The second issue is one on which I compliment Deputy Farrell for taking the initiative to write in advance.  It was certainly something we all wanted.  It relates to top-up payments.  This is a considerable issue on top of the SLA issue with the organisations and the HSE.  It is something we need to deal with, but we need to do so separately as there are layers underneath that too.  There is a comprehensive amount of work on both of these issues that we need to understand.  We also need to respect the other avenues of investigation that are ongoing across the State.  We are challenged on behalf of taxpayers with ensuring that we get to the bottom of this quickly.</p></speech>

It has all been said.  We have a role to ask questions, but when questions become difficult or we avoid them because we are worried, we are in serious trouble.  It is an issue with which we must deal.  We must ask questions and hold the Executive to account for allocating taxpayers' money.  How is it allocated and what was the supervision?  They are the questions for us.  Entirely separately is what Console and those on the ground are left with, which is not for today.  The tragedy on the ground is for people who were being dealt with on a daily basis.  It was the only 24/7 service and it is most unfortunate for them.  We have to ask questions and hold the HSE to account.</p></speech>

They want to get the views of members of the committee.  Obviously, there are sensitive issues in that.  The HSE has asked for it not to be made public or published before its representatives come here next week and, where people received documents, some in hard copy form and some in electronic form, for that to be respected.  Members will be asked for copies before lunchtime if people know the documents are in the building.  I am asking people to respect-----</p></speech>

I will read the letter we received from the HSE with the document.  It is approximately five pages.  It states that it encloses 30 copies of the internal audit report.  It goes on:</p><blockquote>The committee may wish to note that in the normal course the HSE does not publish or release to any third party finalised internal audit reports until six months has expired since the date of completion.  The reason for this is because any affected party has a period of three months within which they may bring a judicial review challenging a report or any part of that report and has a period of six months within which to commence defamation proceedings.</blockquote> <p>The letter further states that if a report is published prior to these periods elapsing, there is a potential risk of liability arising from such publication.  The HSE internal audit report was completed on 14 April 2016 and furnished to Console on that date.  The period within which a judicial review challenging the report may be brought will expire in the normal course on 14 July.  By pure coincidence, our meeting will take place on 15 July.  As such, we will be smack-bang outside the three month period.  The six-month period within which a person could bring defamation proceedings in the normal course will elapse on 14 October.  Anybody is free to do that about anything anywhere in the country.  The HSE says that while it does not anticipate any challenge will be brought concerning the Console internal audit report and sees no basis for such a claim, the committee may wish to obtain its own legal advice as to how it intends to use the report.  The HSE is just putting us on notice.  It is up to us.</p></speech>

There are others in the room who are more qualified to say.  The report forms part of a public body's investigation into a charity, the funding of which falls under our remit.  As a public body, if it is made available, it should be made available in the public domain.  That is my position.</p></speech>

He asked, as to the HSE's request for us not to publish the internal audit report, if it was the Chairman's view that we should respect that and not publish it either by way of the committee publishing it or, inadvertently, a member publishing it.

My understanding is that the correspondence was not published as part of today's correspondence as it arrived too late to be included and disseminated to people.  It has arrived and we have it.  The committee is not meeting until next week so we cannot publish anything.  As Chairman, I cannot publish anything next Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday on behalf of the committee.  It is the committee that will publish it.  That will be a committee decision next week.  The committee could decide next week not to publish.  Let us be clear about that.

They will be put in members' pigeon holes today.</p> <p>  On housekeeping matters, I propose that for the first three weeks the committee operate in the normal way.  We can review the position in September.  What normally happens is that the Comptroller and Auditor General makes his opening comments.  Witnesses then comment and we will have already arranged the first and second speakers.  The first speaker has 20 minutes in total for questions and answers; the second has 15, while everybody else has ten.  That gives everybody an opportunity to make a contribution within a reasonable period.  I suggest we retain this timetable to see how it operates for a couple of weeks.  We can then review it, but it has worked well in practice.</p> <p>  Normally, as part of our work programme, a list of first and second speakers on a rotating basis is drawn up.  There is an onus on the first and second speakers to be well prepared.  I invite members to indicate to the clerk which of the three committee meetings at which they wish to be the first or second speaker and to do so by Tuesday, 12 July.  The meetings will be with the OPW, the HSE and the National Treasury Management Agency.  If there are too many offering to be a first or a second speaker at a particular meeting, the clerk and I will draw lots.  However, everybody will have an opportunity to speak.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-07a.289" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016070700002#A01400"><p>My comments on section 2 will connect with amendment No. 5 to section 3 for the purpose of following the debate.  The concern which I raised on Second Stage is that section 2 confers on the Minister the ability to do "[a]ll such things as are necessary or expedient to be done for the purposes of the State's performing its functions under the Loan Facility Agreement".  Section 3 states very clearly that the funds paid from the Central Fund shall not exceed, in aggregate, a sum of &euro;1.815 billion.  There are, therefore, two sections referred to and I am not sure which is the most dominant.  One states we cannot pay out more than &euro;1.8 billion, while the other states the power to do everything the Minister needs to do to fulfil the agreement is conferred on him by virtue of section 2.  </p> <p>  Regarding the agreement which is tagged onto the Bill in section 24.2 of the Schedule, it is stated clearly under the heading "Specific review" that "a specific review of the Key [where the &euro;1.815 billion the State must or may pay is calculated ] and the maximum aggregate amount made available by all Participating Member States under their respective loan facility agreements shall occur at the latest by the end of 2017, and in any case if a Member State not referred to in Schedule 2 ... becomes a Participating Member State".  A review of the Key is, therefore, built into the agreement.  What we do not know is whether the Key will go up or down.  It is likely that it will only go one way, given the common view that there will not be enough money if any bank gets into trouble.  If the Key were to increase, however, section 2 would confer on the Minister, as is stated the power to do "[a]ll such things as are necessary or expedient to be done for the purposes of the State's performing its functions under the Loan Facility Agreement"?  That is my concern about this section.  The Minister of State will see that amendment No. 5 would introduce another safety mechanism to make sure any amendment to the Key would require Oireachtas approval.</p></speech>

I have consulted officials to make sure the powers conferred on the Minister in section 2 are not so wide-ranging that they give him scope to increase the amount of &euro;1.815 billion in the loan facility agreement.  I can confirm again that there is nothing in section 2, even when linked with the review clause, to give the Minister the power to raise the amount specified in section 3.  If there were to be any change to the figure of &euro;1.815 billion, it would require the approval of the Oireachtas, probably in primary legislation.  That safeguard is already provided in the legislation we are considering.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-07a.291" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1308" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016070700002#A01600"><p>On reading it, I agree with Deputy Pearse Doherty that there seems to be a certain contradiction in that it is not clear from the legislation whether section 2 which refers to "all the powers necessary" and which is very expansive, or section 3 which refers to a maximum amount takes precedence.  Even since we had the debate on Second Stage, things have moved on in terms of the potential for another European banking crisis, the situation in Italy and Matteo Renzi's comments on Deutsche Bank which has $75 trillion in derivatives and his arguing that other European banks have much bigger problems than their Italian counterparts.  Obviously, we disagree with this legislation to start with, but the prospect of a further increase in the sum is quite a problem.  Do the Minister of State and his experts not feel there is a need to amend this section, or to make section 3 stricter, to make it clear that the specified sum takes precedence over "all the powers necessary"?  I am not sure if other members have a different reading of clause 24.2, but I think Deputy Pearse Doherty is right in the reading it the was he has.  I do not see how it can be disputed.  If we sign up to an agreement with a specific clause which refers to a review - clearly, it is not specified that one cannot move upwards in the review - I do not see how we do not potentially have a problem.  How are the Minister of State's officials in the Department so sure there is not a potential problem?</p></speech>

It is not a question of a feeling; section 3 does trump section 2 in that the amount cannot be raised.  If there were a need to increase the amount, in so far as the review is concerned or in any other situation, it would require Oireachtas approval and, more than likely, primary legislation.</p><p>Deputy Pearse Doherty has tabled amendment No. 5 to a later section, which attempts to include an additional layer of protection or a fail-safe mechanism in the legislation.  We can debate it now if it is appropriate, but I am not sure whether we can jump to a later amendment at this point.  Section 3 trumps section 2 and we can look at the fail-safe mechanism proposed by the Deputy when we reach amendment No. 5 if that is convenient.</p></speech>

Obviously, there is a bigger issue which goes beyond the amount of money that could be paid by the State from the Central Fund.  This relates to whether any of the other articles in the agreement could be reviewed or amended without prior notice or the consent of the Oireachtas.  If we take the word of the Minister of State that section 3 trumps section 2 in terms of the quantum of money laid out, this was supported on Second Stage by the Oireachtas on the basis it is tied to an agreement.  We have an agreement containing 22 articles and we know what the money is for.  A number of the articles state that any part of the agreement can be reviewed with the consent of the other member states.  Will the Minister of State clarify whether any review of the conditions of paying this money, which is what the agreement is, would require the consent of the Oireachtas?  Is it just at the discretion of the Minister?</p></speech>

Putting in place the Single Resolution Fund, notwithstanding the loan facility we are trying to agree today which is part of it but also separate to it, is an incredibly complex arrangement.  With regard to the resolution waterfall, consider the various things that may or may not need to happen before even getting to the loan facility agreement coming into action.  Much needs to happen and it is quite complex.  Changing any of the terms is not foreseen.  There is a review clause in the legislation because it is appropriate and prudent, but the complexity involved in changing any element of it would probably mean it is highly unlikely.</p></speech>

We even see what is happening in Italy, where there would be an undermining of what we are discussing if the authorities in that country bail out their banks as opposed to bailing them in, which is now commonly accepted as what would happen in Europe.  All of this is in flux.  There have been amendments and changes as issues have developed.  The Oireachtas is being asked to consent to making available &euro;1.8 billion of funds on the basis European leaders have now accepted what Sinn F&eacute;in has been saying from the outset, namely, that there should be a bail-in of bondholders in a process where a bank goes bust.  We are not sure what would happen if European leaders, in their wisdom, decide, because of other circumstances such as the ECB turning off the tap whereby we would have a problem in the bond markets, to change the structure and the waterfall.  This can be done with the consent of all of the other member states or parties to the agreement without any recourse to the Parliament, but we are on hook through this legislation for paying out &euro;1.8 billion in respect of something that may not occur.  We may not have the type of bail-in envisaged now, as the legislation is going through the Parliament.  My question is what are the safety mechanisms.  What recourse will the Oireachtas have?</p></speech>

It would require the approval of the Oireachtas if the approximately &euro;1.8 billion needed to be increased.  An amendment could not be made to change the substance of what has been agreed in the loan facility agreement.  This is mentioned in paragraph 21 of the agreement on amendments and waivers.  It states none of the aforementioned amendments shall change the substance of the agreement compared to the loan facility agreements entered into with other participating member states.  If Italy wanted to take a particular course, it could not alter the resolution waterfall into which we and other eurozone members are entering with regard to the Single Resolution Fund.  Neither would it alter the terms on which we will make the loan facility available to the Single Resolution Mechanism.</p></speech>

It states, "None of the aforementioned amendments shall change the substance of this Agreement compared to loan facility agreements entered into with other Participating Member States."  Ireland's agreement could not be changed to something out of whack with the agreements relating to other member states but if the substance of it was changed in each agreement, I am not sure whether paragraph 21 would prevent that to which I refer.  We are speaking about exceptional circumstances.  However, we are operating in fairly exceptional circumstances.</p></speech>

It is the very last line, which is what the credit line would be, and no one can stop it.  This loan facility is the last call which could possibly be made on the State.  It is only a loan from the State which would be paid back by the banks.  It is not even a call on the sovereign, either necessarily or directly.  Nothing can be changed in so far as this legislation is concerned by another member state to stop what we are agreeing today, which is the loan facility being the backstop until such time as the fund comes into full effect in 2024 and the permanent backstop is agreed.  Anything that might change the course of placing a charge on the State would come back to the Oireachtas for agreement.  That still stands regardless.</p></speech>

Setting aside the fact the quantum of money cannot increase, with the agreement of the European partners who are signed up to the agreement the terms can change.  They could change substantially with agreement at a meeting in Brussels or Frankfurt.  All of the agreement upon which the legislation hinges could be altered dramatically.  The quantum of money we are making available in respect of the backstop cannot be changed or increased, particularly in view of the Minister of State's earlier undertakings, but the agreement which underpins it could be changed by consent of all the other parties.  It is a concern that the Oireachtas is being asked to make available &euro;1.8 billion on the basis of an agreement that can change without any approval of the Parliament.</p></speech>

Is this the Deputy's concern?  This is about the loan facility, which is a temporary arrangement until the fund is in place.</p></speech>

The conditions of utilisation could completely change.  The interest could completely change.  The repayments could completely change overnight, without any question coming back to the D&aacute;il or Seanad.  We have committed &euro;1.8 billion on the basis of this.</p></speech>

There would have to be complete agreement of all eurozone Ministers to any change that might happen, and whoever the Minister for Finance might be in three, four or six years' time would be able to veto any decision which might have a negative impact on the State.  The Minister would not be able to enter into any decision that might incur an additional cost to the Exchequer without the approval of the Oireachtas.  A change to the resolution waterfall which might change rates and incur an additional cost would not be able to be agreed.</p></speech>

Parties like me would support the legislation because we have argued in favour of bailing in bondholders and a backstop.  While we do not agree with this formulation, the ECB should provide a backstop and there should be a separation of sovereign debt.  At least we are getting somewhere, but all of this could change without reverting to Parliament.  Yes, the Minister will have a veto, but an opinion poll shows that only 24% of people support his party.  What about the other 76%?  The Minister does not necessarily represent all views.  Given the amount of money involved, should any change to what has been agreed to by consensus between the Minister and the other member states not require Oireachtas approval?  That is a basic principle.  I will introduce an amendment on Report Stage to move matters along.  If a change is minor or straightforward, a motion could be tabled in and passed by the Houses, but if it is substantial, it should be debated.  The principle we are being asked to endorse does not just concern the legislation but the legislation dealing with the agreement.  If it changes, the Government's original decision could be altered dramatically also.</p></speech>

As we can read the loan facility agreement, we can examine the 24 articles and determine whether the agreement is okay.  However, the problem is that a clause in the Bill allows the loan facility agreement to be changed without any requirement for D&aacute;il approval.

It is a blank cheque in all matters, except the amount of money that we will make available to the facility.  There are likely to be more problems in Europe in the future and people will consider how we should address them.  One of the ways to do so would be by amending the loan facility agreement.  The Government would not have to revert to Parliament because Parliament would already have conferred on the Minister in law all of the powers necessary to implement the loan facility agreement.  It is a blank cheque because, although we can see what it says, we are introducing this Trojan Horse, in that the agreement can be changed at any time as long as all of the parties who signed up to it agree.  That is okay if one believes the Minister's veto is robust enough or that he is fine, but he does not have a majority in the D&aacute;il.  Passing a provision that gives a large number of powers to the Minister to implement everything in the loan facility agreement is not problematic at this time, but it could be if other articles not debated by the Oireachtas were to be introduced.</p> <p>  I am conscious of the time, section 2 and the fact that we are nearing Report Stage, but I am signalling that I wish to table an amendment on this matter on Report Stage.  I cannot see why the Government would not support the idea of introducing amendments.  It is hypothetical and may be unlikely to happen, as there would have to be consensus among all member states, but in the event of there being amendments to the loan facility agreement, they should revert to the D&aacute;il so as to ensure the powers conferred under section 2 only relate to this agreement, not any future addition, amendment or deletion.</p></speech>

The Deputy argued for it because of what had happened during the crisis.  The complexity of putting the SRF agreement together across the eurozone member states s hould not be underestimated, nor should the difficulty of making a substantive change to any aspect of same.  We have Government oversight via the Minister should there ever be a need to make a change.  The loan facility is a temporary backstop until the fund is in place, after which time the loan facility will no longer be available.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has championed political reform previously and I am sure he still holds those views.  Given all of the difficulties, why would he be opposed to any amendment to the loan facility agreement being laid before the Houses for its approval?  That is democracy.  That represents proper parliamentary oversight in the best way possible.  If it is not a concern, why not allow for any amendment to the agreement to be approved?</p></speech>

Section 3, as presented, provides that, on the approval of the Minister, payments up to a sum of &euro;1.815 billion may be made from the Central Fund, as required.  The amendment proposes that the Oireachtas must approve such payments.  A payment from the Central Fund will be triggered when a bank or financial institution experiences difficulty.  If something of this nature were to occur, the Oireachtas would be in session and debate the relevant issues.  There is no reason, therefore, that it should not be asked to consent to making available a portion of the fund for the required purpose.  The decision should be at the discretion of the Oireachtas rather than the Minister.  This issue also raises the fundamental question as to who should have oversight and the final decision in these matters.  I do not see any reason a provision requiring Oireachtas approval should be a problem, given the seriousness of the issue and the quantum of money involved.</p><p>Amendment No. 5 proposes to insert, between lines 11 and 12 on page 4, the following line: &quot;(2) Notwithstanding the provision of <i>section 2</i>, any decision under the terms of the Loan Facility Agreement to vary the sum specified in <i>section 3(1) </i>shall be subject to a vote of the Oireachtas&quot;.  This flows from our discussion on section 2 and the clause in the agreement that provides that the Key, as it is described, will be reviewed at the end of next year.  This could result in an increase in the Key, thus requiring a greater contribution from Ireland.  While the Minister of State has indicated that section 3 trumps section 2, we have countless examples of legal opinion not being the best opinion or standing the test of time.  In some ways, I am the product of wrong legal information being given to a previous Government on whether a by-election was required in County Donegal because I took the Government of the day to the High Court on the issue and won my case.  The purpose of the amendment is to provide an additional safeguard to ensure any additional sum of money beyond the figure provided will require a vote in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

As they have been grouped together, I will speak, first, to amendment No. 5 because it flows directly from section 2.  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel does not believe the amendment would necessarily add any additional layer of protection to the legislation.  Section 3 is clear that if the amount were to be increased by way of a review or in any other circumstance, another Act would be required.  The Deputy has expressed concerns about Oireachtas oversight and interpretation.  It is not considered good drafting to include the amendment as it would create an unnecessary complication to have to specify everything in legislation.  However, if he were to press the amendment, the Government could accept it.</p></speech>

I reiterate that I am informed that the amendment is not necessary and would not make for good drafting from a legislative point of view.  However, if the Deputy proposes to press it, the Government will be in a position to accept it.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 4, it is important to note that different countries have entered into this arrangement in different ways.  What was offered was what is known as a commitment fee, whereby the State would be in receipt of an amount of money each year - I believe the sum is &euro;1.8 billion - if it were to forgo national approval of the loan facility if it was ever called upon.  We decided to forgo the commitment fee to have flexibility in terms of the repayment in tranches and to provide for national approval by the Minister and the Government, if required.  This is a good approach which provides an extra layer of protection in the legislation and the Government seeks the support of the Oireachtas for this provision.</p> <p>  In so far as amendment No. 4 is concerned, it proposes to transfer responsibility from the Minister to the Oireachtas in circumstances where the resolution waterfall has been exhausted.  This refers to circumstances in which one has a bail-in of at least 8% and one then moves to the mutualised national compartment and thereafter to the mutualised compartments of other states before reverting to our national compartment.  At that point, the single resolution fund will attempt to borrow and that is the point at which one seeks the credit line.  In that circumstance, it is necessary that certainty is given in the agreement to the other participating member states in respect of a quick turnaround for achieving agreement, in this case within four days.  In that regard, it is appropriate to give this oversight power to the Minister and the Government.</p></speech>

If I understood the Minister of State correctly, the need for a quick turnaround is the only argument in favour of conferring this power on the Minister as opposed to the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I will correct my statement.  The argument is that certainty is required such that a decision could be made when the loan was called upon.  Given the dire straits one would expect an institution to be in at that point, any risk of a delay could make matters worse and would risk contagion in other areas.  The idea is that certainty will be provided by the Oireachtas giving approval in respect of oversight and that if we were to find ourselves in such circumstances again, however unlikely that may be, there would be certainty that a decision could be made within four days.</p></speech>

It is not, therefore, the case that institution X would be in serious trouble and that we would need to trigger this mechanism within a couple of days.</p><p>A number of steps have to be taken and the process relating to them will take quite some time.  At that point, the Oireachtas will be debating these matters.  If one of our banks goes bust, we will be back here discussing this issue.  It will be the dominant issue of the day.</p><p> The section does not make it automatically certain that the Minister will make the funds available because it refers to "the approval of the Minister".  The section allows for the Minister not to approve, however unlikely that may be.  The only issue in this context relates to whether the Minister can make a decision more quickly than the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Of course he can because he does not have to consult individuals.  Dictators can make decisions more quickly than democracies, although I am not suggesting that the Minister is a dictator.  When a decision is left to one individual, of course he or she can make it more quickly.  Let us remember that if the Houses approve this measure, they are approving of the concept that the mechanism would be triggered at a point in time.  However, it is always important to vest the power in the Houses where possible, particularly given the quanta of money involved.  This could be a single decision on a certain day that would provide &euro;1.815 billion from the Central Fund to this mechanism, having due regard to what has happened elsewhere.  Decisions like that are best made by the Houses or the Houses' approval is best sought in respect of them.  We have learned lessons from the promissory notes, in which respect power was granted through various items of legislation and the Minister ended up making similar commitments without Oireachtas approval.  We know where that got us.</p><p> I do not agree with the idea that we cannot make a decision within four days.  I do not know from where that timeframe is coming.  Is it set down somewhere that a Minister must make a decision within four days?  I do not know why the Houses cannot debate and pass a resolution in the same period.  How long would it take?  It would not require legislation.  I presume that it would just be a motion.</p></speech>

It may never be drawn down or only drawn down in part.  This is not a question of the Oireachtas giving approval now to agree to the bailing out of an institution using sovereign funds.  It is an assumption to say that we will definitely be able to debate the failure of a bank as it is happening.  As we both know, such failures can happen quickly.  The point of having the bail-in provision at the beginning point of the resolution waterfall is to allow for it to happen quickly, for example, in a day or over the course of a weekend.  There would need to be movement and the Government could be called upon to make a part of the loan facility available.  So as not to create doubt in the markets or risk for depositors, a decision on the 50%, which is what we have agreed to, would be made by the Minister within four days.  The further amount would be provided in tranches in subsequent weeks.  This is a layer of oversight that other countries do not have but for which we have decided to opt because we believe it to be important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-07a.359" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1308" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016070700002#E00600"><p>We support both amendments and are happy to see the Government accepting No. 5, which provides clarity on the position outlined by the Minister of State.</p> <p>  Regarding amendment No. 4, the word "certainty" gets to the heart of the matter.  The Minister of State just made a point about not creating doubt in the markets.  The difference between the proposal as it stands and as it would be if Deputy Pearse Doherty's amendment were accepted is that the power would transfer from the Minister to the Oireachtas.  The point is valid in that there is no certainty for the banks, full stop.  There could be a new Government, for example, or the current Government may decide not to provide the money, which means that there would be no guarantee.  The banks cannot just cash the cheque because the Minister must agree to provide it.  However, it is clear - it is not implied, but is effectively said - that the problem is the extra uncertainty added by an element of democratic oversight in the Oireachtas and the need for a vote.  I do not accept that timing is an issue.  The danger is that this will happen in a time of major crisis, with a significant discussion in society about it and people potentially saying that they do not want to give &euro;1.8 billion to bail out banks.  Pressure will come on Deputies and there is the potential of the vote not passing.  Fundamentally, is this not what is being said?  Although it should be a basic matter for the Oireachtas to get to vote on transferring such a large amount of money effectively to bail out banks, the Government does not want to allow that out of fear that this democratic stage would not provide the markets with certainty and, therefore, it is easier to keep the decision in the hands of the Minister.  The markets would be more confident in him transferring the money because they are less subject to democratic pressures, but is that not precisely the problem that means the amendment should be supported?</p></speech>

Some 3.3% is the allocation key that our banking system pays into the fund.  The loan facility amount, which is a temporary arrangement until the fund has been fully mutualised, is calculated in the same way.</p> <p>  Deputy Paul Murphy is right.  This is about greater certainty.  There is less certainty if a decision is left to the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas approving this power for the Minister now means that we will be able to protect the banking system should we ever get to the stage where we are calling for this backstop between now and 2024, which is unlikely but not impossible.  This is about protecting depositors and people's access to finance.  One can imagine situations in which one is not able to convene the Oireachtas in the necessary time to get approval, should the Minister be minded to give that approval.  For whatever reason, people have been discussing the uncertain political climate in Ireland for the past two days.  There was quite an amount of uncertainty after the recent election as to when the next election would be.</p> <p>  We are committed to the SRF because it is the best way of protecting taxpayers from banking problems.  This loan facility agreement is an important backstop, but it is only a temporary measure until the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, is in place.  We want to send the signal now that we are going to provide this loan facility if it meets the approval of the Minister.  That is the national oversight that we have opted for and that other countries have not.</p></speech>

There is no way that this would happen overnight.  Unfortunately, we have been there and done that.  The Minister of State and I sat on the banking inquiry.  The Houses of the Oireachtas were convened and a guarantee was introduced basically overnight.  Regardless of whether that needed to be done, it was a scenario in which, in the Government's view, it needed to be done immediately.  In comparison, we are discussing something that is at the end of a process and only involves making money available to the board, which itself will only make money available to the banks.  How could an institution even know within a day what call it would make on the SRB, given the different levels it would have to go through beforehand, for example, the waterfall?</p></speech>

At the core of this is protecting taxpayers from any negative implications of a bank going into resolution.  We need to be able to make a decision for only 50% of the funds in the first four days.  Unless it is an extraordinary circumstance, 50% of the funds need to be made available in those four days.  To be sure that we can do that or be in a situation to do that, we give national oversight to the Minister.  Again, that has not happened in other countries.</p></speech>

I will table an amended version of this that will take into account times when the Oireachtas is not sitting when the decision can be triggered.  Outside of elections, I cannot imagine circumstances where we could not recall the D&aacute;il, regardless of where people are.  If the banks are in trouble we will know about it beforehand.  People would be recalled from their holidays or whatever, if the House is in recess.  We will deal with the issue.  I will withdraw the amendment and bring back an amended version.</p></speech>

I will not confuse the BRRD with the Single Resolution Mechanism, which is separate.  The SRM rulebook is based on the BRRD rulebook.  I need to be careful with my language.  The Italians want to avoid the bail-in of certain entities.  The motivations for that are not quite clear.  It is causing problems over there.  That will be different from the approach we want to take here relating to the SRM and the Single Resolution Fund, but we are continuing to monitor developments to see what impact this might have.</p></speech>

The real purpose of that meeting was the difficulties in the Italian banks.  In that context, a number of the other member states involved in that meeting, which were leading, founding member states, indicated that they were not willing to be terribly helpful to the proposals being put forward by the Italian Prime Minister.</p></speech>

It seemed a very exclusive kind of meeting, which a lot of people understandably criticised.  One of the key purposes of the meeting was the enormous difficulties in a number of Italian banks.  Unless that issue is addressed, it will have serious knock-on consequences for everybody else down the road.  We are now in a more uncertain situation because of the Brexit vote in the UK.  The difference between this and the bank guarantee which, except for ourselves, everybody else here would have voted for, is that this allows single banks to be addressed, rather than a blanket bank guarantee, as was done previously.  Obviously, this would have to come before the D&aacute;il to be discussed in the case of the failure of a significant bank at a significant level.  Now we are entering into a period of uncertainty caused by Brexit, with a high-level meeting dealing with really difficult issues in the Italian banks.</p></speech>

The kind of progress one would like to see in the Italian banking system has not been made.  They are now looking at a proposal where no liabilities will be bailed in first.  That is not the approach we want to take.  We believe it is part of a resolution.  Part of the Single Resolution Fund is that there would be at least 8% bail-in of certain liabilities before we moved to any kind of drawdown of funds from the national compartment to the mutualised element of those.  That is what we are looking for here.  Obviously, one has to be cognisant of banking systems in other jurisdictions getting into difficulties and what they are trying to do to address that.  In the context of Brexit there have been difficulties for Irish banks operating in the UK because of the amount of work they do there.  That poses challenges to us, of course.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, would have spoken about this last week in relation to the work that the NTMA and the Central Bank had done to prepare for the outcome of Brexit and have been doing since in terms of monitoring developments.</p></speech>

for &ldquo;section 1354, 1366 or&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>I will lay out exactly what is happening here to be clear for the committee.  I note that amendment No. 7 has been circulated to the committee.  The Department of Finance transposed the 2014 European Union market abuse regulation and directive on 30 June, ahead of the 3 July deadline.</p><p>The EU's market abuse regime has been extended and developed since the first directive in 2003 to take into account new technologies and market developments.  The investigative and sanctioning powers of regulators have been reinforced, while persons reporting potential infringements will be encouraged and protected.  Insider dealing and market manipulation have been redefined in the market abuse regulation to, in effect, create new offences.</p><p> Prior to 30 June, Irish market abuse law punished market abuse crimes with fines of up to &euro;10 million and imprisonment of up to ten years.  The new criminal sanctions under the market abuse directive establish minimum rules for criminal sanctions for those offences and provide for a term of imprisonment of at least four years.  However, under section 3(3)(b) of the European Communities Act 1972, a statutory instrument is inappropriate for the introduction of a new offence with fines of more than &euro;500,000 and imprisonment over three years.  To maintain the high tariffs, the Department was advised to amend section 136(5) of the Companies Act 2014 by changing the definitions from the 2003 market abuse directive to the 2014 market abuse directive via primary legislation.  The amendment ensures that we comply with the new market abuse regulation and directive and will increase the penalty for market abuse up to &euro;10 million and up to ten years imprisonment.</p><p> Amendment No. 7 amends section 136(5) to change the definitions in the Companies Act to account for developments in Irish market abuse law and to refer to the relevant EU regulations and directives.  The deletion of sections 136(6) and 136(7) is due to their explicit referral to the 2003 market abuse directive.  These provisions are no longer necessary due to the amendments to section 136(5).  The amendments to section 136(8) ensure that offences under market abuse law are punished by fines of &euro;10 million and imprisonment up to ten years.  The amendment to section 136(9) relates to civil liability for breaches of market abuse law and points to the articles listing the offences in the market abuse Regulation No. 596/2014 EU.  The amendment to section 137 continues the provision for supplementary rules to be made by the Central Bank which are published as its market abuse rules and the rules are based on Irish market abuse law.  The amendment to Schedule 6 updates the wording to reflect the new market abuse regulation and directive.</p></speech>

We were not aware that it needed to be primary legislation in the first instance and when that was brought to our attention, we felt we needed to work quickly so that there would be no potential period whereby the previous provisions applied, which involved far lower financial and imprisonment penalties.  It was just to make sure there was no gap in the law as it stands in terms of transposing the directive.</p></speech>

We have to do that as soon as possible.  That is why, as Deputy Paul Murphy says, it is being shoehorned into this legislation which, of course, is not ideal.  The important thing to achieve is to prevent there being a gap in the law.</p></speech>

As I said on Second Stage, it is not the best way to do this.  I am not sure why primary legislation was not drafted to deal with this but we are where we are and it needs to be introduced.  There is a gap.  I thank the Minister of State for the note on this.  I have questions as to the advice the Minister received in relation to the transposition by way of statutory instrument to deal with this issue.  Was it legal advice from the Attorney General?  How did it materialise that this could not happen that way putting us, therefore, up against this deadline?  I have raised concerns about important legislation, including the implementation of the mortgage credit directive by way of statutory instrument, which in my view warranted a full discussion.  I am interested to know how decisions are made as to whether to draft a statutory instrument or a Bill.  This is a bit of a mess.  Some advice was given that was wrong.  While I appreciate that we all make mistakes, we think that this is the way to do it.  There is a mistake here which has forced us to put two pieces of unrelated legislation together.  In the meantime, the penalties are at the lower level.  Can the Minister of State tell the committee if any case is pending which might sneak in under the period where the penalties have reverted to the older, lesser ones?</p></speech>

I am informed that it was around the uncertainty that might be there if a statutory instrument was used.  That is why that was not done.  We wanted to be certain we could impose what needed to be imposed.  It is a large item of legislation involving complex interactions.  That would present its own difficulties if we were coming down the road with primary legislation in this regard.  This was suggested as the way to ensure that we were able to achieve this.  I remember the Deputy made the point on Second Stage and elsewhere about how we bring legislation through the D&aacute;il and the need to do so in an appropriate way.  I take that point completely.  This is not the ideal situation, but it is something that we felt we needed to do.  We took this opportunity to do it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-07a.408" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016070700002#G01200"><p>There is a wider issue here that goes beyond the Minister of State's remit.  Advice was given to the Minister by someone.  I am not sure if it was departmental officials or the Attorney General.  The advice was that transposing by way of statutory instrument would have dealt with this issue.  At a very late stage in the drafting process, it was discovered that it was not possible to do that or that it would not be robust enough.  As such, we have scrambled to find a piece of legislation we could fit this into.  Just before the last election, the Supreme Court ruled against the Government to strike down a statutory instrument on fisheries penalty points.  The court said that could not be introduced by way of statutory instrument and needed to be done by way of primary legislation.  In fairness, the Minister has now agreed to annul the statutory instrument.  However, it seems that there is a default position to, where possible, transpose by way of statutory instrument.  Is that a way to avoid parliamentary scrutiny or is there a wider issue with difficulties in finding slots to bring legislation forward?  The mortgage credit directive should have been transposed by way of primary legislation but it has been brought in by way of statutory instrument.  There seems to be a default approach to transposition by way of statutory instrument.  If the Minister of State could speak to the last point I raised, are there any cases which could sneak in during this period and be addressed, therefore, under the lesser penalties?</p></speech>

It is just that in certain circumstances it is the preferred route.  In so far as what happened in terms of the interactions in drafting where the SI was seen to be the more efficient route and that advice changed and at what stage, I would have to provide the Deputy with further information at a later date.  I am sorry but I do not have it to hand.  Given the political reality and the timing situation, we needed to use a Bill that was coming through and which was, of itself, also largely technical in nature in order to get this done efficiently.  However, I agree with Deputies Pearse Doherty and Paul Murphy about the best way to bring legislation through - primary legislation - and trying to achieve that in every circumstances.</p></speech>

I appreciate the comments the Minister of State made and his provision of the note.  Are the Minister of State or his officials aware of any pending cases which may come under the lesser penalties as opposed to the penalties that would be incurred under this legislation?</p></speech>

The penalty of &euro;10 million is very small for the size of some of the entities involved that have been guilty of market abuse.  Irish courts are not going to sentence anybody to ten years in respect of a market abuse offence.  I am not aware that there have ever been comparable convictions in Ireland which resulted in prison sentences and certainly not of that length.</p><p>Given the fines that now apply in the US, the UK and quite a lot of continental countries, is &euro;10 million not a very small amount?  I know it is big in terms of small domestic businesses, but should there not be a percentage element to give significant variation to reflect the size of the entity which might be guilty of market abuse or the size of the entity for which the individual may be working?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-07a.415" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016070700002#H00200"><p>I appreciate the Deputy's view that &euro;10 million might be low, but actually it is higher than the amount being implemented in other EU countries.  We can go higher if it is an administrative sanction.  In such an instance it can be as high as &euro;15 million, or 15% of the total annual turnover of the legal person according to the last available accounts it provided approved by the management body.  This is higher than &euro;10 million, and 15% could be higher still.  The questions of whether &euro;10 million is the appropriate amount, whether ten years is an appropriate term or whether this term would ever even be invoked are worth pursuing as a discussion.  We have gone with &euro;10 million, which is a higher figure than in other EU countries, and &euro;15 million or 15% will apply if it is an administrative section.</p></speech>

It is stated specifically in section 41(1)(l) of SI 349 of 2016 on the European Union market abuse regulations of 2016.  Section 41(1)(l) states:</p><blockquote>subject to Regulation 47(2), where the assessee is a legal person, a direction to pay to the Bank a monetary penalty not exceeding&mdash;<br /><br />(i) in the case of a contravention of Article 14 or 15 of the Market Abuse Regulation, &euro;15,000,000 or 15 per cent of the total annual turnover of the legal person according to the last available accounts approved by the management body</blockquote> <p>It is already there in writing in the statutory instrument we have.</p></speech>

We have very little prosecution of white collar crime in this country.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State would send a note to me, and on Report Stage I will certainly consider that it should be stated explicitly.  After all, we will be trying to compete with mobile investments which may leave the City of London.  It is very important that our regulation should be as tough as that of anyone else.  It should be a percentage and not a fixed amount, and this should be specifically stated.</p></speech>

I appreciate the letter the Chairman gave me on this, and I am familiar with the practice that while it is the Chairman who signs the letter it is usually not the chairperson who makes the ruling.  I met the Clerk of the D&aacute;il on other interpretations of this.  It is deeply frustrating for Members who have a role in financial matters.  The idea the amendment has been ruled out of order as it is not relevant to the provisions of the Bill is absolutely ludicrous.  I question how the ruling has been made.  The legislation is about the capitalisation of financial institutions.  This is what the primary legislation is about.</p> <p>  We have just introduced an amendment to the Companies Act, which we have all, including the Minister of State, acknowledged is unrelated to this legislation.  The Minister mentioned on Second Stage that he was going to bring forward that amendment.  On Second Stage I, the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson and, I am sure, others including the Minister of State, all raised the issue of retrospective recapitalisation, which is central to the legislation.  Commencement orders are central to any legislation, but a commencement order tied to the issue of retrospective recapitalisation has been ruled out of order.  Despite the substance of whether it should be in or not, the issue should be allowed to be debated.  The ruling is completely out of order and I ask the Chair, who has signed the letter, to interrogate how such a ruling was made.  It is frustrating the work of the committee.</p> <p>  I agree we must facilitate the Government with regard to the amendment to the Companies Act, but that is the amendment which should have been out of order.  This amendment is completely in order with the provisions of the Bill.  Commencement orders are included in many pieces of legislation and they are standard practice.  My amendment was to introduce a commencement order and people could have argued whether we should or should not have one.  The commencement order was tied to the Minister reporting on the retrospective recapitalisation of our banks.  The Bill as it was initiated originally is about bailing out banks and the issue of their capitalisation through this fund.  It is not acceptable.</p></speech>

Obviously the ruling on whether or not the amendment was out of order was not a decision for us to take.  I am curious about what the Deputy means by a report.  The Minister has already put on record in reply to a parliamentary question his decision this regard.  Is the Deputy seeking something further beyond the reply to the parliamentary question?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-07-07a.432" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2016070700002#H01900"><p>Yes.  A three line answer from a Minister to state he will not go ahead with retrospective recapitalisation is not sufficient.  We need a report to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas as to the options on the assets we hold in our financial institutions and why we have closed down one of the options available to us.  We had countless debates, and rightly so, on the sale of our shares in Aer Lingus, which were a tiny fraction comparable to the assets we hold in the banks.  People no longer view the banks as assets, they see them as liabilities, but they are still assets.  However, it has just been stated in reply to a parliamentary question that we will not go down the road of one of the options available to us to get some or all of our money back because it has never been tested.  This would require the Minister to lay a report and state the information in a detailed and considered way.  In my view the finance committee should discuss all of the options and it should not just be left to the Minister to state we will not go ahead with this and that we might sell shares in the market at a future time.</p></speech>

On section 6, with regard to the report on the loans made available and the money coming back from the single resolution board, I am interested to know how the funds that will be made available by the State to the board will interact with the fiscal rules.  It will not be dealt with as expenditure so it will not impact on the expenditure benchmark, because it is a loan I assume.  It will impact on our debt to GDP ratio with regard to the rules on reducing the ratio.  I would like to hear how the outworking of all of this would impact on the fiscal rules.  If, on a given day, we had to make available &euro;1.815 billion how could it potentially impact on our deficit and the rules on deficit reduction?</p><p>While it would not impact on the structural deficit, it is interesting to note that other issues that have not been identified could become a major concern if the loan mechanism were ever triggered. </p></speech>

Judging from the Second Stage contributions of some Deputies, albeit not Deputy Pearse Doherty, there may have been some confusion in this regard.  This is a loan which would be repaid with interest.  In so far as that is concerned, it would not impact on the deficit or the expenditure benchmark.</p></speech>

The interest would depend on market rates at the time.  We would recoup the money that way.  The expenditure benchmark is calculated over a ten-year period, which runs from five years previous to the current year to four years after the end of the current year.  The loan would be repaid with interest within two years and, as such, would not figure in the expenditure benchmark rule or impact on the deficit.</p></speech>

Would it be classified as a debt or an asset, depending on from which stream the money comes?  Ideally, one would not want to take it on to the debt position or stock of debt of the State.  Again, we are discussing a scenario in which things have got pretty bad for at least one entity and it has entered a resolution process.  One would hope that no further problems would arise in the wider economy, the eurozone or anywhere else.  However, if one had, for example, the cash on balance that the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, has available to it and the NTMA were to make the loan facility available, the debt stockpile would not be affected.</p></speech>
