    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1406" speakername="Catherine Noone" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#A00200"><p>I suggest we go straight into public session because nothing can be lost in translation, and we will continue in public session unless the necessity arises to go into private session for any particular reason.  The draft minutes of the meetings of 22 and 23 November have been circulated.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  Are there any matters arising?  No.</p> <p>  We have received six items of correspondence, all of which are noted.  As the correspondence from Both Lives Matter only arrived this morning, we will come back to it next week as it contains the methodology used to back up its claim of lives saved by the unavailability of abortion in the North of Ireland.  The follow-up from Leah Hoctor about the calculation of gestation limits can be considered in the context of our report.  The other items of correspondence are listed.</p> <p>  Today we will conclude module 2 and we will finish our public meetings on module 3 tomorrow evening.  We must now start to complete the decision-making process that will allow us to report to the Oireachtas by 20 December, which is the three-month deadline imposed on us by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I suggest, therefore, that we commence the process next week as to when we can make decisions on modules 1 and 2, and the following week, on Wednesday, 13 December, we will consider the draft report which arises from the decisions made by the committee.  I think it unavoidable and necessary that we start the process next week, and early in the week if we have to, as otherwise we will be under pressure to meet the deadline and nobody wants that coming up to Christmas.  I have asked the secretariat to prepare a roadmap for modules 1 and 2.  The one for module 1 was circulated some weeks ago.</p><p>We can circulate that today and then discuss it at the commencement of our public business tomorrow.  I just wanted to give people a bit of notice of that in advance.</p><p> The clerk will have a briefing note highlighting the main issues we discussed with our experts in respect of each of the 13 reasons recommended by the Citizens' Assembly.  That note should assist members and it should be circulated by Friday lunchtime.  We will park that issue for now if that is okay.  Senator Buttimer has indicated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1391" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B00200"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for her comments.  I also ask her to indicate what she means by next week in terms of the process involved.  As I mentioned to her, to the clerk and to other members, I will be away next week speaking at an LGBT conference in the USA.  Could I suggest that we defer any votes until the week after?   I apologise but this is longstanding commitment.  I hope that the committee might facilitate my request to have the votes, if any, taken in a block on Tuesday or Wednesday of the following week.  I appreciate from where the Cathaoirleach is coming on this but, to be fair to me, as a member, we were never given a deadline or a date for votes.  I understand that we have a pressing need to get things done by 20 December but I hope that we could defer the vote.  I do not think that I am the only person who will be missing next week either.  I would appreciate it if I could be facilitated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B00300"><p>I have a separate question on the method of voting.  Was it originally agreed that a vote would be taken at the end of each module?  I am not challenging this, it is just that I want to understand the process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1406" speakername="Catherine Noone" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B00400"><p>My understanding of what was agreed, and I ask that someone correct me if they think me inaccurate on this, is that as we went along we, as a committee, would decide when it suited us to vote.   A modular approach could obviously have been open to votes after each module, but my understanding is that that was to be agreed as we went along.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith was not on the committee at the time so I understand why she is asking the question.  My understanding is that this matter is really up to the committee.  We made the decision to vote but left it open to movement, depending on circumstances.  There was some concession on the last vote, for example, but I do not need to go into that because Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith watched it and she knows what I mean.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B00500"><p>If there are members who cannot be here to vote next week, would it not be better to vote on the substantive question, namely, whether to have a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment, before next week?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1406" speakername="Catherine Noone" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B00600"><p>That is one option.  I will just go to the others who have indicated.  Has the Deputy finished speaking?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B00700"><p>Yes.  I am proposing that option.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1280" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B00800"><p>We finished module 2 today and will finish module 3 tomorrow.  I understand that a number of members, not just Senator Buttimer, will be unavailable next week due to longstanding commitments.  In order to be fair to every member of the committee, we should try to have full attendance before any votes are taken.  I am not suggesting this to facilitate anyone in particular.  At this stage, I have more than two folders of information relating to module 2 so I think that it would be prudent that we have an opportunity next week to debate this information.  We need to look at every recommendation from the Citizens' Assembly.  We also need to examine the information we have received and tie it up with those recommendations.  It will probably take two or possibly three days next week to digest all of this information and establish what exactly it means for each particular recommendation.  If we could do this next week, that would clear the way for having a series of votes on Tuesday week so as to finalise what the committee is recommending.  We will then be looking at a draft report immediately after that.  From my point of view, I would certainly like some conversation next week regarding the information we have received and how it affects the recommendations, one way or the other.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B00900"><p>Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith proposed voting before next week but that would mean doing so tomorrow.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B01000"><p>I propose voting on just one issue, namely, whether to hold a referendum on repeal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B01100"><p>I have the floor. Voting tomorrow would not give us enough time to go over all of our material and consider the issues properly.  Given the seriousness of what we are voting on, I would certainly be in favour of having as full an attendance as possible for any vote.  I support Deputy O'Brien in taking next week to discuss everything we have learned further and then to prepare for voting the week after.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B01200"><p>What we do on module 1 will, or potentially could, determine the shape of module 2.  It is not ideal that we push this because we could then use a lot of time inappropriately next week.  That is a concern for me.  Having said that, I acknowledge that we should be aspiring to full attendance when we make decisions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1406" speakername="Catherine Noone" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B01300"><p>I will just interject to say that because Wednesday is our day to meet, we should stick to it as the voting day.  Having a vote on Tuesday or Thursday would be unfair to members who are making any plans.  As a rule, we should try to have voting on the Wednesday.  I apologise to Deputy Catherine Murphy for cutting across her.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B01400"><p>My other point concerns what the report and the methodology for the report will look like.  The Chairman has talked about a roadmap but we might have to put some work into what such a roadmap would look like.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1406" speakername="Catherine Noone" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B01500"><p>The Deputy is absolutely right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B01600"><p>We could end up with quite a short, effective report.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B01800"><p>We are not trying to write the legislation here.  We may focus on big themes rather than very detailed specifics.  We need to have an idea of what we are going into here because we could then use our time much more effectively.  I would like to hear the committee's thinking as to the kind of report we will produce.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1406" speakername="Catherine Noone" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B01900"><p>I do not think that we would be doing our job well if we produced volumes of a report to give to the Oireachtas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B02000"><p>Yes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1406" speakername="Catherine Noone" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B02100"><p>I do not think that would be a very professional thing to do and, as far as I am concerned, it would not make any sense.  That is, however, a decision for the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B02200"><p>I suppose somebody should say that it is good that we are all back here and that we did not have to terminate our activities.  I think all of us around the table feel that.   I support what has been said about having as full an attendance as possible and, preferably, a full attendance for votes because that is a basic principle for reaching consensus.  I understand Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's suggestion that we vote this week and I think that there is some logic to it.  I have a concern about voting tomorrow, however, because we have also moved the time from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m.   Some of us would certainly have a difficulty with being here right until the end of the meeting tomorrow.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1406" speakername="Catherine Noone" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B02300"><p>The reason for that change is that voting in the Dail tomorrow will be later than usual.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B02400"><p>I understand the reason but I, for example, have a selection convention tomorrow night which was organised when we thought that we might have to rush matters.  Others will have also have reasons why they cannot suddenly change something that was an hour later than-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1406" speakername="Catherine Noone" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B02500"><p>I think there is a consensus on that.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan is reiterating the point I made earlier that Wednesday afternoon is the time for us to be voting.  I do not know if there is any disagreement on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#B02600"><p>Can I have some clarity on the roadmap?  Are we getting a roadmap tomorrow?</p></speech>

As I mentioned, the roadmap will outline the process.  We touched on this after module 1 so we will be expanding on that.  I would like to hold off on the conversation on that because we obviously still have witnesses to come in today.  We can chat about the roadmap tomorrow.</p></speech>

We have already had a vote and there was a lot of controversy about it.  The Citizens' Assembly is the main reason we are here so I think we should have all of the votes at the very end.</p></speech>

I also agree that our report should be short and to the point and should provide a clear indication of what the committee is recommending to Government without getting into nitty-gritty detail.  That is for the Government to do.</p></speech>

I call on Deputy McGrath.</p></speech>

I think the vote well ahead of time sent a bad signal.  I also disagree with the meetings being held at 3 p.m. on a Thursday because some of us from the country try to get out of the city ahead of traffic.</p></speech>

I am a consultant in foetal medicine practising in England at Birmingham Women&rsquo;s and Children&rsquo;s Hospital.  My special interests are in the prenatal diagnosis and management of foetal disease, the management of women with congenital heart disease and the management of multiple pregnancies.  Within my management of foetal disease, is included the diagnosis of differences in the foetus by ultrasound scan, preforming invasive prenatal diagnostic techniques such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling, CVS, performing invasive prenatal sampling such as drainage of fluid collections within a foetus which may be life threatening and also, where appropriate, counselling with regards to termination of pregnancy.</p> <p>  The unit where I work, Birmingham Women&rsquo;s and Children&rsquo;s Hospital is in the West Midlands and delivers approximately 8,000 women each year.</p><p>The West Midlands has a population of 5.5 million and my unit is the regional foetal medicine unit.  We perform over 7,000 ultrasound scans, 410 invasive procedures checking the chromosomes of babies, 48 intrauterine blood transfusions and around 40 fetoscopic laser ablations.  We also perform a number of other invasive tests, included selective reductions which I may mention later.  The unit is a supraregional referral centre for the management of feto-fetal transfusion syndrome and its management by fetoscopic laser ablation.<br/><br/>I have had an opportunity to present to the Citizens' Assembly and I am happy to discuss with the committee the care pathways of the termination of pregnancy under clause E in England, the experience of some Irish women that we have come into contact using these services and some suggestions regarding the use of the term fatal or lethal abnormality.  I do not intend in my introduction to cover all of the aspects that I covered in my paper.  Having said that, I am happy to expand on that with questioning.  <br/><br/>I am sure that all of the members are aware that 40 years ago the Westminster Parliament passed a Private Members' Bill ensuring that doctors who performed abortions, under certain conditions, would not be performing an unlawful act.  This law has never been adopted in Northern Ireland.  The law was subsequently amended by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990.  It is still an offence to perform an abortion unless two independent medical practitioners are of the opinion, formed in good faith, which is an important phrase, that the case meets at least one of the required criteria.<br/><br/>I hope to speak to the committee about clause E which states: &quot;there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped&quot;.  The British Parliament has never sought to define what is meant by the words &quot;substantial&quot; or &quot;serious&quot;.  The matter has been left to be decided in good faith by the medical profession.<br/><br/>It is important to note that clause E of the termination Act is not gestation dependant.  According to the Office for National Statistics in the UK, as many as 190,000 abortions were performed in England and Wales in 2016.  Of these, however, only 3,200 were performed under clause E.  As in the Republic of Ireland, the main foetal anomaly ultrasound scan is performed at approximately 20 weeks gestation in England and Wales.  Despite this only 500 of the 3,200 abortions, that I have mentioned, were performed after 22 weeks of pregnancy.  Also, there were 140 selective terminations of pregnancy, involving multiple pregnancies and over three quarters of these were under clause E.  These can be life-saving procedures for the co-twin and I have described one such case in the case studies that I have submitted.  Over half of these terminations of pregnancy are performed for chromosomal or central nervous system differences in the foetus. <br/><br/>In 2016, 3,265 Irish women had a termination of pregnancy in England and Wales.  Of these 140 had a termination under clause E of the Act.  Again, the foetal indications are predominantly chromosomal or central nervous system differences.<br/><br/>As explained in previous sessions that I have read, detailed anomaly scans of foetuses are performed at approximately 20 weeks gestation, though the availability appears to be much less in Ireland than it is in the UK.  In England and Wales if a difference is found in a foetus, a pathway is followed that may include a second local scan to confirm the diagnosis by an obstetrician with a special interest in fetal medicine.  The second scan should be performed within five working days.  In some cases local obstetricians will be able to fully counsel women on the outlook for their baby.  In other cases, referral to a recognised foetal medicine unit will take place.<br/><br/>We attempt to see women within three working days at my foetal medicine unit and that is the standard that has been set nationally.  When we see these women we scan them, then sit them in a more homely room and counsel them and their families in the presence of a midwife.  All options are discussed with the women including, where appropriate, intrauterine foetal therapy and the termination of pregnancy.  On leaving the woman is given a detailed report that is read through with her prior to her leaving and contact numbers for the fetal medicine centre are given.  A sub-group of women may need additional investigations, both invasive and non-invasive, and some will require counselling by a specialist in another field.  It is important to acknowledge that women will need differing amounts of time to come to terms with this information and make their decisions.<br/><br/>If the woman opts to terminate her pregnancy this will be arranged at her local unit where she can get additional family support.  Depending on the gestational age, both surgical and medical termination techniques are discussed with these women.  As there is an increasing chance of foetuses being born alive after 22 weeks of gestation, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends that the foetal heart is stopped by performing feticide prior to the termination of pregnancy for cases after 22 weeks of gestation unless the abnormality is not compatible with life.  <br/><br/>If the woman opts for a medical termination of pregnancy then a tablet, an anti-progestagen, is administered and admission arranged for induction of labour with prostaglandins about 36 hours later.  Around 95% of women will deliver on the day they receive their prostaglandins.  A small proportion will require a second course.  An infection, haemorrhage and retained placental tissue are the main short-term complications of the procedure.  For the Irish women that we see in our unit, we complete the termination process in Birmingham but once discharged the women return to Ireland.  While in Birmingham, they often express the difficulties that they have with regard to the limited number of people who they can discuss this scenario with and gain support from.  <br/><br/>Finally, I would like to mention the concept of fatal or lethal conditions.  If the law in Ireland is to change and the termination of pregnancy is allowed for foetal differences, I would urge the committee not to make a list as with the ever changing progress in medicine conditions would need to be added and removed from the list on a regular basis.  I would also strongly advise against being prescriptive and using the term lethal or fatal abnormality.  The problem is there is no agreed definition as to what lethal means.  Does it mean that all foetuses with the condition will die before birth?  Does it mean that all foetuses will die either before birth or in the neonatal period despite supportive therapy?  Does it mean that a baby will usually dies in one of these two periods?  Finally, has it just been noted that there is an association between the condition and death?<br/><br/>For the information of members, I included two tables from a publication by Wilkinson <i>et al</i>in the paper that I submitted to the committee.  The first of these lists the commonest conditions named in the medical literature that is said to be lethal foetal malformations.  The same paper quotes the longest age of survival for these conditions, and since this publication survival until 13 months has been reported in a case of renal agenesis.  Therefore, counselling women whose pregnancies are complicated by a foetus with a severe abnormality is not a binary state of affairs but rather a complex discussion that requires a description of risk and probability.<br/><br/>Last year, over 3,000 women travelled from Ireland to England to terminate their pregnancies.  Approximately 140 of them had a termination because their foetus was thought to have &quot;a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped&rdquo;.  The care pathway that is followed by Irish women is sub-optimal, removes them from their support network and is only available to a sub-set of women who are able to initiative their contacts with units in England.  <br/><br/>Finally, if legislation is brought in for foetal conditions, particular care must be taken when using the phrase &quot;lethal or fatal&quot;.</p></speech>

Is he saying that it is clinically impossible to diagnose and differentiate between a fatal condition and a very severe foetal condition?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.65" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Thompson" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#E00300"><p>The first thing is to decide what is the definition of &quot;fatal&quot;.  As a result of the history of the law on abortion in Ireland, it will be very difficult for Ireland's obstetricians to decide.  If it is decided in law that a fatal condition is one in which the baby always dies <i>in utero</i>, then we must consider that those conditions are exceptionally rare.  As the committee can see in the other table I submitted, even babies with trisomy 18 have been noted to survive following birth, although very rarely.  I worry that if the term &quot;fatal&quot; is used, some would argue that everything is fatal.  The contrary argument is that nothing is fatal because it does not result in a death in every single case.  A baby could live for a short period after birth.  That is my main consideration about the term &quot;fatal&quot;.<br/><br/>There was a first part to the question.  Is it impossible to draw up a list?  One could draw up a list of severe conditions if one could decide on one of those four different definitions.  One could draw up a list of severe conditions that would be appropriate for termination of pregnancy in Ireland.  The problem is that more conditions are being diagnosed all the time.  Another condition might then need to be added.  Alternatively, we might find a cure for one of the conditions on the list.  I am concerned that legislators in Ireland would constantly have to revisit the list in a circular fashion trying to tick things off and put things on.  In my experience of legislation, that can take quite a considerable amount of time.</p></speech>

Women who do not present until later in pregnancy tend to be those who have poorer socioeconomic backgrounds, such as those who are refugees.  Generally speaking, people who are less privileged in society will present later on and have poorer pregnancy outcomes overall.  If there is a gestational age limit that is lower, those women would be disadvantaged.</p></speech>

In addition, women are offered that test as part of a combined screening test that measures age, the thickness at the back of the foetus's neck - the so-called nuchal translucency - and markers of hormones in the woman's bloodstream.  That will give the likelihood of the risk of the baby having Down syndrome, Edwards syndrome or Patau syndrome.  One does not have to have that test.  In our unit, only about 60% to 70% of women take up that test but they still have the scan for viability.  In addition to that, women get a detailed anomaly scan between 18 and 22 weeks, which most units try to perform at about 20 weeks.</p></speech>

We are very interested in hearing the facts on this committee and Mr. Thompson has outlined them comprehensively.  If my math is correct, according to the statistics Mr. Thompson gave us, 55% of terminations under clause E, which represents a very small number - about 1.7% - are performed between 13 and 19 weeks.  That is the majority.  Will Mr. Thompson outline whether there are follow-up scans?  Deputy Kelleher and I share concerns about the availability of scanning equipment and access to scans for Irish women.  We are told by management in the HSE that 20-week anomaly scans in many cases are offered where they are clinically indicated.  Is there anything that would give a clinical indication?  My understanding is these anomaly scans are screening scans and there will not be any form of clinical indication.  If there is some form of clinical indication, and Mr. Thompson is the expert in this regard, he might share it with us.</p> <p>  Could Mr. Thompson define what constitutes the neonatal period?  He referenced this in his submission.  Is it in terms of development or weeks?  We are fully cognisant of the issues Mr. Thompson has outlined in the context of making lists and how prescriptive and unhelpful it might be to clinicians but we are equally charged with considering recommendations from the Citizens' Assembly.  Mr. Thompson is aware of those recommendations.  Some relate to conditions resulting in death before or shortly after birth.  Whether it is a good or bad idea is really a matter for the citizens because that is what has been given to us.  We have to consider that and we have to contemplate what recommendations we will make and how they will translate into the medical community.  I fear that as we are sitting here trying to come up with the report, there are doctors and clinicians watching proceedings at home, tearing their hair out and shouting at the screen that this will not work for them in practice.  We want to be respectful and mindful of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly but we equally have to come up with something that is fit for purpose and which translates into medical practice for people.  Perhaps Mr. Thompson will give us the benefit of his experience in grappling with that particular dilemma.</p></speech>

I will take them in reverse order.  The issue of death before or after birth could be helped if the word "usually" was added.</p><p>That gives a degree of scope because nothing - or very few things - in medicine is 100%.  If one said "usually death before or after", that would help the committee's recommendations tremendously.  In talking about the neonatal period, we generally speak about the first four weeks of life.</p><p> For the first two questions I have written down "clinical indications".  What was the Deputy's second question?</p></speech>

In relative terms, however, the majority of foetal abnormalities will still not be detected because the majority of foetal abnormalities will occur in a low-risk population just because there are more low-risk women.  That is why the UK screening programme would strongly recommend everybody having a scan at 20 weeks.</p></speech>

I think that was my first question - on the scans.  I know Mr. Thompson is here specifically to discuss clause E.  However, he mentions that clauses C and D are gestation dependent.  How is that dated?  Is it simply from the date of the last period or by scan?</p></speech>

Best dates would be determined really by ultrasound scan in the first trimester.  The best way to date a pregnancy is between 11 and 14 weeks by an ultrasound scan.  If that is not possible, the dating becomes less and less accurate as time goes by.  Effectively, I explain it to my patients as follows.  With a small child, it is possible to tell roughly how old he or she is by how tall he or she is.  That is the same up until approximately 24 weeks; we can determine how old a foetus is by its size.  However, the standard deviation broadens quite significantly after that time.  It would not be possible to tell the ages of those of us in this room by our heights.  Later in gestation, it is necessary to do something else.  Up until 24 weeks, the best way to do it is by ultrasound.  In the UK it is by ultrasound scan.</p></speech>

Some of the conversations we are having here seem to be on preconceived parameters and I am not sure who put them in place in this country.  Based on Mr. Thompson's evidence, he seems to have dedicated his life to saving life during pregnancy, including the mother's life.</p> <p>  I am assuming that foetal-to-foetal transfusion syndrome means twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome.</p></speech>

Mr. Thompson is dedicated to saving life and we are having conversations here about term limits, gestational stages, survival rates and all of that.  I am concerned that we are trying to frame our work into a preconceived diagram and, at this stage, there is no need for that.  We should trust experts in their field, such as Mr. Thompson, to progress their education and progress medicine.  I am starting to think we should just let the doctors, the experts, deal with this.</p> <p>  Has Mr. Thompson ever encountered a person in the UK who has been compelled or forced against her will to terminate a pregnancy?  There is almost a narrative here - this is obviously non-evidence based from what I can see - that doctors might be encouraging people to terminate.  However, based on Mr. Thompson's evidence, it appears that he does a lot of work to counsel people, advise them on their situation and help them through it.  I ask him to speak to that.</p> <p>  I also ask him to speak to the psychological and mental stress on families - mothers, fathers and other children - that can arise from a diagnosis of foetal abnormality, usually fatal.  Does he have any figures for marital breakdown as a result of such a catastrophic diagnosis?  The previous speakers mentioned this and I have spoken about it previously.  With advances in medicine, children are surviving from just over 24 weeks, which would have been unheard of a decade ago.  I support my colleagues in that we have to be very careful about putting in parameters, particularly when medicine is advancing so quickly and when children who would not have survived ten years ago might survive in the future.</p> <p>  As Deputy O'Reilly said, the 20-week scan is not available outside of the Dublin hospitals.  Professor Louise Kenny from Cork addressed the Joint Committee on Health on this matter.  Mr. Thompson spoke about diabetic women and other women with congenital defects themselves.  We are missing one per week in Ireland where it is the wild card.  It is the 20-year old who has a child with whatever condition.  Clearly, we have issues in this country with 20-week scans.  I do not want to misquote Professor Kenny, but I think her words were that one child a week is being born in circumstances that are not ideal and that these children should obviously be delivered in our teaching hospitals.  I ask Mr. Thompson to address those points.</p></speech>

As a junior doctor, I found it was quite difficult to come to terms with risk and why certain people have babies with abnormalities and who are the high-risk people.  The easiest analogy I can see in our practice is that everybody talks about older women being at increased risk of having babies with Down's syndrome.  However, most babies with Down's syndrome are born to younger women.  That is because younger women have more children.  It is just a factor of how many children are born in that cohort.  If only women over a certain age are screened - when I started my career it was those over 37 in the UK - then the majority of babies with Down's syndrome will not be picked up.</p> <p>  I am trying to work backwards through some of the questions.  There are figures on marital breakdown.  I think there are well-published figures on marital breakdown in families where a baby has been born with trisomy 21.  I would not like to quote what they are, but they are definitely there.  The psychological and mental stress that people go through when they have a baby with a difference is huge.  I do not want to talk about clauses C and D, because that is not part of my practice any more.  However, the babies in the cohort we are talking about are very different because these are wanted babies where women have gone a significant part of the way through their pregnancies telling their families they are going to have a child and when the child is going to be born.</p><p>They then get this devastating news that the baby has some major difference.  We should not be sidelined by the occasional story of babies with talipes or cleft lip or the like, we should be concentrating on the major differences that these babies have.  More than half of them have significant chromosome or central nervous system differences.  This puts the parents under huge stress and makes it difficult for them to make these decisions.  We never give a diagnosis and then agree to a termination on the same appointment unless we are giving a second opinion to another centre.  If people had been given a diagnosis at another centre, decided that they wanted somebody else to check, and had already been given all of the information, then we would agree to terminate at that point.  Otherwise, however, we make parents go away and think about things.  </p><p> In response to the question on preconceived parameters and leaving matters to the medical profession, I think that the medical profession in Ireland would want some support from the Legislature.  I come back, however, to the section of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority Act, HFEA, which talks about two independent clinicians coming to an opinion formed in good faith.  I can essentially make a decision that could be wrong but if I have done so in good faith then I would be acting within the law.  This is very important because we as a profession try to keep up to speed with professional development - I would like to think that I certainly do.  Nobody gets everything right all the time, however, and we have to acknowledge that.  None of us in any walk of life would say that we are perfect, but if a doctor makes a decision in good faith then that is what the law needs to protect.</p></speech>

We have heard testimonies about injections through the heart and graphic descriptions of cutting up dead unborn children.  I wonder if Dr. Thompson could expand on the use of foeticide.  Who is benefitting here: the mother; the doctor; the child?  What is the holistic approach to early delivery or late termination, or whatever it is that we want to call it?  I ask Dr. Thompson to expand on this because there has been much conversation about it being a very barbaric act, though I am sure that Dr. Thompson might disagree with that.</p></speech>

We tend to do this under ultrasound control and gain access to the foetal circulation, sometimes through the heart.  It is important that one then paralyses the foetus by administering a drug much as one would with a general anaesthetic, followed by an injection of either a local anaesthetic or potassium, which stops the heart.  Once the foetus is born it becomes a baby and it is important to realise that whereas the foetus has no rights in the United Kingdom, the second it is born it acquires full rights.  In the UK, then, one might end up with the scenario in which a woman undergoes a termination of pregnancy without the performing of foeticide only for the baby to be resuscitated afterwards.  One would then have turned a scenario involving a foetus with an abnormality into one involving a premature baby with an abnormality, thus making the whole situation worse.  Foeticide is not something that people like myself enjoy because we did, after all, go into our profession in order to try to save lives. On rare occasions, however, I think it is necessary.</p></speech>

Following up on his last point, I think he has touched on something very important with regard to how we define what is fatal.  Dr. Thompson is absolutely correct - once we are born we are all fatal.   To try to put legislative structures on words and definitions can, as Dr. Thompson has recounted from his own experience, take a very long time.  There was a case in Britain some time ago - I cannot remember the name - in which debate and discussion of legislative changes in the High Court resulted in a long period of suffering for a woman and her child.  I would like to say openly to everybody here that we have to be careful about the words we use when we are advising on the kind of legislation we want and we have to be mindful of some of the matters that Dr. Thompson has pointed out.  He has pointed out some very serious issues that we have to grapple with here.  One that struck me was the fact that some women present late with crisis pregnancies involving severe foetal disability because of poorer socioeconomic conditions.  We have to be very mindful of such cases because, in looking at how we structure some kind of legislation, we have to remember that the Citizens' Assembly very passionately wanted it added to the discourse that socioeconomic factors play a major role in forming the outcome of their discussions.</p> <p>  I would like to pick up on a number of points, some of them in the same vein as Deputy O'Connell's questions about foeticide.  I understand that an injection goes straight into the heart and stops it beating.  This injection is lethal - it paralyses the foetus and kills it.  Is there evidence, however, that such an injection causes pain?  I ask Dr. Thompson to expand on the discussion of pain because it is often used in a very emotive way to argue against the treatment of pregnancy in this way.  I would also like Dr. Thompson to expand an another important point.  Women often look for options after they have had a scan at 20 weeks and they might need a follow-up scan very quickly within five days.  This is often not available to them in Ireland, however, and that puts them at a big disadvantage.</p><p>Although they may go to Britain and have that, they need the follow-up care, discussion and conversation, to have the important emotional, physical and medical understanding of everything they are going through.  Would Mr. Thompson agree that because they are forced out of Ireland and cannot get that care at home, where they are surrounded by family and other supports, they are particularly disadvantaged?  Those who talk about cruelty to a foetus or an unborn child often use the word "baby" but we have to also think about the cruelty to the woman who is being denied access to this kind of reproductive health.  I would like Mr. Thompson to comment on those points. </p></speech>

The other case that I described in the papers, microcephaly, whereby the brain is not growing normally, usually only presents after 24 weeks.  Even if a woman has a history of having a previous baby with this, in many cases she has a 1:4 chance of having another baby affected in the same way.  We would have to scan those women all the way through their pregnancy.  Sometimes the head size appears normal until they get as far as 28 or 32 weeks and suddenly it becomes apparent that the baby has microcephaly.  That is important.</p> <p>  With regard to foetal awareness and pain, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has studied the literature on this, and regularly comes out with definitions of it.  Last time it said the evidence that the foetus can and does experience pain is less compelling and accordingly the benefit of administering analgesia is less evident while the risk of the practicalities of so doing remain.  On the basis of first do no harm, prior to the procedure described in this report, analgesia is no longer considered necessary from the perspective of foetal pain or awareness.  The previous report had suggested that we should give analgesia to the foetus in case the foetus felt pain.  After that it suggested that it was not necessary.  I am not an expert on foetal pain but that is the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' position.  </p> <p>  I think Irish women are greatly disadvantaged.  In the UK, not long ago, there was, and there still is, a shortage of sonographers and many units stopped doing 20 week scans.  We have had to train up many of our midwives who perform ultrasound scans to get a new cohort of professionals to do this.  It should be something that is available to everyone.  Ultrasound depends on how large the woman is, in women who are overweight the views are less good.  Women are often brought back for a second look.  We talked about doing it between 18 and 22 weeks but if we do it at 18 weeks we have to bring back a greater proportion of women for a second look and we end up doing more scans overall.  That is why most people settle for around 20 weeks as their best evidence.  </p></speech>

Sometimes the information that might result from that post mortem can be difficult for a woman to accept and absorb if there are issues about her anatomy and the possibility of conceiving and bearing to full term in a normal way.  Would Mr. Thompson comment on the sort of follow-up needed from various specialists, that is not available in Ireland, and the possibility of having a post mortem on the foetus to advise for the future reproductive health of the woman?</p></speech>

People often want a reason why something has happened.  This gives an opportunity to close that chapter and allow people to move on.  That is very important.  Information can be difficult to hear sometimes but often it is better to have the information.  The second point is that if a woman hears this story, and how bad it is, it is quite distressing because she has lost her baby but she wants to know whether it is going to happen again.  We might be able to do the post mortem and say there is a 1:1000 chance this will happen again or we might find other differences in the baby as well.  That means that it would appear the baby has a syndrome and that syndrome has a higher recurrence risk, a 1:4 chance.  People will view those two facts very differently and can make decisions about their future reproductive life in the knowledge of what is there.  In the service here this is a time when ultrasound scanning could be directed at a much higher risk group.</p></speech>

My first question, about the dangers of a strict definition of lethal abnormality, has been partly answered but could Mr. Thompson expand a bit on why the flexibility is important in terms of deferring to medical professions and say how that works in practice?  If the legislation is more flexible are there standard guidelines that the medical profession would work from or would it depend on the doctor or consultant a woman is assigned to?</p> <p>  Mr. Thompson mentioned in his presentation that when a woman is beyond 24 weeks' gestation a team of hospital managers, two clinicians, a neonatologist and a midwife meet to assess whether to perform the termination after 24 weeks.  Could he comment on the rate of abortions in these cases and if any are declined, why?  </p> <p>  My third question is about an issue Mr. Thompson said he did not want to speak on.  I would like him to comment on it but if he does not want to that is fair enough.  It is ground D, when continuance of the pregnancy would have a harmful impact on the other children of the woman.  We have not discussed that very much, apart from the socio-economic grounds.  I do not know whether it would fall under that heading.  Could Mr. Thompson expand a bit on that and how we would encompass that in our legislation?  How is it assessed, is it based on the word of the woman saying her family would be negatively affected?  It would be great if Mr. Thompson could walk us through that.</p></speech>

In the UK, two people have to fill out a form to say this woman meets the ground of one clause and most people were of the opinion that she must meet one but she can meet the grounds of several clauses.  The figures I have given are for E alone, and with any other clause.</p><p>I was not here to discuss clauses C and D.  I no longer do any gynaecology whatsoever, so I do not get involved in cases such as clauses C or D.  Cases such as clause D obviously impact on the family if there is a baby with a significant congenital abnormality.  In reality I believe that in almost every case where I agree to a termination for a significant foetal abnormality, I should probably also circle clause C, and if there are other children already present, I circle clause D.  I do not believe how it cannot have an impact on them.  I believe that more people should have multiple clauses circled but people tend not to do that.  If they hit one hurdle then that is all people tend to be concerned about.  If I scan a patient and the top of the baby's skull is not formed, the baby has anencephaly and the brain is being destroyed.  I would not think about the social scenarios so much with regard to whether I needed to circle that clause.</p><p> I will now turn to the dangers of sticking to strict definitions.  With regard to relative guidelines, there is no doubt that people do things differently in different units.  Everybody has to find their own way but in the UK one has to find what one believes to be significant and serious reasons.  Nobody can define what is right, but there has to be a standard deviation within which people fall.  In the UK, if we see a woman who has asked for a termination of pregnancy for a foetal abnormality and if I believed that it did not fulfil clause A, then I am duty bound to find her a second opinion.  The person who finds the second opinion may also say that he or she does not believe it either.  That would be one scenario.  I have come across cases where we have declined after 24 weeks.  Reference was made to the group and the people who refused in those cases were the people who actually do the procedure, the clinicians.  The others in the group had felt that the cases complied with the law and the people who performed the procedure did not.</p><p> In one situation, for example, which was a psychiatric case partly, the women said that she would kill herself if something did not happen.  We did not feel that it had been explained enough or that enough detail had been gone into at that stage.  We felt that we were only part way.  One of the interesting things I learned from that case was that we were put under a lot of pressure to do this and then we said, "Are you going to sign one half of the form?", but nobody was happy to sign the form.  They expected that we would.  It is very important that it is the relevant specialty person who signs in this regard.  If a doctor believes that a woman has a psychiatric illness and that is the reason she should have a termination of pregnancy, then psychiatrists need to be involved in it.  They should be giving the opinions in those cases.  I am not a psychiatrist.  They should sign half of the form and then I can be involved in meeting the woman and make a decision based on what they say.  If I agree, then I can sign the other half of the form.  Other relevant specialties need to be involved in the process also.</p></speech>

Mr. Thompson has described a counselling system, options being discussed and detailed reports.  In his response to Senator Ruane the witness spoke of situations where there is a difference of views among doctors.  How much of that does a woman get if she travels from Ireland for a termination?   Is any of this pre-decision making available to her with regard to options being discussed and having time to think about those options or do the doctors in the UK rely on this happening in Ireland?</p></speech>

Often women are sent over for a second opinion.  We re-scan, do everything from the beginning and re-counsel.  It is difficult because just as we would do for a women from Birmingham or from Stoke, we do not agree to do a termination when we first meet them, but we impart some information and tell them to go away and think about it.  The women from Ireland then have to find a local hotel in the UK or return to their community in Ireland.  Most, however, tend to stay over in the UK, or Birmingham in our case.  Most women from Ireland travelling for a termination used to go to Liverpool.  Now it is London and some - fewer I believe - come to Birmingham.  It is very difficult for these women.  They certainly receive some counselling.  I believe it is adequate.</p> <p>  I am more concerned that they do not receive the follow-up care that they should.  This is not because the people in Ireland cannot, or do not, give it.  If a woman has had a foeticide performed there should be some feedback afterwards.  I ask patients if they have any questions about the procedure and how we got to that decision.  It is very important that they say yes or no to that.  If the woman is concerned about how she got to the decision then we need to explore it at that time.</p></speech>

There is, however, a constant pressure to keep the costs down for them.  The woman's partner is often there too.

It is about the definition issues, as the raised by the Chairman.  There is no definition of substantial risk and in Britain there is the "in good faith" clause.  In Mr. Thompson's' view, does this make it easier for medics to make decisions?  Have there ever been court challenges on doctors' decisions or does that clause protect their medical judgment?  I ask this in the context of Ireland's situation where the definition of the right to life of the unborn and the equal right to life of the mother causes real difficulties for medics' decisions as to when they are within the law or outside the law.</p></speech>

There was one that did not get to court where the Crown Prosecution Service examined a case of a termination of pregnancy because of a cleft lip.</p><p>There was considerable publicity about that at the time.  It is easy to quote the very rare occasions when these things happen - they are very rare and that is the only one I can think of at present - but what I hope the committee would do is frame a law that would work 99.9% of the time and would be good for the women of this country in general, not concentrate on the 0.01%.</p></speech>

It allows a degree of flexibility.  We are professionals and professionals in other disciplines make decisions with patients about resuscitation and non-resuscitation that could be argued about by other clinicians who would think that, perhaps, they had come to the wrong decision.  It is not obstetricians alone who make these difficult decisions.  I believe a degree of flexibility is required.</p></speech>

I have a general question which is not really part of Mr. Thompson's remit but he stated in reply to a previous question that women from less privileged backgrounds present later than the  majority of women.  Is there a programme in place in the UK to encourage earlier presentation?  Is there anything in that regard that we could learn from in this country?  Clearly, if women are presenting later they are possibly depriving themselves of choices which it might be too late to avail of.</p></speech>

The other key change was direct access to midwives.  Initially, one had to get an appointment with one's family doctor and the family doctor would refer the woman to the midwife and-or the hospital.  Now, there is direct access to the midwife so one almost misses out on the first part of the chain, which in some ways can be bureaucratic for many patients.  The midwives will liaise with the GPs and the GPs can input from there, but it is not dependent on the GPs initiating the first contact.  Women find it easier to contact midwives in those circumstances.</p></speech>

It is an interesting discussion.  What happens if a woman or girl presents and has not made up her mind fully or has not been counselled previously as to whether she will or will not continue with the pregnancy?  Is there a facility to counsel or assist in any way?</p> <p>  My other question relates to when there is a serious abnormality.  Mr. Thompson mentioned something interesting, which we knew, regarding younger women and particular abnormalities, with the second baby having a difficulty as well.  To what extent, if at all, can one assess the strength of character of the woman presenting in those circumstances?  She is suddenly confronted with a serious issue.  She is looking forward to giving birth and is full of expectation, but suddenly her hopes are dashed.  What does Mr. Thompson do to assist her?  Does she continue with her intention to have a termination or does she draw back from that?  To what extent can Mr. Thompson tell whether she will be able to deal with the issue in her life ahead in the case of either the intervention or a normal birth?</p></speech>

That is one of the other reasons that gestational age limits are difficult.  If there is a 24-week gestational age limit and the woman has an ultrasound scan at 20 weeks and two days, a week later she gets a second opinion in her local hospital and the following week she is seen by us for the first time, the gestational age is nearly 23 weeks already.  If the limit is in one week we are going to say to the woman, "Now you must make up your mind and you have a couple of days in which to do it.  If you do not make up your mind in that couple of days you are continuing with the pregnancy".  It is much easier to say that there is time for the woman to come to the right decision.  What people cannot do is flip between one decision and the other, and occasionally people do that.  They say they do not want to have a termination but then follow up and say they want one.  They come back and we discuss it and then they say they do not want it.  It is difficult to make generalisations but often with people who are constantly changing their minds one ends up in the do no harm scenario and, by default, women may well carry on with the pregnancy.  Where they keep changing their minds one does not want to do something that is irreversible.</p></speech>

For example, must they make up their own minds or, given her general demeanour, can he assess the strength or weakness of the woman in question as to whether she is taking the right course?</p></speech>

What we are much more concerned about is when people appear to be putting undue pressure on the woman.  One of the reasons that we have a flexible time gap between diagnosis and when we would act is that it allows people to think.  People have access to our telephone numbers and can speak to the midwives, who have been in the consultation as well and will also see the women again.  Assessing somebody's strength of character is very difficult in this scenario, and passing judgment is difficult.  However, we have difficulties when we feel that people are having undue pressure put on them by other members of the family either to continue or to end the pregnancy.  That often becomes very obvious.  Then we will see the patients apart from the other members of the family and discuss it with them in confidence.</p></speech>

To what extent is counselling available in the case of a woman or girl having a baby who proves eventually to have serious physical or mental or both sensory and physical difficulties?  Does she receive counselling as to whether she has a pre-existing condition that might lead to a repeat of that?</p><p>Does she get adequate counselling and support in those circumstances to help her to make up her mind?  Obviously there is a deep desire to have a normal baby.  In the first instance, the woman may have had her baby with abnormalities in the knowledge that she wanted to have her baby anyway.</p></speech>

They will get counselling from their foetal medicine consultant.  They will get counselling from the midwives because often the women will stay, we will leave the room and they will have a private conversation with their midwives.  In addition, a subset of women will need to have an input from other specialists and sometimes those specialists are clinical geneticists.  Then the clinical geneticist will see the woman on her own or with her partner and discuss the impact.  Sometimes these things can have an impact on the children who are already born so the clinical geneticist can discuss those things with the woman and whomever.  It is important that there is a care pathway that includes clinical geneticists as well.</p></speech>

In his talk he spoke a lot about aborting babies because they had been diagnosed with a particular condition.  I am very concerned that we would think it is okay to abort babies because they are going to be disabled.  As Mr. Thompson has said, there is no way for a doctor to know how long these babies will live.  Many families have been in contact with me to say that they have treasured the time that they got to spend with their babies even though it was not for a long period.  Other families have told me that they were told that their babies would not live very long only to discover that the diagnosis was incorrect and the babies were born safely and enjoying life.</p> <p>  It is also worrying that in England and Wales something like Down's syndrome is seen as a reason to end a baby's life.  We have all become familiar with the terrible statistics that nine out of every ten babies are aborted in these countries when there is a diagnosis of Down's syndrome.  There is no reason the situation would be any different if abortion was introduced in Ireland.  Does Mr. Thompson think that a diagnosis of Down's syndrome is something that should deprive a baby of his or her right to be born?</p></speech>

There are differences as well between babies with normal hearts who have Down's syndrome and babies with abnormal hearts who have Down's syndrome because the co-morbidities with Down's syndrome can greatly affect their outcomes.</p> <p>  One of the things that I did do was outline what happens in my unit in the UK.  We also do a lot of the first trimester screening for the country whereby the blood tests are sent to our laboratory.  I gave the committee some figures for affected pregnancies and the number of people who have terminations.  As one can see, out of the 67 cases that were detected by screening 44 people opted to terminate their pregnancy.  That is not 90%.  That is a specific subgroup of people because between 30% and 40% of women have already opted out of this screening in the first place.  Those women are women who would not want to contemplate having a termination due to Down's syndrome.  This is a situation that is person-specific.  What affects some people in some people's lives affects others differently. </p></speech>

As he said, the babies can be aborted at quite a late stage in pregnancy if a condition like Down's syndrome is diagnosed.  I am worried by the fact that we are living in a world where something like Down's syndrome is seen as something that could mean a baby's life could be ended.</p> <p>  Doctors are trained to save lives and support tiny babies who are seriously ill.  Does Mr. Thompson think that ending the life of a baby because he or she is sick goes completely against such training?</p></speech>

Does all of that boil down to a law where a group of people are allowed to decide whether a baby is allowed to live or not?  This is completely the opposite to what we do here in Ireland, where doctors do their best to care for both mother and baby.  If we repealed the eighth amendment and introduced a similar law to the one in the UK would it not fundamentally change what doctors do in Ireland?  They would no longer care for two patients.  Instead, they would be allowed to decide which sick baby to treat.  Does Mr. Thompson think that we would then treat sick babies with a real lack of care and compassion?</p></speech>

I would like to acknowledge the fact that the legal and health care systems in the UK cater for a significant number of Irish women, and has done so for decades.  Given our experience with mother and baby homes and Magdalen laundries, we are not in a position to be shouting from the rooftop in terms of how women have been treated in this country.</p> <p>   I want to ask Mr. Thompson about future proofing.</p><p>I take the point Mr. Thompson has made in respect of being overly specific about conditions.  Obviously things have changed from a socioeconomic point of view.  Very often people are delaying pregnancies and are availing of assisted reproduction.  Sometimes there are twins or triplets in a multiple pregnancy.  What impact has that had?  Mr. Thompson made a point on a co-twin benefitting from the procedure.  I presume that would happen in a situation where neither twin would be born alive without that intervention.  In the area of future-proofing legislation, in Mr. Thompson's experience are there aspects of law which we must consider in that regard?  The current situation is that there is an equal right to life.  That right would probably extend to a situation wherein there were twins, neither of whom would survive without intervention.  I am trying to think about this from a legal perspective.</p></speech>

The problem is that selective reduction comes with a risk.  When one performs a selective reduction, it can cause the whole pregnancy to miscarry.  One ends up having a discussion with the woman on which option presents the lower risk.  In a case where there is a baby who is very unlikely to survive and another who seems to be completely normal, and where it is unlikely that either will be born alive if the pregnancy is continued, a selective reduction could decrease the chance of the normal baby dying.  However, there will be as much as a 15% risk of miscarriage of the normal baby at the time the selective reduction is carried out.</p></speech>

That became an issue as survival rates for babies increased as time passed by.  It became more about a specific gestational age than about viability.  That is how it has changed.

I was fascinated by what Mr. Thompson had to say about seeking to distinguish between those children with Down's syndrome with normal hearts, as he put it, and those with abnormal hearts.  May I tell him something about children with Down's syndrome and their hearts as we experience it in Ireland?  Children with Down's syndrome generally have very big hearts.  There are thousands and thousands of people in Ireland who will tell Mr. Thompson about the love those children have brought into their lives.  They would tell him about how unexpected the outcome was in many cases and about how what seemed like a disaster when receiving the news turned out to be a situation which brought untold love into the house.  They would tell him how, far from causing mental health difficulties, the situation brought out the best in people as they had to discover and develop their caring sides.  I remember a conversation I had with one very senior politician, who is still serving.  He said that the child in his family who had Down's syndrome was the only one who really saw them all as equal and did not care about any of their achievements.  The child did not compare any of them with one other and just loved them all the same.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Thompson accept that thousands of people in Ireland, who are listening to these proceedings or who will hear about his words in the coming days, will be chilled to the marrow?  Does he accept that there are people who see that there are two lives to be cherished and protected in these situations?  Does he accept that there are those who would be horrified by the way Mr. Thompson talks about the paralysing of the child, or the foetus to use the clinical term, that he carries out as part of the foeticide procedure, or the way he suggests that the odd story of babies with cleft lips being aborted is something we should disregard, as though abortion on such a trivial ground was just a small thing to be disregarded, a mere medical detail?  Does he accept that he has an entirely different world view on this issue, perhaps from that of thousands of people in his own country but certainly from that of those who see two lives to be protected?  Perhaps the fact that he cannot even estimate the number of abortions he has carried out highlights that point.</p></speech>

Senator Mullen said that Mr. Thompson has come here to make a case.  Mr. Thompson came to give evidence, not to make any case.  Perhaps I misheard Senator Mullen but that needs to be clarified.</p></speech>

He has provided answers to many of my questions.  An Irish clinician who has dealt with women who travelled to the United Kingdom for abortions appeared before the committee.  For legal reasons, such doctors cannot refer the medical files of such women to a doctor in the United Kingdom.  That may give rise to difficulty in the case, for example, of a woman who is bipolar or on anti-psychotic medication.  What is Mr. Thompson's professional expert view on the difficulties for a doctor in the United Kingdom in treating an Irish woman whose doctor could not refer the medical file and who may not bring or relay that critical information on her condition to clinicians in the United Kingdom?  I presume such information would have a huge impact on how she would be treated, dealt with and supported in the United Kingdom should she need a termination, such as in the case of a fatal foetal abnormality.  What problems does that pose for doctors in the United Kingdom?  The committee has heard from doctors working in Ireland who encounter a legal obstacle to referring medical files to treating doctors in the United Kingdom.</p></speech>

As I said, it is difficult to have an insight into how a person is behaving if he or she has a significant mental health disorder that nobody is divulging or can divulge.  That can put us in difficulties.  If a woman has a significant health problem, that can put us in other difficulties and the woman in danger.  When under stress, people often do not reveal all of the issues they wish to communicate and do not tell us everything.  Sometimes I forget some of my health problems when asked about them.  It is quite difficult to go through those things.  Such people are in very stressful situations and I sometimes think we give them sub-optimal treatment because we do not have all the information we should.</p></speech>

Most of the questions I intended to put have already been asked.  On page 6 of his statement, Mr. Thompson mentioned that he would expect the number of requests for termination of pregnancies in cases of diagnosis of Down's syndrome to be high and that that would not be representative of the population.</p><p>What does he mean by that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.233" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Thompson" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#O00200"><p>There is the general population.  How screening works is explained properly to everybody.  We are just talking about screening for chromosomal abnormalities.  At this point, between 30% and 40% will say they are not interested and opt out immediately.</p> <p>  The second step, so to speak, is that a risk is ascertained.  When people are informed of the risk and despite the first risk, some people will actually say they had the test because they just wanted it to be low in order to have some good news and reassure them.  Other people will view the risk they get as actually not very high anyway.  We have a cut-off risk of one in 150 at which we will offer invasive prenatal diagnosis.  Some people might view one in 140, for example, as a low risk and then not go on to have invasive prenatal diagnosis.</p> <p>  Those women who go on to have invasive prenatal diagnosis, which carries a risk of miscarriage meaning that for the first time they are doing something that carries a risk of miscarriage, are doing it for three main reasons: it would impact on how the baby would be managed after birth; some people feel that once they have been given this higher risk, they just have to know; and other people do so because they are going to act on the result.  A high proportion of people in the end, therefore, act on the result because they have been through several screening processes beforehand whereas people who would not act on that result actually cannot get that far.  I am not sure if I explained that properly to the Deputy.</p></speech>

Of those, 40 just leave the room immediately and say, "I don't want any testing".  Of the remaining 60, ten come back as high risk.  Those women are all spoken to and offered an invasive test.  Seven of those might take it up and three will decline it because they will say, "Actually, I was going down this process, but now I have to take a risk and I'm not going to take a risk over my baby".  If any of the seven who have the invasive test out of the original 100 are identified as having a baby with Down's syndrome, a high proportion are likely to act on that information.  It depends on what proportion one takes.  Is it a percentage of the people who have the amniocentesis or is it a percentage of the general population?  Therefore, that group is not representative of the general population.</p></speech>

The committee has received consistently high-quality presentations.  I was struck by the large number of facts and statistics.  It gives a very good insight into practice in Britain.  I thank him for that.</p> <p>  I am not sure if Mr. Thompson can comment on this, but I will ask anyway.  We have had medical professionals from Ireland and Britain, people whose job is to care for women and their babies.  They have been consistent - Mr. Thompson has been just as consistent today - in highlighting that we should trust medical professionals.  The witnesses from Ireland, including the masters from the Rotunda Hospital and the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, have been consistent in saying that the current laws are restrictive and a danger to women's health.  Why does Mr. Thompson believe that the medical professionals, the people whose jobs are to care for our loved ones, are so consistent in this message that the current set-up in Ireland does not work for women?</p></speech>

One aspect is from personal experience and women coming over to us.  The other is from my discussions with some of my colleagues here and how they have difficulty in interpreting the equivalent of our clause A when doing a termination of pregnancy when a woman's life is at risk and how they feel that there is great danger.  The one thing that is similar is that it is a criminal offence in both countries at the moment if someone does not fulfil the law.  As I understand it, the difference is that here it is also a criminal offence for the woman, whereas in the UK it is just the doctor who commits the criminal offence.</p> <p>  It is likely that it will be decriminalised in the UK.  Certainly the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has suggested it should be monitored, as other aspects of medicine are, by the General Medical Council.  A similar thing would be sensible here.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Thompson for attending to give evidence to the committee.  During the course of the committee's work, I have been contacted by people on both sides of the debate and people in the middle of the debate.  Clearly, we do not have consensus in the country as to how we should proceed.  While I have seen no medical evidence to support this, it has been suggested that somehow having a termination puts a woman at greater risk of breast cancer.  I do not know if any other members of the committee have been presented with this as though it is a fact.  I cannot find any medical evidence to that effect.  Has Mr. Thompson come across that?  I am conscious that as a Member of Parliament I am here to represent my constituency and all the different views and ask the questions that have been asked of me.  I am just asking that question as it has been presented to me.</p> <p>  If a child is born with a very severe or serious abnormality - whatever term one wants to use - does the child then experience pain having been delivered?  Is it Mr. Thompson's medical view that it would be more humane not to deliver a child with serious difficulties or severe abnormalities?</p></speech>

The royal college document states that parallels should not be drawn between <i>in utero</i>and <i>ex utero</i>even if it is the same gestation.<br/><br/>Regarding the link between termination of pregnancy and breast cancer, I think there is a stronger link with pregnancy, but I am not aware of it particularly being termination of pregnancy.  I would be more than happy to check that for the Deputy and feed it back to the committee.</p></speech>

The citizens voted on a variety of reasons.</p><p>Reason 11 was that the unborn child has a significant foetal abnormality that is likely to result in death before or shortly after birth.  The Citizens' Assembly favoured applying this only up to 22 weeks of gestation.  This is an issue that the committee has to grapple with and I appreciate that Dr. Thompson has a different legal framework.  We are not commenting on that framework, good, bad or indifferent, but we must grapple with this issue.  Could Mr. Thompson comment on the workability of this?  Is it feasible?</p></speech>

For a certain number of women who get a diagnosis at 20 weeks, there would be a rush to make a decision in the next two weeks.  The committee should bear in mind that if Ireland were to go down a similar path to the United Kingdom, parents would probably not get a confirmatory discussion until another week after the scan, leaving them feeling that if they do not make a decision within the next week, they may not get the opportunity to make a decision at all.  It is for the committee to decide whether that might force women one way or the other.</p></speech>

I am standing in this afternoon for my principal officer colleague, Ms Clare McNamara, who cannot be here at short notice due to illness.  The committee has already received the submission of the Department.  This follows on from a letter of response from the Secretary General to the committee in which the ancillary recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly that falls within the remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs was addressed.</p> <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs administers a range of funding schemes and programmes to support the provision of youth services to young people throughout the country, including those from disadvantaged communities.  There are approximately 1,600 youth groups and clubs across the country, with an estimated membership of 89,000 young people, in receipt of funding from the Department under the local youth club grant scheme.  The majority of these young people are in clubs affiliated to national youth organisations.  Local youth clubs, along with each national youth organisation in receipt of funding from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, are expected to operate in accordance with the national youth strategy, which is a constituent strategy of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, BOBF.</p> <p>  The implementation of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People has been ongoing across Government since its launch in April 2014.  The national youth strategy, which was subsequently launched in October 2015, includes commitments identified by young people themselves.  It builds on the youth-specific policy commitments outlined in BOBF.  In line with current and emerging policy, the national youth strategy addresses the current socio-economic needs and aspirations of young people aged between ten and 24 years.</p> <p>  The implementation structures established by the Department under BOBF are overseeing the roll-out of the national youth strategy.  Youth clubs and services have a significant contribution to make to realise the goals of the national youth strategy, as part of a cross-sectoral whole-of-society approach to supporting young people in their everyday lives.</p> <p>  One of the main objectives of the national youth strategy is for young people to enjoy a healthy lifestyle, in particular with regard to their physical, mental and sexual health and well-being.  The Department also provides funding to the national youth health programme.  This is a partnership operated by the National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI, in conjunction with the youth affairs unit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the health promotion unit of the Health Service Executive.  In 2017 the Department allocated &euro;86,952 to the NYCI to support the implementation of the national youth health programme.</p> <p>  The national youth health programme provides a broad-based and flexible health promotion, education, support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings.  Through the national youth health programme, the NYCI has sought to develop the capacity of the youth sector and youth organisations to advocate on issues that affect young people and to develop evidence-based resources to support that work.  The health programme works with practitioners across the youth sector to build knowledge, skills and expertise on a range of health areas, including health promotion, mental health and sexual health.  This work is achieved through the development of a range of training and policy programmes.</p> <p>  Specifically with regard to sexual health and relationships, the national youth health programme provides training to youth workers within organisations and aims to strengthen the organisational environment for the delivery of sexual health programmes.  The b4udecide training course is offered in conjunction with the HSE crisis pregnancy programme, and training and accompanying resources explore the concept of delaying early sexual activity among young people.  A follow-on course for youth workers to the b4udecide training, entitled "Developing a Sexual Health Policy &ndash; Good Practice in Sexual Health Promotion", aims to strengthen the organisational environment for the delivery of sexual health programmes.</p> <p>  The Department is committed to delivering on both the commitments of the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures policy framework and those of the national youth strategy as they relate to prioritising the sexual health and well-being of children and young people.  The funding provided by the Department, in conjunction with that provided by the Departments of Education and Skills and Health and the Health Service Executive supports young people around relationships and sexuality and provides access to timely and appropriate information. </p> <p>  If members have any questions, I can provide more detail or other information they may want.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.267" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamonn Moran" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#Q00400"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to make this opening statement.  The Department of Education and Skills welcomes the opportunity to address the ancillary recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly relating to sexual health and relationship education, which states "Improvements should be made in sexual health and relationship education, including the areas of contraception and consent, in primary and post-primary schools, colleges, youth clubs and other organisations involved in education and interactions with young people."</p><p>The Department has already provided a written submission to the committee which sets out the current provision of sexual health and relationship education in the primary, post-primary and higher-education sectors.  I propose, therefore, to make a short opening statement, although, along with my colleagues, I will be happy to engage with the committee during the subsequent discussion and address any of the items identified in either the opening statement or in our written submission.  The statement is organised in two parts: first, I will set out what is required of schools in the context of sexual health and relationship education, and how the Department supports schools to meet that requirement; and, second, I will describe briefly our monitoring of compliance, the outcomes of that monitoring and recent initiatives which can help and improve the quality of provision.</p><p> I will begin by outlining what we require schools to do.  Access to sexual and health education is an important right for students.  Schools have a responsibility to provide for this, importantly, in consultation with parents and having regard to the ethos of the school.  Social, personal and health education, SPHE, is a mandatory curriculum subject in all primary schools and in post-primary up to the end of the junior cycle.  Relationships and sexuality education, RSE, is required at all levels, from primary to senior cycle.  The Department has set out the content for each of these programmes in SPHE and RSE syllabuses and guidelines, as well as in other support material.</p><p> The primary level SPHE curriculum currently used in schools was published in 1999.  Its purpose is to foster the personal development, health and well-being of the individual child, to help him or her create and maintain supportive relationships and to enable children make safe and healthy decisions now and in the future.  At post-primary level, the SPHE curriculum framework for junior cycle was published in 2000.  It provides students with the opportunity to develop the skills and competence to take care of themselves and others and to make informed decisions about their health, personal lives and social development.</p><p> RSE is not taught as a distinct programme or subject in primary schools or in junior cycle.  Instead, it forms an integral part of the SPHE curriculum at both levels.  At senior cycle, a school&rsquo;s RSE programme may be taught as a distinct programme or delivered in the context of an SPHE programme or another subject, such as religious education, biology, science or home economics.  Primary schools are also required to fully implement the Stay Safe programme, which addresses physical, emotional and sexual abuse.  It aims to increase resilience by giving children knowledge, skills and strategies in an age-appropriate manner, which is an important precursor to understanding the concept of consent in an adult sexual relationship when they get older.</p><p> All schools are required to have an RSE policy that is developed in consultation with the school community, including management, parents, teachers and students, as appropriate.  A school&rsquo;s programme for relationship and sexuality education is developed and taught in the context of its RSE policy.  It is important to note that the ethos of a school should never preclude learners from acquiring the knowledge about the issues, but ethos may influence how that content is treated.</p><p> Contraception or issues relating to consent are not explicitly mentioned in the primary SPHE curriculum or in the RSE programme.  The focus is on developing assertive skills, personal self-efficacy and an understanding how one&rsquo;s body works.  This lays the foundation for later discussion of specific issues in a manner appropriate to the developmental stage of the pupils.  At post-primary level, schools are required to teach all aspects of the RSE programme, including family planning, sexually transmitted infections and sexual orientation.  Elements of the programme cannot be omitted on the grounds of school ethos.  However, all aspects of the programme can and should be taught within the ethos and value system of a school as expressed in its written RSE policy.</p><p> It should be noted that, under legislation, the higher-education institutions are autonomous bodies and the Department does not prescribe a programme in RSE at this level.  The majority of higher-education institutions provide students with information on sexual health and additional links to further information and support on relationships, sexual education and mental health issues.  Information is provided by both the institutions&rsquo; student&rsquo;s unions and student services medical centres.  Several higher-education institutions also provide classes in sexual consent, giving students the opportunity to talk about positive forms of sexual communication.</p><p> I will now discuss the ways in which the Department supports schools in meeting their requirements in respect of RSE and SPHE.  A range of actions have been taken by the Department to support the implementation of SPHE and RSE.  The Department has published policy guidelines for relationships and sexuality education to support schools in developing RSE policy.  These provide clear guidance on engaging with the school community and on sharing the school&rsquo;s policy on RSE, recognising that a partnership approach to RSE helps to ensure that children are provided with a consistent experience and are able to make connections between life at home, in the school and in the community.  This is considered to be a very important requirement.  Sample templates for RSE policies are provided for schools to consider when drafting their own policies.</p><p> An RSE support service and a separate SPHE support service are available to schools.  An extensive programme of continuing professional development, CPD, opportunities has been provided to support teachers in the implementation of RSE and SPHE programmes in post-primary schools.  Over several years, the Department and the support services have also developed a wide range of teaching materials, particularly in the area of RSE.  This work has been done in partnership with other Departments and agencies, including the HSE, the Gay and Lesbian Education Network, GLEN, and the crisis pregnancy programme.  It should be noted that schools have discretion regarding the resources that they use to teach SPHE and RSE, and that these are used in accordance with the school&rsquo;s policy.</p><p> I will now move on to the second part of the statement, which addresses the ways that the Department monitors compliance in this area.  It is the responsibility of a school's board of management to ensure that RSE is taught in the school.  The inspectorate conducts robust quality assurance of provision in SPHE and RSE through its programme of inspection in schools.  Inspectors ensure: that the school timetable includes time for SPHE and RSE; that the RSE policy has been developed; that broad and balanced coverage of the SPHE and RSE curriculum is evident in school planning; and, in focused evaluations of SPHE and RSE lessons, that students are achieving the intended outcomes of the curriculum.  During all whole-school evaluations, school management is required to confirm that the full Stay Safe programme, SPHE curriculum and RSE are being provided.  Where there is evidence that provision is unsatisfactory, recommendations for improvement are made.  In those cases where there is no or inadequate implementation of the SPHE and RSE curriculum, the inspectorate conducts a range of follow-through actions until such time as the relevant school is regarded as being compliant with the requirements in this area.</p><p> Through the monitoring of compliance, we have found that, in general, schools are positively disposed to providing good quality SPHE and RSE, and we have noted the prevalence of a positive classroom and whole-school atmosphere.  Systematic engagement by school managers and teachers with SPHE and RSE continuous development activities has been shown to have a positive impact on the quality of programme delivery.  However, there are some challenges to achieving high quality in that provision which are common across primary and post-primary levels.  In some schools, the development of an RSE policy has not been achieved and there is insufficient engagement with parents on the policy and programme in the school.  However, as was mentioned in the written submission to the committee, our lifeskills survey indicates that almost all schools actually have written RSE policies in place and the remainder are in the process of developing these.  Furthermore, we know that there are issues relating to the competence and confidence of teachers regarding the delivery of RSE.</p><p> I will now outline recent initiatives which will support high-quality provision of services in this area.  The Department is developing a policy on well-being which will be published in early 2018.  The policy, which will cover both primary and post-primary schools, will set out a number of actions which will enhance the physical, mental, emotional and social well-being of students and enable them to build life skills.</p><p>The policy will include actions to support schools and teachers to deliver high-quality learning experiences so that students acquire an appropriate knowledge and understanding of human relationships and sexuality. </p><p> Another important development is the introduction of a new area of learning called Wellbeing, and I apologise for the confusing terminology due to the use of a capital "W", which is part of the new framework for junior cycle.  Social, personal and health education, SPHE, and relationships and sexuality education, RSE, are integral parts of the new Wellbeing programme at junior cycle.  They provide opportunities for teaching and learning directly related to well-being, not least the capacity to develop and maintain healthy relationships.  Wellbeing guidelines developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, have been published and training has already commenced for school leaders to assist them in developing a well-being programme.  It is important to emphasise that the Wellbeing programme is a whole-of-school programme and is not just for specific individual teachers.</p><p> It is envisaged that the SPHE curriculum, including RSE, at primary level will undergo a review by the NCCA in the coming years, as part of its ongoing review of all the curriculum areas, with which the committee members will doubtless be familiar.  A review of the curriculum at senior cycle is also under way, again led by the NCCA.  The SPHE and RSE programmes at that level will be considered.</p><p> These reviews will include the views of all the education partners, recent research outcomes, societal and cultural changes and all the relevant polices and teaching materials that have been disseminated to schools since the SPHE and RSE curricula were first introduced, including material produced by entities other than our own Department, including our colleagues in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the HSE and other partners that operate in this area.  It is not possible to determine exactly what the review will conclude in terms of curriculum content.  The process will be very comprehensive and all views and suggestions will be considered.</p><p> I thank the Chairperson for the opportunity to make an opening statement.  My colleagues and I look forward to our discussions.</p></speech>

That is a good thing but we have a little further to go.  I listened to the presentations and I was startled to learn that sometimes RSE takes place during religion classes.  I wish to refer to a newspaper article that was published in 2014 where it was highlighted that schools used external agencies.  As Mr. Moran mentioned, not all teachers are skilled enough to teach these classes.  Does the Department have oversight in cases where external agencies are used?  Is it left to the board of management to provide oversight?  I ask because when I attended school there were organisations that would have been more comfortable teaching RSE such as Pure in Heart Ireland.  Do some schools still use textbooks that exclusively focus on heterosexual relationships or abstinence from sex until marriage?</p> <p>  I am curious about the external agencies.  Is there a register and regulations for external agencies?  We have had discussions at this committee and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health about rogue agencies offering women counselling, a term I use advisedly.  Can the use of external agencies be regulated?  Is it simply a matter for the boards of management to decide? </p> <p>  Ms McGovern mentioned that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs allocated &euro;86,952 to the National Youth Council of Ireland to support the implementation of the national youth health programme.  To me, that sounds like an astonishingly small amount of money and is a loaves and fishes job.  Will she give us a breakdown of the budget and outline what could be done if more money were allocated?</p></speech>

I will answer one of her questions and another question is for my colleague in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p> <p>  I mentioned in my opening statement that the RSE may be taught as a distinct programme or delivered in the context of an SPHE programme or in another subject.  I also gave examples, including religious education.  There is a requirement that all schools ensure that all students get the RSE programme, unless parents have requested that their children do not receive an  element of the programme.  There is a requirement in junior cycle to have a minimum number of RSE classes per week and to have between five and six classes per year in senior cycle.  The schools will be required to ensure that all of their pupils receive RSE.</p></speech>

I am sure that it contains standardised elements.  Can the RSE course be tweaked to suit the ethos of an individual school?  There may be people teaching abstinence until marriage.  That might conform with the ethos of the school but I cannot imagine it will confirm with what is contained in the programme.  I am referring to the grey area where a board of management may have stepped in and taken control.  Is there a standardised form of RSE?  Is there a mechanism by which there is a contradiction between the ethos of a school and what represents good practice?  I refer to cases where good practice takes precedence over the ethos of the school.</p></speech>

Elements of the programme cover the issues of contraception and consent.  As I said in my presentation:</p><blockquote>Elements of the programme cannot be omitted on the grounds of school ethos.  However, all aspects of the programme can and should be taught within the ethos and value system of a school.</blockquote> <p>For example, schools are required to teach the elements of the programme that relate to contraception.  However, the schools, depending on their ethos might say, for example, in the context of the Catholic Church, we have a particular view on contraception.  It is important for me to point out that there is a requirement for all elements of the programme to be delivered in the schools.<br/><br/>The Deputy mentioned external agencies so I ask my colleague, Ms Egan, to answer her questions.</p></speech>

We promote that the teaching of all elements of RSE and SPHE take place within the context of a policy that is determined at school level.  We provide very clear guidance on how that policy should be developed.  It should be a collaborative process between all members of the school community - the board of management, the parents, the teachers and the students, depending on their age.  That policy should explore all of the issues associated with the teaching of RSE in the schools.</p> <p>  Where an outside speaker is engaged by a school, he or she should be engaged in the context of delivering a planned and comprehensive programme in the school.</p><p>He or she should not be brought in to replace the school programme but to enhance it.  It is the responsibility of the school to ensure that outside speakers are aware of the school policy on RSE and child protection and their input should be delivered in that context.  No rogue organisation at variance with a school's policy should deliver a programme in the school.  We recommend and provide guidance that the class teacher should always be present in the class in order that he or she is aware of what is being delivered and will know if any aspect of school policy has been breached and needs to be addressed.  We advise that material used by outside speakers should be checked in advance to ensure that it is in line with school policy and should be available to parents.  Parents should be informed if an external speaker is engaged.  Programmes delivered by visitors or external agencies must use appropriate evidence-based methodologies with clear educational outcomes.  We have provided very clear guidance to schools on how to use external agencies.</p></speech>

There is no list of approved third parties or agencies.

However, in the curriculum and assessment policy section we receive queries from schools regarding offers made by various agencies to deliver various elements of the curriculum and not just those relating to RSE and SPHE.  There are so many such agencies that the Department is not logistically able to endorse or check all of their offerings.  However, we counsel schools to make inquiries with such agencies as to the quality and nature of the product they propose to deliver and also to establish whether other schools have engaged with the agencies.  As I mentioned briefly in my opening statement, a school's written RSE policy is developed in conjunction with school leadership, teachers, parents, students and the wider school community.  There is a very extensive engagement by the school system in respect of setting out the RSE policy and that level of broad expertise is also brought to bear in determining the nature of the programme to be delivered and the policy regarding the engagement of external entities.</p></speech>

Through that spine funding, the health programme then accesses additional funding from a range of agencies.  The total budget for the health programme is, therefore, far more substantial than the contributions of the Department and the HSE.  Additional funding in respect of sexual health is provided by the crisis pregnancy programme and by the National Office for Suicide Prevention in respect of mental health.

As regards policy, when the witnesses from the curriculum unit are designing guidelines for education for young people, such as in respect of sex and reproductive health education - the areas of particular interest for the committee - do they consider models from other countries, particularly those in Europe?  Can they comment on evidence presented last week to the committee regarding sexual education recently being made compulsory from the age of ten in the Netherlands?  A corollary of that was a reduction of one third in teenage pregnancies between 2012, when it was made compulsory, and 2016.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.</p> <p>  My other question is similar to that of Deputy O'Reilly regarding the use of outside agencies.  Senator Ruane was feeling unwell and went home.  Her daughter attends a school in Tallaght in which sex education is delivered by an outside agency named Accord, which is affiliated to the Catholic church.  Senator Ruane has removed her daughter from that class because she has serious issues with that agency and its affiliation.  The Department's proposals repeatedly state that the ethos of a school may be taken into consideration.  The ethos of school is very much a framework for how this is delivered.  The ethos of the school has to be managed within the school framework, involving all agencies, including the board of management.  Some 94% of  boards of management of national schools in this country contain leading local members of the Catholic church or are controlled by the Catholic church.  Do the witnesses consider there to be an obstacle to progressing the process of dealing with teenage pregnancy and sex education in order to prevent as many crisis pregnancies and to get on with the business of educating a future generation in a full and wholesome way about reproductive health and helping them to live their lives in a way that prevents the outcomes of crisis pregnancies such as, for example, the increased use of the abortion pill?  Do the witnesses think that it would be of assistance to remove the framework of Catholic ethos from national schools?  I am not suggesting that the church should be moved to Mars or some such place but, rather, that the ethos of Catholicism should be removed from the delivery of sexual health programmes in schools.  The latter might have long-term positive outcomes, particularly for young girls.</p></speech>

I will take the question on the process of developing guidelines and Ms Egan will address the query regarding external agencies and ethos.  As regards guidelines, I do not know the full details of the Dutch experience of making sex education compulsory.  However, as members are aware, in making policy decisions on curriculum content, the Department is advised in the first instance by the NCCA.  A very significant element of the policy development process of the NCCA is a consultative process engaging with all the players in the field, including students, parents, educators, school leaders and other agencies active in the particular curriculum area, including teachers' professional bodies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.286" nospeaker="true" time="13:30:00" ><p>I am aware from the work we are doing with the NCCA relating to the revision of the primary language curriculum and the senior cycle curriculum that it also has extensive engagement in carrying out international research and seeking to identify best practice in Europe and elsewhere.  For example, with regard to the current review of the senior cycle curriculum, which would include a review of SPHE and RSE, the first part of that work has been a research phase examining the curriculum provision in approximately a dozen countries, both in Europe and further afield, to identify what does and does not work in those areas.  It is important to point out that what works in one country does not automatically work in another and the particular circumstances of the country must be taken into account.  The policy advice that is received by the Minister and the Department from the NCCA would have been through a very extensive consultation process and would be informed by the views of all the players in a particular area.</p><p>On the distinction between the programme of SPHE and RSE that is delivered in schools and the issue of the Catholic ethos, as I said in the opening statement and in response to the first question from Deputy O'Reilly, all schools are required to deliver the SPHE and RSE programme.  The Department and the inspectorate would be concerned if, when the inspectorate visits schools, the programme is not being delivered.  My inspector colleagues can comment further on that, but the feedback from the inspectorate's visits to schools is that the programme is being delivered in full.  There are some cases where the RSE policy needs to be finalised but the programme is delivered in full.  That is an important point.</p></speech>

They are facilitated to run their schools in accordance with their ethos.  That is enshrined in legislation.  In implementing an RSE programme in schools we are very clear that the schools must implement the programme that is laid out.  They must cover the themes outlined for primary and post-primary levels.  We clearly state that ethos cannot be used as an argument for omitting elements of the programme.</p> <p>  We expect that a school will deliver a programme using a variety of materials and resources and possibly external agencies.  However, we would not expect that an external agency would take over the delivery of the programme in a school.  RSE is not taught only during a class in curriculum time.  The values inherent in an RSE programme, which is about developing children's understanding of good and healthy relationships, are something the children would also experience through the way in which the school is organised.  RSE takes place in curriculum time but the climate and culture of the school also support it.  As the ethos of schools can differ the schools are enabled to take account of their ethos in how the RSE programme is delivered, but they must first ensure that they cover the content and do not leave out areas of knowledge.  They may follow up with how that might be considered in the context of the particular ethos of the school but they must teach what is in the framework curriculum.</p></speech>

I am convinced that education in this area has come a long way since I was in school.  I recall my sex education class really consisting of one word, "No".</p> <p>  That said, I see a contradiction in the idea that the Department will roll out this quite progressive education programme and at same time say that it can be taught within a particular ethos.  We know what the problem is - the vast majority of our schools are still under Catholic control.  That means young people are being told they can do something, but then they are immediately told that it is wrong.  That is not the Department's fault but it is a glaring problem that we as elected representatives must deal with.  Would the witnesses accept that, in reality, people are getting different types of education depending on the type of school they attend?  Notwithstanding the fact that this set information must be given, the context is everything.  That is a real concern.</p> <p>  I have some other questions, although I am conscious of having only six minutes.</p></speech>

Younger colleagues of mine were genuinely interested in this paper.  Some of them only finished school a few years ago and they say, "Look, it sounds great but we never got it".  Will the witnesses comment on that?  Has there been a significant take-up in the last number of years?  The people I am referring to would have finished school at some time between 2006 and 2012.  They say that they never saw it.</p> <p>  With regard to the review being conducted, the witness said that in some schools the development of RSE policy has not been achieved.  Are there any indicators or commonalities in that regard?  Is it related to the size of the schools, the ethos of the schools or the location of the schools?  Are there any commonalities such as that?</p> <p>  The well-being programme sounds like a good idea.  How quickly can that be rolled out and does the Department have the resources it needs to roll it out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.298" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamonn Moran" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112900002#U01300"><p>I will start with the last question.  There are two elements to the well-being programme.  One is the newly rolled out junior cycle well-being area of learning which covers SPHE, CSPE and PE.  Some other elements could also be included.</p><p>This was rolled out to schools from September 2017 and will be reported on in the students' new junior cycle profile of achievement from June 2020.  It is an exciting new area.  Our junior cycle for teachers' continuous professional development, CPD, team has a particular well-being programme going out to schools to assist them in rolling out the programme.  We are committing significant CPD resources to ensuring that the programme is rolled out well.  I will make a point that might address one of the issues Senator Gavan has.  An underlying emphasis of the well-being programme is that well-being is a whole-of-school activity, so it is not the case that when someone goes to a school and asks where he or she can learn about well-being, he or she is told to go to the guidance counsellor or the science teacher.  The idea of the well-being programme is that it is a whole-of-school approach.  All teachers are responsible for well-being in school, so one avoids a situation whereby in a specific well-being or guidance class the student is told about one set of issues regarding well-being and then goes into another class and sees no evidence of those issues in that class.  All teachers are involved in the delivery of well-being.  Well-being with a small W, which is the programme the Minister is seeking to roll out across primary and post-primary, essentially seeks to ensure that across the whole school system well-being is taught in an integrated way.  The junior cycle framework is further down that road, but I think the Minister is keen to ensure that the lessons we have learned from the development of the junior cycle well-being programme can be spread across the whole school system.</p><p> Concerns have been expressed that as one goes into senior cycle and the leaving certificate heaves into view, the time spent on such areas decreases.  Junior cycle teachers and those involved in delivering the well-being programme are typically also teachers at senior cycle level.  Pending the delivery of the well-being programme for the whole school system, we know that the roll-out of the well-being programme in junior cycle will also assist in ensuring that well-being is embodied at senior cycle.  Senator Gavan made the point about students saying they never received this education.  I have spoken about this only within the past two days to my own two daughters, who are in their 20s now.  They went to the same school.  One said they never got it and the other said they got it in spades.  I would make two points in this regard.  First, it could be the case that different teachers might choose to deliver the SPHE and RSE programmes in different ways.  In addition, depending on the ages or level of maturity of the individual students, they can receive this learning in different ways.  It might only hit home with them at a later stage.</p><p> This brings me to another point I will make before I hand over to my colleague, Ms Egan, for any comments she may have.  I made a point in the opening statement about age-appropriateness.  We are asked why we do not teach primary school children about contraception and why we do not catch this at the very start of the schooling system.  In developing the programmes for SPHE and RSE, the Department is guided by the requirement to ensure that this programme provision is delivered in an age-appropriate manner.  We need to be careful that we do not hit students with something they are too young to understand and that they do not go away more confused about information we try to provide to them than before.  Therefore, while some observers might consider that we should be teaching this in a more direct way at an earlier stage, there is a balance to be found between getting children at a young stage and confusing them with issues.</p><p> This brings me to the final point I will make on this issue.  We have made the point very strongly that the provision particularly of SPHE and RSE is a partnership between the school and the parents.  It should be remembered that the schoolteacher is delivering a programme to perhaps 15 or 20 pupils in a class and therefore needs to pitch the delivery of the programme at a certain level.  As a parent of a child, I may have been involved with the school in developing in some cases the RSE policy.  When I go to the school to determine whether I will put my child into the school, I will have been given sight of that school's RSE policy so I can decide whether the approach and the ethos underlying the provision of that policy is consistent with my expectations.  Furthermore, when I see the layout of the programme and how it is proposed to be taught in the school, I can also decide from the home perspective, the parental perspective, to provide the input from the home and parental side of things to ensure that what the child is being taught in school is mirrored and tracked by what is being provided at home.  This ensures consistency of messages between both education forums, and the parent might feel his or her child is at a certain stage at which the parent can perhaps supplement in a more direct way the information being provided in the school.  I would emphasise the partnership approach between both the school and the parents regarding the provision of education in this area.</p></speech>

We also monitor implementation in schools and offer advice to schools on how to improve their provision, so our engagement with schools in that area is an ongoing process.  Yes, there is provision for school ethos to have an influence but most of the RSE programme is about helping children to develop their relationships with others, to get to know themselves and how their bodies work and to develop their self-worth and self-efficacy.  No matter the stage at which one is in a school and no matter where the school is, these elements are really good educational outcomes to try to achieve.</p></speech>

I am very concerned about some of the evidence I have heard today, and many of the previous speakers have spoken well about it.  I am concerned that it is down to the ethos of the school to frame sex education.  Mr. Moran spoke about age-appropriate education.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith spoke about the Dutch system.  In Holland this education starts at four, when children discuss their bodies.  It moves on to respect and attraction at seven and same-sex attraction between eight and nine years of age.  Between ten and 11 years of age they speak about changes during puberty, love, dating and men and women in the media.  They deal with this in Holland from four years of age.  It is not standardised across the Netherlands but it is exceptionally comprehensive.  According to the Catholic ethos when it comes to contraception, condoms are still not allowed as a means of birth control under Catholic teaching.  I am concerned that the rhythm method or the withdrawal method or abstinence is being taught to children in this State.  My understanding is that 90% of schools in this country are under the Catholic ethos, so I am not sure how we square that circle.  I think Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's final question to Ms Egan was whether she was happy with our sex education in this country.  She never actually said she was.  It is very clear to me that we have serious issues here when it comes to sex education under the Catholic ethos.  I know the bishop withdrew his comments but a cleric in this country recently spoke about teenagers engaging in pure and chaste lives.  I am not sure what sort of teenagers he is dealing with but his comments concerned the HPV vaccine and a rather ignorant link between it and sexual activity.</p><p>Has the Department done any work on the promotion of the HPV vaccine, which can eradicate cancer?  I am concerned about how all these things feed into educating our children and about this opposing view.  If the Catholic Church does not teach that barrier contraceptives are a good thing, and if HPV vaccination is not promoted very well, I would be very concerned about how we are delivering sex education.  Various states in the US have different approaches to sex education.  The basic statistics show that in states where sex education focuses on abstinence there is a higher rate of teenage pregnancies than in states where there is a more comprehensive approach.  In New Mexico, where abstinence is taught, there are 90 teenage pregnancies per 1,000 teenagers aged 15 to 19, whereas in New Hampshire, where the education regime is not based on abstinence, the rate is 30 per 1,000.  All of this feeds into the question of whether sex education in this country is fit for purpose.  I believe that if it is being influenced by the ethos of the school to this degree, we cannot sit here today and say it is working.  Somebody answered that there had been no complaints.  I am always concerned when there are no complaints or concerns raised about an approach to something.  </p><p> I am very concerned about what Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith mentioned about Accord being used as a sort of subcontractor in schools.  I am really concerned about what our young people are being exposed to in terms of the approach to teaching sex education.  One of the key things we learnt from the witnesses from the Netherlands who came before the committee last week was that country had destigmatised and taken a non-moralistic approach to sex education, which ultimately led to a reduction in teenage pregnancies.  It also led to Dutch teenagers tending to have their first sexual experience later in their teenage years than their European counterparts.  They generally report it as having been a positive and fun experience.  This non-moralistic approach has worked in the Netherlands.  I do not want to bring up the sexologists from last week again but this approach seems to deliver better outcomes.  I am really concerned that if we are somehow being caught by this idea of ethos then we will not be serving our young people.  Does Ms Egan think that we should have a standardised approach?  Should we forgot ethos and try to deal with our children and young people in a way which separates the moral from the medical?  Does Ms Egan have any concerns in light of what we have heard about the current system today and in light of everyone's questions and answers in that regard?</p></speech>

We do.  We have a curriculum which we expect to be delivered across the board from junior infants right up to leaving certificate.  There is a standardised approach.

We have a system, however, which allows the ethos of the school to influence what happens in a school.</p></speech>

The programme fully facilitates that.  It is a fact within our system that ethos will influence how the programme will be taught in a given school.  In drawing up the policy on RSE at the level of the individual school, there is plenty of scope for all views within the school community to be thrashed out and for decisions to be made on how a particular issue is to be dealt with.</p></speech>

It might appear facetious, but I do not mean it to be.  When I was in school I was shown a video by the nuns.  I would like to think that we have moved on from that.

Commencing in junior infants, the children learn through a number of strand units.  The children are taught certain themes, vocabulary and language relevant to this discussion on a spiral basis, year after year, every week.  The programme runs across themes such as "Taking care of my body", "Growing and changing", "Safety and protection", "Making decisions", "Myself and my family", "My friends and other people", and "Relating to others".  It is a foundational approach.  It sets the foundation for themes and topics which the children will explore at a more advanced level in an age-appropriate manner as needs arise.  We also have to ensure that what the children are learning is relevant to the stage of life they are at.  At certain stages it will be very important for them to understand that their bodies are changing, for example, puberty is explored at the senior level of primary school.  That is the learning they need at that time and it is age-appropriate to them.</p></speech>

What I have just described is from the SPHE curriculum framework, which is the mandatory framework at all levels in primary school.  Those themes are always explored.  In the context of RSE, the RSE policy determines certain topics, which will also be delivered.  That is where there is a lot of consultation with parents.  We are satisfied that parents are getting involved in drawing up the policy.  Of course, we would like to encourage further involvement because we know that the joint approach is most effective.</p></speech>

It is a challenging area for schools.  Alongside the mandatory SPHE curriculum which runs from infants to sixth class and then up to junior cycle, there is also the Stay Safe programme at primary level.  That has been a mandatory programme since 2011.  It is specific to the prevention of child abuse.  It covers certain topics such as "Feeling Safe and Unsafe", "Friendship and Bullying", "Touches", "Secrets and Telling" and "Strangers".  All of these topics are addressed in an age-appropriate manner in a way which is relevant to the children and which will not frighten them.  Again it lays the groundwork for looking at consent at a later stage but it also looks at understanding appropriate boundaries and touches and builds the children's confidence to tell and to say "no".  All of those issues are dealt with through the mandatory Stay Safe programme, which runs from infants to sixth class.</p></speech>

We have had a lot of experts in here to discuss the Citizens' Assembly recommendations.  Practically all referred to the need for enhanced sexual education as a way of addressing and reducing crisis pregnancies.  Children do a lot online and many nearly live online, which is regrettable.  Most are on social media.  It is an evolving medium and something that children are nearly ahead of us on.  Is that something that the witnesses are considering in their policies?</p></speech>

There is school autonomy and a requirement for schools to respond to the needs of their children as manifested in the school context itself.  Those supports are there.  Alongside that, there is a good level of CPD provided which will inform schools about the different resources and guide them as they determine what specific issues need to be addressed with their pupils.</p></speech>

I am conscious of that.  I do have a particular interest in this subject because I have put down numerous parliamentary questions on the subject, as some of our guests will know.  We have had information that children did not seem to have a proper sex education in school.  That is a bland statement that may be right or it may be wrong.  I got an email or text from somebody, and we have to take these things as they are, to the effect that a 14 year old child who had been raped did not do anything about it, did not know what the consequences were and did not have a conversation with her parents.  The parents need to be involved in the programme of sex education in schools as well.  The Well-Being programme is welcome.  It needs to be comprehensive.  It needs to identify all the potential threats to the child.  The child needs to be protected.  We have had enough incidents in this country over the past number of years, and in many other countries, where there is "trafficking", for want of a better description.  The grooming of children is quite evident and is a serious threat to their well-being.</p> <p>  The next part is how to get the information to children.  I see nothing wrong with the system as the witnesses present it, as long as it gets to children and their parents.  If it does not get to parents as well, then it is a waste of time.  The child will go home from school and ask the parents, who may not be receptive to adding to it.  It should include parents.  We are a multicultural society now so the ethos is not as important as it was.  However, it is important that we get the message across to parents regardless of background and ethos.  We need to put special emphasis on that.</p> <p>  I got a shock a couple of years ago when I put down a question in relation to children who were bullied in school and abused through the Internet and social media.  It is horrific.  Particularly horrific is the number of children who self-harmed or attempted self-harm as a result of that kind of activity in their schools.  There were repeated attempts at self-harm which meant that the abuse was still going on.  I remember that the ages were between ten and 14 which is really alarming.  That cohort of children in that age group needs to be concentrated on particularly in order to identify what the threats are, whether via the Internet, social media or predators.  It is a huge issue that needs to be dealt with.  The child needs to know, boys and girls, what the threat is and if there is a threat.  That is not to create suspicion of society but to have a genuine knowledge of what is required in order for them to become balanced citizens.</p> <p>  In relation to youth services, if we can talk about this as well, I want to compliment in particular-----</p></speech>

In relation to the role of parents and the Deputy's strong view that parents must be involved, that desirability underpins our whole approach to the provision of SPHE and RSE in schools.  It relates to both the development of the RSE statement by the school and the engagement with parents.  It underpins the information provided at all stages of the curriculum regarding how parents can provide additional and complementary material as they see fit to their children.  The RSE policy in school is developed in conjunction with parents.</p> <p>  In relation to whether we are sure we are providing sex education in the proper way, the RSE policy for the school needs to set out the rationale for the provision of RSE in the school.  This must refer to the context and ethos of the school, the aims of RSE and, critically, details of how the programme will be delivered in the school.  When the RSE policy is being agreed with parents, they will be able to see how the programme will be delivered and by whom, the particular modules that will be delivered, the role of the principal, the creation of a supportive school climate and culture, the consultation process with parents, parents' associations and students, the resources for RSE, the training for RSE and how the policy will be reviewed.</p> <p>  In relation to the review issue, the schools inspectorate, as part of its whole school evaluations, examine the provision of SPHE and RSE in schools.  The inspectors report their findings and make recommendations for improvements in schools.  In schools that do not have an RSE policy in place or where part of the RSE and SPHE curriculum are not being taught, the inspectorate will make recommendations as to how they should be taught.  Follow up visits to the schools will ensure that those recommendations are implemented.</p> <p>  On bullying in schools, the Department has developed a number of anti-bullying policies.  I say a number because those policies have had to be updated to take account of the increasing use of social media and the presence on social media of nearly all of our school children.</p></speech>

The points made today by the witnesses were well made.  Much of the expertise shared with the committee on this issue indicates how important this area is.</p> <p>  The Stay Safe Programme was introduced following reports of appalling child abuse.  It came directly out of a religious ethos and a group of people who were trusted but whom it was found could not be trusted.  I accept the point on the need for programmes to be age specific but I do not think we have moved on in so far as that ethos is still getting in the way of delivery of sex education.  Delivery in this regard is very contained.  Sex education should be about not only pregnancy and disease but about inculcating positive attitudes in people.</p> <p>  The witnesses have told us that they have studied the research in other countries but that research does not matter if schools do not have the ability to deliver programmes without the interference of an ethos in that delivery.  We have an unusually high rate of religious patronage of schools.  We should be looking to the best outcomes and experiences in other countries in terms of well-rounded individuals who have a good understanding of issues, do not run with the herd and are independent.  We heard earlier that for some people sex education was a great experience and for others it was a terrible experience.  The experience was hit and miss, depending on the teacher delivering the programme.</p> <p>  In regard to sex education, a life survey undertaken by the Department of Education and Skills in 2015 found that 48% of primary and 55% of secondary schools indicated that they relied to some extent on external agencies.  The external agencies aspect is incredibly important.  There must be some degree of understanding of who those agencies are in terms of ethos.  Based on the aforementioned figures, there is a very high level of intervention.  The Department is getting very good evidence from other countries, on the basis of which the NCCA sets the curriculum, but it has no control over how this programme is delivered.  How then can the witnesses say that there is good-quality sex education?  In my view, this programme needs to be something different in many different environments such that it is not possible to say it is a uniform programme across the education system.</p></speech>

In the lifetime of the primary or post-primary school there are SPHE or RSE lessons delivered throughout each year of the programme.  In some cases, schools might value the assistance of an external agency on issues they consider to be sensitive for them to deal with.</p></speech>

Underpinning the SPHE and RSE programmes is a desire to develop children's life skills and their resilience and ability to evaluate the wide range of information and opinions coming at them all of the time.  We do this in two ways.  First, there are themes that are revisited from junior infants to leaving certificate and themes that are revisited at an age appropriate level.  Second, the types of engagement with students during RSE and SPHE lessons is an experiential learning programme where they are presented with scenarios where they can identify what the issues are and how they might be dealt with.  It is a very life-enhancing programme that has wonderful benefits for children.  There are resources available to support schools in delivering those programmes.  It is the case that a school must make decisions about the resources available to it but there are excellent resources available to enable schools deliver the curriculum in the broadest way.</p></speech>

I have found everything said today extremely good from a parent's point of view and a child's point of view.  That said, I have some concerns.  Who drafts the curriculum for science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM?  We are looking at changing how we do business in Ireland if this referendum is to be put to the people, but from an educational point of view are our young people prepared to deal with those changes?</p><p>We are talking from the two sides of our mouths.  We have policy but no implementation.  If we have implementation we can tone it up or tone it down, depending on who we are dealing with.  I need to know what is the position regarding this policy in respect of the two forms of education, social personal and health education, SPHE, and relationship and sexuality education, RSE, when it is brought into schools and who is accountable.  </p><p> I will not lecture but I have a few questions.  The witnesses have outlined how post-primary schools are required to teach all aspects of an RSE programme, including family planning, sexually transmitted infections and sexual orientations.  Schools cannot leave out any part of the programme but can teach the programme within the school's ethos and value system.  How do schools balance what may be a conflict with school ethos with delivering relationships and sexuality education programmes which fully inform young people?  Ms Egan used the word "recommends" earlier, and she can understand the question I have asked.  What happens when schools do not fully implement or provide social personal health education and relationship and sexual education?  Are there any repercussions?  Are parents and students made aware of the shortcomings?  Is there a mandatory requirement for teachers to engage in continuous professional development on the SPHE and the RSE or is the training a once off?  </p><p> It was mentioned that some third level institutions provide information around sexual communications and consent.  To what degree are the issues of healthy sexual relationships and consent a part of the post-primary curriculum?  It is a challenge for some parents and teachers to discuss relationships and sexual health with their children or students.  They themselves may not have grown up in an environment where those issues were openly discussed.  While the Chair at least had the video, some people did not even have that.  What resources are being made available to parents?</p><p> I read Ms McGovern's presentation and listened to her.  At no stage were children in care addressed.  Coming from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs I imagined it would be mentioned.  I had brought up the issue of children in care over the last number of meetings but how we engage with those children was not addressed.  They have been looking for booklets, not just on sexual education.  We need booklets for children in care.  How are we going to let them know how they can reach out for help when they are in a bad position?</p><p> The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has provided funding of &euro;89,000, but the overall budget, including the HSE and education funding, comes to over &euro;500,000.  When I divide that out over the clubs, the 1,600 youth groups, that works out at &euro;327 per grouping.  Can the witnesses explain to me how that reaches the groups?  </p></speech>

On the development of policy, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, advises the Department and the Minister on curriculum policy in schools.  We get policy advice in the form of draft curriculum specification for all of our curriculums from the NCCA, including science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, SPHE and RSE.  The NCCA represents almost all of the education partners, including parents, school leaders, schools and teachers.  The policy advice that goes to the Minister is agreed by the NCCA council.  The Minister will ultimately decide whether to approve the curriculum specification.  The same policy would apply for SPHE as for STEM subjects.  That is the process.</p> <p>  I make the point that the initial NCCA process is representative of all the players involved in this area.  Ultimately, the Minister is the person who approves policy in that area.  </p> <p>  The Deputy asked what happens if a school is not providing a particular element of the curriculum.  In this particular case she refers to SPHE and RSE.  My inspector colleagues can speak further on this as they wish, but I mentioned the inspection regime in the schools.  When inspections are performed, the inspectors will seek to ensure that SPHE and RSE curriculum is being delivered in the school as per specification.  Interestingly, the inspectorate reports have noted a number of positives in this area.  Perhaps this harks back to points made earlier by other Deputies and Senators.  There is a positive school and classroom climate for supporting the teaching of SPHE and RSE.  There is recognition now that it is a whole-school responsibility rather than the responsibility of an individual person.  Things have moved on in that area.  The schools where SPHE and RSE are more successfully implemented make more effective use of teaching methodologies and resources provided for SPHE and RSE.  </p> <p>  My colleagues from the inspectorate mentioned the curriculum resources that are developed by our professional development services by teachers, PDST, and by a number of other Departments and areas active in this field.  </p></speech>

On the other hand, in schools where an RSE policy is not in place, there is a need for the inspector to ensure that policy is put in place and is informed by the guidelines for developing an RSE policy.  In some cases it is necessary to provide clarity about what is taught at each level of the curriculum and to ensure that there is balanced learning at each level.  There is a need to ensure that in addition to having an RSE policy in place in the school, the school leadership monitors the implementation of that policy.  Having the policy and curriculum in place must be monitored by ensuring that the policy is effectively implemented.  The inspectors will have a role in the schools when they perform their visits, but it is the day-to-day role of the school leadership and the board of management which will ensure that the policy is implemented in the school.</p> <p>  The generation of home-school links, particularly when sensitive issues on the curriculum are being taught, is essential.  It is important that parents have close involvement in and are aware of what is taught in the RSE and SPHE curriculum and that they are updated during the year in order that they know at what stage of the year different aspects of that curriculum will be taught.  That is what comes out of the inspectorate regime.  </p> <p>  I will ask my colleague, Ms Amanda Geary, to speak about the post-primary area and address some of the queries raised by the Deputy. </p></speech>

It is approximately 1% or 2%.  The life skills survey in 2015 showed that 99% of primary schools have a policy or are in the process of finalising it.  In post-primary schools it is 98%.  On the 1% in primary and 2% in post-primary, the inspectorate will ensure that policy is put in place.</p></speech>

There is a requirement, under child protection, that all primary and post-primary schools must have an SPHE and a comprehensive RSE programme in place.  If the inspectorate finds that a school does not have that in place, we will draw the attention of the school to the child protection circular and guidelines and tell it that because the programmes are not in place, it is not fully compliant.</p><p>No school wants to find itself in a position where it is deemed in a published report to be non-compliant with child protection procedures and guidelines.  It is rare, as my colleague stated, that we come across a school that is not implementing a relationships and sexuality education, RSE, programme.</p><p> To come to the second question on whether the topic of consent is dealt with, we have a comprehensive programme for SPHE and RSE.  By the end of the three years of junior cycle and the two years at senor cycle, it is very clear that there is a Department expectation of where students and schools will be at in terms of the learning outcomes.  However, the school has absolute autonomy to determine when it delivers on each topic and how much time it provides to deliver on each topic.  For instance, if a school believes it is extremely important to deal with the topic of consent mid-way through first year or at the end of first or second year, that decision rests purely with the school.  It determines when and how much time it spends on any particular topic.</p><p> It was mentioned earlier that, by their nature, SPHE and RSE lessons are interactive and that the students bring their own needs to the discussion.  Frequently, there will be an SPHE plan in place, developed by the school and which follows the curriculum guidelines but it will be and is frequently adapted to match the needs of the students.  If an issue arises in a particular class group, the SPHE programme will be amended to address that need.</p></speech>

The discussion was on cyber safety but it was also to do with children not understanding the roles and responsibilities around consent.  I did not find the presentation very clear on that.  I saw it for third level students.  I would not expect to see it for primary level students but for post-primary I would need to have seen a clearer understanding around the issue of consent.  I am labouring the point on consent because for schools that have a particular ethos or boards of management that are governing it or whoever signs off on the policy, the education around consent is very important.  I want to know if that is delivered in junior or senior cycle or at what stage is it delivered.</p></speech>

To answer the Deputy's question, it can be done in junior cycle.  More often than not it is done in junior cycle.  It could be in second or in third year but the key point to make is that it is dealt with and delivered as part of the SPHE-RSE programme.</p></speech>

The interactive point Ms Geary mentioned is important and is one that has not been raised until now.  In the more informal settings the youth service would be dealing with I imagine there is much more of an opportunity for young people to talk about the complexities of the issues and decisions facing them in their personal lives.  The programmes they are delivering are probably very effective but how widespread is their reach?  I will also ask some education questions.</p></speech>

The total funding for youth sector provision in 2017, to answer Deputy Rabbitte's question partially also, is &euro;57.4 million.  The &euro;600,000 I referred to is just the National Youth Council's budget.<br/><br/>In terms of the reach, there are approximately 400 targeted projects in the country along with 1,700 youth clubs.  Broadly, that is the reach.  We recently completed a map of them and they are in every part of the country but it is important to understand that participation in the youth sector is a voluntary piece so there is no mandatory aspect of that for young people.<br/><br/>In terms of the curriculum, I do not believe it is at huge variance to what is in the education sector curriculum.  This year the curriculum content has been revised and updated built on the latest evidence base, which is a constantly evolving evidence base.  There are eight components to the curriculum that are part of the resource available to those who are working in either a professional or a voluntary capacity in any of those 400 projects or the 1,600 clubs.<br/><br/>In terms of participation in the training, and I got some data in preparation for today from my colleagues, in 2017 alone, 68 people participated in the policy training and 33 organisations.  We have 150 or 180 legal entities involved in this so in this year alone the figures are 68 and 33.  I reviewed last year's data and the figure is in the mid-70s for both training programmes.  They have an additional training programme this year in regard to pornography that they are offering of which there is some uptake.  Individual organisations send their staff or their volunteers through to the training programmes but the training programmes have been in place for a number of years.  I just got the data on the last two years for this input this evening but I could get the data for previous years if members wish.  I am confident in saying that there is provision across the country but the difference is that it is a voluntary provision for young people.<br/><br/>I will add to that so the Deputy has the full information.  In this year, for the first time, the Department has included funding for <i>SpunOut.ie</i>, which is an online youth information resource.  Through our youth information centre grant fund and our youth services grant fund, in a combination of both funds, <i>SpunOut.ie</i>will receive &euro;200,000 per annum for this year and next year in an effort to try to respond to the fact that many young people are now getting their information online.  That is a development that has taken place this year for us.</p></speech>

I want to ask a question specifically to do with qualifications.  Is there a formal accreditation and recognition for SPHE-RSE teachers?  Does every school have a designated SPHE-RSE co-ordinator?  In other words, is there that professionalism?</p> <p>  The third point is that we hear about these outside bodies coming in.  Do they have to be professionally trained?  If one is presenting a curriculum in any other subject one must be appropriately trained and educated, have had CPD or whatever.  I ask the Department about that because I believe the time has come not to allow outside groups to come in unless they are appropriately trained to deal with the delicate issues around young people's sexuality and the ability to communicate with young people.</p></speech>

In the past, our National Educational Psychological Service would have put in place substantial training programmes for teachers and they provided a foundation for much of the early implementation of SPHE and RSE in schools.</p></speech>

I already highlighted the need for this committee to address adoption as a life-saving alternative to abortion because I think this is something that has been unfairly ignored and many couples have suffered as a result.  Does the Department propose to include looking at the whole area of adoption?  Many couples need to adopt so there is a proposal to educate students on adoption.  Does the Department have any proposals for streamlining this process?</p></speech>

Agencies that operate in the adoption area would presumably be among those agencies.  We have a range of bodies that we would advise students about when we are dealing with the issue of crisis pregnancies, so in that context, adoption would certainly be considered as one of the services provided by those agencies.</p></speech>

That is nearly 20 years ago.  A lot has changed in this country in 20 years.  Not much has changed in terms of the realities of sex and all of that, but the fact is that we need to revisit that.  Perhaps it is something that needs to be gone through because primary school is the only show in town when it comes to sex education as far as I am concerned.  In respect of the time when students get to secondary school, things have changed a lot since I was that age, not that I am ancient.  That is just a statement.</p></speech>

However, it also needs to be stated, and this is particularly important in the case of SPHE and RSE,  the teaching and learning in schools are not based exclusively on the 1999 curriculum.  The 1999 curriculum sets out some fundamental underpinnings, but as both my primary and post-primary inspectorate colleagues advised, a mass of supporting material has been provided and continues to be provided.</p></speech>

What is the training with regard to sex education in the colleges when a teacher embarks on his or her training in university?  Will the witnesses expand on what they are told to teach and how to go about it?  I imagine that for many teachers, it could be a very difficult subject to broach with their students.  From a primary school perspective, it obviously needs to be age-appropriate and we understand that, but how are teachers trained with regard to teaching sex education?</p></speech>

The colleges of education have indicated that the time being allocated to specific training in SPHE-RSE has actually increased across the four-year period because of the overall time increase.  We regard that as good provision at the initial teacher education stage.  We recognise that this is a challenging area.  There is no doubt about that.  Many teachers report that it is challenging.</p><p>We are told that some 62% find this area challenging and that 12% find it very challenging and so training does not begin and end at initial teacher education stage.  It is really important that teachers receive good quality continuous professional development, CPD, throughout their careers, and this is provided.  From June 2014 to June 2017, some 3,135 teachers availed of CPD, which is a very high number for us to be able to stand over.  The seminars, which were delivered by the professional development service for teachers, PDST, focused specifically on sex education and other elements of the relationships and sexuality in education, RSE, programme from senior infants to sixth class.  It is important that schools have in place an RSE policy that is clear, implemented and monitored.  The 3,135 teachers mentioned will have benefited from that type of input very recently in their careers.</p><p> The seminars also focused on the particular methodologies for teaching RSE that we regard as being important, these being methodologies that allow for discussion with students and allow them to engage with the issues at a level that is relevant to their own lives and also generate a safe classroom environment at primary level.  A lot has happened in this space.  We have referenced a number of times the amount of resources that are available online.  These are up-to-date resources such that what students are accessing online gives them a good grounding in how to address specific issues.</p></speech>

We need to do much more work in this area.  I accept that there have been improvements but, as I said, there is much more to be done in relation to sex education and not, by the way, only for our young people, but right across the board.  We heard from medical people over the past couple of weeks about the lack of knowledge around contraception, sexually transmitted diseases, relationship awareness, pornography, and so on.  Regardless of what issue we are talking about, education is key.  As a former teacher, I am very aware that almost every issue will come back to education.  We really need to get this right in the primary school setting.  </p> <p>  In regard to the opt-in to continuous professional development, it may be ten, 15 or 20 years since teachers left training college and as such we need to be doing more around this issue.  I accept that the witnesses cannot answer on that issue today, but it is nevertheless important to make that point.</p></speech>

I invite the Minister of State to make his contribution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.427" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2017112900002#B00300"><p>The following motion was placed on the Order Paper of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and referred to the select committee:</p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approve Ireland's participation in two European Defence Agency projects &ndash; (1) Joint Procurement Arrangement for EU SatCom Market and (2) European Centre for Manual Neutralisation Capabilities, ECMAN, pursuant to section 2 of the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.</blockquote> <p>In commending the motion I will briefly outline the function of the European Defence Agency and the background to the programmes in which Ireland wishes to participate.  The European Defence Agency was established by a joint action of the Council of the European Union in 2004 &quot;to support the Member States and the Council in their effort to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European Security and Defence Policy as it stands now and develops in the future&quot;.  On 6 July 2004 the Government approved Ireland's participation in the framework of the agency.</p><p>The European Defence Agency is an agency of the European Union and composed of the Defence Ministers of the 27 participating member states and the European Commission.  Ireland participates in the framework of the agency and contributes in the region of &euro;400,000 to the annual cost of running it, including the cost of its annual work programme.  The agency is focused on assisting member states in capability development, obtaining better value for existing spending levels, improving competitiveness and securing greater efficiency, particularly in the areas of research, technology and procurement of defence capabilities.</p><p>The primary reason for Ireland's participation in the European Defence Agency is to support the development of Defence Forces capabilities for peacekeeping and international crisis management operations.  The Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 regulates Ireland's participation in the agency's <i>ad hoc</i>projects.  It prescribes that participation in category A projects, category B projects or programmes is subject to Government and D&aacute;il approval.  A category A project is where all member states join, unless they specifically opt out, while a category B project is where two or more member states come together to pursue a particular initiative.</p><p>I will now give a brief outline of Ireland's involvement in EDA projects to date.  Following Government and D&aacute;il approval, Ireland has participated or is participating in the following areas: a programme on force protection that involved measures to protect military forces engaged in operational activities; a programme related to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear protection; projects in the area of maritime surveillance and networking; a project focused on counter improvised explosive devices manual neutralisation techniques; and a project concerning co-operation on cyber-ranges in the European Union, the aim of which is to maintain and improve cyber-resilience, in addition to the levels of awareness, insight and expertise of member states' personnel.</p><p>The proposal brought forward by me today is to seek approval for Ireland to participate in two EDA projects - one in the area of satellite communications and the other in the area of manual neutralisation capabilities.</p><p>With regard to the joint procurement arrangement for the EU SatCom market, the aim is to provide commercially available satellite communications &ndash; fixed and mobile &ndash; in addition to related services through the establishment of one or more framework agreements on behalf of the contributing members, to promote ease of access and improve efficiency.  Access to the SatCom procurement project is open to the European Defence Agency's participating member states, EU entities and certain third parties.</p><p>The provision of strategic satellite services is an essential prerequisite for the major deployment of troops overseas and in support of other major operations.  It is vital that the Defence Forces maintain appropriate systems and procedures for the provision of strategic satellite services efficiently and potentially at short notice.  The project represents an opportunity to procure satellite services in an efficient, cost-effective and timely manner through the achievement of potential economies of scale with pooled demand across EU member states and institutions.</p><p>Satellite services play a critical role in enabling the Defence Forces to access reliable communications services anywhere and at any time.  When deployed on operations overseas, the Defence Forces utilise strategic satellite services as their primary system for providing communication links both in the field and back to Defence Forces headquarters.  In that regard, I refer to satellite communications supports location and GPS services in battlefield systems; Defence Forces command and control systems; desk to desk dialling; video conferencing; Defence Forces Intranet access; access to strategic applications, including Defence Forces personnel and inventory management systems; and access to welfare support services such as Internet access and home phone facilities for personnel.  The primary communications channel to Naval Service vessels on operational deployments is also via satellite which also supports its maritime surveillance systems.</p><p>In addition to the potential cost savings, participation in the project would provide the Defence Forces with security of supply and backup in the event of any failure on the part of the current supplier or an urgent operational requirement that cannot be met under the current contract.</p><p>I will now give some detail on the second EDA project.  The ECMAN category B project is a follow-on activity of the European Defence Agency's category B programme on manual neutralisation techniques, MNT, courses and exercise programmes.  Ireland's participation in the programme was approved in 2013 and the project will finish in 2018.  The aim of the follow-on project is to continue to develop manual neutralisation capabilities to the highest standards so as to retain capacity in dealing with improvised explosive devices, IEDs, when it is not possible to destroy or disrupt a device through other means.  The follow-on project will provide personnel with access to a training system designed to continuously update and improve the safety of explosive ordnance disposal personnel operating in an extreme environment.  It also enables those already qualified in manual neutralisation techniques courses and exercise programmes through previous participation to maintain skill levels through an efficient re-licensing arrangement linked with refresher courses.  Officers trained in manual neutralisation techniques enable the ordnance corps to guarantee continuous support for the explosive ordnance disposal and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear improvised device disposal teams.  Participation in the programme will deliver the essential number of personnel to meet requirements over time.  This capability is highly specialised and unavailable elsewhere owing to its highly sensitive and classified nature and mainly developed as part of multinational framework arrangements.</p><p>Manual neutralisation capability is required in situations where the operational environment determines that the risk of causing a device to detonate &ndash; for example, a controlled explosion &ndash; is unacceptable.  In addition, recovering devices intact can have a profound effect on investigations where even the smallest piece of evidence such as DNA on a piece of adhesive tape inside an improvised explosive device or the use of particular components can help to identify the perpetrator or terrorist group involved.  Explosive disruptors are no longer the weapon of choice in such incidents.  Manual neutralisation techniques training is also important when dealing with <font color="#2F2F2F">chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence</font>type incidents such as those using ricin and other white powder events.</p><p>On the financial aspects, there are no costs to the Exchequer arising from participation in the EU SatCom market project.  Costs will arise only if the service is availed of on a pay-per-use basis.</p><p> In respect of the second project, the European Centre for Manual Neutralisation Capabilities, ECMAN, the cost to the Exchequer for Ireland's participation is &euro;75,000 per year for each of the six years of the programme - a total of &euro;450,000 over the lifetime of the project.  The costs will be met from within existing resources.</p><p> In conclusion, Ireland's participation in the European Defence Agency affords us the opportunity to keep abreast of best practice and new developments in the defence environment, particularly as it impacts on multinational crisis management operations.  The Government's White Paper on Defence published in August 2015 states that Ireland will identify opportunities to participate "in multi-national capability development projects within the framework of the EDA in support of the Defence Forces' operations, capacity and capability."  The two projects discussed today are prime examples of how the Defence Forces can develop their capabilities in satellite communications and in manual neutralisation capabilities.  I commend the motion to the committee.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.430" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2017112900002#C00300"><p>These two measures look relatively benign and in the Minister of State's conclusion, the argument seems to be to ask who would deny our Defence Forces the opportunity to keep abreast of best practice and new developments.  However, the point is that there are considerations and concerns that we are increasingly moving towards being part of a greater EU militarisation policy.  There is no doubt that this will threaten our neutrality and the good standing in which our peacekeeping missions are held.  I will take the example of Operation Sophia.  We were respected because of the humanitarian work being done by the Naval Service on the migration crisis in the Mediterranean.  Suddenly, we agreed to become part of this big EU naval mission, which I believe is totally discredited now because what has happened is those people who were taken in by this navy and brought to these detention centres having been mistreated by some elements of the Libyan coastguard and other boats in the area.  We just had an informal meeting with one of the leading NGOs.  The figures given regarding the rape of women and men in these detention centres were staggering and frightening.  While these two measures look relatively benign, we cannot help but ask whether they are the first steps in a much bigger campaign and movement that will really endanger our neutrality and place us in a very vulnerable situation.  In respect of the Minister of State's comment about how it impacts multinational crisis management operations, who defines the crisis and how do we come to an agreement regarding what is a crisis of which we want to be a part?</p></speech>

I would like to follow on from what Deputy O'Sullivan has said.  I say this because of my respect for the Defence Forces and the work they have done over the years and as a former Minister for Defence.  We must be extremely careful here.  There is a constant need for attention which worries me that we are not being dragged into something that was never really our remit and that it would affect the great work we do in peacekeeping and conflict prevention.  It is like what Deputy O'Sullivan said.  The humanitarian approach of the Naval Service was excellent and the manner in which it carried out its duties was superb but then the follow-on involved being dragged into something that is now putting a big question mark over it.  We must recognise that we are a neutral country.  We are a member of the EU but we are a neutral country.  As it is the one thing that has helped us in mission after mission in terms of peacekeeping and respect throughout the world, we must be extremely careful that we are not being dragged along with the others.  Let the others play more games but we should really be clear as to where we stand.</p><p>I read one of the documents with which we were supplied.  Section 2 of the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides:</p><blockquote>The Government shall not approve participation by the State in a project or programme referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i>unless it is satisfied that such participation would contribute to the enhancement of capabilities for United Nations mandated missions engaged in peace keeping, conflict prevention or the strengthening of international security in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. </blockquote> <p>That says it all for me and that is the gospel that we should follow.  We should not be dragged along because we are in the EU and want to be one of the buddies with the rest.  That is not our role.  Our Defence Forces are small but carry out unbelievable work.  I am sure the Minister of State has, like myself, visited various small involvements in different parts of the world where we had 30 or 40 officers who were key people in a big organisational operation in terms of peacekeeping.  I have been going on about this for a long time because I am deeply nervous that we are being dragged along with the rest of the boys and girls.  This is why I was very anxious that we debate this.  To be truthful, what is annoying me a bit is that this motion was put before the D&aacute;il for approval before it came here.  It should have come before us before it went to the D&aacute;il for approval.  It was passed by the D&aacute;il.  If we are going to participate-----</p></speech>

I am open to discussion and I appreciate the Minister of State and his staff are doing the best they can in terms of what the demands are but we cannot be careful enough.  It is not about being a wimp or being afraid of being with the big boys.  It is important for us, with Defence Forces that are small but which are highly skilled in certain areas.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's comments were about what can happen through being dragged into something having participated in a very worthwhile project involving our Naval Service saving lives.  One can be dragged into things without really expecting it.  Therefore, we should stick very carefully to what these Acts say.  I do not doubt the Minister of State's integrity or of that of his staff for one minute but I am just saying is that it should go out loud and clear that while we are members of the EU, when it comes to matters of defence, we have restrictions because of our neutrality and these are the guidelines.  The Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 clearly states what the Government shall not approve and, therefore, that makes it quite clear.</p></speech>

Participation in the EDA projects is not a form of common defence.  Let me state that it does not impact on Ireland's neutrality.  If anybody looks back at my record at all European meetings, whatever the debate is, they will see that the number one thing I always ask for is that our policy on neutrality is respected.</p><p>Irrespective of the nature of the project in which we are participating, I seek legal advice to ensure we are not entering a space that raises questions about neutrality.  As a former Minister for Defence, Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett will have had many opportunities to visit Irish peacekeepers stationed overseas.  Given our involvement in UNIFIL, I have no doubt he visited Lebanon on numerous occasions.  Older soldiers tell me that the threats they face nowadays are much more sophisticated than the threats they faced ten, 20 or 30 years ago.  We must keep pace with the latest technologies and participating in these projects gives us the technical expertise to enable us to carry out peacekeeping duties with the United Nations. </p><p> I attended a UN peacekeeping conference in Canada two weeks ago.  The UN demanded from all participants at the conference that they make a greater contribution to UN peacekeeping.  To do so, we must be able to keep up with the best other countries and those countries with which we work alongside in UN duties.  Interoperability was a new word for me when I was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for defence.  I am now fully aware of the importance of achieving interoperability and being able to operate with like-minded countries, neutral or otherwise.</p><p> A number of other EU member states are also neutral.  I continually highlight our policy of neutrality at meetings with my counterparts.</p><p> Deputy Barrett referred to our participation in Operation Sophia.  The vast majority of the work done by the Naval Service as part of Operation Sophia involves rescuing migrants and bringing them ashore in Italy.  The role is similar to the humanitarian work previously done in the region by the Naval Service.</p><p>  I understand that all European Defence Agency projects must be approved by the select committee before going to the D&aacute;il.  I do not have a problem with that approach as it is only right and proper that members have an opportunity to question the Minister of the day on the reasons we are participating in such projects. </p></speech>

I will comment briefly before Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh contributes.  I share the views expressed by Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan and Se&aacute;n Barrett on neutrality and the respect that our policy has garnered for Ireland throughout the world over the decades.  The views expressed by the Deputies are often aired at meetings of the joint committee.  The particular provision in the 2009 Act is very good and must be adhered to strictly.  I am pleased to note the Minister of State's comment that he outlines our position on neutrality at every meeting of European Union defence Ministers.  As he will be aware, a parliamentary meeting is held on the Common Security and Defence Policy under each Presidency.  At the small number of such meetings I have attended, I have spoken out strongly about our adherence to neutrality, pointing out that we will not deviate from it.</p> <p>  The point made by Deputy Barrett is that we all share a concern at the back of our minds that things may be happening that run counter to the thrust of our policy on neutrality, which is firmly adhered to and supported by the overwhelming majority of the population.  In that context, we are proposing, as part of our work programme for 2018, that the Minister of State appear before the committee at least three times each year to update members on developments in the European Union.  We have an arrangement under which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade reports to the joint committee on Council meetings.  These meetings with the Minister do not take place as often as they should for reasons of scheduling, either on the part of the committee or Minister.  The joint committee cannot meet when it wishes as only certain time slots are available.  In addition, we have a substantial work programme.</p> <p>  Apart from appearing before the select committee to present Estimates or legislation, we propose that the Minister of State attend formal meetings of the committee at least three times per annum to update members on developments in the Council of defence Ministers, including proposals, follow-up and so forth.  We will make this proposal in our work programme for 2018 to ensure members are kept abreast of what is happening and, I hope, to allay any fears that may arise among members of the public and Members of the Oireachtas.  I am sure the programme will be agreed by the committee. </p></speech>

The most important aspect of these meetings is that every country, specifically the neutral countries, has an opportunity to outline its policy on neutrality.  It is often the case that officials from the Department have had wording changed to reflect our policy of neutrality.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.444" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1305" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2017112900002#D00400"><p>Before addressing some of the specific matters, like the Chairman and Deputies O'Sullivan and Barrett, I approach all motions of this nature with a healthy degree of suspicion.  I have argued for some years at the committee against many of the defence motions connected with the European Union that come before the committee and cautioned that we are increasingly creeping into an EU militarised structure.  We will debate this issue in the coming week on a major proposed change to Irish defence strategy involving our participation in PESCO or permanent structured co-operation on defence.  We will deal with that proposal in some detail in the House and members will be aware of my views on that issue and our policy of neutrality.</p> <p>  A number of issues are not completely clear with regard to the European Union's SatCom market, to which we are signing up.  France became the 24th member of SatCom in August last, which was very convenient given that the contract for the delivery of SatCom was signed recently with one of France's biggest companies, Airbus Defence and Space.  As the world's second largest space communications company, there is a logic to the decision to award the contract to Airbus but it is also strange that France did not sign up to SatCom until that contract was signed.</p> <p>  There appears to be a suggestion that the Defence Forces current contract is insufficient.  According to the Minister of State, the project will provide the Defence Forces with security of supply and back-up.  I was not aware of any problem with the supply of satellite communications for the Defence Forces.  Are we liable to pay the current supplier to exit the contract early?  In the event of any failure on the part of the current supplier to meet urgent operational requirements because it is not sufficiently flexible, that is a problem with whomever negotiated the contract in the first place.  If one is negotiating a contract for the supply of satellite communications, it must be flexible and services must be provided at a moment's notice in the event of troops being deployed and requiring such services. </p> <p>  The Minister of State indicated there are no costs to the Exchequer.  While there is no immediate cost evident, is there a cost in terms of ending the contract with the current supplier?  What is the cost per use?  One cannot argue there is no cost if a cost arises each time the system is used.</p> <p>  Another issue arises with the SatCom project.</p><p>It is probably hosted on the Eurostar or one of the other satellites that Airbus has spinning around the earth, looking down on us all.  Who else would share that satellite?  They are not for a single purpose and there have been embarrassing situations in the past where rival companies who were sharing the same space.  I think there was a case some years ago where Vatican TV was embarrassed because there was something inappropriate also coming out on the same channel.  Can we guarantee that whatever system is used is not also being used by our rivals?  We are a neutral country but if we are buying into a system which is to be shared by the other 23 members so far, and there may be more because France is the latest one to join, will that cause a problem?</p><p> I concur with the other members on the explosive ordinance or detonation and the respect that those who are involved in this are held across the world.  I recognise the training which members of the Defence Forces who are attached to the ordinance sections have given in war torn areas and countries which are coming out of wars to ensure that areas of land are safe, and I have no problem with that.  I have several queries, however.  They are talking about using Irish personnel, but the information that I have is that there is a major crisis of personnel in terms of members in the ordinance section in the Defence Forces, with a shortfall in skilled members.  If that is the case, and we are committing eight of the most skilled people to get trained on this manual neutralisation capabilities in the European centre, can we afford to release them?  I think that we should and I am not opposed to it but there is a question of can we afford it if we have international commitments and commitments at home, because one still sees the green trucks regularly moving around the country.  It is provided that the &euro;450,000 that this project will cost will  come out of existing resources.  It was not in the Estimates for next year.  If &euro;450,000 is coming out of other resources, what will lose out?  The Defence Forces, like every section, do not have spare cash lying around.  It is &euro;50,000 short of &euro;0.5 million.  It is money that should be found and it should have been in the Estimates, although perhaps that was not possible because we had not passed it then.  </p><p> Like other Deputies, I think these proposals are benign, for the most part, but they are an additional step towards our being subsumed, or more accurately, having our self sufficiency undermined, where before we were self sufficient and were capable of looking after ourselves.  We did not rely on international satellites or training.  In common with other Deputies, I am not opposed to the motion.</p></speech>

There are other areas where we are able to benefit from being members of the EDA.  Then we have the ECMAN project to which the Deputy referred, which has a cost of &euro;75,000.  I am not sure what head that might be under in the Estimates but I will find out and revert to the Deputy with an answer.</p> <p>  The goal for the new  SatCom Market project is to provide a cost-effective SatCom service solution for the benefit of EDA participating member states and EU institutions.  The Defence Forces currently have a commercial contract in place for the provision of these services which the Deputy inquired about.  Participation in this project will provide the Defence Forces with security of supply and back up in the event of any failure on the part of our current supplier, with whom we will not be breaking our existing contract.  It will be used only if there is a failure on the part of our current supplier or an urgent operational requirement which cannot be made under the current contract.  It will be beneficial for operations overseas, on maritime patrols and Operation Sophia.  The cost is on a pay-by-use basis, without any standing charge.  The EDA is not there to make money.  I cannot give an exact cost of involvement if we have to avail of the service but the rate would be very keen.  If there was a sudden breakdown in the existing service we will be able to tap into this SatCom, and we pay for whatever we use.</p></speech>

I will continue with this line of thought.  We have signed up to European battle groups, for instance.  The logic with this interoperability is that if Ireland is involved in an EU battle group, all the telecommunications systems would be the same if we are working with armies from other countries.  If they have signed up to the same satellite communications, and the logic is that one would use that when based overseas, not necessarily in Ireland, that means that there is a potential cost to the Exchequer because one still has the existing supplier.  I am not opposed to it, I am merely saying that there is a logic here.  Would there then be a cost of us having to switch some of our equipment or is the equipment sufficiently new that it can switch between satellite providers at a moment's notice if required?  One could have a situation in Mali, for instance, where there is a detachment of Irish troops.  Are they working on their own?  Are they working through their own satellite provider or will they be with the other EU troops there, collectively, working off a different communications system?  That would involve a cost.  It might be minor, and the Minister of State is correct that the European Defence Agency is not there to make profit but it must also pay Airbus for the guaranteed space to be available 24-7, which is what the contract would be.</p><p>The space on that satellite would have to be sufficient for all the EU's military missions and operations into the future.  I presume whoever negotiated the contract with Airbus would have done that.  I do not know enough about satellites and how they work to figure out how much would be required, but I understand that if there are two satellites they sometimes go out of range so it is necessary to switch between different satellites.  The advantage of going with Airbus is that it has so many satellites one is never in the dark at any one time.  There is a logic to it but we should not present it as not having any cost.  It has a potential cost in the future.  That might be a better way of presenting it.</p></speech>

I am not sure whether the existing contract we have is negotiated every 12 months, but it is a fixed contract for the overseas missions we have, be it Operation Sophia for the Naval Service or an operation for the Air Corps.  If we were to undertake a new mission we would have to renegotiate a package with the existing provider.  If that provider was unable to provide us with a service, the EDA gives us another option in the future.  From my perspective, if the EDA package is more acceptable or better priced than the existing contractor we have, one would go with the keenest price and the most secure provider.</p></speech>

EU military missions in African countries are in extremely fragile states such as Mali, Somalia and the Central African Republic.  While those are not partner countries for Irish Aid, Irish Aid is involved.  There could be a situation where an EU military mission goes into a fragile, vulnerable country that we are supporting in a humanitarian way.  How can we reconcile the military operation with the humanitarian one?</p> <p>  The other point I wish to make relates to Libya.  The Minister of State can correct me if I am wrong but there was no UN mandate for what happened in Libya, yet our Naval Service was taking part in this EU mission in Libya.  There are contradictions and there is a potential contradiction into the future.  It is not with these two particular pieces but in the future.</p></speech>

He came to see me to find out if he could recommend to his superiors in the United States that they send some key officers to Ireland's peacekeeping college.  He said to me, "You know, Minister, we do not know anything about peacekeeping".  He said, "We just train our soldiers on how to use the best equipment in the world and we send them out on peacekeeping missions".  It brought home to me the difference between what we are about and what the big powers do.  They use force and move in, but we occupy a special little niche.  We are renowned throughout the world for our peacekeeping qualities.  We do not go about armed to our tonsils with bombs, bullets and the like.  We have methods of dealing with people.  I recall visiting Lebanon.  My wife was with me.  One day while I was out visiting outposts she was taken away to visit the homes of various leading local mukhtars and so forth as part of the build-up of goodwill.</p> <p>  We are unique.  I believe that is what is so special about our method of peacekeeping.  We need not compete, and I am not saying we do or that the Minister of State is proposing it, with other big powers that are spending a great deal of money.  It is innate in our people that we are very good at peacekeeping.  Sitting down, having a cup of tea and a chat and getting information is every bit as important as having spies on the ground.  It is unique.  The peacekeeping college is something we should put up in lights.  It exists, but very few people know about it.  It uses the skills that we have developed over the years.  Ordinary personnel spend some time in the peacekeeping college sharing their experiences with those who want to learn about our methods.  It is interesting that we have this reputation.</p></speech>

The peacekeeping school is very important for the Irish Defence Forces.  It is part of the education of both enlisted personnel and cadets, as peacekeeping is one of the topics enshrined in their training.  I am not sure if members are aware of the peace and leadership institute proposed in the programme for Government.  It is a concept the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are bringing forward with the support of the Government.  It will be an institute specifically based on Ireland's participation in peacekeeping.  We are doing some groundwork on that at present with regard to potential courses and how people could participate in it.  Personnel from European member states participate in the peacekeeping school, as well as personnel from further afield outside Europe, just as we send some of our officers abroad to talk about peacekeeping, peacekeeping operations and so forth.</p> <p>  Irish peacekeepers are really well inspected.  One sees that when one goes abroad and sees them in operation and how the local people respect the participation of the Irish.  I extended an invitation to the committee members to visit one of our missions abroad, in Lebanon or wherever, and that invitation still stands.  It is important for the committee members to see how the Irish participate on the ground.  We can arrange that at any time without a problem.</p> <p>  To reply to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, Operation Sophia is a UN mandated mission.  We signed up to Operation Sophia under a UN mandate.  It is absolutely within our policy of neutrality to participate in Operation Sophia.  We do not go near the Libyan coast.  We train the Libyan coast guard as part of the operation but we do not go near the Libyan coastline.  If we pick up migrants we bring them to the Italian authorities.</p> <p>  With regard to humanitarian and Irish Aid agencies, I feel very strongly that if the Irish Defence Forces are on a mission abroad they should link up with the humanitarian and aid agencies to assist them in every way possible.  I spoke about this at a recent event.  It is most important for members of the Defence Forces.  We do a great deal of humanitarian work in Lebanon and elsewhere.</p><p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade gives us, through the ambassadors' offices, a budget that the Defence Forces spend on humanitarian projects on the ground such as water, schools, education, sports fields or whatever, to help the local community.  It is form of bridge building and relationship building within the communities wherever we participate.  One of the more practical examples is in Lebanon because we have participated there for many years.  The Deputy is right to say it is important that we help humanitarian efforts.</p></speech>

I apologise on behalf of the Taoiseach who is unable to be here.</p><p>The net Estimate for Vote 5 - Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for 2017 is &euro;40,676,000.  The moneys provide for the salaries and expenses of the director and her staff, the cost of the local State solicitor service, fees to counsel engaged by the director to prosecute cases in the various courts and legal costs awarded against the State arising from judicial review and other legal proceedings.</p><p>A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;418,000 is being sought for 2017 which represents a 1% increase in the net allocation.  The need for the Supplementary Estimate arises from greater than budgeted expenditure on input A2 administration &ndash; non-pay and input A3 &ndash; fees to counsel, together with receipts in input B &ndash; appropriations-in-aid falling below the level budgeted for.Savings elsewhere in the Vote are insufficient to offset the need for a Supplementary Estimate.</p><p>There are a range of factors that give rise to the need for the Supplementary Estimate.  I will address them in the order in which they are listed in the Vote.</p><p>In terms of the input A2 administration &ndash; non-pay, two main factors give rise to the projected overspend of &euro;616,000 under the subhead.  The first is a requirement to spend approximately &euro;261,000 on the office's IT case management system to meet costs that arise from a major upgrade of software.  The fact that the costs of this upgrade would fall in the calendar year 2017 only became apparent after the 2017 Estimates had been finalised.</p><p>The second aspect of administration &ndash; non-pay expenditure which is projected to run significantly ahead of the amount provided for 2017, has to do with the completion of a range of refurbishment projects that the Office of Public Works has undertaken in the context of moving all staff of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to one site on the Infirmary Road, Dublin.  After 16 years of being split across different sites, the Office of Public Works completed works during 2017 that enabled all staff of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to be accommodated on the one site.  Managing expenditure on a significant-sized capital project from annual voted expenditure is inherently difficult because of the uncertainty as to in which year costs will fall to be paid.  The additional spending of approximately &euro;355,000 projected under this heading in 2017 arises from the timing of the expenditure rather than an underestimation of refurbishment costs.</p><p>In terms of input A3 &ndash; fees to sounsel, two main<b></b>factors give rise to the projected overspend of &euro;1.377 million under this subhead.  The first is a general increase in activity in the courts and, in particular, the Central Criminal Court with the assignment of additional judges leading to an increase in the number of sittings.  The Central Criminal Court is the court that deals with the prosecution of murder and rape cases.  The second factor that gave rise to the overspend under the subhead is the cost of a series of complex financial trials.  Fees to prosecution counsel in excess of &euro;1 million have been paid in these cases in 2017.As the factors that gave rise to the overspend in 2017 are likely to continue into 2018, I inform the committee that to ensure the underlying level of activity on fees to counsel does not give rise to a Supplementary Estimate again in 2018, an additional allocation of &euro;1.54 million has been added to the subhead for 2018.</p><p>In terms of input B &ndash; appropriations-in-aid, there is a projected shortfall of &euro;158,000.  This arises from difficulties in estimating the amount of costs that will be awarded by the courts to the director in any one year and also from an over-estimation of the amount that would be realised from pension-related deductions from salaries.  The additional expenditure, of which I have advised the committee, amounts to a total of &euro;2.151 million.  However, a range of savings made elsewhere in the Vote have reduced the amount required by way of Supplementary Estimate to &euro;418,000.  </p><p>I recommend the Supplementary Estimate of &euro;418,000 to the committee.</p></speech>

How are counsel paid by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions?  Is a panel established for the selection of counsel?  Is an hourly rate paid and applied across the public service when senior counsel are availed of?

The officials are present, if the Deputy wants to receive more specific answers.</p> <p>  In the vast majority of cases the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions pays set standard fees to prosecution counsel.  The brief fee in the Circuit Court is &euro;1,144, with a daily refresher fee of &euro;572.  In the Central Criminal Court, in cases of murder, a brief fee of &euro;7,127 is paid to senior counsel, while, in rape cases, a brief fee of &euro;5,704 is paid.  A daily refresher fee of &euro;1,562 is paid to senior counsel.  Junior counsel are paid two thirds of the senior counsel rate.</p> <p>  I know that the Deputy specifically asked about counsel, but I highlight the fact that the number of judges has increased in the past year.  The number in the Central Criminal Court has increased from between three and four judges to five and six judges.  The increase has led to rape and murder cases being dealt with on a more frequent and quicker basis.</p></speech>

Is the length of time it takes for the DPP to make a decision in individual cases regarding whether to prosecute dependent on resources?  To what extent is the Minister of State satisfied there are adequate resources to deal with the volume of files?  Has the volume of files increased?

I will break it up into two parts.  We talked about the complex financial cases in recent years.  There have been high-profile cases and less high-profile ones.  As a result of the appointment of extra judges to the Central Criminal Court, which went from three to four in the past few years to up to six, rape cases are being taken more quickly, which is a good thing.  Murder cases are also being taken more quickly as a result of the extra resources.  The workload is increasing.  There seem to be more efficiencies as a result of the extra judges.  In addition, the office has been streamlined.  It used to be at two separate venues so there is a focus on that.  There were seven extra staff sanctioned in 2017, which was reflective of the extra workload.</p></speech>

There are savings of &euro;771,000, which, I assume, probably relate to two positions.  The DPP is under-resourced.  Budgetary sanction was given, which this committee dealt with in terms of providing money to employ additional staff.  However, formal sanction for those positions within the DPP was not provided by the Department until just a couple of weeks ago.  That has resulted in a saving of approximately &euro;750,000.  What we thought was happening within the DPP during that period did not happen.  Two positions should have been taken on board.  This is one of the major items.  Will the Minister of State explain why there is that type of saving at the same time as under-resourcing of the DPP?</p></speech>

The officials can do that.  If one looks at the sanctioning of positions across a range of Departments, if there are roadblocks, difficulties or the possibility of moving more quickly, we have to find out the reason why.  I will certainly do that.</p></speech>

On the other items of expenditure, will the Minister of State take me through the fees to counsel, which Deputy Michael McGrath has dealt with?  In terms of the &euro;1.377 million shortfall in the fees to counsel subhead, what does the &euro;155,000 in terms of pay mean?  It is subhead A1.  Is it a transfer from pay?

I welcome that but with it comes an extra workload.  I am putting a big proportion of that down to the fact we have extra judges.  We have gone from having three to four judges in the Central Criminal Court to having five to six.</p></speech>

Assigning extra judges has led to an increased number of sittings.  The Minister of State has said two factors led to the overrun or shortfall - whichever way one wants to look at it - of &euro;1.377 million.  What proportion of it is a result of the increased activity in the courts, particularly the Central Criminal Court, and what proportion is a result of the series of complex financial trials?</p></speech>

I am told by my official that about &euro;500,000 or &euro;600,000 is probably attributable to the Central Criminal Court with the balance driven by the complex financial trials.</p></speech>

The rest is attributable to the changes in the Central Criminal Court.  We have changed how we deal with Estimates over the past number of years.  The output targets remain the same despite an increase in activity.  Even though the reason for this overrun or shortfall is increased activity in the Central Criminal Court, the actual output is exactly the same as what was budgeted for earlier which is between 3,000 and 3,500.

We hear about increases in the number of judges and the number of sittings and we think that there is increased activity, while in fact it is the case that more complex cases are incurring these increased costs, as opposed to a dramatic increase in the number of cases being heard, which is not what we have before us.  I want to move on from that.</p> <p>  On output, in terms of the Estimates process we have to measure not just the money, but the targets, which must then be compared with the outputs.  I am completely confused now.  The Minister of State has told us that the 2017 target for new court proceedings is 3,740 and he told us that the 2016 output was 3,554, yet the documentation before us does not reflect any of those numbers.</p></speech>

The figures which were sent to members of the committee, which is supposed to approve these Estimates, say that the original number of court proceedings was between 3,000 and 3,500.  As a result of the Revised Estimate they are now 3,000 to 3,500.  The Minister of State is telling us that those figures are not accurate.  I will not make a big issue of it but there is an issue here in respect of accurate information being provided to the committee when it is being asked to approve Estimates.  We do not have the fullest of information before us.</p></speech>

Will the Minister of State inform the committee of the complement of staff it has at present?  Have all approved positions been taken up?  Are there any vacancies in the office at this point in time?</p></speech>

The Public Appointments Service is working to fill vacancies for solicitors and administrative support.  The DPP has three main divisions including a directing division consisting of barristers and solicitors who examine criminal investigation files and decide whether prosecutions should be taken.  The solicitors' division consists of solicitors who prepare and conduct cases on behalf of the director in all courts sitting in Dublin.  The administration division consists of general Civil Service grades.  It provides support and other services to both the directing division and the solicitors' division in order to enable the office to fulfil its statutory function.</p></speech>

My final question is connected with the budgetary process in terms of the office's complement of staff and the pay subheading of the Estimate.  Has there been any internal or external examination carried out in the office of the DPP in respect of the resources it needs, including both personnel and other supports, to meet the demands it faces in a timely manner?  Deputy Michael McGrath spoke about the frustration that the Moriarty report is still being examined by the DPP five years later.  Has there been an examination of the office's staffing needs internally or externally?  The Central Bank has carried out a report in respect of what it needs.  Has that happened within the DPP?  If it has not happened recently, within the last three years for example, does the Minister of State believe it is necessary for such a review to be carried out?  I ask because major financial trials have collapsed, which has caused serious upset among a large section of the population, and some would say that these collapses were caused by the DPP.</p></speech>

There seems to be a pattern of arranging meetings outside of the public committee meeting.  Given that the IAA is scheduled to come in on 6 December, I suggest there is no need for a separate private meeting, an informal meeting or whatever way we want to word it in Buswells Hotel 24 hours earlier.  If there are other issues, such as oversight of aviation, etc., we can add that as an extra item on the agenda when the IAA attends this meeting in public session the following day.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

To be honest, I have only scanned it because I was conscious it was not related to this meeting.  However, my understanding is that the IAA is coming in like any other group.  The Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, previously came in and Bus &Eacute;ireann previously had briefings in Buswells.  It gives an opportunity to have a more in depth briefing.  I have no issue with the IAA doing that.  Ultimately, it will be answerable to our committee the following day.  I am presuming we can ask any questions we wish when the IAA comes in the following day.</p></speech>

I would have reservations particularly in relation to the meeting that is scheduled on 6 December with the pilots and the way that the IAA had requested, in a very forthright manner, that we furnish it with the folders that the Irish Airline Pilots' Association, IALPA, had sent us.  The IAA was quite adamant that it was entitled to the information.  When we sought legal advice, as we would have known anyway irrespective of legal advice being sought, we were informed that the IAA had no right to it.</p><p>It just seemed reluctant.  On that basis, I am fearful that this meeting was arranged 24 hours in advance because of the IAA's resistance to coming before the committee to discuss the pilots' situation.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to speak on the Supplementary Estimate.  I also welcome the officials from the Department to the meeting and thank them for the briefing material, which has been circulated.  As for the format of today's meeting, the Minister will make a brief address, after which members who wish to speak may indicate and may then contribute.  Then we can consider the Supplementary Estimate in more detail.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I remind members that in accordance with Standing Orders, discussion should be confined to the items constituting the Supplementary Estimate.  I now invite the Minister to make his address.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-29a.612" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTS2017112900002#B01300"><p>I thank the members for coming to consider this technical Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The entirety of this Supplementary Estimate is taken up with one project, namely Luas cross-city.  Luas cross-city will shortly begin operations and will provide a real benefit to our transport infrastructure.  The Luas network has been a huge success story for Dublin's public transport system and there have already been a number of improvements to the network since the green and red lines began operations in 2004 - for example, the extensions to Cherrywood and the Docklands.  Luas cross-city has been a priority project for the Government and has been delivered on target and within budget.  With testing and training of drivers coming to a conclusion, Luas cross-city will commence passenger services on 9 December.  The project will be a hugely beneficial addition to the public transport network in Dublin, enhancing the overall capacity available.  This will encourage more people to use public transport, which will assist in alleviating congestion in the city.  Alleviating congestion is particularly important at present as the level of economic activity is, thankfully, continuing to grow.  I know that the past few years have been challenging for the city and for businesses, and we all look forward to the works drawing to a close and the start of operations next month.  I take this opportunity to thank the people, particularly the business people, of Dublin for their patience.  I feel they are about to be rewarded.</p> <p>  Passenger numbers on the Luas network exceeded 34 million in 2016.  Luas Cross City is forecast to provide for up to 10 million additional passenger journeys per annum.  Under the agreed budgetary profile for the funding of the Luas cross-city project, an element of the costs arising in 2017 will be borne through the release of section 49 levies held in reserve by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  These levies in the amount of &euro;12.5 million were collected by TII under section 49 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The levies were collected in respect of the Luas extensions to Cherrywood and the Docklands.  These levies can now be surrendered by TII to my Department for reallocation to the National Transport Authority, NTA, for costs relating to Luas cross-city.  The Supplementary Estimate will facilitate arrangements to reallocate the funds in question to fund Luas cross-city project expenditure which was incurred during 2017.</p> <p>  Luas cross-city completes the missing link in the Luas network.  It will help to create an integrated public transport system in Dublin by extending the existing green line at St. Stephen's Green to Broombridge and providing an interchange between the existing red and green lines in the city centre.  It will also serve the new Dublin Institute of Technology campus at Grangegorman.  Luas cross-city will also enhance the image of Dublin as a shopping, tourist and business destination.  This in turn will lead to increases in investment and economic activity.  I have no doubt that Luas cross-city will bring huge benefits to the city, including to the businesses in the city centre and along its route.  I very much look forward to seeing it up and running.  I am happy to address any questions members of the committee may have on this technical Supplementary Estimate to help fund Luas cross-city.</p></speech>

As he said, this is only a technical Supplementary Estimate, but why is this additional money required?  The briefing documentation indicates that the project was coming in on time and on budget, so why then is there a need for a Supplementary Estimate?  Would this not have been envisaged at the beginning of the year and included in the original Estimates?  I know we are only putting in &euro;1,000 and the money is coming from TII, so the arrangements are technical in nature, but why is the additional &euro;12.5 million now needed?</p><p>With the Chairman's forbearance, regarding the fact that this is a Supplementary Estimate, I wish to use the opportunity to ask the Minister why the head of networks operations for TII this week wrote to all the chief executives of all the city and county councils and advised:</p><blockquote>At this point, it is envisaged that the 2018 ordinary maintenance allocations to local authorities will be reduced by approx 30% from 2017 levels.  This reduction, however, will be mitigated somewhat by the availability of additional funds which can be drawn down by the geo app but will nonetheless be significant at approximately 17% overall.</blockquote> <p>In the context of the Supplementary Estimates, why is TII sending out such a letter?</p><p>It begins the letter by saying it has recently been notified by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport that the overall national road expenditure budget for 2018 will be reduced by approximately 15% compared to 2017 levels.  I am conscious it is not overly related to the matters under discussion today but it is relevant in the context of Estimates for the Department and I ask the Minister to address it today.</p></speech>

There is good news for those living in Dublin but not for those who have to travel on the M8 or the M7.  Since I began commuting to Dublin, I have looked forward to being able to avail of the Luas to get from Clondalkin to St. Stephen's Green.  However, the nightmare of congestion on the M7 at Naas and Newbridge will have to be resolved in order for the Luas to be of benefit.  That obstacle must be overcome in order to attract more travellers to Dublin.  The development project in that regard should be fast tracked.  Only if that congestion is alleviated will the Luas cross-city be of benefit to those travelling to Dublin via the M8 or M7.</p> <p>  Has the issue of training for Luas drivers been resolved?  Is the Minister sure it will be possible to operate the cross-city line in view of health and safety requirements and drivers seeking more training?</p></speech>

Extra money is not being sought but, rather, there is a transfer of &euro;12.5 million.  Under the provisions of the Act, I have to give a ministerial direction for money to be taken from the TII pot, which then comes in to the Department.  The money goes on a quite circuitous route.  It is collected from developers and goes to local authorities, then into the TII pot and then into the reserves of the Department.  It then goes to the National Transport Authority, NTA, which allocates it to Luas cross-city.  That has to be done under the Act.  It is not a Supplementary Estimate-------</p></speech>

We are addressing many issues of that sort.  There is an issue outside the Dublin area which we are addressing that I suspect I should not discuss now because it does not regard the Luas cross-city but I will do so to try to be helpful to the Deputy.  Construction has started on the first of the major upgrade schemes, that being the widening of the M7 Naas bypass and an upgrade to the Sallins bypass and Osberstown interchange projects.  Those are being implemented as one project.</p> <p>  Additional funding is being provided as part of the capital plan review which will allow for significant enhancements to the programme.  The funding has facilitated a range of national roads initiatives, including M50 safety enhancement works, measures to reduce energy usage for traffic route lighting, the inclusion of some additional major and minor road upgrade schemes in TII's construction programme and the appraisal of a range of projects with a view to developing a pipeline of future projects.  Financial provision is also being made to meet the Government's commitment to contribute to the A5 upgrade.  </p> <p>  Quite a lot of money will be spent under the new capital plan in addressing the issue of park and ride facilities.  I hope that will help to address issues on the outskirts of Dublin such as that referenced by Deputy O'Keeffe regarding his getting to that point and difficulties beginning at the Red Cow roundabout.  That is an issue for many people travelling to Dublin.  That will be addressed and commitment to so doing has been made in the new capital plan.</p> <p>  In addition, the internal workings of Dublin transport will be revolutionised in many ways, such as through the Bus Connects initiative, on which approximately &euro;770 million will be spent in the coming years, beginning in 2019.  Issues other than the Luas are being addressed at great expense.  The overall consideration is not solely in respect of Dublin and Broombridge to Sandyford, as other problems are also being considered..  It is hoped that the Bus Connects initiative will also be introduced in Cork, which might interest Deputy O'Keeffe.</p></speech>

I have a note on the issue which might have been circulated to the Deputy that I will read out because we anticipate the issue will be addressed.</p> <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and the funding of public transport.  I am not involved in the issue the Deputy addressed, which is the day-to-day operations of public transport, but I will try to reassure him in that regard.  Both the NTA and TII have statutory responsibility for the provision and oversight of Luas services, while the action services are operated by a private company, Transdev, with which the Deputy is familiar.</p> <p>  The issue of driver training for services on the new cross-city line is a matter for Transdev.  The Commission for Railway Regulation, CRR, is the independent regulatory agency charged with oversight of the safety of all railway activities in the State.  The regulatory process operates independently of the Minister and the Department.  The CRR as safety regulator ensures that a safety management system is in place for the operation of Luas cross-city.  The role of the CRR is to assess safety management systems to ensure they conform to all requirements prior to awarding safety authorisation or safety certificates and the assessment of new or significantly altered railway infrastructure and rolling stock to ensure safety compliance prior to placing in service.  It has the necessary powers to deal with any risk to safety that may arise.</p> <p>  I made inquiries on the issue this morning because it was anticipated that a Deputy would raise it.  The Department is utterly confident that there are no safety issues that will in any way delay the launch of Luas cross-city on 9 December.</p></speech>

As regards the &euro;12.5 million in appropriations in aid receipts, is that money going from the TII to the NTA via the Department for the Luas?  From where is it accumulated?  The Minister earlier referenced levies from the docklands and so on.  Is that from where it comes?</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, there is a levy on developments along Luas lines.  As I outlined in response to Deputy Troy, the money from the levies is collected by the relevant local authority.  The route it takes is somewhat circuitous, the reason for which I do not know but which is required under the Act.  It goes from the local authority to TII, then to the Department, which gives it to the NTA.   The NTA, as the sanctioning body, sanctions the money and sends it to fund works on the Luas cross-city.</p><p>It has to be done because of the mismatch between the levies collected one year from a developer and the money being paid out somewhere else.  It is a question of need under the Act.</p></speech>

It is hugely important infrastructure that will help in bringing about a more integrated public transport network in the capital city.  It is a good start and while we have a long way to go, we must acknowledge the work that has been done.  As the Minister said, a lot of people have been inconvenienced by the construction work in the past few years, but I hope they will reap many benefits and rewards when the service is up and running.  Does the Minister know how much of the money raised by way of the development levies went towards meeting the overall cost of the line?  </p> <p>  My next question may be a little unfair because the Minister cannot predict how much development will take place along the new line.  However, the Department is aware of how much land has been zoned for development.  On that basis, can the Minister give us a figure for the potential development levies that could be recouped in the next five to ten years by Dublin City Council?</p> <p>  I note that &euro;150 million of the cost of the Luas cross city project was met through European funding, which is welcome.  I have said to the Minister on previous occasions that I do not think the Government is availing enough of the funding available to us to invest in infrastructural improvements.  Now that we see the benefits of such investment in this project, will the Minister commit to considering using the Juncker fund to accelerate other projects in the future?</p></speech>

The Deputy is right that &euro;150 million came from the European Investment Bank.  The funds for the scheme have come from the European Investment Bank by way of a loan of &euro;150 million, the Exchequer and TII reserves, mainly made up of development levies.  </p> <p>  On the amount of land zoned, it would be speculative to say how much has been zoned and how much could be raised.  I do not think I could do that.  However, I could ask TII to give us some estimate, but I imagine it is considered to be a steady, ongoing source of revenue.  I doubt that it could be specific, but it might have some projections.</p></speech>

There has been no application to the new Juncker fund from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, which is disappointing.  The Italians, for example, availed of &euro;600 million from the fund for the provision of a railway line.  The Poles also availed of the fund and used the moneys to improve existing infrastructure and rolling stock.  There is an opportunity to use the fund and, as captain of the ship in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Minister should be pushing this agenda to avail of funding to accelerate investment in public transport.</p></speech>
