    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-03a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jimmy Kelly" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015030300002#H00200"><p>I thank members for the invitation to make a submission on low pay and the living wage.  My colleagues and I will seek to cover all aspects of this issue.  If possible, I will share the allotted time with Mr. Michael Taft.</p> <p>  Ireland is a low pay and high cost economy, which means Irish workers have less purchasing power than their peer groups across Europe.  This is a long-term phenomenon rather than an outcome of the recession.  When addressing issues of low pay it is necessary to consider workers' pay packets and what is known as the social wage, namely, the compensation workers receive through access to public services and social protection supports.  On each of these measures - direct pay and the social wage - Irish workers lose out.  This is especially evident when wages in traditional low paid sectors, such as hospitality and retail, are compared across Europe.  In these sectors, Irish workers are at a particular disadvantage when compared to their European counterparts.</p> <p>  It is argued in some quarters that we need to keep wages low to maintain competitiveness.  This argument is a distortion and misrepresentation of competitiveness.  The most competitive economies in Europe have high levels of investment, infrastructural quality, health and education, use of technology and innovation, to name but a few elements.  They also have high wage levels, which are critical to an economy's competitiveness.  It is not possible to build a prosperous economy on low wages. </p> <p>  Ireland's low wage economy is a direct contributor to what is described as in-work poverty.  Approximately 350,000 members of the workforce or one in five employees are categorised by the Central Statistics Office as living in deprivation conditions.  Not only is this economically irrational, but it is socially obscene.</p> <p>  An increase of &euro;1 in the national minimum wage, a strong joint labour committee system, an end to precarious employment as well as a right for part-time workers to take up more hours are necessary measures to boost economic growth and vindicate the right to a decent wage.  They should be seen as the first step towards the goal of implementing a living wage.</p> <p>  I ask Unite's research officer, Mr. Michael Taft, to address some of the specific aspects of the Irish low wage economy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-03a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Taft" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015030300002#H00300"><p>Mr. Kelly outlined the overall position.  To put the matter in perspective, in the hospital and retail sector, compensation in Ireland falls considerably behind compensation among our peer group, namely, other northern and central European countries.  To reach the average level would require a substantial increase in compensation, in some cases of more than 20%.</p> <p>  A similar pattern is evident in the statutory wage floors.  When factoring in purchasing power and a worker's full compensation package, the national minimum wage falls well below the purchasing power of our peer group.  In more than half the countries with minimum wage legislation, only 5% of workers rely on minimum wage protection, whereas the figure in Ireland is close to 10%.  Given that these figures are taken from EUROSTAT data for 2010, it is likely that the percentage here will have increased.  </p> <p>  Regarding affordability, Ireland has always been a high profit country, even when one factors out the inflated levels of profit arising from multinational accountancy practices.</p><p>This is certainly the case in the wholesale and retail sector where Ireland's profit levels are above the EU average.  Hospitality profits are lower than the EU average but the underlying indicators such as turnover, gross value added and labour productivity approximate European levels.  This suggests the problems are structural in the sector.  Whatever they might be, it is certainly not the case that wages are the problem.  </p><p> As Mr. Gerry Light pointed out, there are 350,000 people in the workforce who are officially categorised as living in deprivation, that is, one in five people in the workforce.  There are also three other areas where low pay has a high cost.  First, there is a cost to the Exchequer where tax revenues are reduced and social protections are increased, for example, the family income supplement.  This subsidy to low pay employers reduces the State's ability to invest in our economic and social infrastructure which negatively impacts on all of us.  Depressed take home pay reduces consumer demand.  This is exacerbated by precarious workers where they are unsure of next week's income.  Essentially, the low paid are prevented from fully participating in the consumer economy to the detriment of economic performance.  Finally, low paid negatively impacts on firm performance, in particular, firms dependent on domestic demand and in need of increased turnover.  These firms need more customers coming to their door with more money in their pocket, therefore, wages are an indispensable element of increasing demand capacity.  It is often stated that the wages must wait for the economy to recover; this is to view the process in a static and backward way.  Economic growth occurs because of wage increases.  A wage strategy that benefits the low paid is an important element in the growth and equality toolbox.  The question is if whether the economy can afford not to have wage increases and the answer is "No".</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-03a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Light" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015030300002#J00400"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for inviting us to appear before the committee.  By way of introduction, Mandate Trade Union is one of the country's largest private sector unions representing some 45,000 workers across retail, distribution, administration and the licensed trade.  Not surprisingly, our membership is predominantly female who work in the main part-time hours and, significantly, the sector in which we are active accounts for more than 250,000 workers or approximately 15.5% of the entire workforce.</p> <p>  The importance and value of retail work has significantly increased largely due to the hollowing out and loss of decent employment in other traditional sectors such as construction and manufacturing during the years of economic recession.  In many instances, the earnings derived from retail have become the principal income for many households.  </p> <p>  Many of the relevant background issues pertinent to this important debate being considered today were highlighted when we presented before this committee in September 2013.  Therefore, I urge committee Members to revert to our previous presentation along with what we have to say today in order to build a comprehensive brief on this crucial issue to many thousands of low paid workers and their dependants.  </p> <p>  The growth of precarious work and low insecure wages is no doubt the fuel that drives income inequality both in Ireland and globally.  However, we suggest that the problem is particularly acute based on recent research emanating from TASC entitled Cherishing all Equally - Economic Inequality in Ireland.  </p> <p>  As we emerge from many years of economic recession and associated austerity policies which imposed hardship on many of our citizens, it is time to fundamentally address the type of society that will emerge and the degree of influence open to us in shaping it.  Do we repeat the mistakes of the past by placing the greed of the market ahead of the needs of our people?  Much emphasis has recently been placed on the importance of work in building both economic and social prosperity into the future.  The slogan of "work must pay" is one which is commonly recited.  However, we must ensure we go far beyond the rhetoric and ensure that this aspiration becomes a reality for the many thousands of current and prospective workers who are not only entitled to it, but deserve it.  Clearly there exists a moral imperative on behalf of the State and employers to create a fundamental shift in how we view the world of work and ensure that the "jobs at any cost strategy" does not become counterproductive.</p> <p>  Based on previous experiences, if left to their own devices far too many employers will ignore this call for a fairer and more decent workplace.</p><p>One only has to listen to some of the submissions made to this committee during the past few weeks-----</p></speech>

He will have heard my earlier reference requesting witnesses not to refer to people who are not present.  I ask him not to mention any other organisations or companies, by name, in his presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-03a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Light" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015030300002#K00300"><p>Okay.  Based on the evidence to which I have pointed, it is very disappointing that in general this is all low-paid workers can look forward to in respect of employers, in particular, taking a different view to the world of work that we need to create as we emerge from recession into some kind of economic recovery.</p> <p>  We would argue that some of the suggestions centrally have as their focus an attempt to move away the responsibility from employers to pay a fair and decent wage and to move that burden back on to the State through increased social transfers.  Far too many employers subscribe to the call for wage restraint because wage increases might cause damage to economic recovery.  Surely a more courageous and creative attitude must be demanded from employers.  They cannot be allowed to wash their hands of their collective responsibility towards building a sustainable economy along with a fairer society. </p> <p>  In the face of this determined resistance by large groups of employers, the State, for its part, must set out a clear vision and create a culture whereby a fairer sustainable deal is achievable for not only low paid workers, but all workers.  That is a moral imperative and essential if we are to create a society in which the general discourse around issues such as statutory minimum and living wage thresholds can take place in a balanced manner ensuring that the voices of all parties can be afforded the respect, dignity and influence that they deserve.  The traditional power shift between labour and capital has dramatically increased in favour of the latter, particularly during periods of heightened economic recession.  This reality is most apparent in the fall in disposable incomes and the subsequent dramatic decline in domestic consumption which has occurred in recent times.  The shift in this power balance is also linked to the numbers of workers who are trade union members.  The right to collectively bargain in a meaningful way must be a cornerstone of any new order that emerges over the coming years.  In this regard, the proposed introduction of legislation in this area is to be welcomed but employers must not be allowed an easy route away from the obligations which are placed upon them.  For far too long many employers, through our voluntarist model of industrial relations, have been allowed adopt a dismissive and hypocritical approach to the real value of a worker's constitutional right to become a member of a trade union.  I do not know whether it is order, and I am sure the Chairman will guide me on this, for me to mention a particular employer.</p></speech>

It must be pointed out that this letter was written in the context of an ongoing dispute we are having with this extremely profitable Irish employer which, not surprisingly, centres around the core issue of decent work.</p> <p>  The existence and outcomes from a robust, meaningful collective bargaining environment not only has the direct effect of lifting workers out of precarious working conditions but also lessens greatly the pressures and obligations on the State to provide support structures which prevent more workers being exploited and moving deeper into workplace poverty.  Many employers are prepared to do the right thing by their employees and enter into collective agreements with Mandate to produce working conditions which are decent and fair.</p></speech>

For the purpose of my presentation I will talk about the hospitality sector, a sector of the economy where workers are in a very unequal relationship with their employer, where pay at the level of the national minimum wage is the norm, where there are no other conditions of employment, and where the prevalence of zero hour contracts is very high.</p> <p>  I will give the members some statistics.  Central Statistics Office figures for workers confirm that the average hourly rate of pay at quarter four 2014 remains below the average hourly rate at quarter four 2010.</p><p>There was a significant increase in the numbers on the minimum wage between mid-2011 and mid-2014, and we know that at the end of 2013, 12.5% of all part-time workers claiming jobseeker payments worked in hotels and restaurants.</p><p> With regard to the employment created in the industry, CSO figures confirm that the recovery started in early 2011 and there has been a 23.1% increase in employment between 2011 and 2014.  Part-time employment increased by 14.1% and full-time employment increased by 15.5%.  Between 2011 and 2013, there was a reduced employer PRSI rate if an employer's workers earned less than &euro;356 per week.  The employers in the sector also have the favourable Government policy of a lower VAT rate and international tourism numbers are now at pre-recession levels.  There were 7.6 million visitors to Ireland in 2014, a figure which increased by 9% on that of 2013.  Domestic tourism numbers have increased by over 2.2%, with total spending in 2013 by tourists at &euro;6.54 billion, which is an increase of more than 10% on the figures from 2013.</p><p> In the restaurant sector we have identified some organisations with considerable profits and in the hotel sector there is evidence from independent research indicating that 90% of hoteliers anticipated revenue growth in 2014.  Occupancy levels in hotels also increased in the same year, along with average revenue per room and average profit levels per room.  Our submission also has examples of significant sales and purchase transactions in the hotel sector, which is hardly evidence of a sector that is experiencing anything other than a boom.</p><p> In mid 2011, the Oireachtas approved a favourable VAT rate of 9% for this sector.  A SIPTU survey in the restaurant sector indicates that the VAT rate was not passed on, to a significant extent, to the consumer by way of price reduction.  The cost to the Exchequer in a full year of this VAT reduction is approximately &euro;350 million, and the total will be approximately &euro;1.4 billion by mid-2015.  The line from the two organisations which look after employers in this sector is that the VAT rate has been solely responsible for the increase in employment, but that does not stand up.  The recovery in the sector started prior to the VAT reduction and it is demand-led.  It can be attributed to the significant increase in international tourism, primarily from the UK and North America, with such tourists spending more when they are here.  These factors are related more to the exchange rate between the euro and sterling or the dollar.</p><p> The only way workers in this sector can have the issue of low pay addressed to enable them achieve a living wage and be able to gain or benefit equally from the recovery and be able to provide for themselves and their family is through the joint labour committee, JLC, process.  This JLC process is enshrined in legislation approved by the Oireachtas in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012.  Following a review under this legislation, a statutory instrument was introduced, SI 28 of 2014, for the establishment of a hotels joint labour committee, with the JLC in place before 2011 for the catering industry remaining in place.  However, hotel and restaurant owners are exercising a veto over this piece of Oireachtas-approved policy, which is having the effect of ensuring that tens of thousands of workers remain in work poverty.  It also ensures the means by which employers continue to pass the obligation to the State of paying a living wage to these workers by way of welfare support.  Not alone are these vested interest groups being allowed to exercise this veto over the will of the Oireachtas, they are also bringing Ireland and the State into breach of International Labour Organization conventions.</p></speech>

Representatives of a number of employer organisations appeared before the committee last week, so this is our second set of hearings on this issue.  Obviously, we are examining low pay and a living wage, as well as income and economic inequality across the economy.</p> <p>  There is a clear conflict between what the employer organisations have said, and will say, and what the trade unions say.  That is probably no surprise.  The problem is that we all appear to be saying the same thing, that we want a fair economy and workers to have decent wages, but the approaches are certainly not the same.  I am interested to hear the witnesses' views on what the employer organisations have said, because there are differences even in terms of the data that are provided.  It would helpful to hear their views.  The Irish Business and Employers Confederation says that the minimum wage is appropriate, competitive and affordable while also taking account of changes in the cost of living.  It goes on to say that the living wage comes with a fiscal cost as it will hurt employment.  What is their view on that?</p> <p>  The Irish Small and Medium Enterprises association said that the real concern for workers is not a national minimum wage subject to tax deductions, and that such a concern would be the responsibility of the State.  It talked about the social responsibility of the State and said it is not the responsibility of employers to deal with wealth redistribution.  We hear that from all of the employer organisations.  ISME said it is not the responsibility of employers to be wealth distributors in the economy and that increasing the minimum wage is a blunt instrument in addressing poverty and only serves to increase the cost base of business.</p> <p>  Those are the arguments they have made against increasing the minimum wage and moving to a living wage, or increasing wages generally in the economy.  What is the response of the witnesses to that?  In terms of the three constituent trade unions, do they support an increase in the minimum wage?  If so, at what level?  Do the individual unions support a living wage and how would they envisage that being implemented and over what timeframe?</p> <p>  The second question relates to the challenge workers face.  Perhaps the witnesses could give examples of the human cost of the facts that we have.  The Unite presentation referred to almost 400,000 workers who are working but who are living in poverty, with huge levels of deprivation, and the 20% of the workforce on low pay.  What is the human, social and economic cost of that?</p> <p>  My third question is about precarious work and under-employment.  While we can increase the minimum wage hourly rate or increase wages generally, that does not achieve much for a worker on a low-hours contract in terms of their overall situation.  How important is dealing with precarious work and under-employment when dealing with the issue of low pay and in-work poverty?</p> <p>  Finally, the employer organisations appear to be saying that we should continue building an economy on low pay.  They are against increasing the overall tax take, despite the fact that we have one of the lowest levels of tax take in the EU.  They are also against wage-setting mechanisms and collective bargaining.  Are there examples of countries that have much better and more robust employment legislation, better and fairer progressive taxation systems and better wages that are more competitive than us?  Where do we fit in competitiveness terms given that we have such high levels of low pay, low levels of overall taxation and rate very badly in respect of weak wage-setting mechanisms?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-03a.35" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Light" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015030300002#M00300"><p>I will attempt to answer all of the questions.  The Senator spoke first about the responsibility of employers.  Employers are very good at telling us what is not their responsibility.</p><p>As we argue in the submission, it is about time that employers stepped up to the plate and told us what they are responsible for.  It is not too big a call to ask them to create the best possible secure employment that they can on the cusp of a recovering economy.  That was clearly enshrined in our submission.</p><p> I know my colleagues will pick up on other points in respect of current thresholds in place.  Over the course of the past week, the low pay commission has come into vogue with respect to whether it would be appropriate to increase the statutory minimum wage.  The model is that if any movement is to be achieved, it would be done with an evidence-based process.  From the Mandate perspective, I share the views of the relevant Minister and we have an aspiration for the wage to be increased appropriately at the earliest possible time.</p><p> With regard to the relationship between a living wage and a minimum wage and whether both can be enshrined in legislation, there is nothing wrong with being able to demonstrate clearly how this can done, as it has been quite recently by groups such as Vincentian Partnership.  It demonstrated what it takes to have a basic standard of living which allows a person and family to exist in a society.  Society means nothing if a person cannot live in a very basic form within it.  The movement in this respect is important and we keep this as a clear aspiration.  We are moving on a very deliberate path towards the creation of a living wage.</p><p> I am confident my colleagues will pick up the other issues I have not addressed.  There is no danger in having a minimum wage and seeking to increase it in an appropriate and timely fashion.  We have had the current legislation for a number of years, which has a clear provision for employers to be able to argue inability-to-pay clauses.  I ask members to consider the number of cases which have come before a court sustaining that argument.  There have been very few, and one could count them on the fingers on one hand.  That tells us much.  There is much bluff and bluster about whether we should have a minimum wage and if it should be increased.  This is an evidence-based process so if a business can prove it cannot pay the minimum wage, it can make a case.  Very few of them do that.</p></speech>

Over recent weeks, Government spokespersons have pointed to the fact that a considerable number of jobs recently created have been full-time posts.  The problem with under-employment is that people are already trapped in existing jobs, so there is a real danger that we will miss them and take our eye off that ball.  We should ensure that, wherever possible, we should try to improve the lot of people who are under-employed.  Unfortunately, I did not get to read out a significant part of our submission which seeks the introduction of a code of practice that allows meaningful access to full-time employment for people who are currently under-employed or who are part-time workers.  That is already in an existing code of practice from 2001, which was enshrined in an EU directive as far back as 1997 and transposed into Irish law in 2001.  One of the clauses has been largely ignored and so has the opposite effect of what was intended.  Therefore, the code of practice has been used to drive people from full-time work back to part-time work.  Now is the time to strip out that commitment and give it status in its own right, as well as developing meaningful codes of practice.  That would help in a major way in the battle against under-employment and helping those trapped in it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-03a.39" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jimmy Kelly" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015030300002#N00400"><p>The Senator asked what employers have to say.  We are well aware of statements from employers organisations fitting what the Senator described.  If we were to wait for the day when employers announced that they would introduce a living wage, it would never happen.  Employers are driven by other motives, and trade unions are seeking to have decency implemented in workplaces.  If we are to move towards having a living wage, we must start with improvements in the minimum wage.</p><p>We believe there should be an immediate increase of &euro;1 per hour in the minimum wage.  As stated by Mr. Light, zero hours contracts do not provide people with a decent week's wages.  A person on a zero hours contract in respect of which he or she is being paid the minimum wage might only get a decent wage for a few weeks at a time.  My sister works in Dunnes Stores.  Often a person is employed on a full-time basis, for which he or she gets full pay for a couple of weeks, only to be told at short notice that he or she is only required one particular day the following week, despite that he or she has to meet the same financial commitments.  This is intolerable for workers and is leading to what has been described as in-work poverty.  I am old enough to remember that when a person got a job, it meant he or she got some financial independence.  That is what work is all about.  It is not about becoming a millionaire.  Now people are being driven to having to take on two jobs to have a decent standard of living.  The situation will become even more intolerable unless there is a move to increase the minimum wage to that of a living wage.  To move us in this direction, Government procurement contracts need to start with that type of principle.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-03a.41" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John King" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015030300002#O00200"><p>SIPTU supports the call for an increase in the minimum wage and for the introduction of a living wage.  However, a couple of factors must be borne in mind.  First, when the minimum wage was first introduced, the then Minister declared that it needed to be maintained at two-thirds of the median wage.  It is currently probably less than 50% of the median wage.  Had the line proposed by the Minister been held, it would now be between &euro;10.40 and &euro;10.80 per hour.  Second, Ireland is one of two EU member states that have not increased their national minimum wage in the past seven or eight years.  The only country that has not increased the earnings of the poorest of the poor in its country is Greece.</p> <p>  In terms of impact, people on the current minimum wage are unable to participate in society.  It leads to poverty, social deprivation and so on.  It also means people cannot provide for their means never mind their wants.  It means that a cohort of our people are struggling to survive every week to provide the basic means for themselves and their families.  In regard to what would happen if the minimum wage was increased, it should be borne in mind that the minimum wage is not an ideal measure for labour cost competitiveness.  In this regard, other things must be factored in, including employer PRSI contribution costs.  Ireland has one of the lowest employer PRSI contribution costs.  While the minimum wage in some countries might be slightly below or above ours, employer PRSI contributions in those countries are significantly higher.  As stated earlier by one of my colleagues, and this is evidenced in various submissions made, there are other structural labour costs that tend to be of more interest to employer groups than the rate of pay.</p> <p>  The issue of under-employment and wage-setting mechanisms is addressed in our submission.  The national minimum wage is the minimum threshold of decency that should be extended to all people in this country.  However, it deals only with the proposed hourly rate of pay.  We believe that the Oireachtas should grapple with the issue of vested interests and employer groups not co-operating with the wage-setting mechanisms, because they enable workers to have some kind of equal bargaining relationship with their employers in setting reasonable hours, overtime rates and minimum sick pay in the event of their falling sick in order that they do not have to rely on State supports and so on.</p><p>It is evident that, in most of the European countries, even in countries where there are no national minimum wage rates, workers in sectors of those economies tend to be covered by sectoral collective bargaining agreements.  Where employers are refusing to co-operate with Oireachtas policy that workers should be covered by way of sectoral mechanisms, we ask the committee to help find the means by which the Labour Court can be guided to deal with the issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-03a.43" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1071" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015030300002#P00200"><p>I thank those who have made presentations.  Mr. Kelly gave the figure of a &euro;13 billion fall in household consumption from 2008 to 2012, which is massive.  That hit the sectors SIPTU is focusing on, primarily retail services, and that figure of &euro;13 billion has not been made since 2012.  In that context, how can the loss be made up?  What would they say to employers who say their hands are tied by that loss?  The unions would say we have to look at other issues in the hotel and hospitality sector, such as loans and so on, but I would like to focus on that one issue.</p><p>Mr. Light commented that many employers are prepared to do the right thing by their employees and they have returned &euro;30 million to the domestic economy through pay increases that the unions have negotiated.  Will he explain what is the common denominator with regard to those employers?  With regard to the employer whose name we are not allowed to mention, Mandate has a survey in December's <i>Shopfloor</i>which showed that 76% of staff in that organisation are, in the phrase Mr. Light uses, on &quot;flexible contracts&quot;, and Mr. Kelly summed up what that means.  Some 88% of them feel their hours were not fairly distributed and 85% said insecurity over hours and rostering is used as a method of control.  That speaks to me of zero-hour contracts being, as I described them previously, like the situation of the navvies in England.  What work are the unions doing around that to bring a degree of fairness or to get to the fair and decent workplace?  I put that question to the three witnesses as they all deal with that area.</p><p>To conclude, I point out that the cost of employers' PRSI contributions was doubled overnight on 1 January 2013, or perhaps 2014, as part of a jobs initiative.  Many employers were not even given that information until they got their wages bills in that first year, yet many of them just took it on board.</p></speech>

However, I would make these points.  First, we are now at the beginning of a different type of position.  We are seeing wage increases and a large part of this is because of trade unions working with their members in workplaces and negotiating pay increases.  Second, employment is starting to rise.  Third, the Government has ended nominal austerity.  In other words, it has stopped imposing costs on both the household and business sectors.  Of course, Unite and other trade unions have been saying that if it had done this much earlier, we might have been getting out of the recession earlier.</p> <p>  There are two processes happening which could vindicate the promotion of wages.  First, we have a more promising economic and fiscal background.  Second, we would make the point that where companies can pay a minimum wage or a JLC rate that is struck, they will be able to assist those firms which are unable to pay and, therefore, take a postponement under the minimum wage and JLC legislation.  If firms that can afford to pay do not pay, they hurt a number of sectors.  Obviously, they hurt the workers, who do not get the pay, they hurt the Exchequer, they hurt the wider economy due to depressed demand, and they also hurt those other businesses that are reliant upon the spending power of workers.  In the first instance, we are entering a different economic and fiscal cycle.</p><p>Second, it is about ensuring that those companies that can pay the increase do so and, thus, help out those companies who badly need that spending power.</p></speech>

However, I would tie that response to my earlier commentary regarding the employees in certain sectors of the economy who, because of the low levels of trade union density and a lack of advanced forms of collective bargaining therein, have no real means by which they can influence the conditions under which they are forced to work.  We believe that the Oireachtas should insist by way of policy that workers in particular sectors are covered by collective agreements, be that joint labour committee or registered employment agreements, so that employers are not allowed to exercise a veto and thereby affect workers' peace.  It is fundamental that vested interest groups are being allowed to cherry-pick the Oireachtas policies with which they want to comply.  We believe the Oireachtas needs to deal with this issue.  We believe also that it is only through the joint labour committee structure that workers will have an opportunity to influence their working conditions and ensure they get proper, decent and regular hours of work.</p></speech>

If the JLC structure is so good when then was it necessary to introduce legislation around the minimum wage?</p></speech>

This dates back to the Trade Disputes Act 1906.  However, the joint labour committee system does not cover every worker in the economy.  It covers only particular sectors of the economy.  It is necessary that the minimum wage apply in at least those sectors of the economy that are not covered by a joint labour committee.  During the period between the introduction of the minimum wage in 2000 and the collapse of the JLC system in 2011, only a small percentage of the Irish workforce was covered by the national minimum wage.  Following the troika process in 2010 and the High Court decision in this area, tens of thousands of workers failed to be covered by that protection.  They lost all of their conditions of employment and were collapsed to levels of the national minimum wage.  We want to put in place forms of engagement for those workers which ensure they get minimum legally enforceable conditions of employment, which is more than just about the minimum hourly rate of pay.  Within this collective bargaining process can begin a process of engagement with employers within industries to bring people, by agreement, towards a living wage as distinct from &euro;8.65 per hour with no frills attached.</p> <p>  On the PRSI issue, the Government introduced a favourable PRSI rate, in addition to the VAT rate, for employers whose workers earn less than &euro;356 per week.  In other words, employers would pay less PRSI in respect of employees earning less than &euro;356 per week.  The evidence is that this facilitated a move towards the creation of part-time employment, which is one of the reasons for the level of under-employment and incentivised zero-hour type contracts.  While this was reversed in 2014 significant damage had been already done to people on full-time contracts, in that they lost hours and were displaced.  My commentary in regard to Ireland's PRSI levels relative to our European partners stack up, notwithstanding that which may have taken place with the PRSI rate.</p><p>Employers in this jurisdiction pay much less than their counterparts in most of our European Union trading partners.</p></speech>

The Deputy referred to the common denominator in respect of employers who are willing to deal with trade unions and do the right thing by their employees.  The common denominator is that they agree to sit down with the trade union and, in doing so, they do the responsible and morally correct thing by their employees.  Long before any collective bargaining legislation has to be placed on the Statute Book, they agree to be seen to do the right thing by coming to the table willingly and openly.  There is no doubt that without this type of attitude and approach, not much headway will be made in dealing with the issues of low paid workers.</p> <p>  On the key measures, the trade unions believe the awards we have achieved have been understated.  Over the past two years, some &euro;30 million has gone back into the economy and not only directly benefited low paid workers and their dependants, but delivered the many other benefits for the economy highlighted by my colleagues.  This is a crucial issue. </p> <p>  We must be careful, in the more general and open debate that is taking place on decency thresholds, whether it is the statutory minimum wage or a living wage, to apply the following simple mathematical formula: the hourly rate multiplied by weekly hours equals the wage.  We can become much too narrowly focused and claim an increase of 20 or 30 cent in this or that rate is great but the reality encountered by low paid workers in the workplace is that employers can completely mitigate the benefit of any increase with the stroke of a pen.  The simple way to do this is by reducing hours of employment or in some cases eliminating them.  The key element in any debate is to place this formula on the table and examine the issue in a holistic fashion.  We must not rely excessively on increases in rates.  While such increases are important, we must look beyond them at the various component parts.    </p> <p>  While I do not propose to refer to a specific employer by name, everyone present will know which company I am talking about.  What we have to do to bring about engagement----- </p></speech>

The purpose of this meeting is to hear from the witnesses about the reality of low pay for many workers.  A number of highly profitable companies are employing people on low hour contracts.  It is outrageous that witnesses are not allowed to discuss that issue because it is the elephant in the room.  Furthermore, what is being said would also be said outside this hearing.</p><p>I fail to see why there is any difficulty with any of the witnesses either naming the organisation involved or talking about it because it makes a mockery of what we are trying to do if we put a muzzle on people who come into the hearing.</p></speech>

If I may, I will finish the substantive point in respect of what we have to do.  It is a fact that we have to ballot our members.  It is a fact that the decision will be known next Friday and it is a fact that it is highly undesirable that we had to go to that length to have a major retailer come to the table and discuss legitimate issues of concern with us.

These are people who are working full-time.  On a humanitarian level alone, there is a necessity to focus on the issue of low pay.  We have an exceptionally uneven wage scale in Ireland in terms of the highs and lows and I believe the minimum wage is an extremely important part of that.  I agree with some of the speakers that it is not the only issue.  There are the major issues of public services, tax, conditions of employment and purchasing power.  We have a low pay commission, not a minimum wage commission, and if the low pay commission was to do what it says and pass the advertising standards, it would look at all those issues that feed into low pay and make recommendations to the State on what should be done to alleviate this humanitarian disaster in society.  It is not only employees who are on low pay.  In certain scenarios there are employers who are on low pay.  One of their concerns is the relationship between the minimum wage and unemployment.</p> <p>  In an effort to create an evidence-based discussion, is there any research of which the representatives are aware that either negates or suggests there is a clear relationship between the minimum wage and people losing their jobs?  We know many people are on the minimum wage, as highlighted by Mr. Gerry Light.  There are also many people on the minimum wage working for very profitable businesses.  A committee like this or an executive should be able to identify how many people on the minimum wage work for companies that cannot afford anything more than the minimum wage and how many work for extremely profitable businesses that could easily afford to compensate above the minimum wage.</p> <p>  I had a look at the Small Firms Association document.  There appears to be a conflict about evidence from Mr. Michael Taft on the purchasing power element of low pay.  Mr. Michael Taft stated that when purchasing power is taken into consideration, low pay is even lower in the State.  Obviously the Small Firms Association has stated that is not the case.  Can Mr. Taft identify where the evidence for his statement has come from and we will speak to the Small Firms Association on the issue?</p> <p>  My final point is on purchasing power.  The last thing we want is wage inflation which leads to a reduction in purchasing power, where workers are no better off but wages have nominally increased within society.</p><p>Representatives of the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, appeared before the committee last week and made a good point in setting out that if the State provided proper public services, it would mean that the living wage could be reduced.  The costs of all our public services put pressure on families' wage resources.  In what ways do the representatives of the unions believe that purchasing power could be increased within the economy, other than by increasing the minimum wage, which I would support?</p></speech>

The vast majority of them, as we know from the figures that have been released, are low paid.  A far bigger percentage of workers are on rates of pay below the medium pay level and certainly below the average level than are on rates of pay above it.  They have not received a pay increase.  It is only right that workers, and low paid workers in particular, should benefit from the recovery that is taking place.</p> <p>  The taxation issue or the issue of the development of public services is a much bigger question.  We want there to be progressive taxation system that would be capable of funding the delivery of proper, decent public services for all our citizens.  I believe it was the Taoiseach who said last week that work should pay.  We believe there should be a clear distinction between the two and that those who are required to rely on public services should have the standard of public services we all deserve in the 21st century.  Our view is that people who go out to work deserve to be treated with dignity and respect and paid properly for the work that they do.  </p> <p>  As I understand it, the low pay commission at this stage will be used as a means to guide Government policy on what the minimum wage rate should be.  In that context, reference is also made to "and related matters".  It will be interesting to see the scope it will have in interpreting what related matters might be.  In conjunction with that, a review is being carried out by, I believe, the University of Limerick on the zero-hour contracts.  Facilities are now provided, both in the minimum wage legislation and in the reform agenda for the reintroduction of the joint labour committee system, for employers to be able to plead inability to pay in certain circumstances.  Workers in this economy have carried the brunt of the adjustment necessary by way of income reduction or a reduction in spending power and so on.  That has led to some of the stagnation that has taken place within the domestic economy.  All of our European partners, bar one, saw the sense in maintaining consumer demand in their domestic economies and all of them, bar one, increased their minimum wage.  A strategy of not increasing wages, or reducing wages or take-home pay, is not only detrimental to the interests of the workers, but it is also counter-productive to the maintenance and creation of demand in the economy, which will be essential if we are to sustain a recovery from this crisis.</p></speech>

The notion of low pay and precarious work conditions are bad enough but when it is experienced in profitable companies, it is particularly galling.  For far too long and far too often the value and output of the contribution of workers has been conveniently set aside.  We, and particularly employers, talk about competitiveness at every opportunity and we talk about productivity levels, but some of the biggest and most profitable corporations in this world are retail operations.</p><p>They produce billions every year in both turnover and profit.  We must look at that issue, point the finger and ask the questions, where appropriate, of those who can clearly pay but resist doing so, as well as of those who may have a genuine case.  As I said earlier, the only place one can make such a case is around the table, with employers facing workers' representatives.  Ultimately, if there is disagreement, then the institutions of the State can be called on to make a call on the situation.  There is nothing wrong with that; it is a fundamentally safe way to conduct business.  </p><p> A question was asked as to whether there is any evidence to support the view that minimum wage legislation leads or contributes to higher unemployment levels.  I have said publicly many times that it is not in any trade union's interests to force employers into a room and get them to pay money that they do not have because that will ultimately end up in the loss of employment and the closure of businesses.  Why would one do that?  The potential for higher levels of unemployment can be adequately catered for within the current structures that exist, namely, the inability to pay clause.  Employers can go to court and let the most appropriate body in the land make the judgment call.  If an employer genuinely believes that having to pay the minimum wage or honouring some other commitment will be detrimental to his or her business, he or she can make that case and let the court make the decision.  That is a very safe mechanism and whether we have credible evidence for or against the argument, that safety net is there.  However, as I said earlier, it  is a mechanism that is very rarely used for very obvious reasons.</p></speech>

All of the scary monsters put forward by employers about what will happen when we move in the direction of decent pay do not stack up.  Let us look at what we have created in this proud republic of ours.  Not so long ago we had full employment, an end to forced emigration and the start of inward migration for the first time.  We moved into that good space and nobody can say that the crash and crisis was linked to workers being paid proper wages.  It was based on greed, the property bubble and the behaviour of the banks.  None of it was connected to workers being treated decently.  We are making an argument which fits in with what Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n described, in terms of consumer demand being needed at local level.  I try to relate what we discuss with what happens locally in terms of local economies and local communities.  Moving in this direction not only achieves what my colleagues have described in terms of decency at work, but it also generates spending at local level through increased consumer demand.  These are the benefits upon which we must focus, rather than suggestions that the world will end if workers start getting paid properly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-03a.71" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Taft" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015030300002#U00300"><p>I wish to cover three points briefly.  In terms of studies or analyses of the impact of an increase in the minimum wage on unemployment, originally such analyses were very model-driven, with supply and demand curves for wages.  The assumption was that the more expensive labour became, the less demand there would be for it; in other words, increases in wages would result in rising unemployment.  This assumption was superseded some time in the 1970s and 1980s when economists left their desks, went out into the real world and actually analysed what was going on in an empirical sense.  They found that raising the minimum wage or the statutory wage floors had very little impact on employment.  It is hard to know exactly where the wage increase fits in because there is a lot of noise in the labour market but essentially, they found nothing.  There was no negative impact and I can supply some of those studies to the committee.</p><p> The second issue is about where we took our information from.  As the committee can see in the notes, the information on hourly compensation was taken from EUROSTAT's national accounts.</p><p> In terms of the purchasing power parity, I am sorry I did not footnote this but I will forward our tables to the committee.  The purchasing power parity was also taken from EUROSTAT.  It refers to each country that equates to the actual individual consumption, which is the preferred parity for our workers' wages.  I will forward on the data.  </p><p> Finally, if we replace collective provision with private provision, then we should not be surprised that prices will rise and the reverse is the case.  For instance, recently an RTE programme compared public services provided by  French and Irish hospitals and it was shown that it costs &euro;7 for a person to go to a GP in France.  If employee compensation was increased to provide for health care, and in most EU countries the majority of health care is expended through social insurance and employee compensation and not through the Exchequer, we can see the benefit of falling GP costs and, similarly, with child care.  We all know of the situation where child care costs between &euro;100 and &euro;200 per month because it is provided as part of public service provision rather than &euro;1,000 per month, and upwards, in the private sector.</p><p> There is an ability and we would invite employers to consider the following.  A stronger, collective provision of services for people will mean that they do not have to demand as high a wage.  If one does not pay out &euro;1,000 per month, rather &euro;100 or &euro;200 per month, then a dynamic will be generated in wage setting.  One of the problems we had was that wages rose in the pre-crisis period because they had to keep up with inflation, especially inflation induced by housing.  If we can reach equilibrium whereby more of those services are provided through collective provision, we can have wage structures which are more egalitarian, promote living standards, remove in-work poverty and still provide a basis of a profitability for employers.</p></speech>

He also referred slightly to who is behind statistics and that sometimes people get caught up in words like "underemployment" that do not explain exactly what it means.  The real term should be "involuntary part-time".  They are not workers who work part-time.  They are workers who seek more hours but cannot access them.  I will explain the impact such a situation has on workers.  At present, 147,000 workers in this economy work involuntary part-time and cannot access more hours because of a number of reasons, which I will go into shortly.  The current figure of 147,000 represents a 60% increase on the number for 2008.  The most recent statistics shows that as a percentage of the entire workforce, we used to have 0.4% of the workforce as involuntary part-time or underemployed but that percentage has risen to 7.8%.  Ireland was the best country in the EU 15 countries for underemployment, but now we are the second worst in that group.  The reason is twofold.  The first reason is a lack of statutory protections.  As Mr. Light alluded to earlier, the part-time worker directive was never fully implemented.  That means workers do not have a code of practice in place at the moment to seek more hours when they become available on a shopfloor, for instance.</p> <p>  Other EU countries have a contract called an honest contract.  For example, if a person gets a ten-hour contract but is regularly asked to work 15 hours, or one is regularly working 25 hours, the excess hours above ten hours are paid at a rate of time and a half.  That means an employer is incentivised into giving his or her employee an honest contract.  That means it would be cheaper for employers to increase a worker's hours to 25 rather than pay the 15 extra hours worked at a time and a half rate of pay.  </p> <p>  As people will be aware, Ireland also has very weak collective bargaining laws.  As  Mr. Light mentioned earlier, that has led to a situation of collective bargaining agreement and negotiation rights with employers.</p><p>Not only have we managed to win &euro;30 million in pay increases, as mentioned earlier, but the increase to the State was &euro;3 million, when one takes into account employer PRSI contributions, not to mention the reductions in social welfare transfers.  We also said in our submission that there is increased revenue through VAT, income tax and employees' PRSI.  Those workers in a position to bargain collectively and get better pay and terms and conditions have made a massive contribution to the State.</p><p> At the moment we have neither strong statutory protections for workers nor full collective bargaining rights.  The 15 other EU states are ahead of us in respect of involuntary part-time positions, because they offer at least either strong statutory protection or access to robust collective bargaining mechanisms.  The committee might consider that.</p></speech>

The witnesses should accept that each time the union demands more money from an employer, it weakens the chance of that employer taking on more employees.  That cannot be in the unions&rsquo; interest or the employees&rsquo; interest.  It is much more important they have a job than that they take so much money off the employer they put the company out of business.</p> <p>  In my company many years ago the question of a national pay rise cropped up.  We decided we wanted the best employees to come to us.  We automatically paid everybody an increase.  Other employers, our competitors and the employers&rsquo; organisations criticised it.  Within a very short time ours was the place where people wanted to work.  They came to us and their brothers, sisters, cousins and neighbours tried to get jobs with us.  I can think of five of our non-Irish competitors which went the other way and cut costs.  They were all gone within ten years.  This case is not being taken into account.  Every time the unions pressurise an employer to pay costs that make him less competitive, they damage his opportunity to employ more people and to pay more.  What we did many years ago worked very well.  We paid more and became the best employer.</p> <p>  It happened last week in the United States where Walmart, the biggest retailer in the world, announced that it would give an increase to its 500,000 employees.  It gave as the reason that it wanted the best employees.  That was not its policy in the past.  That is the case the unions should make, rather than forcing it on employers which are having difficulty now, as many are.  The unions could find a different way of encouraging them to succeed, and I take Mr. Light&rsquo;s point that very few have actually gone to the point of claiming inability to pay.  The way to go about it is to encourage the employer to do a better job, to get the best employees, to pay more and I believe they will succeed on that basis.  The living wage concept is fine but the minimum wage is the wrong direction.  The unions should change their attitude.  That is a comment for all the witnesses.</p></speech>

With the greatest respect, I think the Senator&rsquo;s proposal to us today is utopian in the extreme.</p><p>I refer to it in our submission.  It suggests that a job at any cost strategy is the way to go.  Surely we have to have regard to the quality of the employment we are creating.  The number one consideration must be that in an effort to take people off social welfare and put them back into work, we do not worsen their lot.  That can happen if we have little or no regard for the quality of employment.  Work must pay and must be seen to pay.</p><p> I will refer to an entity outside of the jurisdiction.  The Chairman can pull me up on that but Senator Quinn named it and he was not pulled up.  I refer to Walmart.  As a result of the pressures in recent years and the general thrust generated by society for fairness and decency, it has done what it did last week.  I could not believe what happened and I wiped my eyes when I read the article.  For many years the labour unions in America have been following the company and attempting to get it to do the right thing, at significant expense to them.  There is now a chink of light at the end of the tunnel as a result of the lobbying that was carried out in respect of campaigns around decency and fairness.</p><p> I will make a final point.  We have not come before the committee to look for a pay increase on behalf of our members.  This is a societal issue.  We are proposing a pay increase which will be applied to all workers who find themselves in part-time, low-paid and precarious work.  We are trying to do the right thing for them.  We are prepared to engage with the relevant employers that do business with us and allow us, as much as they will allow, to make the case for it.</p><p> I have said on a number of occasions that if we fail to agree, we will go to the Labour Court and let it make the decision.  That is crucially important.  This issue is broader than the trade unions.  It is about the society we are looking to build as we emerge slowly from the years of doom and gloom into a better place for all of our citizens, not just those who are employed but for everybody.</p></speech>

It may not be a surprise to him that I am diametrically opposed to them.  As I have stated repeatedly, all low-paid workers and the vast majority of other workers in our economy have gone without a pay increase for a significant period and have shouldered a significant burden in terms of the adjustment in our economy.  I do not want to go any further into the matter.  There are different views.</p> <p>  We ask that where the Oireachtas approves and decides on policy, low-paid workers in certain sectors of the economy should be covered by collective bargaining agreements to give them some equality of influence in their bargaining power with employers.  Some employers refuse to engage.  We ask the Oireachtas not to accept that and to define the means by which the Labour Court is guided to deal with that.  Interested groups have been before the committee which are happy to take revenue out of our hard-pressed Exchequer at a cost of some &euro;350 million per year and take from the State by way of what is paid to Bord F&aacute;ilte and other organisations to fund their advertising campaigns and so on.  They gladly take favourable Government policies, yet refuse to accept others.  Within the JLC structure is the means by which engagement can take place to reach agreement on issues about pay and conditions of employment.</p></speech>

I tried to equate the &euro;350 million which has to be found through the Exchequer to implement the reduction in the VAT rate for the tourism sector and associated industries since 2011, plus the approximately &euro;300 million or &euro;350 million spent each year on subsidising people in work through family income supplement.  A minimum of &euro;2 billion of taxpayers' money has been spent in the past three years on subsidising work directly and indirectly.</p><p>A minimum of &euro;2 billion of taxpayers' money has been spent in the past three years subsidising work, directly and indirectly.  As Mr. Michael Taft said earlier, if there were better and less costly public services, there might be &euro;2 billion more to go towards reducing what people have to pay.  It would help, in this context, if we did not have to subsidise work.  <br/><br/>Can I ask each of the representatives for a comment on the reduction in the VAT rate?  It has obviously done some good - nobody can say it has not.  I have a question for Mr. John King.  I read an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>about a PricewaterhouseCoopers report which stated that, by next year, Dublin hotel rates would return to pre-2007 levels.  This is the very same sector we are subsidising to the tune of &euro;350 million and the same sector which is refusing to engage in improving the working conditions and rates of pay for people who work in the sector, many of whom are in the &euro;8.65 per hour category and who do not get a full week's work.  <br/><br/>In the context of the point about inaction through the JLC mechanism, can the witnesses elaborate on what exactly they meant by saying the Labour Court could be guided to deal with sectors which do not engage?</p></speech>

The attitude to the VAT rate is typical and we express this view in our submission.  It is not true of every employer but it certainly seems that many of them want to have it every way.  It raises the question of why we needed a statutory minimum wage and why, now, we are having a worthwhile discussion around the living wage.  It is necessary because swathes of workers cannot properly bargain within their industry or sector.  If an employer group within a particular sector is given advantageous or favourable treatment, such as by way of a reduced VAT rate, there has to be a dividend for everybody, not just for some.  Employers cannot continually and robustly argue against meaningful collective negotiating mechanisms at the same time as arguing against the need for a statutory minimum wage or a living wage.  Do they ever ask themselves why we need such things?  They argue against every measure which is socially and morally progressive.  Ultimately, it leads back to those arguments put forward at the beginning of the meeting.  One of the consequential effects of those arguments is to illustrate the need for a living wage and a minimum wage in the first place.</p></speech>

In other words, it is what governments do when a recession hits.  The British Government did it and, back in 2008, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions called for the Irish Government to consider it.  It is a Keynesian tool used by governments whenever they get into this type of situation.  There is nothing wrong with it <i>per se</i>and it can be very effective when it is targeted.  However, an implied social contract is involved.  In other words, people who receive benefits have responsibilities.  If the social contract is not adhered to, and if one party decides, &quot;I will take all the benefit but will not treat the economy, the workers or the exchequer correctly and, instead, I will grab all I can&quot;, that person fails to realise that the reason they got the benefit in the first place was because it was a social intervention in which we all share.  The committee may wish to put questions to employers on the VAT reduction and the fact that, having received benefits through a number of policy instruments, they also have a social responsibility to ensure those benefits extend to everybody.  That is the only way the entire economy benefits.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-03a.89" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John King" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015030300002#Y00400"><p>I will try to avoid being repetitive.  When the VAT rate was introduced in 2011, it was a time when evidence from the CSO suggested the sector had turned a corner.</p><p>Employment was starting to grow and there was an increased number of tourists.  There is no great evidence that the VAT reduction was passed on to any significant extent by way of price reduction, and we certainly know that the employees did not benefit from it.  This was introduced at the same time that the sectors were able to benefit from the reduced employers PRSI rate, where their employees earned less than &euro;356.  That is what led to a lot of the boom in employment.  When one digs down into those figures, one can see that a lot of the growth in employment in the industries within those particular timeframes was in part-time employment.</p><p> To recap, what I say is somewhat repetitive in relation to what Mr. Taft said in that where industries or sectors are able to avail of favourable Government policy, they should, equally, be required to comply with Government policy in relation to other matters.  I remind the committee that by not co-operating with this piece of Oireachtas policy, they are actually bringing the Irish State into disrepute with a signed International Labour Organization, ILO, convention relating to workers in hotels, restaurants and similar establishments, which states the best method to determine rights for workers in these industries is by way of a collective bargained agreement.  I put it to the Oireachtas that within the ILO there is specific reference to the development of skills and so on in the hospitality sector.  Since the collapse of the joint labour committee, JLC, system, the majority of pay rates have fallen to &euro;8.65 an hour.  It is not surprising to us but it might be surprising to the committee that at the same time the employers are saying they do not want to pay any more than &euro;8.65 an hour and they do not want the JLC, they are the apprenticeship commission bemoaning the fact that they cannot attract good calibre craftspeople such as chefs into the industry.  That is no wonder considering they will not agree to engage in order to pay them a decent wage with decent conditions of employment.</p><p> On the point about the Labour Court being guided, the system of industrial relations in Ireland under the 1946 Act is based on voluntarism.  The 1946 Act provides the basis for the joint labour committee system.  The intent of it is that it produces what is known as an employment regulation order, ERO, which is a legally binding document.  At the start of the process, the initial engagement is voluntary.  What we are saying is that there are other aspects of industrial relations in this jurisdiction that specify that where an employer refuses to engage voluntarily, the Labour Court is guided to be able to deal with the issue.  I will outline two references in that regard.  For instance, under the Industrial Relations Act 1969, if a union requests a meeting with an employer and it refuses to engage, the union can refer the matter to the Labour Court under section 20(1) and the Labour Court will hear the case whether the employer shows up.  The employer is invited to participate and will be asked for his or her views or opinions and to make a submission, but the Labour Court is guided to deal with the issue if the employer refuses to engage voluntarily.  That means the employees get an opportunity to at least have their case heard under the industrial relations mechanism provided by the State.</p><p> Under the 1969 Act, section 11 enabled the Labour Court to set fair employment rules following consultation with representatives of employers, workers and industries.  It fell off the Statute Book in the 1990 Act and we ask the committee to recommend to the Government that the measure be re-enacted so as to say that if employers decide they do not wish to voluntarily engage, which is their right, then the Oireachtas should not accept that because it is Government policy that there would be such a mechanism and that it will find a way to guide the Labour Court to do it.</p><p>This guidance of the Labour Court could be done under the provisions of section 11 of the 1969 Act.  The section would enable the Labour Court to deal with the issue and also allow the Oireachtas to implement its policy of ensuring low paid workers are covered by the protections of a joint labour committee.</p></speech>

I hope she has as much success as her predecessor, the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English.</p> <p>  I listened with a certain amount of amusement to the contribution of the previous delegation and the proceedings at the recent party conferences.  This is the year of the sheep in China but to many in Ireland, 2015 appears to be the year of the pay rise.  Rather than it being the year of increased productivity, tax equality for the self-employed or increased competitiveness, it is the year of the wage increase, for which small businesses and businesses in general are expected to pick up the tab.</p><p>I remind the committee that small businesses throughout the country do not have a representative on the low pay commission, bearing in mind that it is many small business people who will be picking up the tab.  I firmly believe that the low pay commission is but a fig leaf for an increase in the minimum wage, and I have grave concerns about that.  It is basically an increase in the cost of production.  This is the Government reneging on its responsibility in terms of the redistribution of wealth.  Businesses are not about wealth redistribution - we are about creating jobs and creating wealth for distribution.  I heard the previous union speaker say that if businesses have an inability to pay they should go the Labour Court.  The reason business people do not go to the Labour Court in some cases is embarrassment about their inability to pay; instead, they will make a couple of people redundant.  That is what will happen on this occasion also.  Some 4.7% of the population are on the minimum wage.  They will be the first in line for the door.  For the unemployed who are trying to get jobs, this is a missed opportunity to give them jobs.  I met people from two companies last week in preparation for this meeting.  One who works in the food business said that due to costs he would automate his business.  The balance will move towards automation - in other words, redundancies.  The other company had nobody on the minimum wage but if it went up it would have people on it, and the owner said he would be forced to make people on the higher rate redundant.  As an employer I have grave concerns that this is what is going to happen.  There will be another whopping increase of, I think, &euro;1.  That is &euro;40 per employee, and for 40 employees this amounts to massive increased costs for employers.  I will invite Ms Patricia Callan to go into the more detailed aspect of our presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-03a.97" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia Callan" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015030300002#CC00200"><p>Our submission has been circulated.  Essentially, the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 is very clear in terms of what one is meant to consider in determining that rate.  In our submission we have gone through each issue one by one and set out the reason we feel it is a valid argument for not having an increase in the minimum wage at this moment in time.  We have gone further, arguing that we should freeze the minimum wage at its current rate so that it is not up for discussion for the next three years.  The reason we have taken this decision is that there is a very strong sense that growth is returning to the economy, but from our members' perspectives it is all about stability, getting one's feet on the ground again and rebuilding the balance sheets.  Many people are still heavily in debt and have not been paying themselves as they are trying to invest in the business again, and they really cannot have cost increases imposed upon them.  This is the nub of the issue and it is where it differs from other discussions about pay rates.   If businesses are levied with an increase in the national minimum wage there are no productive gains, so it is actually just a cost.  It is very hard for any business operating on low margins to absorb costs at that level.</p> <p>  In terms of the low pay commission, as our chairman has mentioned, we were disappointed, given that many of our members who put themselves forward - real business people who are running real enterprises and employing people on the minimum wage - were not selected.  The process was a written application and selection.  There were no interviews and there was no sense on our side that those involved were trying to have the low pay sectors represented or, on the other side, low-paid workers.  Where can they be seen?  We need to have another look at the commission.  I am concerned that if we establish this body and we are all meant to support it, it has to be independent and outside politics.  We have to stop senior politicians from saying they expect a &euro;1 increase.  One cannot expect something if one puts it into the hands of an independent commission.  Certainly, we need serious reassurances as a country about the process of the low pay commission. </p> <p>  I will take the committee briefly through the review methodology.  In terms of the analysis - I am aware of this from the previous presentation - if people want more detailed charts and sources, we can forward them.  In essence, we did an assessment of inflation, which is one of the biggest indicators.  People always say one has to keep pace with the cost of living but, in fact, at the end of 2014 the cost of living in Ireland was 0.6% below 2008 levels.</p><p>Therefore, there is no reason to say that the minimum wage should be increased at this time.  We have calculated that the minimum wage is 19% above the level established at the time of its introduction.  If it had risen in line with inflation it would be just &euro;7.  By any metric, the minimum wage rate is very good compared to the cost of living index.</p><p> In terms of the movement in earnings of employees, all the unions have said that the race to the bottom is terrible, but during the crisis the number of people on the minimum wage fell.  Therefore, that is not a valid claim.  Some 4.7% of the workforce were on the national minimum wage at the end of quarter two of 2014, compared to the 2007 estimate of 4.9%.  </p><p> We have also done an assessment in the context of median wages.  Much of the discussion in the literature is about this concept, in that the ratio of the national minimum wage to the median wage has an important impact in terms of whether jobs are likely to be lost when it is increased.  Because of our position on that metric, we believe, in the context of the literature, that it is likely that we will lose jobs if the minimum wage increases, because our overall wage bill will be too high and businesses will not be able to afford it.  We have examined the sectoral and regional impacts in this respect.  The minimum wage is a very blunt tool.  It applies regardless of the type of business one is employed in or where in the country one is based.  We all know there are huge variations throughout the country and that is why we are opposed to the use of this blunt instrument.  It will have a destabilising impact in the sectors most represented in our association - namely, the accommodation and hospitality sector, retail and other services, and those services being provided outside the greater Dublin region.</p><p> For us the level of unemployment is the most serious issue.  People seem to have forgotten that we have a shockingly high level of unemployment.</p></speech>

That means we are looking at locking even more people out of the labour market.  When we look to the live register, it is interesting to note that employers that are already experiencing skills shortages.  We are still seeking to recruit people with skills from abroad because of the mismatch.  We have low-skilled workers on our live register and young people with no experience.  If it does not make sense to hire a worker on that basis, and a business will not do so if its costs are too high.  That is a basic metric of which we need to be aware.</p> <p>  With regard to national competitiveness, we have one of the best minimum wage rates in the world.  Ours is the fifth highest in Europe.  The rate in Luxembourg is an outlier, and the rates in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany are the same as ours.  When account is taken of the purchasing power argument in this debate, we drop only by one percentage point.  We would go further in arguing this point and say that this cannot be looked at in isolation.  In many other countries, people on lower rates of pay are taxed much more than people here and they have access to much better public services.  We need to look in the round at the taxation and income policy element in term of public services as well as the national minimum wage.</p></speech>

Mr. A. J. Noonan said he was amused at the contributions from the trade union representatives, but I do not think there is anything amusing about the issues we are discussing.  We are examining the issue of low pay.  The facts from EUROSTAT, the OECD, the CSO, the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, and the Nevin Economic Research Institute show that 21% of workers in this State are on low pay, 350,000 workers in this State suffer from deprivation and there is a big problem in terms of in-work poverty.  That is the reality.  We are dealing with that issue and those facts.  How we can create a more sustainable and a fairer economy and what are the responsibilities of the State and employers in achieving that fair economy?  That is what we are about.

The presentation suggests that it is not the job of businesses to redistribute wealth but to create wealth which can then be redistributed by Government.  At the very start of the presentation, reference is made to the fact that the business community and small firms in particular are a key driver of economic growth.  The economy is not something that acts in isolation.  The economy has to be there to serve society and citizens.  Employers have a responsibility in that area too.  My first question to the witnesses relates to the responsibility of employers to create and achieve a fairer economy and better income equality.</p> <p>  We heard earlier from Mr. Taft from the Unite trade union.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-03a.111" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1133" speakername="David Cullinane" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015030300002#EE00400"><p>I am posing the questions.  My point is that we are getting different figures from Mr. Taft and from Ms Callan.  I looked at the EUROSTAT figures and they show that we drop significantly below the European average when one factors in the price of goods and services.</p> <p>  The witnesses are obviously against an increase in the minimum wage and I would imagine that they are also against wage increases in the economy generally.  However, they also made the point that we have a difficulty with regard to the provision of public services.  That is one of the problems which leads to both income and economic inequalities.  We heard from IBEC at a previous meeting and it agreed that child care provision, health care and housing are very important instruments when dealing with economic equality.  All of the employer organisations are arguing against increasing the minimum wage and are calling for wage restraint.  They are also against any increases in taxation, whether that be corporate or income taxes.  In that context, where is the money going to come from to provide the services we need if we want to achieve a fair economy?  Is it fair or right that we have 21% of workers on low pay?  Is it right that we have 350,000 workers suffering from deprivation?  Is it right that some employers who can pay more refuse to do so because they do not want to?  Is that right?</p> <p>  The witnesses expressed the concern that an increase in the minimum wage could cost jobs.  What evidence is that argument based on?  Can the witnesses provide evidence that increasing the minimum wage by &euro;1 would actually cost jobs across the economy?  Where does assertion come from?  We are trying to lift our domestic economy by increasing domestic demand.  The very firms and businesses that the witnesses represent would be the ones to benefit the most from any wage increase because people would have more money in their pockets to spend.</p></speech>

There are people on low pay who are suffering because they live in deprivation.  That is the reality for those workers.  I am asking the witnesses, as representatives of employers' organisations, what responsibility employers have to meet that challenge and to deal with the very real situations those workers face.  I do not see anything in their presentations which lends itself to any real solutions for those workers, that cohort of people who suffer because of low pay.  What is the witnesses' solution for them?</p></speech>

Many small business people in this country have not taken a wage for two or three years.  Therefore, I would be very careful.  Obviously, your politics and my politics will never be in the same equation, because you actually want to tax more and you want us to pick up the tab.</p><p> You asked what responsibility employers have.  We have a responsibility to create wealth and thereby create jobs.  It is up to Government to redistribute that wealth.  It is not our job to redistribute wealth.  It is not our job to increase taxation.  It is our job to keep our businesses going.  Far fewer people are self-employed now than in 2008, as a result of many of the policies that this Government has implemented.</p><p> I have grave concerns about the attitude towards the national minimum wage and the question that we have a responsibility.  I have given two evidence-based examples from my conversations last week of companies which will have to let people go for different reasons.  First, they are unable to afford to keep the people on.  Second, it is now possible for one of the companies to automate its processes and thereby create wealth in the organisation.  That is our job.  That is my view anyway as an employer of 24 years standing.</p><p> You mentioned fairness.  Why do you as a-----</p></speech>

Let us be real.  If a person running a business is not making money, she is going out of business and everyone who works for her is going to lose their job.  No matter what anyone says about the societal implications, the big picture or macroeconomic implications, if a person running a business is not making money, she will go out of business and everyone who works for her will lose their jobs.</p> <p>  At all points we must ensure that the basic principle is that we have to make a profit.  Profit is not a dirty word.  Essentially, we need risk takers to establish businesses and we want a more productive and supportive environment for them to do so.  Let us broaden the bigger concept in terms of what will solve all our economic issues.  Why not make risk-taking easier?  Why not have social welfare for the self-employed?  Why not have equity in tax treatment for the self-employed?  Why not have capital gains tax for entrepreneurs set such that it makes sense to sell a business here rather than move operations abroad?  There are far more big issues that we could get into in that context.</p> <p>  Let us return to profitability and the dynamic of our economy.  Fully 97% of all companies employ fewer than 50 people, of which 84% are micro-firms employing fewer than ten people.  Some 53% of all people on the national minimum wage are in three sectors: hospitality and accommodation, retail, and other services.  The average profit in those firms ranges from &euro;14,549 up to &euro;21,470.  I do not know why people have picked an increase of &euro;1.  I would love to hear your justification for a &euro;1 increase.  Where is your economic analysis on the basis of what is actually in the legislation around that?  Do you really believe a blunt instrument like that, which simply increases business costs, will work?  A business owner has no way to recoup that in her margins or her ability to sell.  At a basic level, how is she going to stay in business?  That is a critical point in all of this.</p> <p>  The argument around the domestic demand is a lovely one.  We all love the idea of being paid more, having more money in the economy and it being circular.  Again, if a person running a business has an inability to pay, then she is not actually going to stay in business.  I was struck by the unions emphasising the use of that clause.  I have been in this business for some time and there is no one in my memory running a company who would risk her business reputation by going to a third-party institution which she does not know, because she is not experienced in third-party institutions, and say publicly that she has an inability to pay.  That would simply kill her business entirely.  She would be gone out of business in the morning.</p></speech>

On top of that, every other company would be equally put out on the basis that competitors are getting a better business cost base.  Basically, our point is that we view this as an entry rate into employment.  Certainly, in terms of the relativities of pay, it has always been a concern for us that wages are seen to move in line with it.  We need to see pay increases return across our economy.  That makes sense for all of us, but it has to be moderated and justified on the basis of productivity.  It was interesting to hear the views when we were discussing the matter with large companies.  As with small companies, there is no such thing as a flat-rate increase for employees any more.</p><p>Every single business makes an individual decision on a person's productivity level.  Outside unionised industries the decision is made purely on the basis of productivity.  Unions behave differently but have very little representation in the private sector.  I do not see us ever going back to flat rate increases.  I hope that the public sector follows suit and rewards productivity.</p></speech>

We can agree to disagree on the impact that would have on businesses, competitiveness, job losses and so on.

We are a small open economy operating in a globalised world where we must price our goods and products at a price to sell internationally.  We need that money to come back here to support our domestic demand businesses.  It is not as simple as asking what we are going to do to solve the problem of low pay without considering the overall structure.  If we do not have any businesses or jobs, everybody is on welfare and the amount of tax paid is much lower because there is nobody to pay taxes and the economy collapses.  We should build consensus and work towards societal goals but we must be realistic about the fact that if we do not have our economic fundamentals right, none of those aspirations can be delivered upon.</p></speech>

Someone&rsquo;s figures are wrong.  I am not saying whether they are Ms Callan&rsquo;s or the previous speaker&rsquo;s but there is a discrepancy there.</p> <p>  I accept there are businesses which are genuinely struggling at the moment and there are people who own those businesses who perhaps are not even receiving a wage.  I want to park that, however, to talk about the people who are successful and have a measured profitability.  Given that the workers in those businesses helped achieve that profitability for those companies, what is wrong with their getting a dividend through a better wage?  In my four years on this committee I have never experienced such an engagement.  This is quite an unusual conversation.  I am very disturbed to think we should pay people what they are worth.  It is like talking about cattle.  I am very upset by the fact that somebody could speak like that.  We are talking about people.</p> <p>  If a company is not viable and cannot pay the minimum wage to some people and does not believe that should exist, there is a question about whether that company should be in business.  Unless somebody has a massive social conscience and sense of social responsibility and has set up a business as a social enterprise, it is my understanding that businesses do not employ people for the sake of it.  If something can be made at less expense and the profit could be slightly larger, that would be the case.  Would that not be the case in most businesses?</p></speech>

The minimum wage is a floor, so it is a legal instrument.  We are not talking about labour market dynamics in terms of the normal market pay rate.  Obviously, that is critically important and does occur.  I can clearly stand over our member companies and say that those making a profit are giving pay increases, but they are doing so on that person's personal contribution to the business, rather than in the sense that everyone should automatically get a pay rise.  That is good and efficient in terms of introducing detailed performance management systems and metrics.</p> <p>  In most small companies people are a lot closer to their employees.  They are their friends and relatives who live in the same town.  This is not a them-and-us scenario at all.</p></speech>

Last week, their colleague, Mr. Mark Fielding, proposed that the best way of getting money back into people's pockets was through a taxation-based income return process.  Is that something the witnesses would look at?</p> <p>  Figures have been quoted about our minimum wage being one of the lowest, but they include self-employed people who cannot afford to pay themselves.  How many of Ms Callan's members are either not in a position to pay themselves the minimum wage or are paying themselves just around the minimum wage?</p> <p>  Figures were quoted for pre-tax profits, but how do they compare to European figures, including the UK?  There is a flip-side to that.  In January, the SFA previewed 2015 by saying that two thirds of firms were optimistic about growing and seven out of ten businesses expected to see strong investment levels.  Surely if it is all that good and healthy, then workers should share in it as well.</p></speech>

I do not have international figures, but I have compared where we stand internationally as regards the minimum wage.  Even if one takes the UK, which people love to comment on, we still have a higher minimum wage than the UK even though our exchange rate is particularly unfavourable at the moment.</p></speech>

Even in terms of the concept of the living wage, there are 900 companies in financial services.  If that was to roll out here, it would mean something like 90 companies in Ireland signing up.  Therefore, it is not a big success rate and does not make sense.  We really need to focus on getting our economy back on track and getting more people back into work.  The more people who are in work and paying taxes, the better.  In terms of taxation, it is all about distribution and getting more, so one does not have to increase rates.  In fact, our experience shows that when we reduced capital gains tax rates, returns went up.</p> <p>  As regards how we fund all our expenditure, we believe that having lower taxes and more people contributing will, in the end, be a net benefit to everybody.</p></speech>

They tend to work through issues one-by-one with people on the ground, or they ring people like me for advice.  Rarely, if ever, do people end up with a third party and to do so would suggest to me that they had not managed the situation successfully.  They do not have experience of the State apparatus.  Even though it is notionally free it has become very legalistic and a lot more solicitors and barristers are involved.  It is not just a matter of cash but management time and effort.  If people are operating such a tight business that they feel they do not have the capacity to pay increases in the minimum wage they will not have the time or capacity to go to the Labour Court to argue that.  An easier decision will have be made.</p></speech>

I agree with the witnesses that purchasing power is the key issue for everybody.  NERI came before the committee and said that if people's purchasing power increased in other areas it would decrease pressure on the demand for the living wage.  That is maybe one area of agreement in this discussion.  How do we increase purchasing power in the economy in general?  There are 350,000 people in deprivation and we have moved from 0.7% underemployment to approximately 7.4%.  That is a problem which the Oireachtas has to deal with because I am talking about families, about people going hungry and being cold and about children not getting the opportunity to which they are entitled.  This gives rise to generational societal problems which cause major difficulties for cohesion in society and will be felt not just in our generation but in that of our kids too.</p> <p>  I believe if people work hard, use their smarts, take risks and invest money they are entitled to fair compensation and a fair profit but there also needs to be a fair wage.  That balance is what is necessary in this country at the moment.  We do not want companies to make supranormal profits and people to be paid poverty wages at the same time.</p> <p>  For competitiveness we need to look at every space in society, and wages need to be almost the last place we look.  I agree that universal social charges should not be levied at higher rates for self-employed people who have exactly the same income as employed people.  Ms Callan is correct that we should not arrive at an arbitrary figure but it could also be arbitrary that a person would seek a freeze for a few years.  What exactly are the economic boxes that need to be ticked so that, in three years' time if we are sitting here again discussing the matter, the Small Firms Association might agree that an increase in the minimum wage was necessary?</p> <p>  The delegates from NERI said that minimum wage increases that are smaller but more frequent are actually better for businesses.  Instead of an employer looking down the barrel of a &euro;1 increase to the minimum wage, would it be more desirable to have a 25c minimum wage increase over a period of four years?  This would be easier for businesses at the edge to adjust to.</p> <p>  A major issue in this discussion is that one side says the minimum wage does affect employment rates while the other side says it does not.  There has been a lot of research into the question in Britain and an official study has found that there was virtually no negative impact on job growth from minimum wage increases.  In a lot of the studies I have done, an equal number of people state that it does affect employment as state that it does not.  Accordingly, in the round it has very little effect.</p></speech>

The first answer would be to reduce taxation.</p><p>The second would be to introduce PRSI incentives for employers to take on employees.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and I have had many discussions on public procurement.  A 1% increase in public procurement in Ireland would create 1,500 jobs.  That would be a good thing.  Capital gains tax relief could be introduced for companies disposing of assets.  Increased mergers and acquisitions and increased transactions would increase the opportunities for businesses to be transferred, allowing a new generation to take over and grow.  They are my initial comments; I can go into more detail if the committee wishes.</p></speech>

They are the things I have talked about today, such as assessing whether inflation is a justification for the minimum wage, in addition to movements in the earnings of employees, the level of unemployment and the employment inflation rate.  It is all clearly labelled.  The benefit for me of setting up a low pay commission is that we have all shared data - the committee has heard much conflicting data - and it is necessary for someone to put all of that together and to figure out what is correct and what is not.  It concerns me that our data seems to be so divergent even though we are all quoting from the same sources.  The commission must do a thorough piece of work.  It would be easier for employers to sell this concept back to our members if they could clearly see the justification on that set of metrics.</p> <p>  The problem in the past was that the Labour Court literally picked a figure out of thin air - I was not at those meetings, as the court would not take contributions or have hearings - and then one would meet the Minister and he would say it was about making sure work is attractive compared to welfare.  That is my only concern and that is what we were repeatedly told.</p> <p>  What was said about under-employment is interesting.  I would love to have a more detailed piece of work done around that, because what I hear from companies is actually the opposite.  It is the case that they have had people on three-day weeks and they would love them to come back and work five-day weeks but the welfare system makes it unattractive for them to so do.  Again, we can get into the practices of bigger corporations and specific instances that we heard about earlier, but understanding how the social welfare system interlinks with the labour market is something that we need to do a lot more on, because we do not have evidence in that regard.  We have attempted to look at it through various groups in Departments, but no one has tackled it holistically.</p> <p>  The Government should fundamentally reform the entire social welfare system to make it easy to move in and out of work and to take account of hours worked and not have people penalised for coming to work when there are additional hours.  The situation is not clear-cut.  It is also a concern for us because we have skilled employees at work and it makes far more sense in smaller companies, which is all I can speak for, to try to bring them up to full hours.  The last time the minimum wage went up by &euro;1 an hour, in many sectors that had minimum wage workers, they chose to reduce their hours from 20 hours to 15 hours.  It was that black and white.  It was a set number that made the difference in terms of maintaining welfare rates.</p> <p>  Again, I am not generalising about this; I know there are all sorts of other considerations, but it merits a much bigger discussion.  We no longer work in a market where there is a five-day week composed of 39 hours, where one has a lunch break and goes home on Friday evening.  The market is 24 hours a day and it is global and flexible.  Workers can live with that too because a lot of workers have flexible needs and it might suit them to come to work for X number of hours because they have other commitments.  Once we get our heads around that, we need to almost recreate our system from the ground up, and that would merit a serious amount of attention in terms of resolving all of these issues.  We may be coming at the problem from a different angle but there is certainly a problem that needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

I know Ms Callan does not want to say there should be an increase in the minimum wage at this stage, but would it be acceptable if in three years' time there were incremental rate increases?</p></speech>

If the low pay commission were to do this exercise every year, and we are satisfied that the process is transparent and independent and that it is using actual evidence-based policy making, that is something we could certainly live with.  The reason we have taken the decision to talk about a freeze at this moment in time is that we are living in exceptional times.  It is amazing how quickly people have forgotten what we have come through in the past seven years.  Owner-managers have not forgotten quite so quickly because they have a lot more sleepless nights than the average person.  They are very risk-averse.  When we talk about banks and funding now, the banks keep telling us that people are shattered and that the problem in terms of demand is that people are so risk-averse.  We could have all sorts of other discussions about that, but there is an element of truth in it.  What people really want is to feel that they have security, stability and, particularly at this time, foreseeability in terms of business costs, which are critical to one's long-term investment and decision-making.</p><p>That is critical to whether I would hire somebody.  If there is a threat that the minimum wage will be &euro;9.65 in a number of months' time, should I already have stopped hiring?  Has this discussion stopped job creation?  That is the untold aspect.  The worst thing in life an owner-manager has to do is to let somebody go.  Making people redundant is traumatic for owner-managers, so they will not put themselves in a position in which they have to do that if it is not necessary.</p></speech>

Running a business is not a nine-to-five job.  If one is running a business one is working 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  It would be a good idea for people to learn what it is like to be an employer.  As Ms Callan stated with passion, we have a 9% unemployment rate.  That is the most disturbing issue in the country.  There are at least 100,000 people who are long-term unemployed.</p> <p>  Having started a business with Connie Doody, I know that the effect of unemployment on people - in terms of their lack of confidence and self-esteem and the fact that they are not meeting people every day - is devastating.  The country is going nowhere if we are bitter and cynical about our job creators.  We are not talking about the multinationals that have a pot full of money.  They are very capital-intensive, and it is much easier for a company to make a profit when it is capital-intensive.  That should be studied as well.</p> <p>  I supported the minimum wage when it was introduced.  I am still supportive of it in spirit, but compared to when it was introduced I still believe our economy is in a dire state.  One only has to walk the streets around here to see the shops closing down.  That is happening in the suburbs as well.  It is a fairly sad state.</p> <p>  I detest cynicism.  There is a failure to understand that employers and employees are a team.  They work together, and there is mutual trust and good faith.</p></speech>

We are talking here today about small and medium-sized Irish companies.  That is the reality, and we must face facts.  I do not know anybody who wants to be ruthless and exploit another person, because that person would not work if he or she felt exploited.</p><p>If they felt they were being exploited, they would not put their heart and soul into the business.  It is good to protect people but the problem originally was that the minimum wage kept going up every year.  It is no harm for our colleagues to know that in 2000, wages in Germany were exactly the same as our wages but our wages up went up over the past five or six years so we lost our competitiveness.  A learning process is needed to understand what business is like.  We need private enterprise and being self-employed is not 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  It is 24-7.  One cannot just look at one's watch and say "I'm getting out the door and going home."  One must be on the job all the time.  From my experience and that of other employers, it is a team composed of owners and their workers.  </p></speech>

Once one gets beyond that, one tends to grow very quickly, which is great because one has professionalised one's management in the main and are on a growth strategy that, hopefully, works out.  A lot of people choose to stay around ten employees - the micro-business mark.  They hit that level and they are happy to do so.</p></speech>

There are 40 pieces of employment law one needs to know overnight if one chooses to hire one person.  This militates against people in the very early days hiring someone.  Our survey showed that most companies have about 52 employees before they hire a human relations professional to deal with this myriad of issues.  Until then, it is a case of the owner-manager trying to grapple with it.</p></speech>

The Department has made considerable additional effort in the limited time available to assist in this regard, and the officials involved deserve to be commended on their contribution.  This briefing has sought to focus primarily on performance, specifically departmental target-setting and information and performance related issues arising, and to treat changes in financial allocations as ancillary.  Briefing for the remainder of the Estimate reflects the more traditional approach.<br/><br/>The proposed structure for the meeting is in two parts, A and B.  Part A is to test the value of the approach that is being piloted.  It is proposed that the meeting will consist of an initial session dealing exclusively with issues of performance relating to programme A, which is housing.  This is highlighted in the performance-based briefing material and otherwise raised by members.  To examine performance effectively, existing Government policy should be taken as a given except to the extent that the committee may consider that some clarification is required.  That is part A.  Part B, which is the remainder of the meeting, including the supporting briefing material, will follow the traditional format but will include a revisiting of the housing programme if it is necessary.<br/><br/>I welcome to the meeting the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with special responsibility for housing, planning and co-ordination of the Construction 2020 strategy, Deputy Paudie Coffey, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with responsibility for local community and rural economic development issues, Deputy Ann Phelan, who is also Minister of State at the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Transport, Tourism and Sport with special responsibility for the implementation of the CEDRA report.  I also welcome all of the officials from the Departments and thank them for their attendance.  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-03a.196" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12015030300002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and sub-committee members.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss with the sub-committee my Department&rsquo;s Revised Estimate for 2015.  I am accompanied by the Ministers of State, Deputy Ann Phelan and Deputy Paudie Coffey.  To assist in the work today, we have prepared briefing on the Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2015 which sets out details of the Vote and related funds as well as other key information.</p> <p>  Budget 2015 marks the end of an era of budgetary austerity.  That the Government is in a position to increase expenditure in 2015 reasonably indicates the progress we have made following expenditure reductions over the past six years to address the perilous financial situation we inherited on coming into office.  As a Government, we have never believed in austerity for austerity&rsquo;s sake.  What was done was done because we were left with very little choice.  I am very pleased, therefore, that the hard-won flexibility we have to meet emerging demands and invest in our public services following the greatest economic crisis in our history has very immediate and positive impacts on the Vote before the sub-committee.  The provision of &euro;1.3 billion being made available to the Department for 2015 is firm evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the sector.  It is made up of more than &euro;800 million in current spending and almost &euro;500 million in capital investment and represents an increase of &euro;460 million on the 2014 Estimate.  Department programmes will also benefit in 2015 from resources available from both the local government and environment funds.</p> <p>  The year 2015 will see a very significant level of new investment in housing across a range of measures which will increase the supply of homes to be made available.  The overall provision for housing has increased by &euro;230 million, with capital funding increased significantly by &euro;180 million.  This will result in an investment of &euro;800 million across a range of programmes.  This investment will allow for significant expansion in social housing provision, with more than 7,400 new homes to be provided under a range of social housing initiatives in 2015.  Combined with a target of more than 8,000 transfers from rent supplement to housing assistance payment, HAP, almost 16,000 housing units will be delivered this year.</p> <p>  Social housing is a top priority for the Government and this is evidenced by the additional &euro;2.2 billion in funding announced for social housing in budget 2015 to support the implementation of the Social Housing Strategy 2020.  The Government is committed to dealing comprehensively with the housing list through a wide range of measures, including a comprehensive return to mainstream local authority builds.  The total targeted provision of more than 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of 75,000 households through HAP and the rental accommodation scheme, will address in full the needs of the 90,000 households on the waiting list, with flexibility to meet potential future demand.  In committing to provide these 35,000 new social housing units, at a projected cost of &euro;3.8 billion, the strategy marks a fresh start for social housing that was badly needed.</p> <p>  The local government fund has undergone significant change in recent years.  While motor tax continues to be paid into the fund, local property tax, LPT, collected by the Revenue Commissioners is now also coming into the fund.  This year sees the ending of the general purpose grant payments and the introduction of LPT being paid to local authorities through the fund.  A total of 80% of LPT will be retained locally to fund vital public services.  The remaining 20% will be redistributed to provide top-up funding to local authorities that have lower property tax bases due to the variance in property values throughout the State.  These measures are necessary to create a balanced system of funding across local authorities.  The Government has devolved more powers to local authorities by giving elected members discretion to vary the rates of LPT by up to 15%.  This allows for greater transparency and accountability at a local level.  Fourteen local authorities lowered their basic LPT rate for 2015.  The income sources available to the local government fund this year are estimated to be motor tax of &euro;1.167 billion, LPT of &euro;440 million and a payment from the Exchequer of &euro;233 million.  My Department will make payments estimated at &euro;1.839 billion from the fund in 2015, including LPT payments to local authorities of &euro;459 million, payment of &euro;364 million for the maintenance of non-national roads to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and a payment to the Exchequer of up to &euro;484 million.</p> <p>  The transfer of water services responsibilities from local authorities to Irish Water took place on 1 January 2014.  This major reform will drive improvements in water services in the coming years and decades.  Irish Water published its capital investment plan for 2014 to 2016 last May.  A total of &euro;222 million has been provided by the Government to Irish Water in respect of its capital expenditure in 2015.  This will fund progress on projects set out in the plan, including key water and waste water infrastructural projects.  In addition, &euro;399 million from the local government fund will be provided to Irish Water in 2015 in respect of operational subvention. This will fund the allowance of 21,000 litres of free water that is being provided to all children in the State along with the cost of capping domestic water charges at the levels set out in the Water Services Act 2014.</p> <p>  The 2015 Estimate for my Department also contains an allocation of &euro;130 million for the new water conservation grant which I announced last November.  To promote sustainable use of water and to enhance water conservation in households, the Department of Social Protection will administer, on behalf of my Department, a &euro;100 water conservation grant in respect of principal private residences.  The allocation of &euro;130 million is based on an estimate of up to 1.3 million households applying for the grant.  This estimated level of demand for 2015 takes account of the number of primary residences recorded in the 2011 census as well as experiences with other similar demand-led schemes.</p> <p>  My Department, in consultation with the Department of Social Protection, is finalising the modalities of the water conservation grant.  Following this, I will make regulations which will provide for the terms and conditions attaching to the grant, including the date by which households will need to have responded to the Irish Water campaign if they are to be eligible for the grant.  All households registered with Irish Water under its application campaign will be contacted directly by the Department of Social Protection in due course.</p> <p>  The Government remains committed to supporting the group water sector as an important element of the water industry in Ireland.  This is reflected in the provision of &euro;17.5 million in 2015 for my Department&rsquo;s rural water programme, under which funding is provided for group water schemes.</p> <p>  In environment and waste management, the programme provides for expenditure of &euro;35 million, largely to meet the cost of the important work of the Environmental Protection Agency, including the work of the former Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland which was merged successfully with the agency in 2014.  The environment fund, financed from the landfill and plastic bag levies, will provide a further estimated &euro;45 million to be directed to key priority areas such as environmental enforcement, waste prevention and recycling.</p> <p>  In community and rural development, the Leader elements of the rural development programmes provide for voted expenditure of &euro;45 million in 2015.  A total of &euro;30 million of this is to meet the outstanding commitments under the 2007-2013 programme, which has been very successful, with more than 9,000 projects receiving funding.  Indeed, financial support has been provided to more than 8,000 enterprises and more than 4,000 full time jobs have been created.  In addition, &euro;15 million has been provided for the new 2014-2020 Leader programme which I expect to be operational this year.</p><p>This programme will build on the previous programme&rsquo;s success in creating new and innovative opportunities for rural businesses and communities. </p><p> The Vote also provides funding for the local and community development programme, LCDP, which will conclude later this month and for its successor, the social and community activation programme, SICAP, which will be rolled out from April.  SICAP takes account of the new aligned structure in its delivery and objectives.  In particular, SICAP will be managed and implemented through the new local community development committees, LCDC, as the new governance model for local and community programmes in each local authority area.  The allocation of over &euro;45 million for 2015, to cover the funding requirements of both programmes, LCDP and SICAP, will allow further progress to be made in this vital area.  </p><p> Chairman, members, I have kept my remarks as brief as possible so that we can have a full discussion on the activities of the Department and how our programmes, and the very significant resources we will deploy in support of them in 2015, will benefit communities and citizens throughout the country, make the maximum contribution to job creation and economic recovery, and help the less well-off in our society.  </p><p> I look forward to hearing members' thoughts and contributions.  The Ministers of State, Deputy Paudie Coffey and Deputy Ann Phelan, and I will be happy to deal with matters that members wish to raise.</p></speech>

I want to clarify an issue relating to new units that are being provided this year as part of the five-year programme that was announced some months ago.  There are proposals for 7,400 new social units and there is an additional 8,400 households who will be assisted through the housing assistance payment.  Of the 7,400 new social units, some 1,400 will be built or acquired.  Do we know at this stage whether that number will be built based on the Minister's consultations and negotiations with the management of the local authorities?  Have the proposals from the local authorities been assessed?  Is the Minister in a position to provide a breakdown of each local authority's proposals to build or acquire housing units?  We would like to know which local authorities will be involved in a house building programme.  All the stakeholders recognise that we must address the issue of supply and one addresses that by providing more units.  </p> <p>  The proposed 7,400 social units will comprise 3,000 units under the social housing leasing initiative.  Will the Minister clarify if the proposed 3,000 new units will be provided by social housing agencies and, if so, have the social housing agencies been granted planning permission to construct the units?  Will the units be constructed this year?  Can we state definitively in which local authority areas they will be built?</p> <p>  It is also proposed that 1,000 vacant local authority dwellings will be refurbished and returned to use.  We would expect that all local authority units would be in use.  In real terms that is not a new allocation of 1,000 housing units.  There is also a proposal for 2,000 new rental accommodation scheme units.  Is that 2,000 new units under the RAS schemes? </p> <p>  I have heard the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, state that he would bring forward legislation to address the case of the many local authority tenants who are being refused access to accommodation under the RAS scheme because the landlords will not accept local authority tenants.  That may take some time.  </p> <p>  The Minister made an announcement on rent caps and I hope he will elaborate on how he will address people's inability to afford the increased rent?  Will new RAS schemes come on stream?  The supply issue is pivotal.  The demand far outweighs the supply.  I meet people daily and the issue they raise is their inability to find a home under the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  I am glad to hear the Minister say that it is at the top of his agenda.  I am nervous that the units are not available.  The Minister is hoping that units will become available to be leased.  </p> <p>  In the course of his speech the Minister has set a target of over 8,000 transfers from rent supplement to housing assistance payment, HAP.  Is the Minister referring to existing families that are getting assistance at present and will be assisted again in the coming year?  The headline rate is 15,800 units, but how many new units will be delivered by the end of 2015?</p> <p>  What role do public private partnerships play in the provision of housing?  What is the level of Exchequer exposure to public private partnership agreements?  I did not hear that mentioned.  Should the proposals for public private partnerships not be taken up, what money has been put aside and has provision been made in the Estimate for that?  What is the total amount of money being spent on housing assistance payment?  What is the timescale for its roll-out?  Will the Minister elaborate on the HAP scheme, when it is enforceable and when is it expected to be completed?  Will it assist new families?  Based on his negotiations with local authorities is he satisfied that the units will become available?  We need to build units, and if we fail to do so we cannot satisfy the demand.  If the units are not provided the crisis will deepen.</p> <p>  While I appreciate the Minister's commitment and the effort he and his Department are making, if we do not succeed in having shovel ready projects the units cannot be provided and the crisis continues.</p></speech>

It is correct that 52% of the Vote is allocated to housing.  That reflects the priority of Government, which I am sure he welcomes.  We have an issue with the supply of housing because of the way that social housing was dealt with in the past 20 years.  I am not blaming anybody.  There was a failure to build sufficient social housing and this is now critical.  There was a lack of activity for a number of years which caused a perfect storm and gave rise to issue which we now must now address.</p><p>We have had comprehensive discussions with local authorities.  For the 1,400 built or acquired we sent out request calls to every local authority in the country.  We got them back last week.  We are doing the analysis now and will verify the exact numbers in the coming weeks.  We are going through the list local authority by local authority.  I was pleasantly surprised at the capability they have for new builds, which is a good sign.  We will determine how that figure is broken down on the analysis of every single local authority.  We are heat mapping this to prioritise areas particularly around Dublin and larger cities where we have a larger demand.  I expect quite a number of these will be new builds.  There are areas where it still makes more sense financially to acquire, which does influence one's decision - one is not hitting supply and if there is availability at a cheaper rate than it would cost to build it makes sense to purchase rather than build.  There is a deep analysis going on in our Department, which has been ramped up for the purposes of doing this work.</p><p>  A question was asked about leasing.  It is a mixture.  I believe there is a volume of them ready to go and we are happy with that.  There are some areas where there are specific issues we isolated as part of this analysis.  This is almost a pick and mix style.  If we have problems in one area of build or buy because of the costs in purchasing in high demand areas, we can have other options regarding leasing.</p><p> I will turn to the question on local authority units.</p></speech>

Will social housing agencies be charged with responsibility to provide them?  Have they submitted a response to the Department similar to the local authorities' responses and are they competent to deliver these units?  Are these 3,000 new units?</p></speech>

We are in continuous discussions with them.  We meet weekly at different levels and I chair the monthly social housing implementation strategy meeting.  We met with them last week, so "Yes" is the answer to the Deputy's query.</p> <p>  Questions were also asked about the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  There will be 2,000 more in the RAS scheme.  One must also remember there are a few areas which do not have housing assistance payment yet, so bringing in more RAS is a necessity.  There are areas where RAS is more successful than in other areas but we still need to use it.  It is a very important scheme.  We have rolled out HAP in seven local authorities with five more are to come on stream.  It is an analysis we have just made and I expect to make an announcement on those five in the next week or so.  There are over 1,000 people currently signed up to HAP.  Percentages of transfers from RAS into the new HAP are in the region of 50%.</p></speech>

He is right to do so because it has become a great crisis and has not been helped by the fact that previous Administrations left it to private landlords to deal with people on housing lists.  I am sure the Minister will not be able to give an accurate figure but is there a good indication from the four local authorities in the Dublin area that they are coming up with sufficient numbers for the Department to get ahead with building in this area in particular and also in other cities such as Galway and Cork where there is great pressure to provide housing?</p> <p>  Has any thought been given to the type of units that are being built because the traditional three-bedroom unit is suitable for some families but not necessarily for others?  Could the Minister comment on the voids situation, particularly in Dublin city, and whether it is getting on top of voids?  </p> <p>  My constituency is in one of the pilot counties for the housing assistance payment, HAP.  My impression is that it may be easier to roll out HAP when more housing becomes available.  Does the Minister think there will be problems?  My fear is that landlords may not bite.  Can it be made as easy as possible for landlords to get involved in that because at the moment, they tend to want to take private customers who are paying their own rent?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-03a.250" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12015030300002#E01200"><p>The Deputy will be glad to know that Dublin is a priority.  We have a specific task force relating to Dublin and another task force relating to the rest of the country.  I chair an oversight group.  We have a specific group that delivers on that and we meet with it every week.  The chief executive officer of South Dublin County Council is the chairperson of it.</p> <p>  We have issues relating to other major urban areas.  Something that is often underestimated is the fact that we have major issues in some major towns, including commuter belt towns, which I see as a priority.  That commuter belt is extending further than it had been expanding a few years ago.  I regard it as a priority area for social housing and members of the committee would probably agree with me.  I will certainly focus on that as regards looking at allocations and where we are going.  </p> <p>  The question about the type of units is a very good one.  There is a difference between the type of units and the percentage of them that were required in years gone by and what we need now.  I am not sure if colleagues are aware of this statistic but it is one that always startles me.  Approximately 70% of all people looking for housing are either single or single with children.  This changes the dynamic of everything one does and reflects the way Ireland has changed.  The volume of 20 or 30 three-bedroom houses built on the edge of town when we were building houses on a grand scale in the early 1990s will not work anymore.  For starters, we need to deal with the demographic change.  Second, we also need to deal with the fact that mixed tenure is probably the way to go and we need to work towards that in some fashion.  The type of units is changing and we need to ensure that we adjust to meet that.  </p> <p>  In respect of how we are analysing what we require across the country, I am happy to tell members of the committee that the Housing Agency has been working very closely with us on a deep analysis of the multi-units we need and where we need them so we will certainly be influenced by that.</p> <p>  HAP will be more successful as it is being rolled out.  It is being rolled out further.  We did some analysis relating to where we want it to be rolled out in the next five local authorities.  I expect to be able to announce that in the next week.  It is important.  There is no doubt that HAP is dependent on supply.  Having said that, with some tweaking, it can be more successful.</p> <p>  Voids are social housing units that are boarded up.  Nothing infuriates me more than this subject.  As one drives around Dublin, a city I know very well having lived here for nine years-----</p></speech>

A total of 2,300 units were returned to use in 2014 and 1,000 units are targeted for 2015 so there has been a lot of progress.  There are issues that relate specifically to the city centre that I have seen myself.  We have spoken with Dublin City Council about them.  In 2014, Dublin City Council returned 467 units to service.  Fingal County Council brought 165 units into play while South Dublin County Council brought 92 units back into service.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council does not have many such units.  Somebody else is usually bringing them back into play, not the taxpayer.  However, the council brought back five units.  Cork City Council brought 212 units back into service while Cork County Council brought back 155 so quite a volume of them have been brought back into service.  A total of &euro;5 million is there for voids in the 2015 budget.  We are adamant that the voids programme is critical because one gets stock back into place very quickly.  I always concentrate on this issue.  I have gone as far as identifying voids myself and bringing them to the attention of local authorities to be turned around.</p></speech>

In terms of providing accommodation for those people, could I suggest that they are asked whether they want to move back to Dublin if they happen to be working in the Dublin area?</p><p>I do not suggest that the genuine need in County Kildare, which I know is huge, should not be addressed.  However, if some of those people want to move back to Dublin because they are working in Dublin, it would be better that their needs were met in the greater Dublin area.  I am just asking for that to be considered.</p></speech>

We detected some inconsistency across local authorities regarding the cost of refurbishment per unit and the turnaround times.  We are looking closely at that in regard to measuring performance.  Obviously where we have existing stock and assets that can be quickly turned around, that must be the priority for local authorities.  Some have been very good and some have not been so good.  We will be measuring those and future funding will be allocated based on good performance.  It is a message for local authorities not to leave houses lying vacant while they have people on housing lists waiting to get into those houses.  They should bring them back into beneficial use as soon as possible.</p> <p>  In recent years they might have had the valid complaint that they did not have the funding to do it.  That is no longer the case because the funding has been provided in recent years and it will be provided again this year.</p></speech>

I would like to know the number of voids in Laois that were funded.  As far as I am aware there is only one void house not in use that should be in use.  The county has boarded up houses all right, but they are private houses.  I have raised this issue previously with the Minister.  I believe there should be a bar on landlords buying houses that were previously local authority houses in order to rent them out.</p></speech>

However, houses that were built by the taxpayer should not be sold and within a couple of years be in the hands of a private landlord.  Then the taxpayer is paying a rent supplement to the tenant in that house.  The public purse is being hit twice.  I am in favour of rent allowance and people being able to buy their local authority house.  I support tenant purchase schemes, but there should be a clause whereby houses that are provided under a social housing scheme and subsequently sold cannot be purchased by a landlord and rented out with the taxpayer then having to cough up again to pay rent allowance to a social tenant.  There are many such examples.</p> <p>  In Laois it was stopped because I highlighted it.  That local authority introduced a 20-year rule whereby a house purchased in the previous 20 years from the local authority could not be rented out.  When I first raised it at a council meeting, it was nearly devoured.  However, it is quickly seen that in local authority estates landlords were coming in and buying social housing to rent back to people who are on rent allowance.</p></speech>

I am in favour of rent allowance and tenant purchase, as is the party I represent.  I highlight the huge demand in Monasterevin, Portarlington, Mountmellick and Portlaoise.  There is a demand across the constituency, as there is in south Kildare.  I am sure the Deputy beside me will highlight the issue in north Kildare.  However, there is pent-up demand in south Kildare.  It is absolutely diabolical at the moment and needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  What is the number of new housing starts and units purchased in 2014?  I know that units are purchased for good reasons at some times.  From what the Minister has said, I take it that 1,400 units were given the go-ahead to start or be purchased in 2015.  Will the Minister clarify that figure?  In the mid to late 1930s some 8,000 or 9,000 houses were being built.</p> <p>  How many of the 1,400 units will the approved housing bodies have and how many will the local authorities have?  By and large the approved housing bodies do reasonably good work.  However, there are some issues.  There is a huge amount of housing being built from the public purse and I strongly defend that.  The approved housing bodies have a role, but they are registered charities.  Some of them operate very much like companies.  Apart from some of the older ones, they are very much commercial operations.  These approved housing bodies have already acquired a large housing stock over which there is concern.  There is also concern within the local authorities about allocations in that the local authorities do not have full control over the allocations to those most in need.</p> <p>  There is an issue with some housing bodies cherry-picking, with what are described as the worst, more difficult or troublesome tenants winding up in the local authority estates.  I can show the Minister examples of that if he spends an hour or two with me some day.</p></speech>

Given the performance over the past year, I can see it developing further across the housing sector.  I am highlighting it with the Minister and two Ministers of State present.  I want them to hear what I am saying because there are serious issues in this regard.  While it is public money going into them, the local authority does not have a huge amount of control.</p> <p>  There is also the issue of cherry-picking with what are regarded as the best tenants going into the approved housing body schemes while the ones deemed to be more difficult - perhaps they have a drug habit or whatever - going into the local authority housing.  In terms of social integration we are winding up with another form of segregation.</p> <p>  The affordable housing scheme has dried up completely as we know.  Does the Minister have plans to restart that?  I know he will say that in parts of the country there are houses for sale on the open market that could not be matched with any affordable scheme and that is a reality.  In parts of the country that is not the case.  There are huge schemes of houses lying empty that are either with a receiver or with NAMA.  Could we not take a more imaginative approach?</p> <p>  Many people are caught in what is called the grey area.  The income thresholds for local authority housing are too low.  A person who earns more than &euro;25,500 is out of the loop and that does not take into consideration deductions from wages.  Those thresholds are not realistic and need to be reviewed.  There is a cohort of people with income above that and up to &euro;40,000 or &euro;45,000 who cannot buy on the open market and are continuing to rent.  I am sure the Minister, the two Ministers of State and the Deputies present recognise what I am talking about.  There is a huge opportunity and a huge gap in the market to be filled.  If those people could be placed on a loan scheme, there are houses in the constituency where I live that could be bought for between &euro;50,000 and &euro;80,000.</p> <p>  In the part of the world where I live landlords are not interested in RAS.  Landlords are getting out of RAS as quickly as they can because they do not want to be on 80% or 85% of the market value.</p><p>They can get more than that.  There were a number of new RAS contracts last year.  Is there a figure for that?  </p><p> My next question concerns HAP.  Given the level of rents, we will end up with the same problem in many parts of the State.  We will certainly have the same problem in Laois and Kildare, in terms of the levels of rent that can be achieved on the open market.  The Minister will have to be bold and do what he said he would do about rent controls at the weekend, something to which I will hold him over the next year or so because he said he will be in office for more than a year.  He will upset some people.</p><p> I refer to some of the PPPs that have been entered into.  I and others were told at the time it was the only way it could be done and would provide value for money; it could be front loaded and this, that and the other could be done.  It has been a noose around the necks of taxpayers and ratepayers.  I caution the Minister against entering into any PPPs.  We all want new programmes, but we need to be very careful about the long-term costs.  The problem is that the officials sitting around the Minister will not be able to tell us the terms of the PPP for next year or the year after because it is commercially sensitive information.  Despite the fact that the public will fund it, we will not know its terms.  I can show the Minister some awful examples of PPPs that were rushed into during the terms of previous Governments.</p></speech>

In Offaly, the figure was 35 and it was given 31.  Laois beat Offaly in that sense.  We will see how it gets on in another year's time.</p> <p>  I refer to the Deputy's comments on social housing.  He referred to it before and it is a valid point.  We are considering a new tenant purchase scheme and all of the issues around that.  Maybe as part of that we could examine this issue.  The Deputy referred to the policy in Laois.  We do not know how many other local authorities have adopted a similar approach.  It would not be a bad thing to find that out.  We might send out a question on that.  It is something which could be examined.  </p> <p>  I did not say what I said earlier on demand and the heat map because three Deputies who are not a million miles from each other are sitting here.  There is a demand for accommodation in Dublin and large commuter towns within a certain distance of it, which needs to be considered.  I have visited or spoken to most local authorities.  The Deputy met me at one.  Some are fairly well advanced.  We would reward those who are, because there is a need for that.  </p> <p>  The Deputy asked for outputs for 2014.  I have the figures.  Local authority housing totalled 285, the capital assistance scheme totalled 357, voids and vacant units totalled 2,333, regeneration totalled 247, leasing totalled 1,062, RAS totalled 2,173 and HAP totalled 485.  We exceeded our targets as a Department.</p> <p>  I will come to the question on AHBs.  In terms of local authorities versus AHBs, we are probably touching just below 1,000.  The Deputy raised many issues in respect of AHBs.  That is a real issue.  We have plans to introduce legislation to regulate AHBs, which is necessary and will be helpful.  The way in which AHBs work in this country is a little bit different from others, which has positive and negative aspects.  We have a large volume of AHBs, but many are small.  The critical mass in terms of what can get out of them is not necessarily there.</p> <p>  A voluntary register is in place and a Bill is expected to be in place by quarter three of this year.  It is currently being prepared and will regulate AHBs and all issues relating to them.  It will also be helpful to them as regards structuring them into the future and how they can work with us and finance themselves to deliver more.   We are also examining EIB investment and the HFA.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised social issues regarding AHBs and local authority houses, which were raised with me before.  The regulatory process to which I referred will deal with all of those issues.  He also asked about affordable housing.  It is something that is under review.  He raised a valid issue.  The problem is that in many parts of the country the price of units is so low that it is not worth doing.  As the market changes and recovers, it is something we will revisit.  I raised the issue internally in the past couple of weeks, in terms of revisiting it in the near future.  We would have to geographically zone in on where we target.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about RAS, which has been quite successful.  There are issues in certain areas which we are trying to address, but we see it as being part of the mix in the future while the HAP is being rolled out.  HAP is being rolled out across the country.  We have picked five more local authorities and as it is rolled out it will become more successful.  That is why we have made certain provisions.  </p> <p>  PPPs were another issue he raised.  The issue is the value we can get.  We feel we can get very good value from PPPs, in terms of what was thought of them in the past compared to now and the models in Britain and other countries.  We have had a substantial amount of contact from various different people with various different models.  Our analysis shows that there is good value.  I expect it to be quite successful as we roll it out next year and into 2017.  The Deputy should not think we are necessarily looking in any way, shape or form at the models of the past. </p> <p>  Nothing is defined in respect of PPPs, but how people will partake will be very different from the way things were done in the past.  I expect there will be very good value for the State and there is quite a level of competition out there in terms of the groups which are coming to us to work with the Government in that regard.</p></speech>

He said it was very successful.  My experience is that landlords are exiting as quickly as they can.  The HAP scheme is based on the same principle, namely, that the local authority leases the house.</p><p>However, the house is leased below the market rent and over a long period.  How will that work in counties where landlords are ditching the schemes as quick as they can?  They can get up to 30% more rent on the open market than from RAS or HAP.  Rent control is the only way to solve the matter.</p></speech>

Discussion of this matter is welcome as it pretty much dominates our daily routines.  For example, this morning six new families visited my constituency office.

Just as there are two Irelands in terms of the recovery, there are two Irelands in terms of the housing issues.  Six local authorities make up exactly half of the housing waiting list - three in Dublin, the two Cork authorities and the Kildare authority.  Their prospective tenants make up 50% of the 90,000 people who are on the housing waiting list.  There are also six local authorities in which it makes a lot more sense to buy than to build, because there will be available stock.  These six local authorities make up 3% of the waiting list.  It is important that we strike the right balance and adopt a strategic approach to deal with the housing crisis.</p> <p>  I wish to refer to an aspect that gets under-counted.  The document before us states that 139 people slept rough in the greater Dublin area last November.  I know that the crux of the problem, in part, has been dealt with, but an increasing number of families are homeless or at risk of being made homeless.  I acknowledge that some improvements have been made in terms of crisis management by community welfare officers, but that situation can only last for so long.  We are not counting the people who are couch surfing, the families who have split, the families who have difficulties getting their children to school and the families that must store their belongings because they have had to move out of their accommodation.  Local authorities need to capture that information so that we can go after the problem.</p></speech>

A family may no longer live together or they may be split up, so they are at risk of being made homeless as they will be out of their accommodation in the next two weeks.  If one can captures statistics on a problem then one can deal with the matter.  Some local authorities have a different way of capturing such information than others.  We need a constant way of capturing the statistics.</p> <p>  The HAP scheme has been piloted in a number of areas.  I want HAP to be successful and I see its value in solving the poverty trap that many of us have complained about for years.  I want people to be able to go to work, which is the intention of the scheme, and RAS has done the same to some extent.  I know of instances in which landlords have been actively talked into withdrawing from the RAS scheme.</p></speech>

Some auctioneers will say part of the reason they do not encourage people to engage in RAS or rent assistance is due to the red tape involved.  Therefore, the schemes need to be simplified.</p> <p>  The number of people on waiting lists differs from area to area, as do the staffing ratios in local authorities.  Some authorities have the ability to deal with an additional workload while some are at the bare bones in terms of staff.  The embargo has been a very blunt instrument from that point of view.  The staffing ratio is an important issue.  </p> <p>  The Minister outlined the make-up of waiting lists, which I was aware of, but I wish to caution against something.  It can be very bad value to build a lot of one bedroom houses, as it can lead to less flexibility.  Someone may live on his or her own but later on in life he or she may need a carer or someone similar in the house.  Therefore, it is important that we have correct housing provision.</p> <p>  In terms of approved housing bodies, I have some good experiences and some not-so-good experiences.  The Minister is right: we have a large number of small bodies and there is a bit of cherry-picking.  In my experience, quite a bit of cherry-picking takes place.  We should look at the way this is handled in other European countries where the likes of the European Investment Bank act as co-funders.  When the housing associations met the committee they talked about the need to have a co-guarantee with Government because they are charities.  I hope this issue will be addressed because a very large amount of money could be leveraged.  I hope there will be a mixture of tenure and renters in some of the schemes developed, because renting must be an option into the future.  For a cohort of people, renting is about security of tenure and affordability of rents, but it is not the same issue for every group of people.  I hope we will adopt a more European approach to renting because it will be increasingly difficult for people to purchase homes due to restrictions that have been placed on mortgages and also because a lot of people live on fairly low incomes.</p> <p>  I wish to mention a number of specific issues.</p></speech>

We have specific issues in Galway, Waterford and Limerick as well as in major towns.  One learns something new every day, but the Deputy will be surprised to learn that some of the major towns around Ireland have specific issues.  Departmental analysis has been carried out and we have heat-maps with a lot of detail.</p> <p>  As I said in my earlier reply to Deputy Cowen, some local authorities require a different mix of housing.  How we address the matter will depend on what stage some of them have reached and, therefore, we need flexibility, but the Deputy can be assured we will address the matter.  We will announce the allocation in a few weeks' time.</p><p> I am glad Deputy Catherine Murphy raised the issue of homelessness.  She was the first Deputy to do so.  The community welfare officers are doing a lot of good work and it must be acknowledged that their intervention mechanisms are working.  I accept that they are not the be all and end all, but they are targeting certain families and ensuring that they can remain in their homes.</p><p> As regards homeless in the greater Dublin area, analysis has shown that the actions we took before Christmas were successful.  To be fair to the three Deputies opposite, they were part of the process and I took their comments on board.  However, we now see that there is a pull towards Dublin in the services that are being provided.  I can assure Deputies that we are looking at other ways and resources that we can utilise to deal further with the issue of homelessness for both rough sleepers and homeless families.  Families are a priority for me, including how quickly we can get units for them and turn them around.  I have made commitments in that regard.  I do not want to be dealing with NIMBY syndrome, although there will always be a bit of it.  Let us call a spade a spade.  We will make the hard decisions and will get the units in place for families in particular.  </p><p> The Deputy referred to statistical analysis.  One cannot be absolute about it, because some local authorities do things in different ways.  Our analysis shows the difference between housing need, which is 89,000, and specific issues concerning homelessness.  In November 2014, there were 168 rough sleepers in Dublin.  In December 2014, emergency accommodation nationally was 2,858, while the figure for Dublin was 1,868.  We have undertaken analysis but are constantly examining how we can refine data coming through from local authorities in order to create a consistent approach and categorise the people concerned.</p><p> I appreciate the Deputy's analysis regarding the HAP.  It is a necessity that it works in order that people can avoid the poverty trap, and the 30-hour period is a critical issue in that respect.  We have already spoken about simplifying the bureaucracy around the scheme and we are examining that matter.</p><p> The Deputy also referred to staffing ratios and waiting lists, and I wish to give an assurance on this point.  I have spoken to almost every local authority in the country.  In addition, together with the Ministers of State, Deputies Paudie Coffey and Ann Phelan, we have visited many chief executives, particularly in priority areas.  Local authority staffing issues are a priority for us, including in the Deputies' own local authorities.  If staff are required for any specific housing issues, this will be addressed if it is not already being addressed at the moment.  Some 300 extra jobs in local authorities have already been sanctioned to deliver the social housing strategy.</p></speech>

If Deputy Catherine Murphy has any specific issues she should raise them with me directly and I will address them myself.</p> <p>  I take on board her point concerning the mix of houses.  When I referred earlier to singles or singles plus children, I did not mean that one-bedroom houses would be built.  I was just reflecting on the current demographic situation in the country, which amazes me because it just shows how substantially Ireland has changed in recent years.  I agree with the Deputy that two-bedroom units would be more prevalent.</p> <p>  I also take on board her comments about approved housing bodies or AHBs.  I had some very good experiences with them before taking up my current ministerial post.  There is a need to examine the whole AHB area more holistically.  In my earlier reply to Deputy Stanley I said we would be bringing in regulations on that. </p> <p>  The Deputy also asked specific questions about HAP.  Some 1,000 households are in HAP and the breakdown is 50-50 new versus those on rent supplement.  Did she ask another question also?</p></speech>

Local authorities have different approaches.  The problem with community welfare officers is that, with the best will in the world, some people, including families, are being captured far too late.  When people contact me I encourage them to talk to the local authority officers dealing with homelessness.</p></speech>

We could prevent people from getting to that stage.  If we can get over this year, we may well see more housing stock starting to come in.  It is critical this year that, as far as possible, we deal with families in particular.  It is much more difficult to find accommodation where children are involved because of keeping them in school and all the rest of it.  Some local authorities are capturing it in different ways, however.  I will discuss some of the issues separately with the Minister.</p> <p>  It is one thing to get landlords to include their properties in RAS or HAP, but it does not stop there.  The ongoing management of those schemes is quite labour-intensive.  Given the number of houses that will end up in that sector, which will be the dominant one, has the Minister considered the management issue and what the needs of local authorities will be?  Are those matters being examined?  Others will not come into the system if it does not work, so word of mouth is really important from a landlord's perspective.</p></speech>

We have a project board and a site group which are dealing with the whole issue of HAP.  We are nuancing it all the time and as we roll out the process we are learning more.  We are taking on board what we learn all the time and are adapting to the new process.  Ultimately it is the right direction to take, although one does not get everything perfectly right on day one.</p><p>It takes people out of the poverty trap.  I will take the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on board directly.  If she has any individual problems she should please bring them to me as well.  That is chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Social Protection, which is directly involved.</p><p> I am very interested in the prevention of homelessness, which the Deputy has raised several times in different fora.  Last year was the first in which we had composite national data on homelessness.  That is a fact.  We publish quarterly reports on this.  I agree that the focus has to be on prevention.  The tenancy sustainable protocol, of which the Deputy is well aware, has been rolled out and has had an impact.  We might need to roll it out even further.  There is also the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, educational campaign on people&rsquo;s rights.  We have also stressed an enhanced role for the local authorities, for them to be as active and involved on the ground as well in prevention.  It is not just a question of addressing the problems as they arise but of trying to facilitate and prevent families in particular coming in.  I accept and agree that if, in the next 12 months or so, we can do that in a nuanced and better way it will be quite helpful because the economic turnaround and the supply coming up will redress the problem.  We have had detailed discussions with all the organisations I mentioned, on how to roll the protocol out even further, with the PRTB on the campaigns, and Deputies can expect to see them, and with local authorities about being more hands-on. </p></speech>

Notwithstanding that the Department is no longer paying the general purpose grant to replace the local property tax allocation, the local government fund is being robbed of the rates associated with Irish Water.  Even at that, the valuation throughout the country is &euro;60 million.  In early December the Minister gave me details of the rate applicable in each county, which brings the total figure to &euro;48.7 million.</p><p>The estimate valuation of the assets on transfer was &euro;11 billion.  Now we see applicable commercial rates of only &euro;59 million or &euro;60 million.  If I look at my constituency, the rate bill in Offaly was &euro;15,000 for last year.  There was a lot of money spent on building new plant during the course of the past ten years in the county.  It amounted to a multiple of millions; far in excess of &euro;1 million.  The general rule of thumb one might expect on commercial rates on property is 1%.  When the figures are &euro;11 billion and &euro;59 million, something does not add up.</p><p> This plays into the subvention issue and the ongoing process on whether we are on or off balance sheet to be adjudicated by EUROSTAT.  We never paid the commercial rates of the ESB, Bord na M&oacute;na or the parent entity of Irish Water, Bord G&aacute;is.  However, the Government is subventing the commercial rates which were to accrue to the local authorities.  This is one issue.  The local government fund is another issue.  I would have expected a lot more funds to accrue to the revenue streams of the local authorities.  This is not the case.</p><p> As we know from the Taoiseach's response to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Fleming, Fianna F&aacute;il's spokesperson on public expenditure, there is a delay concerning the process involving EUROSTAT and the CSO.  The CSO continues to deliberate on the process of making the application to EUROSTAT.  We now understand that this will not be returned until June at the earliest, which is a bit longer than we had expected.  However, it is vital that we state definitively if &euro;59 million is or is not the exact figure.  If it is not, and if it is to increase in the coming year further to continued re-evaluations - it has been completed in only three counties - will the local authorities, which have a wrong rate at present, be reimbursed in the future?  The other issue is the on-off balance sheet issue.  It may be no harm if it is off balance sheet or if it is on balance sheet because it would be two and a half times less than what Irish Water is paying for the &euro;300 million it borrowed recently.  This is my question on the local government fund.</p><p> What level of subvention cuts, if any, are being rolled out to the group water schemes in the coming year?  What process or level of finance is being put in place for subvention levels to proposed new group water schemes in the future?  Are there any changes to the mechanisms which were in place prior to this?</p><p> On community and rural development, when will the new social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, be rolled out?  Is money being put aside for potential legal action which may arise from the tendering process?  I am not being facetious, but rather I am conscious of the representations I am receiving from many of the staff in the various programmes throughout the country who are worried and nervous that their role will be diminished by this new body.  Will the same level of funding that was there in the past be put in place?  Is there a threat to the existing employment rights of those who are involved in various schemes which will now fall within the remit of SICAP?</p><p> Will the Minister address the issues raised about the local government fund and, in particular, the commercial rates that have been apportioned to the assets that are now in the ownership of Irish Water.  The payments to local authorities are far less than I had expected.  It could be argued that this is the difference between passing the EUROSTAT test or not.  It, therefore, needs to be clarified.</p></speech>

There were 32 recommendations in the report of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, which falls within the remit of the Minister's Department.  The Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, has a particular role in this area.  There is a concern that Pat Spillane and the committee went away, put together a good report, came back with it but, as I understand it, there is not much allocated for this year.  A figure of &euro;1 million has been mentioned.  Are there any plans to ramp this up, given the pressure that rural Ireland, in particular, is under?  Has consideration been given by the Government to this issue?</p> <p>  The funding for the group schemes is down to &euro;17 million this year.  That is a drop of about &euro;10 million or &euro;11 million on last year.  Is there a concern about this?  Will it meet the needs of the group schemes? </p> <p>  On the local government fund, what is the overall figure for the amount collected in local property tax in 2014?  I am looking at the local government fund figures.  It is made up &euro;440 million from the local property tax.  A full collection would have brought in approximately &euro;530 million.  I am open to correction on this.  This figure is fairly similar to Fianna F&aacute;il's figure.  A figure of &euro;440 million has been pencilled in for it.  If there is a balance, where did it go?  Some 80% of the tax is supposed to stay with the local authority.  The other 20%, from the better off local authorities, is supposed to be distributed to more rural counties such as Leitrim.  What has happened?  There is potentially &euro;100 million as l&aacute;thair.  </p> <p>  Some &euro;1.167 billion in road tax is being collected.  Another &euro;223 million is coming from the Exchequer.  This gives a total income of &euro;1.85 billion in the local government fund.  There may be a good explanation for the payments out, but some &euro;459 million is due to be disbursed under the local property tax allocation.  I am referring to both last year's and this year's figures as they will be roughly the same.  Some &euro;364 million is allocated for what is called local and county roads.  This brings the expenditure figure up to &euro;823 million.  Some &euro;1.85 billion is coming in and &euro;823 million is going out.  There is about &euro;1 billion or so to be accounted for.  A sum of &euro;484 million of that is accounted for because it is fed back to the Exchequer.  Therefore, &euro;459 million is disbursed under the local property tax heading, &euro;364 million is disbursed under the local and county roads heading and &euro;484 million is being sent back to the Exchequer.  It presumably goes into something such as housing.  However, this brings the figures up to approximately &euro;1.3 billion.  There is approximately &euro;550 million missing.  Will someone please tell me where it is gone?  </p> <p>  We all know that local governments are starved of funds.  We are always speaking about it and how to fund them.  We have a gap of &euro;500 million.  Where is it gone?  Why is it not going to local authorities?  This money is collected through motor tax for roads.  It is collected through the local property tax because, as the Minister and his predecessors have always stated, it is for footpaths, lighting, libraries and parks.</p> <p>  Will the Minister also comment on the EUROSTAT issue?  An official from EUROSTAT was quoted recently in the "paper of record". </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-03a.312" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1052" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12015030300002#L00500"><p>Is the 20% distribution of the local property tax to the local authorities based on the needs and resources model or is it related to a lower property tax?</p><p>Very often, what happens is that local authorities are deemed to be quite well off because, for example, they have a staffing complement they have to pay and they have a number of swimming pools, libraries and so on.  However, very often, the local authorities, particularly in developing areas, are playing catch-up and it can work hugely to their disadvantage.  What is the mechanism used for the 20%?  Is it about higher property tax ratios?  Is it to do with the requirements to fund what they already have in place?  What mechanism is used to calculate that?</p><p> I also did my tot on the same figures as Deputy Stanley so I will not repeat that one except to say I also could not see where the &euro;532 million was accounted for.  With regard to the capital investment for Irish Water, this is no longer very transparent because of the way development contributions are now handled, given the local authority no longer applies them in regard to water and wastewater on a planning application since 1 January 2014.  With Irish Water, it seems to be hit and miss and it is quite difficult to get information on this.  Therefore, we do not know the position.  I understand something will be published in the next few weeks by the Commission for Energy Regulation but, if we cannot get an answer on that today, can we get some sort of a comprehensive answer on how that is handled and what legislation it comes under?  I am only annoying the Minister by writing parliamentary questions and not really getting to the answer I am trying to get to, which is an explanation of how it is actually done.</p><p> On the conservation grant, in a reply last week the Minister for Social Protection told me the Department needed additional staff to deal with that but the Minister, Deputy Howlin, said on Friday or Saturday that it did not.  The Department of Social Protection tells us it is being handled almost on an agency basis for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Is any contribution being made by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to process that?  What involvement is there, if any?</p><p> In regard to the figures Deputy Stanley highlighted, why are we being shown the &euro;484 million, which is a contribution to the Exchequer, as though it was a contribution to local government?  It is almost a dishonest way of stating it.</p><p> The Minister said in his statement he is finalising matters with Irish Water in regard to the conservation grant and that he will be issuing regulations.  Will it actually be regulations or will it involve primary or secondary legislation?</p><p> The last Leader programme was renegotiated with the result that we got a reduced amount from Europe, if I remember rightly, but we were able to reduce the contribution we made.  What will be the approach on this occasion?  Will it be the same as the current situation or will we revert back to making a higher contribution but getting more funds into the country?  Has the approach been decided at this stage?  Clearly, there is huge demand on that fund, which has been one of the success stories over the years and has produced some very interesting initiatives.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-03a.318" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12015030300002#M00600"><p>Yes, I have a note of that.  I have been down the road on this a few times before with Deputy Cowen.  There is no robbery going on here.  The &euro;59 million, which was estimated to rise, is in the local government fund, as the Deputy knows.  If this change had not been made, a global valuation would have been made, similar to other utilities.  Certainly, the estimated rates bill would not have risen above &euro;59 million.  Therefore, we were quite happy with the &euro;59 million and believe it is accurate.</p> <p>  Deputy Cowen asked in regard to the group water schemes.  I had a very good meeting in Galway with representatives of the group water schemes and they had very few issues.  I would make one point.  We have a combination of various political representatives here.  These people supplied water throughout the country at their own cost for years, which should be acknowledged.  They have paid for water for decades.  I will certainly support them in whatever way I can because they deserve to be supported for the efforts they have made throughout many parts of Ireland where it is very difficult to provide water.</p> <p>  As regards new group schemes, the grant increase in 2014 is to &euro;7,475 per house and they will continue to be part of the rural programme.  We will announce the allocations shortly.  The reductions in subsidy were agreed with the national federation.  When I met the representatives in Galway, we spoke at length on a number of issues.  The only request they had was that they wanted a multi-annual framework.  I have agreed to that because I recognise the work they do and want to ensure they are able to plan ahead.  I believe Deputies across the House will welcome the fact I made that decision.</p> <p>  Deputy Cowen's next question related to SICAP, the social and community activation programme.  That has been announced and the groups have been told.  As the Deputy will be aware, there is a two-week cooling-off period so people can decide if they want to do something or question the process in one way or another.  Outside of that, I simply make the point that those groups have been notified.</p> <p>  I committed to dealing with a number of issues that were outstanding and which everyone in this room knew about.  As part of the process, there were specific issues in regard to women's networks, the islands and Traveller groups, and there were other smaller issues.  I am confident that, across governmental processes, we will be able to deal with all of them.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about employment rights.  That is a matter for each organisation, not for me.  However, I would expect the allocations given and the way in which we have managed this would, by and large, maintain jobs if not create jobs in some cases.  The ins and outs of every individual company is their own business and neither the Deputy nor I can get involved in that.  They are the entities in their own way.</p> <p>  I am not sure if the Deputy asked a question about the Leader programme.  If not, I will move to the next set of questions.</p></speech>

I do not expect that today.</p></speech>

If it is possible, we will do it.  I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, to comment on the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, report.  Deputies opposite would agree it is a great document and much work went into it.  There is an allocation in that regard.  Over the coming months, however, we will be looking across Government funding mechanisms to enhance it as well.  There are a number of programmes that could do this, and in particular I will look to ensure, with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, that this happens.  It is a lifeline and a great project for rural Ireland.  I have answered the question about group schemes.</p></speech>

The group sewerage scheme figure was trebled from approximately &euro;2,100 to in excess of &euro;6,000.  Does the Minister have the figures for sewerage and water schemes?</p></speech>

The local property tax figure for 2014 was &euro;491 million and for 2015 it is to be &euro;440 million.  Some 80% of the local property tax is retained locally to fund various public services.  The remaining 20% has been redistributed to provide additional funding to certain local authorities, as the Deputy is aware.  There have been lower property tax bases due to variance in property values throughout the State.  It is there to ensure no local authority received less funding than in the previous year.  Authorities could work from this baseline.  The issue has been raised in other forums and confusion arose at times.  All local property tax proceeds are funding local authorities.  I am quite categorical in that regard.</p></speech>

The difference is between &euro;491 million in 2014 to &euro;458 million this year.  The Deputy asked about motor tax and funding arising from that.  Motor tax has always been paid to the Central Fund.  There have been questions about triple taxation and motor tax being used to fund 34 local authorities and their water services.</p></speech>

The Deputy subsequently referred to EUROSTAT and the water conservation grant.  EUROSTAT has not delivered on this at all.

For example, there were wide variations with regard to staffing ratios of local authorities, and that is factored into their baseline.  A local authority in Meath has half the staff of Kerry but it has more people living in the county.  Kerry is a net contributor, as it happens, so I am not being unfair to the authority.  When do local authorities in growing areas ever play catch-up in an equalisation fund?</p></speech>

Any of them which are growing got more from the local property tax.  It is a not a fund that we can fully control either.  The idea is to ensure we have created a system with a floor based on fairness.  That is what we did.  It has been broadly accepted.  The Deputy had a similar question to that of Deputy Stanley and we have outlined those issues.  There will be a capital investment plan for water announced in the near future.  Initial plans have been announced.  I have forgotten the Deputy's specific question.</p></speech>

The ESB will not be given extra resources to administer the grant and it will have to absorb that cost in its allocation.  The water conservation grant will be done through a regulation.</p> <p>  The Leader programme has been very successful and has made a great contribution throughout the country with regard to volume of schemes.  Deputies opposite would agree with that comment.  We can learn from the process and I have very specific ideas about it.  I am working very closely with the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, in this regard.  The bottom-up approach, dictated through a process from Europe, is good and we will see the results of that in the near future as the process kicks off quite soon.</p></speech>

There was a change because commitments were already made.  The funding for the new programme is &euro;250 million, with the rate of co-funding still to be finalised.</p><p>The rural development programme is still being signed off at European Union level.  It is important to note that I will shortly be in a position to call for expressions of interest in the new programme.  My priority is to ensure the &euro;250 million available under the programme is allocated to facilitate new projects in the community.  </p><p> On the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, the &euro;1 million allocation was for projects specified in the commission's report, which makes 34 recommendations.  The focus of the report is the co-ordination of existing funding for rural areas across various Departments.  The CEDRA report does not identify a new budget but addresses ways of ensuring existing budgets are spent in rural areas.  </p><p> Under the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, which will be rolled out from 1 April 2015, &euro;28 million will be allocated to communities.  The tender process was won by 44 development companies.  The major concern among the Leader companies was that the process would result in privatisation.  This concern has not been realised. </p><p> The Minister addressed employment issues.  Such matters, including legal issues, are for the Leader companies to address.  The Minister also noted that community funding for women, Travellers and the islands has been ring-fenced.  Additional funding has been provided for community development programmes in the inner cities.  In addition, &euro;400,000 was provided for an Cos&aacute;n in Cherry Orchard and Changing Ireland and &euro;9.5 million interim funding has been provided to the local and community development programme.

I remind members to switch off their mobile telephones and other technological equipment.  This meeting has been convened to consider the Revised Estimate for Vote 33 - Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in detail and to question the Minister in that regard.  A briefing on the 2015 Revised Estimates from the Department, along with a suggested list of questions from the committee secretariat, have been circulated to members.

It also seeks to promote the Irish language, support the Gaeltacht and to assist the sustainable development of island communities.</p><p>A gross provision of almost &euro;273 million is available to my Department for these purposes in 2015.  An additional &euro;6.216 million in funding has been carried over from the 2014 capital provision.</p><p> In broad terms, the 2015 breakdown of allocations to my Vote group are as follows.  There is over &euro;156 million for arts, culture and film, which includes approximately &euro;59 million for the Arts Council.  There is over &euro;39 million for the conservation and protection of Ireland's built and natural heritage, with some &euro;43 million for the Irish language, the Gaeltacht and islands, as well as over &euro;38 million for North-South co-operation, including support for two North-South implementation bodies in the form of Waterways Ireland and Foras Teanga.  The 2015 allocations again reflect the Government's ongoing commitment to the prudent management of our public finances but this is the first year in many years that there is growth in current funding for my Department.  There is also additional funding for key targeted initiatives, including over &euro;17.5 million for the decade of centenaries, including a new &euro;4 million current allocation for 2016, &euro;2 million in additional funding for the Arts Council and &euro;2 million in additional funding for national cultural institutions.  There is also &euro;1 million in extra funding for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and &euro;1 million in additional funding for peatlands restoration.</p><p> I will provide some further detail in respect of the key areas of expenditure under my direct responsibility.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, will speak about the relevant aspects of the Gaeltacht, Irish language and the islands programme, and the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, will address matters related to Culture Ireland.  My colleagues and I will make brief remarks and are happy to expand on any matter that members may wish to raise afterwards.</p><p> A key priority for arts and culture expenditure in my Department for 2015 will be the ongoing commemorations programme.  The &euro;4 million announced as part of the 2014 budget will support Ireland 2016, the Government's initiative to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Easter Rising.  It is very important that we commemorate those pivotal events of 100 years ago, which had such a profound impact on the future direction of this country.  Ireland 2016 is much more than commemorations, and it presents us with a once in a generation opportunity to evaluate what we have achieved as a nation over the past 100 years and to look to where we want to go in the next 100 years.  Further details of the programme will be announced shortly.  The capital allocation of &euro;13.5 million for commemorations, supplemented by &euro;1.216 million in carryover from 2014, will provide for a number of flagship projects, or what I would term permanent reminders, to be progressed this year.</p><p> These include the development of an interpretive exhibition centre within the GPO complex that will focus on the events of 1916.  Other flagship commemorations capital projects in 2015 will include the adaptation of the Kilmainham court house and gaol for use as a new visitor facility, the restoration of the existing premises at Cathal Brugha barracks to provide front-of-house facilities for visitors to the archive and for a state of the art storage facility for the military pensions archive.  There will be development of a new visitor centre at Teach an Phiarsaigh at Rosmuc and a tenement museum at 14 Henrietta Street, along with the refurbishment of Richmond barracks, where the leaders of the 1916 Rising were held after their surrender, as a cultural, educational, training, heritage, tourist and community facility.  The 2015 funding will also support the following projects, which form part of the Ireland 2016 commemorations programme.  There will be development of the recital rooms at the National Concert Hall, as well as ancillary works to the foyer and front-of-house facilities.  There will be redevelopment of the National Archives at the Bishop Street headquarters.  Turning to other areas, I am very pleased that 2015 sees the first increase in current allocations for national cultural institutions which share an additional current allocation of &euro;2 million for 2015.  Furthermore, the major &euro;32 million renovation of the National Gallery continues this year.</p><p> The important and valuable work of the Arts Council has also been recognised and reflected in the 2015 current allocation of almost &euro;59 million, which is an increase of &euro;2 million over the 2014 allocation.  That will allow the council to continue to support arts organisations of various sizes, from national bodies such as the Abbey Theatre to small, locally based groups across a very broad range of individual art forms and practices.</p><p>Funding is also provided to meet the anticipated demand in 2015 for funding in respect of the Cork events centre.  A sum of &euro;2.5 million is provided in 2015 for Culture Ireland.  The Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, will expand on the priorities for Culture Ireland in his contribution.</p><p> With regard to heritage, funding of &euro;39.3 million has been made available for the Department's heritage programme.  This includes over &euro;31 million allocated for current expenditure, with a further &euro;7.9 million in capital funding.  A further &euro;3.75 million in funding has been carried over from the 2014 capital provision.  The protection of Ireland's unique raised bog special areas of conservation is a key concern, as is the avoidance of major fines by the Court of Justice of the European Union.  This is reflected in the allocation of an additional &euro;1 million in 2015 for peatlands restoration.  Priority will also continue to be given to the turf cutter compensation schemes and investment in alternative turf cutting sites for affected cutters.</p><p> The Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, will speak about the relevant aspects of the Gaeltacht, Irish language and island Estimates in his address to the committee, so I will proceed to North-South co-operation.</p><p> A provision of more than &euro;38.5 million is made available to support the two North-South implementation bodies, An Foras Teanga, comprising Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency, and Waterways Ireland.  These budgets will be subject to the approval of the North-South Ministerial Council in due course.</p><p> Ireland's heritage and culture are of enormous inherent value.  In addition, they make a significant contribution towards growing the economy and helping to create jobs.  I will be happy to expand on any matter the members might wish to raise after the Ministers of State make their contributions.</p></speech>

Mar is eol don coiste, t&aacute;im lonnaithe sa Roinn Dl&iacute; agus Cirt agus Comhionnanais chomh maith, ag pl&eacute; le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; comhionnanais agus le comhphobail nua.  T&aacute; r&aacute;iteas agam anois gur mhaith liom a l&eacute;amh amach don choiste.</p> <p>  I appreciate the opportunity today to discuss with the select sub-committee the 2015 Estimates, to outline this year's priorities for Culture Ireland and to build on the Minister's remarks on commemorations.  The Department's Culture Ireland programme continues to create and support opportunities for Irish artists and companies to present and promote their work at strategic international festivals and venues.  In 2014, the Culture Ireland grants programme supported more than 300 projects from all art forms, thereby enabling artists to perform in 51 countries around the world.</p> <p>  It was a successful year for developing new audiences.  Culture Ireland supported Irish artists to reach 3 million live audience members and a further 6 million television viewers.  Irish artists won high-profile awards and critical recognition.  They also created important platforms for other State bodies, such as Tourism Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, to gain wider benefits for Irish tourism and business interests.</p> <p>  Culture Ireland's &euro;2.5 million allocation for 2015 will be directed across all art forms, in line with its strategy, which is focused on strengthening Ireland's international reputation for innovation and creativity, and creating career opportunities for Irish artists globally.  In addition to grant round funding and showcasing initiatives, Culture Ireland also supports Ireland's two key overseas cultural centres, the Irish Arts Center in New York and the Centre Culturel Irlandais in Paris.  As well as maintaining important connections to the diaspora, these centres in prime cultural cities help to develop further opportunities for Irish artists.</p> <p>  To date in 2015, Irish artists have presented work globally, from New York to Sidney, as part of the 164 events that have been awarded support so far to take place this year.  The music showcasing at Celtic Connections in Glasgow, the Folk Alliance International conference in Kansas in the US, and home showcasing at TradFest in the first two months of this year have already reaped contracts for many Irish musicians.  For the St. Patrick's Day period this year, Irish film festivals have been supported to take place in Boston, New York, Rome, Moscow and Sidney.  Irish musicians will tour extensively in the US, Australia, China and Europe.</p> <p>  I wish to refer to the ongoing work on commemoration of the historic events of 1916.  The commemoration affords us time to interrogate the past based on hard evidence, to examine the issues in a dignified way and for communal reflection to seek to understand better the emotive forces that propelled the emergence of an independent state.  Almost 100 years ago, Irish men and women, North and South, took up arms in many uniforms.  The question of this island being part of an empire was one question that many sought answers to.  They took that question apart in the trenches of the western front, in Gallipoli, at the Somme, in the rubble of Sackville Street, in the GPO and on Moore Street.  Our memory project, in the decade of commemorations, will remember all of them.  The expertise of our cultural institutions and the advice of historians, who comprise the Government's expert advisory group, will be central to our commemorations, as will the vibrancy and imagination of young people.  I look forward to the continued support of Oireachtas colleagues as we develop and deliver these commemorative events.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, is aware of the issue because he has worked on it for some time.  A number of the islands are located off west Cork, such as Bere Island, Sherkin Island, Dursey Island, Whiddy, Heir Island and Long Island.  Funding will be in place until this month.  There is a campaign to find a core funding stream and a permanent home in a Department.  The Minister of State's officials have made contact, and he has had very senior contact at ministerial level, with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Will he give me an update on progress with that issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-03a.367" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/997" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN22015030300002#F00100"><p>As the Chairman rightly pointed out, and I believe it is a question he has raised before given it is of interest to his home county, where there are a number of non-Gaeltacht islands, it was highlighted before Christmas that there would be changes to the funding streams as a result of the new cap.  I am delighted to inform the committee there is going to be a change.  I acknowledge the work that took place behind the scenes, particularly by the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, and their officials, with my own officials, in finding a solution.  From 1 April, responsibility for the non-Gaeltacht islands will be moving to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and there will be a move in funding from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to the tune of &euro;300,000, and &euro;400,000 in 2016.</p> <p>  There has been a lot of uncertainty around the non-Gaeltacht islands.  I met people on both Bere Island and Sherkin Island and I had two public meetings prior to this decision, so I know there was a degree of stress and distress on this issue before Christmas.  However, work can progress with willpower.  We can sometimes be critical of a lack of interdepartmental thinking and a lack of proactivity at an interdepartmental and Government level.  However, in this instance, I believe a tremendous effort has taken place between my Department and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and also with the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan's officials, to ensure there is a proper funding stream in place from 1 April onwards.</p> <p>  I say this by way of an update, given this was announced in the last number of hours.  I acknowledge the role of the Minister, Deputy Kelly.  For the first time, there will be continuity of responsibility in one Department for both the non-Gaeltacht islands and the Gaeltacht islands, which I believe is a good thing.</p></speech>

This is a very timely and apt response.  While I do not expect the Minister of State to have the answer to this question today, the last time he was here, I mentioned to him the abandonment before Christmas of a tendering process for a Long Island ferry.  If he cannot answer now, that is fine, but perhaps later this afternoon or tomorrow an official might let me know whether that process was concluded successfully and when the contract was awarded.</p></speech>

We were all concerned that the financial pressure on the cultural institutions was going to lead to a juncture at which they might have to introduce charges.  As nobody wanted to see that happening, this is positive.</p> <p>  The overall spending on the arts has seen a slight increase, which I welcome, and I welcome what we are spending across the whole spectrum.  Can the Minister give us absolute assurances in terms of the disbursement of these funds and in light of the transparency that exists, both in respect of her own Department and in respect of the Arts Council and how it transacts its business?</p><p>The country is doing well in the area of film and some impressive initiatives have been taken.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, will be conscious of what is being done in Donegal where an initiative has been established with the local authority to promote Donegal as a destination for film production.  A significant amount of funding is being made available to the film sector.  Can the taxpayer expect to see a return other than the aesthetic benefit we get from the production of high quality television and film entertainment?  Obviously, there are benefits that accrue to the country on a tourism front and further benefits that may accrue in terms of attracting international investment in the sector.</p><p> In the area of natural heritage, there has been a dramatic cut in funding from &euro;14 million down to &euro;9 million.  I am concerned as to how that might impact on the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  To a great extent it is the unsung hero of the public service.  It works out of the public eye but does very valuable work on our behalf.</p><p> In terms of the built heritage, I am aware of the difficulties around the whole Moore Street project and I am supportive of what the Minister has attempted to do, but what is the present position with regard to Moore Street and does the Minister have any ambition to take the project forward?</p><p> I note that &euro;43 million is being made available for the Irish language and the Gaeltacht and islands, as well as more than &euro;38 million for North-South co-operation, including support for two North-South implementation bodies, one of which is An Foras Teanga.  Out of that &euro;81 million of expenditure what amount is being spent on language support and language promotion?  Is is possible to extrapolate that information from the figures provided?</p></speech>

The Arts Council is funded by my Department and is statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations.  Therefore the arm's length principle applies.  It is independent in its decision on who it funds and the amounts it allocates.  As a public body the Arts Council is required to adhere to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's code of practice for the governance of State bodies and other practices of good governance and transparency.  Disbursal of funding is required to be fully in line with public service financial and accountability requirements.  I understand that the Arts Council also requires the organisations it funds to comply with similar standards.  On its website the Arts Council commits to operating to the highest standards of corporate governance and has adopted a corporate governance regime in accordance with best practice, which includes a section on conflicts of interest.  Full information on the council's funding decisions is made available on its website.  Everything that has been paid out between 2008 and 2015 relating to funding is on its website.  I am happy that the Arts Council continues to discharge its duty as the principal State agency for the promotion and development of the arts in Ireland in a strategic but transparent manner.  It also publishes a newsletter on its decisions.</p> <p>  Returns from the film industry include 6,000 full-time jobs and 53 feature films which were made last year.  Many of those employed in the industry are graduates.  Some 65% of investment is inward investment.  Some 20% of tourists come here because of movies they have seen.</p><p>The film is digital media-based and the content is a major growth market.  I was in Kilkenny recently to meet the people from Cartoon Saloon.  The company's film was a major hit and got a great nomination.  Unfortunately, it did not get an Oscar prize, but it has won awards.</p></speech>

I was happy to watch it on television.  Having said that, it is a great story for Kilkenny.  There are 50 people employed there with plans for more employment.  That is one of the opportunities the film industry produces.</p> <p>  A high-level expert group is examining the film industry to determine how to create the right environment for the industry to thrive.  We had the section 481 incentives in the budget last year which gave tax relief on investment up to &euro;50 million.  The expert group is in place.  We are keen to examine this not only on a piecemeal basis, but to have a proper plan for the film industry because it is important to our economy.</p> <p>  A Deputy raised a point about a reduction in funding for built heritage.  The figure appears to be down but actually it is not down.  We had a one-off &euro;5 million built heritage scheme last year.  This was the built heritage jobs leverage scheme and it was very successful.  A total of &euro;5 million was invested by Government and the scheme managed to leverage a further &euro;10 million from private owners or organisations.  This allowed many of the heritage projects to go ahead.</p></speech>

It was added back in this year and that makes up the difference.  Although there appears to be a reduction, in fact, it stays the same.</p> <p>  I was asked about Moore Street.  I am satisfied that I have fulfilled my statutory responsibility with regard to the national monument.  Of course I was disappointed that Dublin city councillors rejected a proposal that would have allowed the restoration works to be carried out and for a visitor centre to be provided in time for Easter 2016.  That said, my door is still open and my officials continue to engage on the matter.  The national monument is 14 to 17 Moore Street and that is where my responsibility lies.</p></speech>

I have an overall responsibility for policy and there are component parts within that area.  Foras na Gaeilge has responsibility for North-South matters and matters outside Gaeltacht areas as well as Northern Ireland.  I will pinpoint the support systems &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has to support and develop the language.  The authority has overall responsibility for implementing language planning within the Gaeltacht areas.  We could try to break it down and ask about the different areas in financial terms, but I believe we need to consider the matter holistically.  The overarching focus of my post is a 20-year strategy and how we work towards the implementation of different schemes within the 20 year strategy.</p> <p>  If Deputies have specific questions on specific areas and seek a financial breakdown, I can provide it, but it is difficult to pinpoint which areas are developing or where the promotion is taking place because it is such an all-encompassing policy area.</p><p>Maidir leis An Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain, is &eacute; sin an cloch is m&oacute; ar mo phaidr&iacute;n.

The growth in the current funding for the Department is to be welcomed, after a number of years of decline.  I have some brief questions.  Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l alluded to one of them, namely, the views on extending the built heritage jobs leverage scheme.  Will it proceed and what shape will it take?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-03a.385" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/973" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN22015030300002#J00300"><p>As I said, the build heritage jobs leverage scheme was a one-off &euro;5 million stimulus package in 2014.  It was very successful and leveraged another &euro;10 million in private funding, meaning &euro;15 million was invested in heritage throughout the country.  Many projects benefited from it.  As things improve I will put the case forward as to why another stimulus package should be funded, to the same extent if not more, if possible.  It is a great way to protect our heritage.  </p> <p>  Many communities are now involved.  The Heritage Council does great work in that respect, and has a great system whereby it has engaged with communities over the past ten years.  Heritage is for all of the people and many people are now becoming interested in it.  There are many heritage groups throughout the country.  It is great that there is so much engagement.  Our heritage is part of who we are and where we belong.  It is important that it is protected.</p> <p>  In regard to the jobs leverage scheme, some 540 historic structures across every county benefited.  Of those, 525 were protected or proposed protected structures, with the remaining 15 located in architectural conservation areas.  It hit every county in the country, which meant that everybody benefited from it.</p></speech>

It is true that we should concentrate on that because many groups and heritage buildings benefited from it.  The Minister had a recent opportunity to visit my constituency, and visited Lissadell House in County Sligo.  I ask her to elaborate on her impressions of the estate.  Does she believe that historic houses such as Lissadell House and Hazelwood House are in need of Government support and funding?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-03a.387" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/973" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN22015030300002#J00500"><p>I was delighted to be in Sligo and I enjoyed the hospitality and great welcome I got.  It was a pleasure to visit Lissadell House which is owned by Mr. Edward Walsh and Ms Constance Cassidy.  She could not be there that day, but he was there, along with his family, and it was great to see the major work they have carried out in the house.  It is important that people are living in our historic houses because buildings are nothing without people.  Deputy McLoughlin was there and saw how important it is to have a family living in such a house and what it brings to it.  Renovations have been carried out and works of art have been returned.  It has a close connection with Yeats.  I was there to launch the Great Yeats Birthday Party which is happening on 13 June this year and is part of the Yeats 2015 commemorations.</p> <p>  There is also a connection to Countess Markievicz.  We are coming into 2016.  Women played a significant role in the Easter Rising, such as Cumman na mB&aacute;n.  The north west has a particular focus on the role played by women and it something we should consider in the commemorations.</p><p>All of these historic houses are very much part of our heritage and I believe we need to support them as far as we can and do whatever we can to ensure they remain an important part of our architectural heritage.</p></speech>

B. Yeats.  My question concerned additional grants for such houses.  This is a house that is being lived in.  Nine members of the Cassidy-Walsh family live in it at the moment.  It is a certainly a huge tourist attraction in the north west and it is vitally important that funding be made available and that when people are prepared to invest they be encouraged by the Department in respect of additional funding.</p></speech>

In the meantime, our staff are always very willing to give advice and provide whatever supports we can, because sometimes a bit of advice is of huge help in restoring some of these properties.  We are very happy to engage and work with owners of these houses.  Tax relief is available for work on historic homes that are open to the public for visits, and that is the case with Lissadell, because the owners very much want to make the house available to the public.  That incentive would be of assistance.</p></speech>

The Minister said that an additional &euro;6.2 million in funding had been carried over from the 2014 capital provision.  I wanted to check that this was for capital funding.  What projects is this funding for?  Is it just for existing projects or is there something new?  From 2008 to 2015, the budgets of the national cultural institutions and the Arts Council were cut by between 40% to 50%.  Although there are some very minor increases, they go nowhere near replacing those huge cuts in funding.  All of the cultural institutions have contacted Deputies and publicised the fact that some of their services are at breaking point.  I wanted to clarify whether those institutions were safe for this year.</p> <p>  The budget of the Department has increased for the first time by a small amount, but nearly all of that increase has been in the form of capital expenditure on projects that have already been announced, such as the renovation of the National Gallery of Ireland.  It has been said previously in this committee, so I will not labour the point, but much of the increase - &euro;4 million - is for the commemoration of the 1916 Rising.</p> <p>  From research I carried out previously, I know there is a real trend in jobs in the arts in the direction of part-time and poorly paid work and the use of free labour.</p><p>This has been highlighted a number of journals.  To give the Minister some examples, an article in <i>The Visual Artists' News Sheet</i>stated that unpaid internships are becoming more common for a new generation of young arts workers, and that they prop up the sector.  An article in <i>Irish Journal of Arts Management and Cultural Policy</i>stated that the reality is that the replacement and displacement of paid jobs by interns does happen.  Will there be any change in that trend now that we are meant to be in so-called recovery and the budgets are increasing?  There is not much point in having increased budgets if people do not benefit and are not able to remain working in the arts sector on a living wage.<br/><br/>The National Library of Ireland has been highlighting this issue.  Last October it said it would need &euro;1.25 million in this year's budget just to keep existing services in operation.  That was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i>on 15 October.  I may be mistaken, but the figure on page 25 of the Estimate is &euro;600,000.  Is that correct?  That is half of what it asked for.  Page 25 also shows the figures for output performance.  It is not as if these institutions can cut back on the number of people who want to come in and avail of the services.  The number of visitors in 2013 increased by 79,000, or 43%, on the previous year, so it would seem that the staff in the National Library are dealing with more people but the budget is being cut throughout the years.  Will the National Library and other such institutions be able to provide the services?  The figure for the National Archives is listed on page 9, but it is stationary; there is no increase.  Is it the case that it is charging people for its services and is therefore able to maintain those services?  That is not a positive direction for the arts and heritage sector.<br/><br/>On the centenary commemorations, we are all delighted that these will happen, but many people in the arts are not happy that almost the entire increase in the arts budget is for the commemoration of 1916 when people at the coalface are not able to heat their studios or maintain the practice of their craft.  Will the Minister comment on that?</p></speech>

The figure for the Cork Events Centre is &euro;1 million.  For the heritage sector the figure is &euro;3.75 million, and the allocation for Teach an Phiarsaigh is &euro;250,000.  There is a total of &euro;6.2 million, and that is carried over from last year.</p> <p>  What is important is that in the 2015 budget I have managed to secure the position for the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  We have held the funding and turned the corner.  The budget increased considerably compared to this time last year, and as things improve I will continue to fight for more funds for my Department.</p> <p>  The extra money achieved in the budget reflects my own priorities in terms of the decade of centenaries.  There was &euro;17.5 million in total, &euro;13.5 million of which was for capital expenditure and &euro;4 million of which was for commemorations.  The arts will benefit from that &euro;4 million as well.  The cultural institutions will benefit.  The Arts Council got an extra &euro;2 million this year, but that was over and above the &euro;4 million allocated.  We have &euro;4 million for commemorations, but the cultural institutions will be able to benefit from that fund, so the arts will benefit.</p><p> An additional &euro;2 million was secured for cultural institutions and I have a breakdown of that figure.  The Deputy mentioned the National Library of Ireland.  We work very closely with it and my Department is in constant contact with it in terms of how we can best serve its needs.  It was satisfied with the additional &euro;600,000 we were able to allocate to it this year.</p><p> Access to the National Archives of Ireland is free.  Payment is required for copies taken of the archives, and that practice has been in place for many years.  The policy of free access to all our cultural institutions will continue.</p><p> The other part of the increase in the budget relates to the &euro;1 million allocated to the peatlands restoration programme and a further &euro;1 million allocated to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.</p><p> In regard to the additional funding provided to the cultural institutions, many people are working in the creative sectors and they will benefit from the additional funding provided for the commemorations programmes, including &euro;2 million for the commemorations programmes, &euro;1 million for the cultural programme out of the &euro;4 million allocation, artistic projects associated with the major capital projects and the creative and artistic input to interpretations.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned provision for artists.  The change in the tax relief for artists increased the threshold to &euro;40,000.  Research by the Arts Council has shown that there is significant employment in the arts.  While of course we would like more to be employed in that sector, perhaps some people have decisions to make for themselves in terms of supplementing their income.</p><p> Some 300 high-end jobs have been created in the construction work on the National Gallery of Ireland.  Some 200 jobs have been created in the construction stage of the new interpretative centre in the GPO, and that project is progressing very well.  Therefore, more jobs have been created in terms of funding for the arts.</p></speech>

I was obviously referring to people in the arts sector, so the Minister has not answered my question.  I also asked about the National Library of Ireland.

I want to be clear in pointing out that this year we have managed to hold on to our budget and to increase it.  We held the budget as it was for 2014 and increased it.  I am very happy with that.  The National Library of Ireland and the National Museum of Ireland are satisfied that there has been an increase in their funding.  We work very closely with them and they were happy that the funding was provided.</p></speech>

I will brief as I am aware of the time factor.  In regard to the commemorations planned for next year, will any specific funding be targeted at local authorities or different community groups or allocated to commemoration activities involving young people and, if not, why not?</p> <p>  In regard to the Culture Ireland grants programme, the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, said that 300 projects were supported last year and he mentioned a number of film projects.  Did that extend to literary projects?  This year, County Meath will be hosting the third Hay literary festival, which is world renowned.  Will projects like that one be covered under that grant this year?</p><p> My final question is for the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh.  The budget allocation for the Irish language strategy has been increased by 10%.  Has that money already been earmarked or will local communities like Baile Ghib in County Meath be able to avail of such funding?</p></speech>

As regards the &euro;4 million in additional funding for the 2016 commemorations, I was clear from the start that I wanted community involvement in them.  Of course we will have the major parades which are all very much Dublin focused, but I want to give all citizens an opportunity to participate and engage with 2016.  For that reason, 25% of the &euro;4 million budget has been allocated to local authorities.  We have met the city and county CEOs and I welcome the fact that they are keen to get involved and be part of the 2016 commemorations.  Liaison officers and commemoration committees have been appointed in every local authority and we will be working closely with them.  They will be able to roll out local programmes, involving heritage officers, museum curators and arts officers from all local authorities in every county.  I am happy that they are keen to become involved.  The year 2016 will be for all citizens in the whole country and will not be confined to events in particular places where the Rising took place.</p> <p>  Deputy McEntee mentioned the Hay festival with which I am familiar.  It is a very successful literary festival and we will try to support it as best we can.  I will examine whatever application is sent in.</p></speech>

In Deputy McEntee's county of Meath, there was a major event during the 1916 Rising in Ashbourne.  It is important that the commemorations are not seen to be Dublin focused and that every local authority is able to commemorate the activities that took place in Easter Week 1916.  There were quite a number of insurrections, small and large, throughout the country.  Those best placed to commemorate them are local authorities who know the dynamics of their own areas much better.  They can deal with community groups that wish to commemorate the individuals concerned and the events that occurred.</p> <p>  As regards the Deputy's specific question, an international programme to support Irish writers is in place.  In partnership with the Ireland Literature Exchange, more than 20 translations of Irish writers have been produced.  We had a major presence in Edinburgh, as well as at the Toronto and Berlin book festivals.</p></speech>

This meeting has been convened to consider the supplementary information received in respect of the 2015 Revised Estimates for public services from the Department of the Taoiseach's Vote group.  </p> <p>  The D&aacute;il ordered on 18 December 2014 that the following Revised Estimates for public services be referred to this sub-committee for consideration: Vote 1  &mdash;  President's Establishment; Vote 2  &mdash;  Department of the Taoiseach; Vote 3  &mdash;  Office of the Attorney General; Vote 4  &mdash;  Central Statistics Office;Vote 5  &mdash;  Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions; and Vote 6  &mdash;  Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  This sub-committee met the Taoiseach on 18 February to consider the Revised Estimates for 2015.  As some members requested further information arising from the discussions that day, it was agreed to await such further information before completing our consideration of the Revised Estimate for Votes Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive and before sending a message to that effect to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, in accordance with Standing Order No. 87.  In response to this committee's request, supplementary information was provided and has been circulated to members.  Are there any comments?</p></speech>

I wish to refer briefly to the issue of Irish Water and its classification in terms of the market corporation test.  The assumption up to now was that we would know by March how that would work out, that is, whether Irish Water would pass that test.  However, in the Taoiseach's letter to the Chairman, he says that the CSO is working to finalise its report in the next two to three weeks; hopefully it will be done by the end of March.  He goes on to say that the assessment will then be provided to EUROSTAT and that the CSO has been advised that the final response from EUROSTAT is likely to take at least two months from the date of receipt of the assessment.  At this stage it looks like it will be at least June - possibly later - before we get a final decision on the market corporation test for Irish Water.  This is significantly at variance with what we understood and I am pleased to get that information on the record.  That is the only point in the Taoiseach's letter to which I wished to refer.</p></speech>
