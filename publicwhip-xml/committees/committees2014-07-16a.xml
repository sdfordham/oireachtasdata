However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they will be entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise the witnesses that the opening statements they have submitted will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br />I advise the witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery that, at the request of the broadcasting service, they are asked to ensure for the duration of the meeting their mobile telephones are turned off or switched to aeroplane, safe or flight mode.  The meeting is being broadcast live on UPC channel 207.<br />The meeting is about therapy services for children with special needs in an educational setting.  The joint committee in the past considered the issue of education of children with special needs.  A range of interventions for children with special education needs is possible, among which are health and personal social services such as psychological or speech and language therapy services provided by the HSE.  To assist the joint committee in its consideration of this matter, I am pleased to welcome the National Council for Special Education, which is represented by Ms Teresa Griffin, Ms Mary Byrne and Mr. S&eacute; Goulding, and the HSE, which is represented by Mr. Pat Healy and Ms Anne Melly.</p> <p>We were scheduled to have another guest, a principal from St. Joseph's primary school in Fairview, but she is unavailable due to unforeseen circumstances.  I invite Ms Griffin to make the presentation on behalf of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Teresa Griffin" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014071600004#F00200"><p>I thank the committee for its invitation to attend this afternoon.  Mr. S&eacute; Goulding is head of operations for the NCSE and Ms Mary Byrne is head of special education.  The NCSE has a vision of a society where children and adults with special educational needs can achieve their potential.  We all know "it takes a village to raise a child" and for a child with additional needs, the village needs to comprise a family, appropriate schooling and support, if required, from clinical and therapeutic professionals.  These supports include clinical psychology, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and psychiatric support etc.  From the outset, I emphasise that the NCSE is very supportive of the approach being taken under the HSE progressing disability services for children initiative, as well as A Vision for Change.  We welcome the move away from a multiplicity of therapy service providers to the development of regional multidisciplinary teams around the country.  The NCSE is represented on the various national and local groups leading this initiative.  In many places around the State, our special educational needs organisers work well with local HSE disability services to plan and put services in place for students with special educational needs and we work hard to ease anxieties of parents and children in transitioning to and from school.</p><p>  Special education is a key Government priority and the NCSE is very appreciative that the resources we need to provide to schools have continued to be made available to us, despite the very difficult fiscal environment.  We have the ability to respond to growing student enrolments by continuing to allocate additional resource teacher and special needs assistant, SNA, posts in line with need and by establishing special classes and expanding special schools.  When meeting colleagues from the HSE, they advise us of their capacity issues and constraints.  Groups constantly tell us the position around the availability of clinical and therapeutic service continues to be problematic for children, families and schools.  When a child needs clinical or therapeutic intervention and does not receive it, we all know there can be significant repercussions for the child&rsquo;s development and in terms of an ability to access education.</p><p>  It is generally acknowledged that HSE-funded early intervention teams work well in certain areas of the country but I have been told by parental, school and advocacy groups that access to important health services is limited in other parts of the country, with gaps in services and long waiting lists.  The main issues raised include lengthy initial waiting lists, insufficient intervention if it is provided; inadequate support in mainstream school settings; concern that only some students in special classes receive support and others in the same class with equivalent need do not receive such support because of the segregated multiple service providers and concern that some children have to be taken out of school and brought to clinical settings.</p><p>  The difficulty around accessing a diagnosis of disability was one of the reasons the NCSE recommended to the Minister a change in how resource teachers are allocated to mainstream schools.  We felt one cannot base access to additional teaching support on a diagnosis of disability if there is not national consistent access to such a diagnosis.  Parents and schools have told us that they make difficult decisions based on the availability or absence of therapy services.  For example, parents seek to send their child to a special school or a special class where he or she might get therapeutic support even if the child is capable of attending mainstream education, parents refuse to allow their child to leave a special class or special school setting because they might lose their therapy intervention and parents seek professional reports simply to access special school placement so the child can get therapeutic or clinical supports.  Worryingly, mainstream and special schools are encountering severe difficulty in deciding if they can maintain the enrolment of some students who present with challenging behaviour in the absence of clinical supports.  We all agree that none of these scenarios is a good outcome for the child and none is in line with the national policy of supporting inclusive settings.</p><p>  As I stated at the beginning, the NCSE is broadly supportive of the progressing disability services initiative but children are only children for a period.  We have recommended that, pending the full roll-out of the progressing disabilities initiative, children with special educational needs should have early and timely access to sufficient clinical services, which should be provided on a consistent, efficient and equitable basis throughout the country.  This is something that the HSE is also working hard to put in place.  I am very happy to any of the committee's questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Healy" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014071600004#F00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to attend today.  I am joined by my colleague Ms Anne Melly, specialist in disability services.  The committee requested information on the provision of therapy services for children with special needs in educational settings and I will outline the national programme under way to standardise and develop the way in which services for children with disability, including those with autism, are delivered.  I will then deal specifically with issues in the Dublin north and north city area in which St. Joseph&rsquo;s school is located.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive has recognised the overall need to standardise the way in which services for children with disabilities, including those with autism, are delivered.  We are currently engaged in a reconfiguration of our existing therapy resources to multidisciplinary geographical based teams for children as part of the national programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People between zero and 18 years.  The objective of this exercise is to achieve a national unified approach to delivering disability health services so there is a clear path to services for all children, regardless of where they live, what school the go to or the nature of their disability.  There is a national structure to underpin this change management programme with national, regional and local implementation groups in place.  All elements of the implementation structure include multi-stakeholder involvement, including representatives from the Department of Education and Skills and its relevant service strands, including the National Educational Psychology Service and the National Council for Special Education.</p><p>  The vision for service delivery is that every child and its family will have access to required services; there will be equity and consistency across the country; effective teams will work in partnership with parents; resources will be used to the optimum; and health and education will work jointly to achieve best outcomes for children.  The intention is to roll out an integrated care model that will allow children, whatever the nature of their disability, to be seen as locally to their home and school as possible, at primary care level when their needs can be met there and by a network specialist interdisciplinary team if their needs are more complex.  The primary and network teams will be supported as appropriate by specialist support services with a high level of expertise in particular fields.</p><p>  An additional &euro;4 million has been specifically allocated in 2014 to drive implementation of the programme, and this equates to approximately 80 therapy posts.  As the programme is rolled out, it will ensure that the resources available are used to best effect in order to provide health supports and ongoing therapy to all children between zero and 18 in line with their prioritised needs.  In particular and over time, it will mean that all children, regardless of where they live will have equitable access to services based on their needs.</p><p>  Within the Health Service Executive, local services are delivered through integrated service areas, ISAs.  Each of these is at different stages of development across the country and the 2014 plan will see developments across a number of categories.  The local implementation groups in the mid west, Meath, west Cork, Cavan and Monaghan are already well developed and will consolidate implementation of the model, building on progress to date.  The local implementation groups in Kerry, Mayo, Galway, north and south Lee in Cork, Wexford, Kildare and west Wicklow and the midlands are ready to move to the next phase and will begin to fully reconfigure their services in line with the model.  The local implementation groups in Dublin will also see significant progress; Dublin north and Dublin north city on the north side and Dublin south, south east, south west and south central on the south side will finalise the consultation phase with all stakeholders, complete implementation plans and commence reconfiguration towards the new model of service.  The local implementation groups in Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Louth, Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, south Tipperary, north Cork and Wicklow will progress to the consultation phase and will establish a health and education forum, reviewing and amending governance and management structures, service policies and procedures and prepare for reconfiguration in 2015.</p> <p>Turning to the reconfiguration in the Dublin north area, Dublin north and Dublin north city, services to children with disabilities in this area are provided by a variety of service providers, including St. Michael&rsquo;s House, Daughters of Charity, Central Remedial Clinic, St. Paul's hospital and special school, which is linked to the Mater hospital, St. Joseph&rsquo;s School for the Blind, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, HSE early intervention services and Beechpark services for children with autism.<br />While many models of good practice have been developed and implemented to meet the needs of children with disabilities in Dublin north and Dublin north city, access to services and the timeliness of the response to identified needs has been largely determined by whether a child resides in an area where there is a service provider with a level of resources which enables a speedy and appropriate response.  Access to ASD services for children with normal IQ or mild intellectual disability has been determined by whether the child attends a class supported by Beechpark services.<br />With regard to autism-specific services and complex needs, Beechpark services and St. Paul's hospital and special school are autism-specific services, but the remaining service providers are also involved in meeting the needs of children with autism when the presenting need is less complex or where the primary disability is intellectual or physical or sensory.  Beechpark services are primarily targeted at providing appropriate multidisciplinary supports to children in Dublin north and Dublin north city who attend special ASD-specific classes that have been developed in special and mainstream schools.<br />With the multiplicity of service providers involved and the diversity of children&rsquo;s needs, ranging from mild intellectual disability to much more complex needs involving multiple disabilities, issues have been identified regarding the need to have very clear identified care pathways for all children requiring health and personal social services.  Evidence would suggest that there is greater clarity with regard to access where needs are clear and diagnosis is straightforward.  However, the pathway for children presenting with complex needs has not been as clear, and gaps have been identified.  In this context, some children diagnosed with ASD have had difficulty accessing a service and transitioning from one service to another.<br />In response to the many challenges emerging regarding the reconfiguration of multidisciplinary services in these areas, a dedicated senior manager has been assigned by the HSE to manage the reconfiguration programme.  An implementation group comprising all stakeholders - including all service providers, representatives from the education sector and parents - is in place and work is actively progressing to attend to the realignment and reconfiguration of the service delivery system in line with the agreed policy direction.  This work involves considerable system changes and it has been recognised that during the period of implementation additional resources will be required to address waiting lists and service pressures.  In this context an additional five posts were approved in 2013 to enhance the service response for children with ASD, and these posts are currently being recruited. <b></b>More important, a further 21 posts have been sanctioned in 2014.  This additional resource will enable the commencement of an enhanced service response for those children presenting with complex needs, including ASD, in this area.<br /><b></b>The HSE and the Department of Health jointly commissioned the NDA to carry out research into the practice of assessment of need.  The findings of the report produced on the national programme for children aged 0 to 18 years highlighted that where the Health Service Executive has configured disability services for children into geographically integrated teams, the statutory assessment of need process worked better and in a more streamlined way.  There was also less emphasis on using the assessment process to develop diagnoses in order to meet the specific entry requirements of individual services.  Accelerating the reconfiguration into geographically integrated teams would be very important, therefore, in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the statutory assessment of need process.<br />I am happy to answer any questions from members of the committee.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1154" speakername="Averil Power" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014071600005#G00300"><p>I thank Mr. Healy and Ms Griffin for their opening remarks.  I thank Teresa in particular for being very up-front in her presentation about the impact of this lack of services on children.  It is totally unacceptable that whether a child receives a vital service is dependent on where he or she lives.  This is very unfair to the children concerned.  We know that children with special needs need to receive appropriate interventions as early as possible, yet in some parts of the country this early intervention is non-existent.  In my area of Dublin bay north and in the broader north Dublin area, the waiting list for early intervention - the list to get on a list to be considered for a service - closed in November 2012.  No matter how serious the child's need, he or she cannot even get on a waiting list.  This is a really shocking and very unfair situation.</p><p>  The HSE presentation referred in detail to reconfiguration of services, and we all share its vision as to what services should be provided in an ideal world, but in the meantime, the HSE has been talking about this since 2011.  I have tabled this issue a number of times in the Seanad over the past three years and my colleagues in the D&aacute;il have also raised the issue in that House.  Every time I have raised the issue I have heard the same reply as today - that services are being reconfigured.  That is cold comfort to the children who have been unable to get any service in the meantime.  I support Ms Griffin, who is representing the National Council for Special Education, in her call that in the interim something needs to be done.  I agree that reconfiguration of services should be pursued, but in the meantime the resources need to be available.  It sounds as if this talk of reconfiguration is being used as an excuse for not providing resources and in my view this is very unfair.</p><p>  The principal of St. Joseph's in Fairview planned to speak to the committee today but she is unable to attend due to illness.  I will make some of the points she intended to present.  St. Joseph's is a mainstream school with a number of special classes which were provided on the promise of appropriate health and educational resources.  The educational resources are in place.  Originally, all the children in the special classes were being provided with speech and language and occupational therapy services from Beechpark, but because of cuts imposed in recent years, Beechpark has not taken on any new children.  The current situation was referred to by the National Council for Special Education in that only half the children in the class are receiving a health service, based on an arbitrary decision depending on when they joined the school.  This is very unfair to the children concerned and it has also caused health and safety risks for other students and for the staff because the behaviour of some of these children who are not getting the services they need has deteriorated to the point where a number of serious incidents have occurred when children have become out of control in the classroom and attacked teachers.  The principal rang me one day in tears as a result of the latest incident.  She said she did not want to be forced to expel primary schoolchildren because she wants to be able to look after them and to provide them with the service they need, but she is unable to do so.  She is at the end of her tether as a result of the impact of the lack of services on her children.</p><p>  When will the reconfiguration of services be completed?  In north Dublin, three years on, we are still talking about a consultation process.  In the meantime, children who started three years ago have now missed out during a vital part of their young lives which they will never get back.  I ask the HSE to provide the resources for a service which can then be reconfigured later as needs be to provide a consistent service in all geographical areas in the country.  The ideal situation would be for the health services to be provided on the same basis as educational provision.  The Department of Education and Skills made an arrangement years ago with the Department of Finance to ensure that teachers and special needs assistants would be provided when a special class was initiated.  The Department does not need to renegotiate with the Department of Finance for every new class because that agreement is in place.  This should be the case in the provision of the health service but it is not.  Has the HSE requested it in budget discussions?  Will it look for it?  Does the HSE agree that this would be a better solution to these problems?</p></speech>

I have two questions, which are both directed to Mr. Healy.  He referred in his presentation to the 80 new therapy posts approved for funding in 2014.  I understand there has been a delay in advertising those positions and they have not been filled as of today.  I ask Mr. Healy to clarify the position.  I ask him to explain the basis for the allocation of these posts around the State.  Has the HSE made any attempt to ascertain the number of therapy posts needed to ensure that the disability network teams will be fully staffed?</p> <p>What body, if any, measures the outcomes or consequences for children who are not getting the necessary level of therapeutic interventions in an educational context?  Apart from the impact on the individual, there is a long-term economic cost of failing to assist children at an early age to reach their potentials.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014071600006#H00200"><p>I welcome the NCSE and HSE guests.  Which existing therapy services are included in the new reconfiguration?  Can the HSE give us an overview of the pressures in different parts of the country?  There are different operations in various regions.  What are the waiting lists for the various therapy services?  Are they much longer in some areas than others?  Are young people being seen earlier in some areas, and do the waiting lists extend to more than a year in other areas?  Are there caps on the number of psychological assessments and other services a school can get?  My information is that the number of children a school can send forward to see an educational psychologist is limited.  As a result, schools must choose between children, which is not a position in which any school should be.  Is this case across the country?</p><p>  Could both guests elaborate on the distinction between services available to special schools and mainstream schools?  Parents have told me they felt they had to send their children to special schools because it was the only way they could access support services although the children were capable of being in the mainstream school system.  What services are affected by the distinction between special and mainstream schools?  Could the NCSE elaborate on its experience of the allocation of resource hours?  Its presentation has outlined that it very much depends on when a child is assessed and follows on from assessment.  Could the NCSE give more details on the number of students affected and whether it is different in various parts of the country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Healy" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014071600006#H00300"><p>The reconfiguration of services is a major change programme and we wanted to get it right.  We set out four categories of locations.  The first category is the mid west, where much work has already been done and the model is working well.  It is not getting additional resources this year but is moving on.  We will give some funding to support education and training and to keep the good work going.  The third category is Dublin, where there was clear recognition of the necessity to prioritise and address the challenges.  Category two includes a range of locations across the country where all the preparatory work in terms of consultation with families, schools and educators has been done, the care pathways are ready and we are ready to implement.  The final category is those that have work to do this year but will be ready next year.</p><p>  The prioritisation of the posts is related to need but also to the capacity to implement the reconfigured programme in a sensible and organised way.  We are targeting 21 posts to the north side of Dublin, which will make a significant difference.  The posts are cleared and will be filled on a permanent basis during the rest of the year.  We recognise we need to use the resources we have to target waiting lists.  We will not wait until the posts are there permanently but will use the resource at local level to use capacity between public, private and voluntary in order to address the waiting lists.  We do not want to lose the benefit of the reconfigured model.  The key aspect of it is that, as we roll out the model and apply more resources over time, we will eliminate the non-standardised issue whereby the service depends on the service provider to which one is aligned or whether a special school has resources attached to it, or issues such as the Beechpark issue in Dublin.

There is work ongoing examining how many posts we will require into the future and a workforce planning piece has been done.  The additional resource we have this year is &euro;4 million and we cannot move beyond that.  Our maximum capacity is to implement the 80 posts.  Including the posts that were approved last year and this year, it will be a 20% increase in the north Dublin area, which is significant.  I take the point made by education colleagues that we are not in the same position as them in that we do not have to get approval to proceed every time a special class is developed.  This is not how the funding of the health service has progressed.</p><p>  I have outlined how funding is being allocated this year.</p> <p>The areas where we target funding take into account significant pressures and the capacity to roll out the model in the current year because we need to do it appropriately.  The model does not envisage placing caps on schools.  With regard to making a distinction between mainstream and special schools, the purpose of the new model we are rolling out is to remove all of this inconsistency.</p></speech>

The point has been made in the feedback through education that those associated with a particular service provider or class may get a very good service, but the issue for us is that we must develop a more consistent approach.  The inconsistency which arises by targeting particular special schools or specific providers, as has been done in the past, is not the way to continue.  I referenced the work and research done by the National Disability Authority which supports this.  Where the model is implemented it makes a difference.  I take the point made by members that one must pay attention to today as well as roll out the model, and we are trying to strike a balance, but we do not want to lose the implementation of the model.</p></speech>

We will allocate 21 posts, which will make a significant difference.  These 21 posts, together with the five posts approved last year and other replacement posts, will mean a 20% increase in the resources available.</p><p>  The point made by my education colleagues is correct.  The health system does not have approval to proceed as special classes are developed.  We do not have the resources to match education in the same fashion.  There was acknowledgement that to roll out a reconfiguration of the services additional resources are required, and &euro;4 million was secured by the Minister to give effect to this.  This will go a long way.  We will implement a post specifically focused on developing outcomes associated with the model, which will help to demonstrate the benefit and measure how we progress.</p></speech>

At a meeting with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children I provided analysis of all therapy posts in the system.

A  member of staff there went on maternity leave and was not replaced, and children were left without a service.  This was entirely predictable and there should have automatically been a replacement but this did not happen.  From raising this issue in the Seanad over the past three years I have learned there seems to be a difference between how many people are recruited and how many people are providing a service.  Where do we stand in respect of this?  Mr. Healy stated 21 extra posts have been allocated.  I have been raising this issue for a long time.  For the past two years the Minister has stated a total of &euro;4 million has been allocated, but we have not seen it being spent or seen people in positions.

There is a commitment to utilise the resource to provide education and training to support the local implementation group process and to target local waiting lists while the permanent posts are being put in place using capacity in public, private or voluntary sectors.  We have the challenge of dealing with the employment control framework which operates in the system.  We are funded for a level of resource.  We are covered for a percentage of maternity leave but we do not have approval to go beyond this.  We try to prioritise therapy posts in particular.  We have set out in our operational plan for social care for the year the importance of maintaining therapy services, particularly for children.  In acknowledgement and recognition of the challenges in Dublin, such as Beechpark and autism spectrum disorder services, we prioritised the totality of Dublin during 2014 and we will continue to try to develop this, which is why we have specifically assigned 21 posts to the north of Dublin city.</p></speech>

We included the &euro;4 million funding in our service plan and have approval for it this year.  In January and February this year we announced the intention to spend the money.  We have gone through the process of settling on the allocation of the resource, approval to fill the posts is in place and we will fill them.  An important and positive part of this is we will be able to benefit from the graduates in September.  It is very positive to have the posts ready for them.  We will also target the use of the resource in the current year on waiting lists and on education and training with regard to local implementation groups.</p> <p>It is important to support the consultation and engagement with families.</p></speech>

I do not think we have progressed any further on this than when we started and I find that depressing, given the nature of the issue.  Services have not improved and all we keep hearing is talk of process, though I mean no disrespect to the witnesses.  If the 21 people referred to are recruited by the end of the year I will be the first to congratulate the witnesses.  I am sceptical because I have been told of recruitment for the past three years.  I have with me today replies to questions from different Deputies of various parties that raised the issue in the D&aacute;il and they were all told there is a process in place and people are being recruited.  I am sure Mr. Healy is trying to be helpful and I mean no disrespect to individual witnesses when I say I am sceptical but I get phone calls from school principals who are in tears because of what the children in their schools are enduring.

The issue of the cap on psychological assessments was also raised and I understand the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, has a limit of two assessments for every 100 children in a school.  Its approach tends to look at the whole school and put structures in place on that basis.  I think NEPS assessments are limited as outlined but I will come back to the committee later if I am mistaken.</p><p>  On the different services in mainstream schools and special schools, from an educational point of view, we allocate teaching and special needs assistant, SNA, resources to schools in line with pupil-teacher ratios that are set down for special classes, whether in mainstream schools or special schools.  For example, the standard pupil-teacher ratio in a special class for children with autism is one teacher and two SNAs for every six children but this can increase depending on the children and many special classes have three SNAs.  In other words, staffing of one teacher and two SNAs for every six children is the baseline and individual care needs are also taken into account.</p><p>  It is difficult to measure deficits in the monitoring of outcomes for children because, as our policy advice has said, outcomes are not routinely measured.  We recommend that where additional resources are applied outcomes must be measured because we would like such information.  Through additional services implemented by the Health Service Executive, HSE, in conjunction with voluntary organisations like Atlantic Philanthropies in Limerick and an initiative in Tallaght, we have become aware that where services are put in place 18% of children that need early intervention speech and language therapy will be discharged from the service.  In other words, the service that was put in place saved those children from multiple disadvantages later in life because the early acquisition of language is very important and children who do not acquire language early will be at a significant disadvantage when they start school.</p><p>  The last time we examined the matter of waiting lists was in preparation of our policy advice paper last year.  I think 23% of applications under the assessment of need process were met in the timeframe set down by the HSE, but perhaps the HSE witnesses here can confirm that.  This led to significant delays in children accessing resource teaching hours.  The impact on our services can be seen in the understandable frustration of parents who know they must have a disability diagnosed before additional teaching supports can be accessed.  We allocate resources twice a year and huge frustration builds as deadlines for our assessment and allocation process approach.  The frustration stems from the fact parents are on a waiting list and know if they miss the deadline they must wait another six months for the allocation of resource teachers.</p><p>  The lack of therapeutic services in certain parts of the country sometimes means a recommendation for an SNA service is made where speech therapy is required but the resources are not available.  When we turn down an SNA this also leads to frustration.  If parents are unwilling to allow a child to leave a specialist setting when he or she is suitable for a mainstream setting because of a fear of losing therapy services we must open more special classes.  This is counterproductive in terms of the inclusion setting and it affects our services.</p></speech>

I want to refer to a case that has arisen in the mid-Kerry area, where services are being reconfigured.</p> <p>St. Francis special school in Beaufort has encountered huge difficulties since last autumn in providing occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and physiotherapy to its students.  The experience of the 52 children attending that school has been appalling and very upsetting for their parents.  Many of the children have regressed because of the inadequate level of services.</p><p> I very much welcome the provision of 80 additional posts nationwide, four of which have been allocated to Kerry in recognition of the reconfiguration process that has taken place there.  The fact remains, however, that the reconfiguration has left huge gaps in the service and children have suffered immensely because of it.  Will the delegates indicate whether similar problems have arisen in other counties?  When will we see the full allocation of those 80 posts and what guarantees can be given to children and their families that they will receive the services they require?  Nobody is looking for a luxury service here.  I recently visited a mother whose son struggles to swallow and cough.  The lack of services available to him has led to his regressing so far that he developed a chest infection because he was not able to cough.  That is how fundamental these services are; it is basic stuff, not anything fancy.</p></speech>

I mentioned in my presentation the categorisation we devised, with category one comprising those locations in the mid-west, Meath, west Cork and Cavan-Monaghan where a great deal of progress has been made.  The mid-west is often cited as one of the exemplar sites around which the model was developed, with west Cork being another very early adopter.  The collaboration between schools, service providers and the Department in those areas is excellent.  When we talk about rolling out the naught to 18 model, that is what we are talking about.  Part of the learning from west Cork and other locations in the mid-west and elsewhere was the necessity of having that type of framework in place, with local implementation groups, good consultation with parents and so on.</p><p>  To address Deputy Griffin's question, a similar process to what happened in west Cork was undertaken in Kerry.  The general feedback I have had is that it has worked well, people understood what was being done, there was a great deal of engagement and consultation with the various providers and good linking into schools.  I will look into the situation at St. Francis special school in Beaufort, which I know well from my past role as director of disability services in the south.  I was not aware of any particularly significant problems there, but I will investigate the matter.  The general feedback on the changes has been good.  Indeed, the work done by the National Disability Authority shows that where the new model has been rolled out, it is working better overall.  I take the point, however, that the changes must be handled appropriately and in proper consultation with families.  There is obviously a resource issue at play here in the context of increased levels of need.  I am confident, however, that the model we are rolling out is the best one.  We must address the resource issues as we go on.  I will get back to the Deputy regarding St. Francis special school.</p></speech>

He might not have got around to reading the detailed e-mail I sent him last week setting out the problems at this particular school and elsewhere in mid-Kerry.  The previous Minister, Deputy James Reilly, met with parents and HSE officials in May and was well aware of the problems.  Students at St. Francis special school have had an appalling experience.  My concern is to ensure the HSE is fully aware of the terrible impact on the children in question and to seek assurance that the same thing will not happen elsewhere.  While I appreciate the need for reform and to do more with less, we cannot have that amount of damage being inflicted on the children who depend on these services.  While the objective is to move to a better system in the long term, this type of thing cannot be allowed to happen in the transition period.  I ask that the HSE be vigilant in identifying these types of problems and, where they arise, to rectify them as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

Has there been any progress in that regard or is there a continuing issue with finding suitably qualified people for posts?  Delays in assessments are causing particular problems for students who are transitioning from primary to second level.

I know from experience that there are huge difficulties for teaching staff in having to decide which students will be assessed.  In the particular school I have in mind, there was a class with five students all requiring an assessment and all in receipt of some level of resource hours.  Some were simply being taken out of the class and given whatever additional hours they could be given even though those hours were not necessarily allocated to the individual student.  One student was assessed and diagnosed as having severe dyslexia and dysgraphia and the recommendation in the NEPS report was that the child have an occupational therapy assessment in light of the issues identified with fine motor skills.  The parents discovered, however, that there was an 18-month waiting list for that assessment.  They had the NEPS assessment confirming the child's diagnosis but they were faced with a delay of 18 months before obtaining an additional diagnosis of what they suspected was an underlying condition.  That created huge difficulties for the school because although management knew what needed to be done for this particular child, it could not secure the resources to do it.  Will the new allocation model be able to address those types of scenarios?</p> <p>In this child's case serious consideration was given to whether he should move from mainstream to special school because the resources were there to deal with dyslexia.  The parent wanted to keep him in mainstream school.</p><p> It is an awful predicament for any school or teacher to be in, to be told what is wrong with one&rsquo;s son and that he needs additional tests which are 18 months down the line.  Eventually that parent had the tests done privately.  I believe if one has tests done privately, there is a problem with recognition of the report.  The school said the parent was better off staying in the public system because, although it would take longer, it would carry more weight.  I do not believe that is the case but that was the impression given.  Some parents weigh up whether to get it done privately or to hang on to do it in the public system if that will carry more weight.  This causes huge problems.</p></speech>

We recommended that time be taken to ensure further consultation.  We consulted quite widely and went back to various groups about our model.  It is a change and that is difficult to manage.  We did not want a model that would send a shock through the system and cause a great deal of upset and concern.  We recommended that the Minister take time to consult further with the various educational partners to make sure that when or if the model was introduced, there would be broad consensus behind it.  The last thing anybody wants, especially parents, and the children, is deficiency in the resourcing model.  For our model to work it is important that everybody work together to ensure it is put into place as quickly and smoothly as possible, which would reduce anxiety among parents and students.</p><p>  That is one of the reasons for recommending change, to ensure that resources would be available in the school, based on the educational profile of each school to help a child who everybody knew had difficulties.  We are not saying that children do not need to be assessed.  We believe absolutely that it is appropriate for children to be assessed but that is to inform the teaching and learning rather than just to drive the diagnosis of disability.  We accept recommendations from appropriately qualified people for the allocation of resources.  If one has a private diagnosis and it meets the appropriate criteria, for example, for autism, we accept that and allocate resources.</p></speech>

That is obviously not the case but it is the perception that there will be questions about the qualifications of the private assessor and whether that report will be accepted.  All of those issues can be addressed easily by relaying information.</p></speech>

The diagnosis is the least important part.  The schools should focus on the strategies to develop language skills and contribute to the individual education plan, IEP, as opposed to having a label and allocation and assuming that it is a case of happy days afterwards.</p></speech>

There are usually several parent representatives in the local implementation groups.  Where it works well it seems to have a very beneficial impact.  It overcomes the type of difficulties Deputy Griffin spoke about.  That is why we are trying to develop it.  Equally, it is a good feedback process.  If we start to roll it out and it does not work as well as we thought it would, we can get feedback and respond.  We want to make sure we do that right.</p></speech>

Historically, at primary level, children who had dyslexia or a mild or borderline general learning disability had the supports within the school.  The children did not need assessments, which was causing a bottleneck in the transition from primary to post-primary.  The Department changed the way of allocating services at post-primary level to mirror what was happening at primary level.  That should address the bottleneck.  There is still a requirement for an-up-to-date assessment of behaviour but it might not be necessary for a child with autism.</p></speech>

I was very impressed with the proposed new model.  I attended the briefing by the NCSC at the Department of Education and Skills.  It is a very positive step.  I spent several years dealing with those challenges in the classroom from the parents&rsquo;, the administrative and the teaching points of view.  It is very welcome and I look forward to its adoption.</p><p>  The collaboration between the HSE and CoAction in west Cork leads to the good work there.  One of my children uses that service and we are blown away by the level of service and the therapies available, especially speech and language, occupational, and all the four main therapies.  I do not want to make my colleagues jealous by boasting about this wonderful service. </p> <p>To give credit where credit is due, it is exceptional and parents are very appreciative.  I do not believe they realise how lucky they are in west Cork.  They believe the standard there is the standard across the board.</p><p> What are we doing to measure outcomes in the area of early intervention?  The amount of therapy my little two and a half year old girl is receiving is impressive.  My hope is that when she goes to primary school, there will not be the same draw on resources.  How far have we proceeded in measuring the outcomes?  I would like to know the NCSE perspective.  Perhaps the HSE is measuring also.</p></speech>

There was widespread consultation with parents of the children involved.  Everyone was happy to move forward with the reconfiguration process but, unfortunately, what people got was certainly not what they were told they would get during the consultation process.  Obviously, there is no point in having a consultation process and informing parents of the proposed outcome if it is not going to be followed through.</p><p>  When the problems first arose in Kerry, there was not a good system of feedback and parents did not feel empowered to highlight the problems and try to work through them.  I am thankful that in the past two months, there has been a process in place to allow for a regular meeting with representatives of the HSE to address the problems that arise.</p><p>  From the Kerry experience, one of the main problems is that when somebody goes out sick, nobody replaces him.  It is a huge problem.  If the driver of a train to Kerry is sick, somebody else replaces him and drives the train.  However, if one member of staff is not able to provide a therapy service for a child with special needs who desperately needs it, that child must go without.  That is not acceptable at all.  Will it be addressed?  Will we actually see flexibility in the system so that, rather than shutting off services, a replacement member of staff will be able to do the job that is necessary at the front line?</p></speech>

We are going to do it at national level this year.  It will be assigned specifically with a role in the development of outcomes for the programme for those between zero and 18.  Obviously, we will be working with colleagues on the wider agenda concerning outcomes overall but we want to focus specifically on the rolling out of the aforementioned programme.</p><p>  Deputy Griffin and Senator Power referred to leave.  Within the health service, we are limited by the employment control framework.  We have some flexibility, which is limited by resources.  There is a certain amount of cover possible, which often relates to maternity leave or sick leave, but if one goes beyond what is resourced, there is just no funding to cover.  There have been gaps in some of our services when there was a high proportion of leave, for whatever reason.  We have tried to come up with innovative ways of trying to deal with the problem locally, including through using clinics and reorganising how we operate.  However, the employment control framework and the necessity to live within fixed resources bring challenges.</p><p>  As I said to Senator Power, we have absolutely prioritised the therapy posts for filling, particularly those being talked about at this meeting.  Given the importance of therapy posts, we are trying to maximise the resources we have for the very reasons suggested by the Deputy and in recognition of trying to roll out the programme.  At the same time, however, there is a significant challenge in terms of health resources.  The employment control framework applies and we must live within it.</p></speech>

This was because of the scale of numbers and the fact that other parts of the country were regarded as more attractive.  These areas had more candidates.  Once one went below a particular threshold, it was more difficult to encourage people to come in one's direction.  We try to develop creative ways to attract staff.  Challenges can arise, but, broadly, we are training, through the universities, etc.  The important thing is to have the posts into which to put the graduates.</p></speech>

Why have there been such different rates of progress in the reconfiguration around the country?  Have there been particular problems?  It is stated the plans of the local implementation group are already well developed and are being consolidated in the mid-west, Meath and some parts of Cork.  Deputy Daly pointed out that the services are working very well in some parts of Cork.  I look forward to similar circumstances in north Dublin.  In some areas, staff are just finishing the consultation.  This is not only in north Dublin, but also in Dublin's north inner city and in south, south east, south west and south central Dublin.  The same applies in Donegal and Roscommon.  Do particular local issues arise?  Are there difficulties getting people to the table and reaching an agreement?  Why are some places already delivering services while others are still at the talking phase?</p></speech>

An important benefit of having a post like my own, as national director of social care, is that it brings a specific focus to the area of disability in the elderly.  What we are now able to do, and what we have done in the social care operational plan for the year, is bring a specific focus to this, give it the priority it requires and start to roll it out in a consistent, measured way.  Of course there are resource issues, which we have talked about.  It is necessary to put in place the appropriate process.  We need to put in place the appropriate policy procedures and guidance.  One needs to have consultation locally.  The type of discussion we have had needs to be engaged in, and that is what we are now doing.  I regard this as very positive.  I am positive about the future in regard to rolling out a consistent model across the country.</p><p>  There will, of course, be an issue of resources.  The positive aspect of this is that there has been an allocation of &euro;4 million this year.  We are saying clearly we are going to drive that out and ensure we do the recruitment.  As I stated, we must target waiting list initiatives and so forth in the meantime.  We do not have the benefit of the kind of arrangement the education sector has whereby once a need for a class has been identified, a dedicated and agreed resource can be obtained.  We are not in that space.</p></speech>

There was a coming together of the capacity to implement a new model and providing resources for it.  We were able to demonstrate that by making this push, we would get a result.  It is important for us to successfully do this, demonstrate that we can do it well and then seek more resources.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.111" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014071600002#A00300"><p>At its meeting on 1 July the Government decided that matters relating to the fatal shooting of Ronan MacLochlainn in Ashford, County Wicklow, in May 1998 were of significant public concern.  It also agreed to the processes relating to the establishment of the commission as defined in the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 on this matter, including the bringing of a resolution before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p>  In 2010 the partner of Ronan MacLochlainn, Ms Gr&aacute;inne Nic Gibb, took a case against Ireland under the European Convention on Human Rights alleging a failure on the part of the State to carry out an effective official investigation into this fatal shooting in accordance with the terms of Article 2 of the convention.  During friendly settlement negotiations on the case, a commission of investigation was proposed as a means of ensuring the State&rsquo;s compliance with the convention in this matter.  The settlement negotiations did not reach a satisfactory conclusion.  Instead, in a unilateral declaration which was submitted to the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, under Article 62(A) of the convention, Ireland admitted to a technical breach of the convention in this instance and, by way of a remedy, offered to conduct a commission of investigation into the fatal shooting.  In return, the court was asked to strike out the case.  In its decision of 25 March 2014 the court struck out the case on the basis that a commission of investigation would meet Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the convention in this matter.  Having regard to the outcome of the case and with the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I proposed to the Government that a commission be established.  The Government has agreed to this proposal.</p> <p>I emphasise that, without prejudice to the work of the commission of investigation, its establishment relates to a failure of process on the part of the State in this fatal shooting.<br />The draft order specifies that as Minister for Justice and Equality, I am the Minister responsible for overseeing administrative matters relating to the establishment of the commission, receiving its reports and performing any other function given to the Minister under the Act.  It also authorises me to set the commission&rsquo;s terms of reference.  I have arranged for the terms of reference to be provided for the members of the committee.  As provided for in section 5(2) of the 2004 Act, the terms of reference will be published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>.<br />I am also authorised by the draft order to appoint the member or members of the commission of investigation.  I will nominate a senior counsel to act as the sole member of the commission and inquire into the following matters: the circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of Ronan MacLochlainn on 1 May 1998 in Ashford, County Wicklow; and all relevant Garda matters, including the policies, practices and procedure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the planning and control of the operation which led to the fatal shooting and the training provided for personnel detailed for the Garda operation concerned.  The terms of reference provide that the commission shall keep Ms Gr&aacute;inne Nic Gibb, applicant in the case to the ECHR, involved in the investigation to the extent necessary to safeguard her legitimate interests.<br />The conduct of the commission of investigation is a matter for the sole member appointed to run it.  Essentially, the task of the commission is to decide whether the use of force by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this instance was proportionate.  It is envisaged that the commission will report in six months.  Based on this timeframe and excluding third party costs, the overall cost of the commission of investigation is estimated to be &euro;350,000.  In accordance with the provisions of the 2004 Act, following consultation with the commission and the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I will have guidelines prepared on the payment of legal costs and other expenses to persons who become involved with the commission.<br />Arising from the outcome of the case to the ECHR, it is necessary to proceed to establish a commission of investigation into this fatal shooting.  In accordance with the provision in section 3(2) of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, the approval of both Houses for the draft order is required.  Accordingly, I would be grateful for the support of the committee for the resolution before it.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the Minister's remark about not wishing to prejudice the proceedings, is it possible for her to indicate the outcome the commission of investigation is seeking in terms of the effective investigation into the shooting of Mr. MacLochlainn in 1998?  Specifically, will the investigation be looking into whether wrongdoing took place or is the purpose of this investigation simply to establish the facts?  Is there a question of wrongdoing on the part of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in carrying out their duties on the day?</p></speech>

The establishment of the commission meets our international obligations.  The internal investigations of the three bodies I referred to were deemed to be unacceptable.  A commitment was given in respect of the establishment of the commission of investigation to ensure we had a remedy.  The key issue relates to whether the use of force by the State was proportionate.  Deputy McGrath asked the same question.  That is the primary issue under consideration by the commission.</p></speech>

I will make some brief introductory remarks after which we can get into discussion.</p><p>  The Office of the Ombudsman has two jobs.  One is to investigate complaints and to try to find redress for individuals.  The other is to try to promote improvement in public services.  This report fits very much into the latter.  It was not a report designed to hold individual hospitals to account.  It is a report produced in conjunction with the Irish Hospice Foundation to try to highlight ways in which services for people at the end of their lives could be improved in our public hospitals and elsewhere in the health service.</p><p>  The report tries to do that by deriving its power from the stories of the people who came to us either with their complaints or their loved ones who came to us to complain on their behalf.  It is intended, if one likes, to try to promote better services in the future for people who are reaching the end of their lives and put forward some simple propositions as to how services could be improved.  Although there are many themes, the single biggest theme that comes across is the importance of good communication so that patients and their family members understand what is going on.  They need to understand the role of the clinicians and what is likely to happen.  They need to get the support they need at what is a very difficult stage.</p><p>  Fundamentally the report tries to illustrate the circumstances around a death being managed well - where people understand what is happening, where they have access to privacy which they need and where they have access to the support they need.  One cannot get over the grief that is associated with a death, but we can ensure that people do not go on being troubled and upset by the nature of what happened around the process of dying.  We cannot take away the grief, but we can make things as good as possible to ensure the person is comfortable, that they are without pain, that their loved ones are with them, that they have access to whatever support they might need by way of religious rights and that the whole process is handled with dignity.</p><p>  That is all I want to say by way of introduction.  The report and my comments stand for themselves.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.168" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1129" speakername="Susan O'Keeffe" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2014071600003#H00400"><p>I thank the Ombudsman and his office for producing this report, and I congratulate him on it.  As he said, this is a somewhat unusual report for us.  We spend a considerable amount of time talking about accountability and effectively trying to find someone to blame.  It is quite refreshing to have a report that does not take that approach and rather assembles the stories and finds some common themes, as the Ombudsman has done very adequately.  In Ireland, the area of death is one we are not great at and we are learning to be better at it.</p><p>  The Irish Hospice Foundation does extraordinary work in its own right.  I pay tribute to it and to Ms Angela Edgehill who is a terrific director.  Having a programme on television was really useful and I am sure the Office of the Ombudsman got extraordinary feedback from that.  The more we talk about the problems associated with death, the more likely we are to create an environment in hospitals where that becomes the expected thing and becomes a natural part of how we are without having to write out long recommendations.  However, having said that, we need to put come protocols in place.  I have read the report carefully.  I am sure the Ombudsman is aware that the Joint Committee on Health and Children launched a report today, which is obviously very valuable.  We are all singing from the same hymn sheet here, but the more often we talk about it and the more people we involve, the greater the possibility of broadening the reach of the message, which is very important.</p><p>  Does the Ombudsman have a view on how to engineer a change in hospitals?  One of the recommendations in the other report was to have a person who is responsible.  It takes much more than just having a person, does it not?  The Office of the Ombudsman has the opportunity to look closely at all those stories that people sent in, many of them very painful.  They opened up their hearts, albeit they did not start out thinking they would end up in a report such as this.  I am sure they are very grateful that this is what happened.</p><p>  What does the Ombudsman believe can be done?  While I have commended the publication of the report, I am concerned that because it does not point fingers and highlight what is wrong, it may have the capacity to gather dust.  When I wrote to the Chairman asking for the Ombudsman to be invited to appear before the committee, I believe I used that expression - I certainly did so when talking on radio about it.  I do not want that to happen.  Given the painful experiences people have shared with the Office of the Ombudsman, I do not want people to say, "That was a good idea, but we could not take it further".  It is a challenge for the Office of the Ombudsman and for us as a committee to know how we can help to be part of the process.</p> <p>We are making a start by engaging in the discussion.  As the Ombudsman sees it, what steps should be taken by members and his office to keep the momentum going?  I have a particular concern about the guidelines on resuscitation.  The request not to resuscitate clearly presents a very complex issue.  Partners' and families' rights and so on also present very difficult issues.  It is a particular issue that could cause many difficulties and clearly has.</p></speech>

From my perspective, leadership at a clinical and an administrative level within the health services is where the fundamental change needs to happen.  It needs to happen in a way that attends to the culture on individual wards in hospitals.  There are issues about physical infrastructure that can be put in place in order that people have a separate space in the time leading up to the death and also to be with their loved one after death.  There are elements which can be put in place and one can recommend that every acute hospital put them in place, but more of these elements relate to the culture of care on the ward and the way clinicians are trained in the initial training and also as they go forward.  The advantage of the hospice friendly hospital programme being in place is that one can point to a template for how to things well.  The report should lend impetus to that piece of work, on which we will continue to work with the Irish Hospice Foundation.  I too commend it for its work on this issue and also for the work it has done, as the Senator says, to bring the issue to the attention of many more individuals, clinicians and managers.  Hospitals need to have a strategy in place on how they deal with end of life cases.  In terms of a follow-up, we have in a sense commended a template to it.  We have put forward examples of how not to do things, but we can see what complaints are coming in and look at whether hospitals are implementing best practice set out both in this report and the report of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and the work of the Irish Hospice Foundation.  </p><p>  There is a strange ambiguity about Irish attitudes to death.  The traditions around it made it much more real and personal.  The majority of people now die in hospital and the numbers are striking.  Each day 35 people die in an acute hospital in Ireland and this, in a sense, has moved it out of communities and away from people's experience to something that happens elsewhere.  It is particularly important that it be dealt with well.  In that sense, we will continue to work with the Irish Hospice Foundation.  We will also work with the HSE to ensure it is driving the issue forward.  We will support the recommendations that there be a strategy and an individual responsible for the strategy in place in each acute hospital setting.  We will then monitor change through the number of complaints received.  If we continue to receive complaints, that will give us much more leverage to actually say it is not good enough and that the hospital should have been implementing the findings and that we want it to do so as a consequence of the investigation or examination we have undertaken.</p></speech>

Because they were generally dealt with at examination stage, the recommendations would have been agreed to.  This was not instead of giving individuals the redress they wanted, but very many of them came to the office, saying their primary motivation was to ensure that what they had experienced would not be experienced by anyone else.  In a sense, what we have done is deal with the second stage; we have not just resolved the issue with the individual hospital but also tried to drive the learning more widely across health services.</p></speech>

T&aacute;imid an-bhu&iacute;och gur th&aacute;inig siad isteach.  I thank the Office of the Ombudsman for the report.  It is interesting for members to come at it from a different angle.  Is Mr. Tyndall telling us that, in one sense, the report is a benchmark and that the Office of the Ombudsman is laying down the baseline for future data that will be the benchmark the office will use in measuring improvements in this area?  </p><p>  Has there been a change in the trend of complaints when one looks at complaints made a number of years back, or has it been similar?  Is there any sense that part of the problem is that clinicians and staff are under such pressure that the way in which they handle an issue is not intentional but the result of not having thought things through and that if they had more space and time, they could do this?  </p><p>  Mr. Tyndall referred to 35 people a day dying in acute hospitals.  Is that an increasing trend in the past couple of years?  How many complaints point to a lack of services to allow people to die in peace at home with the support of their loved ones?  Have cultural issue comes into play?  I have been at a number of funerals in the past year or so, one of which was the funeral of an African child and I was quite taken by the difference in the way that they mourned their children.  It was a very sad  ceremony and very different from the traditional Irish wake.  I am aware also that the Muslim community has a very different way of dealing with death.  Perhaps as a nation we have been slow to take on these cultural differences.</p><p>  The Office of the Ombudsman has instigated a report on a good death.  Is Mr. Tyndall thinking of producing similar reports on issues about which he has received a number of complaints on a theme?  We have mentioned the issue of direct provision accommodaton and prison services which are not necessarily under the ambit of the Ombudsman; therefore, he cannot conduct a specific investigation, but would he consider producing a similar report because there has been a series of similar complaints?</p></speech>

There is no question but that we will be producing more themed reports.  It is a good way of generalising what has been learned.  It sits alongside the casebook, the first of which is due to be brought out in the autumn.  The question is how do we ensure we do not keep repeating the same mistakes.  There is no question in my mind that staff in the health service are working under extreme pressure.  People will say they are struggling to find time to do the job well.  That said, the issues around palliative care and so are non-negotiable.  Should people be in pain because staff are too busy?  Should they not have access to adequate food and water?  Should they not be treated with dignity and respect?</p> <p>Ultimately, it is for me as Ombudsman to say that regardless of whether these things were caused - as they may have been in a small number of instances - by resource pressures, much of the time they are caused by the failure of leadership to create positive cultures around care.  I will continue to highlight them.  In a sense, there is a line over which one must not stray.  Whether an issue arises because of resource pressures, individual failure of leadership and management or a failure of training it is still for me to highlight it.  Ms McNally will speak to the committee about trends and compliance.</p></speech>

Approximately 10% of the complaints received by the office relate to health and social care.  While many of the complaints received relate to the HSE, they related more to monetary than other matters.  That 10% compares with 50% in other jurisdictions such as Wales.  As such, the number of complaints received in this regard is small.  A large percentage of those complaints down through the years would have related to end of life care.  While only a relatively small number of complaints are received the fact that the same complaint continues to be made highlights that this is a constant issue.</p><p>  In regard to the question about numbers, the Irish Hospice Foundation is the most appropriate organisation to answer them.  The statistic of 35, or 43%, of people dying every day in hospital arises from the Irish Hospice Foundation's audit of end of life care.  I understand there is an intention to repeat that audit.  </p><p>  On whether it is our intention to do similar reports, as stated by the Ombudsman as this issue had been a regular theme over a number of years it was dear to his heart that this report be done first.  There are other themes emerging which the Ombudsman is committed to examining.  Obviously, we have limited resources and as such we cannot do everything at once.  We would hope to undertake a number of similar reports in the next couple of years. </p></speech>

However, resources are an issue.  It is possible to deliver good palliative and nursing care to people in their own homes but this requires services which are sufficiently well resourced.  There are excellent examples of this but there needs to be more.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.181" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Tyndall" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2014071600005#K00500"><p>I want particularly to comment on the issue of direct provision and will comment later on the cultural diversity issue.  I am on record as saying, as is my predecessor, that some of the most vulnerable people in our communities do not have access to proper independent redress.  This must be a matter of concern for this committee and people in general.  I believe this needs to change and I will continue to make the case for change in this area.  Where people are denied their rights because they are not citizens of a particular country and are, because of this, living in circumstances over which they have very little influence, this is where the demand for independent redress should be highest.  It is unusual across Europe for people in these circumstances not to have access to the national ombudsman.  I do not believe that is right and it should change.  My views on that are unambiguous.</p><p>  On cultural diversity, I am conscious of the issues around cultural diversity, including the different traditions of dealing with death in terms of mourning, burial and so on.  This has not featured particularly in the complaints to my office.  However, it is an issue we would be alert to.  The complaints we receive relate more to the increased numbers of people dying in hospital as to opposed to elsewhere.  One of the most remarked upon features of hospitals is the age profile of their populations.  Very high proportions of people in hospital are in their eighties and increasing proportions of people in hospitals have dementia and other conditions associated with ageing.  A consequence of this is that the demands placed on clinical and nursing staff in particular are very different from what they were in the past.  I am not convinced that in producing our nursing and clinical staff for the future we have reflected the changes in the nature of the job they will be asked to do in our acute hospitals.  I intend to have conversations around this with the bodies responsible for clinical staff in the health service.  It is important I have conversations with them as a matter of course but these are areas I will want to explore with them.  </p><p>  In a sense, this report also gives me the basis for a conversation with those who are committed to producing our future doctors and nurses around the issues that need to feature more in training than was necessarily the case in the past.</p></speech>

A number of the nursing homes already come within my jurisdiction because of the fact that they receive State funding.  I am pleased at the moves to extend my jurisdiction in this field.  In my view, regardless of who is paying, people need to have access to redress.</p></speech>

This report has been circulated to medical and nursing schools.  We want to maximise learning from the report.  The Ombudsman has spoken at events for student and qualified nurses.  I recall that at one such event a nurse stood up and said in relation to a story which the Ombudsman told that it had made the hair stand up on the back of her neck.  It is the power of the story versus a piece of theory or a standard.  We would hope that schools and hospitals will use some of the stories in this report to make the hair stand up on the back of the neck of staff and thus make them aware of how easily things can go wrong and the effort that is required to provide a really good, dignified service at the end of life.</p></speech>

It confronts people with the consequences of their practice.  People do not set out to provide a poor service.  Often what happens is the result of staff being busy and under pressure.  To some extent, to provide this type of service day-in and day-out one has to detach oneself from emotion.  It is helpful, therefore, to remind people from time to time about how patients and their families feel about what is happening.  The more we can encourage this, the better.</p></speech>

During a previous interaction between the committee and the Ombudsman, he raised with us the need to ensure that all public services, whether delivered by a private or public company, come under the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman, which is an issue that arises not only in Ireland but throughout Europe.  It is an issue on which the committee would like to work further in the autumn with the Ombudsman.  It is a key issue.  I commend the Ombudsman on his endeavours in that respect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2014071600005#K01200"><p>I congratulate the Ombudsman on this report.  I hope it will have the intended effect of bringing about a guaranteed minimum service or standard.</p> <p>Ms McNally raised the point of why there are not many complaints.  Some of this relates to the Irish approach to death, as has been noted, and if somebody dies, people may not want to resurrect issues surrounding the death or dwell on the matter so they move on.  I have found that people often do not want to make a complaint because they do not want an incident to reflect badly on other staff.  A person may wish to complain about nurses on a night shift or a doctor but could feel the complaint would reflect on the entire team helping a loved one.  There may be a case for family meetings to be held within a very short timeframe.  I have experienced every part of the hospital service in the past year so I could tell the committee much more than some of the doctors in hospitals near me.</p><p> I have been made aware that sometimes there is a failure by the hospital - although it may not be the hospital's fault - to share information with a family because the person being treated wants to put on a brave face and will not allow medical staff to share the issues with the family.  They may say they are not doing badly or they are not in pain.  They may not want help.  That can lead to conflict as an adult is entitled to privacy and information.  If somebody is to care for a person at home and take on that responsibility, I do not know how we can get to grips with conflicts that can arise, as the carers should be entitled to information as well.  If a patient, whether it is a mother or brother, is going home, a carer must be informed as to whether he or she could be violent, for example, or wake in the night screaming.  One would not be aware of such behaviour if one is just visiting a patient in hospital for an hour or 30 minutes.  A person making arrangements for home care may not know the consequences of particular medication or bouts of lucidity mixed with anger.  We must consider how physicians and nursing staff can share information in such scenarios so a family taking on care in the last weeks or months of a person's life can understand the full consequences of what is being taken on.</p><p> It is good that we are talking about this issue and moving in a specific direction.  It may make it easier for patients in future to avoid just putting on a brave face and asking to be brought home.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.190" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Tyndall" time="16:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2014071600006#L00200"><p>Some of the most touching cases involve people who did nothing wrong in a sense but where patients did not want families to know how ill they were.  Families in such cases feel medical staff are keeping knowledge from them but, as the Deputy describes, the loved one has decided to do that.  It is difficult because once a person is capable of making decisions, a doctor must respect it.  That can make life very difficult.</p><p>  Where a person is going home, there are issues about people preparing themselves to care for that loved one.  The carer may not know the precise nature of the condition or the impact of medication, and these are difficult issues.  Sometimes there is not a straightforward and right answer and the hope is people will feel a little more confident in allowing clinicians to share the requirements with family and some of the conversation around these issues.  I again commend the Irish Hospice Foundation on the work it did with RTE on developing the programme.  Perhaps we need to get better at speaking about these issues.  I hope the contribution of our office will help the debate move forward and make people feel more comfortable.  When there are happy family events on the horizon, one can understand people choosing to minimise the fact that their life is limited because of a fear of detracting from the happiness of family events.  That is very understandable.</p></speech>

If the hospital cannot say much to the family, it should at least ensure there is some support in the community, with a public health nurse or community psychiatric nurse calling out to see how things are going or offer support.  After a few weeks there may be a greater willingness to share so those support services are important.  There have been unfortunate episodes where the hospital forgot to send a referral letter, etc., so such issues are critical.</p></speech>

The report indicates the families may not have understood the full implications of the term so is there more work to be done in the area?</p></speech>

Ultimately, it should be a clinical decision and there should be full communication with the patient and the family if requested.  It would be preferable for that to happen.  People do not understand that it takes pressure from both the individual and the family if there is a realisation that the decision would be primarily clinical.  There is the possibility that people would feel disengaged from the process as a consequence and there is a need to improve guidance.  It is a difficult area and sometimes it is clear that to be involved in very invasive efforts to save a person's life is not appropriate when practically there is no prospect of extending the life or where quality of life would be significantly damaged by the condition and intervention.  Explaining this to individuals and ensuring not only that guidance is right, but that communication is appropriate, can be challenging.  There is more work to be done.</p></speech>

While a complex dynamic of fast-moving events ultimately came into play, how two concerts became five can be explained by one observation: the informed music industry opinion of the artist's appeal, based on entirely reasonable assumptions, was simply overwhelmed by what can only be called an extraordinary and utterly unpredictable social phenomenon.  Let me explain.  Garth Brooks in recent years had played only occasional concerts in the USA, had not toured abroad for many years, had not been in Ireland since 1997, and had not released newly recorded material since 2001.  Two concerts, catering for 160,000 people, seemed perfectly adequate, particularly as the same artist had drawn a total of 140,000 fans on his last appearance in Ireland.  These reasonable assumptions were, however, rendered redundant by the truly astonishing demand for tickets.  This was simply a case where a public reaction utterly defied logic and conventional wisdom.  Within two hours, three concerts had sold out and an incredible total of 240,000 tickets were sold.  What had simply been a concert became a national event; what had simply been a night out became an unmissable national celebration.  There may be something particularly and exuberantly Irish in the way people suddenly became aware that they were creating, and would be participating in, what would be the great Irish celebratory experience of the summer of 2014.  An irresistible social force took over, and suddenly five concerts had sold out and 400,000 tickets had been sold.</p><p>  When Aiken Promotions, aware of what was happening after three concerts had instantly sold out, approached Croke Park seeking two extra nights, we had concerns about the impact on the local community of a larger than usual number of concerts taking place on successive evenings.  These concerns, however, were allayed somewhat by several factors.  One, there was to be a two-month gap between the One Direction concerts and those of Garth Brooks.  Two, the Brooks audience would be easily managed and very unlikely to be troublesome.  Three, concert licences in Dublin have never been declined; moreover, Croke Park concerts are run to the absolute highest standards.  Indeed, Dublin City Council told us that the One Direction concerts were run as close as it is possible to get to a textbook standard.  Four, Croke Park has never run more than three concerts on consecutive nights since its redevelopment in 1993 and did not host any concerts in 2013, and this would be a one-off national event over five nights that would never be repeated.  Finally, in agreeing to the request from Aiken Promotions for two extra concerts in Croke Park, the GAA was conscious of its own tradition of making the stadium available for important events of national significance, be it the Special Olympics, soccer and rugby internationals, the Eucharistic Congress or a possible Rugby World Cup in Ireland.</p><p>  Of course the GAA was set to make extra money from the extra concerts.  That is exactly the point: it was extra money, bonus revenue that we had not allowed for in our budgets and that we were not dependent upon.  We were content with two concerts, while a third was already a bonus.  In any case, concerts or no concerts, the GAA will drive on with its plans for 2014.</p><p>  I would also like to clear up some confusion that exists in the public mind about the number of concerts permitted in Croke Park.  Croke Park has planning permission for three concerts per annum.  This is in-perpetuity permission.  If we wish to hold additional events catering for more than 5,000 people, we must apply for a special events licence.  The Garth Brooks concerts were such events.  The mechanism of special events licensing is the most common approach employed in Dublin, and Croke Park's use of this mechanism is not unusual.  For example, concerts in Marlay Park, the Phoenix Park and the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, as well as the St. Patrick's Day Parade, etc., are all licensed.  We have successfully applied for special events licences in the past and have never been refused by Dublin City Council.  Legally, there is no limit to the number of special event licences we may apply for.</p><p>  I would like to turn now to the issue of Croke Park's neighbours and to the GAA's relationship with these residents.  In his mediator's report on the long-term management of concerts in Croke Park, Kieran Mulvey noted the lack of trust expressed by residents' representatives in Croke Park.  On the one hand, I accept that we need to work harder to change that negative perception where it exists.  On the other hand, there are two unpalatable facts that must be faced: first, not all of those who objected most vociferously to the concerts even live in the area adjacent to Croke Park, and, second, many of the objections lodged with Dublin City Council were fraudulent.  In addition, it has to be recognised, and it is now clear, that the majority of residents in the area were not opposed to the staging of five concerts.</p><p>  It is important, too, that everyone be aware of the very positive elements of the relationship we have developed with the Croke Park residents, notably through our community gain initiatives.  The GAA spent &euro;1.5 million to provide a community centre on Distillery Road, and we employ a full-time community and public relations officer to liaise with local residents.  We established the Croke Park community fund in 2008, through which the GAA donates &euro;100,000 every year to the community located within 1.5 km of Croke Park.  Since 2008 we have allocated over &euro;500,000 to local community initiatives, groups, charities, and individual streets and associations.  This year alone, the GAA has funded 22 local groups, covering street committees, local sports and cultural groups, local charities and day-care centres.  Under our youth community gain initiatives, the GAA subsidises the participation every year of children from the area in the Croke Park community GAA C&uacute;l camps.  This summer, over 200 local children participated in the camp.  We also run a weekly computer coding class in Croke Park for children from the community; these are free of charge and are well attended every week.  The GAA also distributes match tickets to local residents.  Elsewhere, in a composting and recycling initiative, 15 tonnes of Croke Park compost was given free to local community gardens and homes in 2014.  Finally, every Christmas the GAA organises and funds a Christmas party for senior citizens from the local community; the 2013 party was attended by 650 local people.</p><p>  These facts, I hope, give an indication of how seriously the GAA takes its relationship with the local Croke Park community and how it strives to treat this community with respect and consideration.  These same principles informed our engagement with this community over the Garth Brooks concerts.  We were genuinely concerned about the impact on the local community of a larger-than-usual number of concerts taking place on successive evenings.  The GAA, therefore, in conjunction with Aiken Promotions, undertook an extensive and vigorous consultation process with the local community so as to better understand, address and resolve local concerns relating to access, parking, cleaning and any possible anti-social behaviour arising from the concerts.  This consultation process had four distinct stages: we held a local residents' meeting on 12 February; we held two meetings, on 18 February and 11 March, with local public representatives; in the first half of March, we sent out a survey questionnaire to 27,000 households living within 1.5 km of Croke Park; and at the end of March, we ran a community information sharing forum at which we communicated the results of this survey to local residents.  At this meeting, we gave a draft events plan for the concerts to local residents, and management personnel from Croke Park and Aiken Promotions discussed this with residents.  The feedback we received from residents through this process was recorded, reviewed and used where possible in the drafting of a hugely comprehensive event-management plan that was ultimately submitted to Dublin City Council as part of the licence application.</p><p>  It is fair to say that Croke Park has a reputation for running well-organised and safe events.</p> <p>It has developed a close working relationship with Dublin City Council in the successful staging of these events.  A spirit of honest exchange and mutual trust has characterised the relationship between Croke Park and senior Dublin City Council officials and this approach has ensured all concerns are adequately dealt with in finalised event management plans for major events.</p><p> The planning for the Garth Brooks concerts followed the protocols established by previous events held in Croke Park.  As part of this process, it is customary to hold formal and informal discussions with statutory agencies and Dublin City Council to review event-specific issues and agree a joint strategy for addressing these issues before committing to an event management plan.  During our discussions with Dublin City Council the impact of five shows on local residents was always raised.  During both informal and formal discussions the council stressed heavily the need for what it called additionality in our licence application, in other words, the need to do things that had not been done before in the staging of such events, for example, in the quality and extent of the arrangements.  I stress the vital point that at no stage was there ever even a hint that a licence would not be granted for all five concerts.  Prior to the submission of the draft event management plan for the concerts and the application for an event licence, the Croke Park stadium director, Mr. Peter McKenna, received a telephone call from Mr. Owen Keegan, chief executive of Dublin City Council, who was returning a call made by Mr. McKenna to Mr. Keegan.  In their telephone conversation Mr. Keegan advised Mr. McKenna that Dublin City Council would support a licence application for all five concerts.  Mr. Keegan asked Mr. McKenna to make the decision making process as easy as possible for Dublin City Council.  Mr. McKenna assured Mr. Keegan that he and his team would work closely with Mr. Keegan's colleague, Mr. John Downey, in making a complete and comprehensive submission.  Mr. McKenna also assured Mr. Keegan that he would ensure the One Direction concerts would be held in an exemplary manner.  All further liaison with Dublin City Council after that conversation was with Mr. Downey.</p><p> As preparations for the Garth Brooks concerts continued, the One Direction concerts held in Croke Park on 23, 24 and 25 May were used to trial additional event management measures, as follows.  A residents-based community team was deployed to monitor the cordon area with the primary function of assisting fellow residents.  Additional garda&iacute; were deployed to support Dublin street parking services in order to enforce legal parking.  A co-ordinated public transport and parking information campaign was run in conjunction with Dublin City Council and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A 24 hour community freefone hotline was staffed by members of the community team during the concert period.  An additional community litter team was deployed to support the Dublin City Council cleaning operation.  These new measures were hugely successful and only three complaints were lodged with Dublin City Council over the three nights of the concerts, a low figure that is unprecedented in the running of major events running in the city.  Some 240,000 people attended over three nights.</p><p> After the One Direction concerts, Croke Park and Aiken Promotions met Dublin City Council on 3 June to address some concerns raised about the originally submitted works schedule.  An amended works schedule was presented and accepted, detailing a five event schedule.  To stress how clear was the understanding that a licence for all five concerts would be granted, Dublin City Council officials, in informal discussions prior to a decision on the licence application being announced, expressed the hope the Mulvey report would be released before a decision on the licence was made public in order that it would be clear to residents that there was a longer term plan in place for the management of concerts in Croke Park.</p><p> I acknowledge that Croke Park values its positive working relationship with Dublin City Council.  The joint approach to additional measures was clearly visible in the success of the One Direction concerts and the collaboration between Croke Park and Dublin City Council in general event planning leads to important attention to detail and a joint commitment to getting things right.  However, I am obliged to emphasise that all of our contact with Dublin City Council on the Garth Brooks concerts led us to believe we would be granted a licence for all five concerts.  At no stage was Croke Park alerted to the need to prepare contingency plans for a smaller number of concerts.  It would have been crucial for Croke Park to have been alerted to prepare such contingency plans.  Members can imagine, for example, the huge scale of the security operation necessary to deal with even a small percentage of the 160,000 fans who might attempt to gain access to shows for which they had no ticket.  Such contingency plans would have required a multi-agency approach.</p><p> I would like to touch on a small number of other issues relating to the ultimate refusal to grant a licence for the five concerts.  On Thursday, 3 July, I heard about the decision to grant a licence for only three concerts from a friend of mine shortly before I was contacted by Mr. Owen Keegan at 9.15 a.m.  I told him of my shock at the decision and called him back about an hour later to ask him not to sign off on the decision to grant a licence for only three concerts to give us time to consider the ramifications of the decision.  He said the decision had already been made and signed off on and could not be appealed.  Despite our excellent record in running concerts at Croke Park, despite Dublin City Council's praise for our running of the One Direction concerts, despite the quality of the submission and the total commitment to formulating the licence application according to the letter of the law, and despite a long-standing relationship with Dublin City Council, apparently, we did not even deserve the courtesy of being allowed to consider and, possibly, address the grounds for the refusal to grant a licence for five concerts.</p><p> I would like to address some of the points made by Mr. Owen Keegan, chief executive of Dublin City Council, in his written submission yesterday to the committee.  Dublin City Council refused the application for five concerts for three reasons.  The first reason offered is that five concerts over five evenings would be "unprecedented for Croke Park".  We agree that it would be unprecedented, but how does the notion of something being "unprecedented" automatically disqualify it?  Should the licence application not have been considered on its own merits, regardless of whether something had happened in the past?  The lack of a precedent seems to be an excessively conservative and unprogressive reason to invoke.  One wonders how transformation and improvement in society would ever occur if we allowed our decisions to be dictated only by the way we did things in the past.  In any case, establishing a precedent does not tie one's hands for the future.  Saying "Yes" today does not mean that we cannot say "No" tomorrow.  One simply decides on the merits of things as they occur, as we believe should have been the case in this instance.</p><p> The second reason offered for the refusal of the licence for five concerts was that the Garth Brooks and One Direction concerts together would, for Dublin City Council, have represented "an over-intensification of use" of Croke Park.  This is an argument that is employed rather selectively.  We did not hear anything about over-intensification of the use of Croke Park during the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road when Croke Park was needed to host international soccer and rugby internationals which were, of course, in addition to Croke Park's own schedule of match days and concerts.  Should the IRFU's application to host either the 2023 or 2027 Rugby World Cup in Ireland be successful, Croke Park will be required for a total of seven matches, again in addition to Croke Park's own schedule of match days, plus its quota of three concerts.  Is there anyone here who seriously imagines that an argument about over-intensification of use of Croke Park will be allowed to interfere with these seven rugby World Cup matches in Croke Park?  I think there is not.</p><p> The final reason offered for the refusal of the licence for five concerts was that it would have led to "an unacceptable level of disruption" for local residents and some businesses.  I have already addressed in detail Croke Park's excellent record in the staging of concerts, Dublin City Council's recognition of the textbook running of the One Direction concerts, the extra measures put in place - trialled at the One Direction concerts - to manage the Garth Brooks concerts and our complete willingness to comply with Dublin City Council's request for additionality in the management of the event.</p> <p>It would appear, however, that Dublin City Council was swayed by the submissions it received that objected to the holding of five concerts.  Here we arrive at the most disturbing aspect of the entire business because Mr. Keegan acknowledged that: "Dublin City Council was contacted by a number of individuals stating that they had not made submissions/observations on this licence application."  Clearly, these fraudulent submissions objected to the five concert application.  Mr. Keegan further stated that: "11 such instances came to the attention of the Council.  The matter was referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for their attention on 12 June 2014."  Eleven fraudulent submissions is bad enough.  How do we know that this was the full extent of the fraudulent submissions?  Mr. Keegan implied that Dublin City Council only became aware of such fraud when people whose names had been falsely used contacted them.  It is not unreasonable to assume there may have been many more fraudulent submissions, given what was quite clearly an orchestrated campaign to prevent a licence for five concerts, through fair means or foul.</p><p> Given that Dublin City Council was clearly influenced by the vociferous campaign waged by a small minority to block the concerts, a campaign waged heavily in national media and of which Dublin City Council was clearly aware, as its submission yesterday acknowledged, and given that there was incontrovertible evidence of fraudulent submissions objecting to the granting of five licences, surely Dublin City Council should have been alerted to the fact that its own licensing process was being seriously manipulated and distorted by people opposed to the five concerts.  Alerted to this fraud a full three weeks before reaching the decision to grant a licence for three concerts only, Dublin City Council should have taken the time to cast a more rigorously sceptical eye on the nature and extent of the opposition to the five concerts and perhaps reached a different decision.  It is in this light that, in a written submission of 4,000 words, Dublin City Council's offering of a mere 34 words on the impact of the manipulation of its licensing process, is surprising to say the least.  Even more disconcerting is the verdict reached by Dublin City Council in the 34 words: "Accordingly, while it is disturbing that so many submissions may now be called into question, it does not, in the opinion of the City Council, interfere with the integrity of the decision arrived at."  If Dublin City Council itself admits that "so many submissions may now be called in to question", how can it conclude that this does not interfere with the integrity of its decision?  Surely that is exactly what the fraudulent submissions did to the integrity of its decision.  What more conclusive and damning proof could there be that the integrity of Dublin City Council's decision had been undermined by the submissions process being manipulated and distorted in the unique goal of persuading Dublin City Council not to grant a licence for five concerts?</p><p> My final comment in response to Dublin City Council's written submission relates to the matter of the major economic loss to the country due to the decision not to grant a licence for five concerts.  Again, Dublin City Council offered only a few very brief sentences in its submission on this question and seemed to imply that potential economic benefits are simply not a consideration in its decision-making where concert licence applications are concerned.  However, Dublin City Council said that potential benefits are "not central" in its decision-making.  That does not seem to say that economic benefits are not considered at all, only that Dublin City Council does not seem to consider them very important when considering licence applications.  If only it had done so on this occasion.</p><p> I will conclude with these comments.  I reiterate that the GAA fully accepts the recommendations made by the mediator, Kieran Mulvey, on the future staging of concerts in Croke Park.  We cannot say fairer than that.  The GAA wants a strong, mutually respectful and mutually beneficial relationship with Croke Park residents, a relationship that has been made difficult in the past as there has not been one coherent group representing residents with which we could engage.</p><p> Finally, the bigger issues raised by this affair need to be seriously addressed.  Listeners to these remarks will gather that Croke Park feels let down by the process.  More than that, the country has been let down.  I do not think it unreasonable to claim that the people of Ireland, and those abroad who have followed this affair, find the decision to refuse a licence for five concerts incomprehensible. They are right.  It is incomprehensible.</p><p> Let us consider the reality of what we all knew when the licence application for five concerts was submitted.  It meant 400,000 people - 330,000 of our citizens and 70,000 tourists from abroad - had paid a substantial sum of money to buy tickets for the concerts, flights and book hotels.  These people were set to present the country with the undreamed-of gift of a massive economic uplift.  We all knew this but what did we do?  We said "No" and in so doing we turned our backs on an enormous financial windfall, and denied a vast number of people the pleasure of enjoying a great social and cultural occasion.  Moreover, we made a decision that can be considered undemocratic because the wishes of a truly enormous number of people were ignored.</p><p> Dublin City Council tells us that the decision reached was "appropriate, balanced and reasonable".  Was that the case for the 400,000 people who had bought tickets and looked forward to the concerts?  We had the opportunity to grant ourselves a joyful celebration and to enjoy a unique national, social and cultural experience that we would have fondly remembered for years.  We have now lost all of this and, as is the way of these things, we only realise the enormity of what we lost when it is too late to do anything about it.  How could we have so lost sight of the bigger picture?  How could we have lost sight of the people's decision to have a national celebration and their willingness to pour money into the economy?  How could we have become so side-tracked as to commit such a self-inflicted wound on the country?</p></speech>

Aiken Promotions has promoted shows all over Ireland for 53 years.  Throughout this time, we have operated to the highest standards in terms of business practice and the planning and staging of events.</p><p>  In late December 2013 I concluded a deal with Bob Doyle, Garth Brooks' manager, and also with Peter McKenna of Croke Park for two shows on 25 and 26 July 2014.  On 20 January 2014, Garth visited Croke Park to announce that he was returning after 17 years, and would come out of retirement and film his comeback special - a live concert broadcast from Croke Park in Dublin.  There was widespread coverage of the press conference nationally and worldwide.  It became apparent there was going to be huge demand for tickets because people started queuing as soon as the press conference took place.  I spoke again with Bob Doyle and Peter McKenna and told them that there definitely could be a third show, we should have it ready to cope with demand if the first two shows sold out.  Tickets went on sale at 9 a.m. on 30 January.  The three shows sold out in two hours with thousands of people still queuing at outlets and thousands of people online trying to purchase tickets.</p><p>  After tickets went on sale, the media coverage was extensive and focused on the desperation of fans queuing for tickets all over Ireland.  It also highlighted some technical difficulties which meant some people could not get tickets in some areas.  Plus, there were reports that tickets were starting to exchange hands for hugely inflated prices.  I had further conversations with Bob Doyle and also with Peter McKenna.  In direct response to the demand, we agreed to do one more show and possibly a fifth one.</p><p>  On 1 February, our event controller called the Dublin city manager to inform him of the plans for additional shows and he expressed appreciation for the courtesy of letting him know.  On 3 February the fourth show was announced.  On Wednesday, 5 February, a meeting was held at Croke Park which was attended by Aiken Promotions, Croke Park and the Garda to discuss the Garth Brooks event, including the potential impact on the community and how it might be addressed.</p><p>  On 6 February, tickets were released for the fourth show and again it was an instant sell-out.  I spoke again to Bob Doyle and again to Peter McKenna and it was agreed to release the fifth show for sale which sold out immediately.</p><p>  On Wednesday, 12 February, a meeting was held with Dublin City Council.  I was accompanied by the event controller and the licensing and safety officer for Aiken Promotions.  Attending the meeting from the council was the city manager, the executive manager and the licensing officer.  The meeting was constructive.</p> <p>Dublin City Council did inform us that it would be a big ask to do five consecutive days at Croke Park and that it would be looking for additionality to the standard arrangements to address the impact on the local community.  We also discussed the timeframe for submitting the licence application and the potential benefits to the city.</p><p> On 12 February, a meeting chaired by a community representative was held with local residents where a number of objections were raised, not all of which related to the Garth Brooks concerts.  The meeting was attended by Aiken Promotions who were on hand to respond to specific inquiries regarding the Garth Brooks event. </p><p> On 18 February, Aiken Promotions and Croke Park met with local politicians where a number of concerns were discussed along with some constructive proposals.  On 11 March, a second meeting took place between Aiken Promotions, Croke Park and the political representatives for the local area.  On 21 March, Aiken Promotions and Croke Park met with garda&iacute; to discuss the event.</p><p> On 29 March, an open day was held at Croke Park for local residents.  At this, the plans were available for inspection as well as a rolling PowerPoint presentation summarising the main points of the event.  Croke Park and Aiken Promotions representatives were available to answer questions and record comments.</p><p> On 3 April, I met with Bob Doyle and the rest of the Garth Brooks team in Nashville.  They made a general inquiry about the status of the licence.  I relayed to them that Peter McKenna had spoken to the city manager and he had been told that we would get the licence for the five shows.</p><p> On 17 April, the licence application was submitted to Dublin City Council, 14 weeks before the event.  It has been wrongly reported that we left this to the last minute to submit to Dublin City Council.  This was in fact submitted four weeks in advance of the current requirement which is ten weeks before an event. </p><p> On 13 May, Aiken Promotions met with Dublin Fire Brigade to review proposals in the licence application.</p><p> On 3 June, there was a meeting attended by Dublin City Council, Croke Park and Aiken Promotions to explain in great detail the schedule for removing all the production after the fifth show on Tuesday, 29 July, and returning Croke Park fit for purpose for the matches due to take place on Sunday, 3 August.  A schedule was agreed within the permitted working hours of 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.  Given that we were actively discussing the fifth show in such detail with Dublin City Council, surely this would have been an ideal opportunity for the council to raise objections or flag that this show was problematic.</p><p> On 5 June, Aiken Promotions attended a meeting with Dublin City Council regarding sound management.  No major concerns were expressed about the capability of Aiken Promotions to achieve compliance.  On 10 June, Aiken Promotions attended a meeting with the HSE to discuss the draft medical plan for the event.  That same day, we also attended a meeting at Store Street Garda Station regarding traffic management, at which a number of proposals were tabled by Aiken Promotions and appeared to be well received by all present.</p><p> On 16 June, the first statutory agencies meeting took place at Croke Park with contributions from all attending parties, including Dublin City Council, the Garda, the fire authority, the HSE and the venue.  On 23 June, the second statutory agencies' meeting took place at Croke Park with all relevant parties attending, including Dublin City Council.</p><p> On 2 July, at approximately 10.30 p.m., I received a call from my event controller to say that the city manager had phoned him to say they were only granting a licence for three concerts at Croke Park, the first three dates.  I immediately informed Bob Doyle of this development and his response was that it would not be acceptable as they had committed to doing five nights.  I relayed this position to the event controller who passed the message back to the city manager.  Shortly after, the city manager made contact again with a firm offer to grant the licence for four shows.  I again immediately relayed this to Bob Doyle who then brought Garth himself on to the phone to be updated on the situation.  Garth Brooks responded in the early hours of Thursday morning, 3 July, that he had agreed to do five shows and was committed to playing all five nights.  Garth treats his fans equally and fairly and, therefore, could not treat 160,000 people who had bought tickets for the fourth and fifth shows differently from the fans who had bought tickets for the first three nights, so his position would have to be that it was five shows or nothing.  I relayed this response back to the event controller who asked that Garth's position be considered by the council and a view on this conveyed back to us before 1 p.m. that day.</p><p> At 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 3 July - ahead of the 1 p.m. time discussed - the licence was issued by Dublin City Council for three shows only.  I immediately contacted Bob Doyle to advise him of the situation as, first, the licence had been issued publicly at an earlier time than expected; and, second, it was immediately being picked up on the newswires that permission had only been granted for three shows.  Since then, we have explored every option open to us with no success.  This is not a touring show.  The stage and production have been custom built for Croke Park and on such a scale that it simply could not be relocated to another venue.</p><p> On Wednesday, 9 July, I met with a senior civil servant to discuss the issues.  He suggested that I speak to the city manager.  During that meeting, in desperation to resolve the issue and without due consideration or any consultation with Garth Brooks, I put forward a number of different suggestions to see what options, if any, the council would be willing to review, or if the matter was closed from all angles.  This included doing five concerts as originally planned, possibly doing earlier shows on the Monday and Tuesday, and also the issue of possibly doing matin&eacute;es on Saturday and Sunday.  The matin&eacute;es on Saturday and Sunday was the only option that the city manager responded positively to.</p><p> On review, it was quickly evident that the option of doing matin&eacute;es on the Saturday and Sunday was neither desirable because of the safety and logistical implications, nor possible within the terms of the licence.  Despite this, as this option had been made public by the city manager and because of his encouraging response to consider a revision to the licence application, I did inform Garth Brooks who immediately rejected this on practical grounds - that is, he could not do five high-intensity performances over three days.  Also, a matin&eacute;e show would not provide the same experience one would get at night in terms of the production, in particular the benefits of the custom-built video and lighting rigs that had been specially designed for this event.</p><p> Over the following days, I engaged with the same senior civil servant and a range of other intermediaries to find a solution.  One of the suggestions was an uncontested judicial review based on the council agreeing to consider additional information.  I met with the city manager and the executive manager on Monday, 14 July to discuss the option of a judicial review but we failed to get their support.</p><p> There was an additional offer put forward by Dublin City Council to look at granting a licence for new dates in October to replace the fourth and fifth shows.  To follow the current licensing process, the application would be presented as a joint venture with Dublin City Council, as this only requires submission five weeks before event, rather than the ten weeks standard.  I ask the committee to note that it was impossible for Garth to accept this proposal as he was committed to a world tour which is due to start in Chicago on 4 September.  He was also already scheduled to perform elsewhere on the dates suggested.  Therefore, I had to confirm to Garth Brooks that evening that we could not secure any more than three shows in July.  As a result, Garth Brooks issued his own personal statement.  Aiken Promotions then issued a notice cancelling the shows.  Hindsight is a wonderful thing but I feel that an event which any city in the world would have been proud to host should have been viewed with an informed strategic eye and encouraged, not dismissed.</p><p> There are a few things I would like to emphasise.  The licensing system is what it is.  I followed the same process that I have followed for years in Dublin, as well as other counties around Ireland.  It is a well established custom and practice to sell tickets subject to licence.  I must state clearly that, by custom and practice, any residual impacts of a concert on an environment are dealt with through the conditions attached to the licence.  Our focus throughout all formal and informal contacts with Dublin City Council and all statutory agencies was to deliver above and beyond the standard requirements and practices to ease the impact of five concerts in recognition of the unique circumstances of this event.  There was never a discussion on the number of shows being reduced, only on the impact that the five nights would have.</p><p> I accept the procedure and that the elements of the process were correctly followed, but I feel that the decision-making process was not reasonable, balanced or fair, and that the decision was wrong.  I am fully aware that in the licence application process for concerts there is no recourse for review or appeal against the licence issued by Dublin City Council.  However, this has been an extremely frustrating position to be left in during the last few weeks considering the events that have come to light, specifically that some of the objections lodged to the council are being investigated as fraud.</p></speech>

I will be going to members of the committee shortly.  I ask them to keep their contributions to four minutes and I will try to do the same myself.  I have a question for Mr. McKenna on the phone call to Mr. Keegan.  Mr. McKenna's statement this morning clearly states that verbal assurances were given by the city manager that five concerts would be supported by Dublin City Council.  That is at odds with and in total contradiction of what was said to us here yesterday.  Does Mr. McKenna have any other evidence to confirm his assertion in this regard?  The public will ask who they are supposed to believe.  Perhaps Mr. McKenna could take that point first, which is the big question.</p></speech>

This telephone conversation happened very early on in the process.  I think Owen Keegan would have been aware of the concerts from Jim Clark who rang him on Saturday, 1 February.  After that I wanted to get a reassurance and heads-up myself as to where we stood on the concert application for all five licences.  I rang Owen Keegan, but he was not there; he was away from the office.  A couple of days later he phoned back.  I remember it well because I was conducting a meeting in my office with one of my senior staff.  We talked about it and he said the city would be very supportive of the five concerts.  He wanted us to make the process easy for him.  He said: "Make One Direction happen well and put all the additionality you can into the applications."</p> <p>We said we could guarantee we would put our best foot forward.  We finished the call and I was ecstatic to share that with the individual in the office.  From then on I was certain we would get five licences.  We did much work on the One Direction concerts and brought additionality to the process.  There were 20 or 30 meetings from February because we were engaging on One Direction at the same time and there was no suggestion that the applications might fail.  I was so confident I went on holidays when the decision was made and would not have done this had I doubts.</p><p> It may sound dramatic but I would swear an affidavit based on what I have told this committee.  That is how certain I am of the contents of the telephone conversation.</p></speech>

Tickets for GAA matches are made available for residents to purchase and this applies to all GAA members.  Tickets for concerts are free and are distributed by way of a raffle.  There are 200 pairs of such tickets per concert and those interested in attending can enter their names.</p></speech>

We regard 27,000 houses as being in the environs of Croke Park as that constitutes a radius of 1.5 km.  There is no single group with which we can deal and a small group, consisting of some people from the area and some from outside, was very opposed to these concerts.  That group was the only voice that was heard.  We were concerned by the fact that in recent weeks other residents emerged who wanted the concerts to proceed.</p><p>  The thing we would do differently in future and the biggest challenge is to engage with a coherent residents' group on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

I believe it emerged in recent weeks that the vast majority of people in the area had no problem with the concerts proceeding.  The difficulty is those who shout loudest and those who take to the airwaves are heard.  This makes it difficult for us.  As Kieran Mulvey said in his report that a coherent group is needed to express the voice of the residents.  We would be very happy to engage with such a group in future and had such a group partaken in this matter the outcome would have been different.  The big concern we had related to the number of fraudulent submissions and the full story on this has not been told.</p></speech>

I did not foresee that it would grow to five shows as that is unprecedented.  I have never seen such a thing in my time as a promoter and it would have been the biggest ever live event in Ireland.  It would have been the equivalent of Michael Jackson's eight nights in London, Bruce Springsteen's ten nights at Giants Stadium, New York, and Roger Waters's five nights in Argentina.  This was our big moment.  When we sold tickets for five concerts we built a five-show event.  The idea was to film the show on three of the nights and make a documentary.  It was going to be massive and that is how it grew.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.237" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014071600009#L01300"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their informative presentations.  They were clear, coherent and laid out in detail, as I would have expected because this is how the witnesses do business.  If we take anything from this as legislators, we must ask how a situation was allowed to develop where 400,000 tickets were sold in advance of the granting of a licence.  It is not the fault of the witnesses as this is the system in which they must operate and I suspect we may have to consult them on another occasion on developing a legislative approach to this issue.  At minimum, we must develop an appeals process because An Bord Plean&aacute;la usually acts as final arbiter in general planning issues relating to buildings and so on.  No such system exists in cases such as this.</p><p>  The Chairman has addressed Mr. Duffy's point on Mr. McKenna.  Mr. Aiken spoke of the expectation that the five concerts would be granted permission.  I am flabbergasted, frankly, that Mr. McKenna can make his statement as strongly as he does.  When compared to the evidence yesterday from Mr. Keegan, there is a direct conflict and I do not know how it can be resolved.  This committee is not undertaking an investigation but the conflict must be aired.  Mr. McKenna is prepared to swear an affidavit, which is welcome, and Mr. Keegan has further questions to answer on this.</p><p>  Yesterday, explaining how he reached the decision, Mr. Keegan covered the points raised by Mr. Duffy on unprecedented over-intensification and unacceptable levels of disruption.  We probed him on this matter and he said he was prepared to allow four concerts.  I still do not understand how four concerts, in addition to the earlier three concerts by One Direction, could have been acceptable, though unprecedented, and was not deemed over-intensification of use and an unacceptable level of disruption.  Somehow the fifth concert was the straw that broke the camel's back.  I do not accept this and when pressed on this issue yesterday Mr. Keegan made a slip by saying something had to be given to the residents.  In other words, Dublin City Council had to be seen as doing something in response to the concerns raised by residents.  I put it to him that had the promoters sought six or seven concerts the council might have granted permission for five on the basis he outlined and deemed it acceptable.  He countered this.</p><p>  On the issue of residents and objections, I have some sympathy for Dublin City Council as the process for lodging objections is not as detailed as it is for construction projects because there is no fee.  The issue of how to deal with the situation now has been raised.  Mr. Aiken said he spoke to a senior civil servant and Mr. Keegan yesterday mentioned having met a senior civil servant but I do not know whether the same person is in question.</p> <p>Have the witnesses come up with any potential solution that could get us past this?  The Government has refused to take a legislative approach.  The witnesses considered a judicial review and Mr. Keegan made it very clear to us yesterday that he was prepared to gamble ratepayers' money to challenge it aggressively.  What is the legal advice on whether it might have been successful?  As a ratepayer, Mr. Duffy must feel aggrieved at the decision.  Many ratepayers have contacted us, such as hotels, restaurants and the business community, who are flabbergasted by it.</p></speech>

While it was a major issue and a blow to us, we had not budgeted for the concerts.  The GAA feels bad for the 400,000 people.  Everybody in this room knows people who had planned to come home or hold family celebrations, and the sheer disappointment of these people is the worst part of it.  It would have been fantastic to have been part of these concerts.  It would have been a national celebration and the loss of that is the worst of it.  The GAA is not the loser.  The money is irrelevant.  We feel a sense of loss for the 400,000 people, particularly the 70,000 who were coming from abroad, the many Irish people who were coming home for their holidays around the concerts.  They are the real losers.</p><p>  With a little flexibility, this could easily have been avoided, notwithstanding the fact that the legislative frameworks applied.  All along, we thought there would be five concerts, and at some point it was reduced to three.  Had the council approached us and said it was thinking of reducing the number from five to three, Aiken Promotions and we would have asked what we needed to do to reassure the council, and would have done whatever it would have taken, for the 400,000 people.  However, we were not given the opportunity.  The news came out of the blue, the decision was taken, it was signed off and there was no appeal.  The end was very abrupt.</p></speech>

Could Mr. Duffy talk about the legacy issue of the handball situation, which seems to be the centre of most of the aggravation, particularly regarding those who reside outside the area and have succeeded in promoting a campaign of objections to the GAA's activities?  The Mulvey report and intervention was an effort to get to the bottom of that.</p></speech>

We were all delighted that we had solved the problem on the basis that we would go ahead and build a new centre on the Croke Villas site and include a bar there for the use of local residents.  Mr. Mulvey thought we had an agreement.  Unfortunately, one of the key handball people had not been at the meeting, as he had been in Belfast on the same day dealing with issues around the redevelopment of Casement Park.  The handball group subsequently told us we did not have an agreement.  We had given in to most of their requests because we wanted to resolve the problem, which had existed for a long time and was annoying a small number of local residents.  While we did not physically shake hands, we felt we had an agreement, and two weeks later the handball group told us it would not accept it.  While this is part of the problem, we went more than half way to resolving it and Mr. Mulvey would be very happy to verify the process and tell the committee the GAA did everything possible to resolve it as part of the process around the concerts.</p></speech>

Regarding the conversation with Mr. Keegan, it has turned into a case of "he said, she said".  I could not believe the amount of interest in the concert and the unprecedented amount of attention it has received.  I cannot believe the number of e-mails I have received and people who have come to me, as a legislator, asking me to intervene.  As Deputy Dooley said, it is down to a few people.  Yesterday I raised the issue of how Marlay Park has been able to have so many concerts, some of which I recently attended, which cause major disruption.  The response was that the residents get along with the council and there is no issue with the promoters.  This is the main issue that needs to be dealt with.  The report has been published and it is to be hoped we can do something to establish some sort of appeals process.  The fact that concert tickets can be sold without a licence having been issued is a serious issue we, as legislators, must address.  I thank the witnesses for their presentation.</p></speech>

What a mess and what a lost opportunity.  The evidence is disturbing because they are saying that matters between Croke Park and Dublin City Council were fine until this bad man came along and upset the apple cart, insisting on enforcing legislation, as he sees it.  It is a bad place to be.  Although I was not here for the meeting with Mr. Keegan, I read the presentation he made and it does not reflect what has been told to the committee today.  We need to get to the bottom of it.  Croke Park has not had a series of events or concerts stopped by such a problem before.  Have there been any near misses where it almost happened?</p></speech>

There were issues about the U2 concerts in 2009.  It was not about the planning permission but about the overnight works to bring a colossal stage in and out, which could only be done overnight.  This issue caused much concern in the area.  We have never been refused an event licence, nor, to my knowledge, has anybody in Dublin.  That is the real shock.</p></speech>

Mr. Downey, in his submission, would probably say the One Direction concert was probably run in the best and most exemplary way of running a concert in the city.  We employed a number of camogie ladies, because young people were coming.  We had a paediatric accident and emergency station on site.  We sold no alcohol.  We provided meeting points for parents to collect their children and had bus collection points.  We did everything to make it one of the great events in the city and we pride ourselves, in writing the handbook for this, that what we do in Croke Park is exemplary.</p></speech>

There is a legal element and there is also the understanding with the residents around Croke Park.  The legal issue is that Croke Park can run three special events in a year without a licence.  It must apply for a licence for any more than three.  This has happened previously.  I accept that because of the timescales involved the promoters must sell tickets before the due process is completed.</p></speech>

The real point here, as P&aacute;raic Duffy said, is that 400,000 people have been discommoded and disappointed.  A total of 70,000 of them were coming from abroad, which is half the number that came here for The Gathering.  There are other aspects.  Caterers have had to cancel &euro;1.5 million worth of purchasing of Irish food and beverages, which would have been there for the five days.  A total of 10,000 people were due to be engaged casually within Croke Park over that period.  That was a casual wage bill of &euro;1 million.  The Government was going to net &euro;3 million on VAT on tickets, merchandising and food and beverages.  All of that has just been wiped.</p></speech>

P&aacute;raic Duffy and Peter McKenna referred to the 400,000 people but the person I feel most sorry for is Garth Brooks, given the effort he put into this and what he was going to do.  People will never see a show like this again, regardless of what happens in the future in technology and so forth.  They will never see the show that he intended to put on.  He was putting everything into this.  It was his comeback special.  The press referred to how it was all five or nothing and so forth but if he was motivated by money, he would have done the three shows and recouped something.  What he did was right.

The dates it offered were in the middle of October.  Then there is the talk about intensification.

We have received two very interesting presentations.  We heard Mr. Keegan's presentation yesterday.  To say that there are differences is to put it mildly.  The critical one is Mr. McKenna's regarding the telephone call during which he was assured that the five concerts would be looked on favourably.  It was a telephone conversation, so it was an oral commitment, possibly.  This is an issue I raised yesterday with Mr. Keegan.  If I intended to build an extension to my house on the Beara Peninsula in west Cork I would have the option of going through a pre-planning consultation, and there would be minutes of that.  All the issues would be written down and, like them or lump them, one would have a fair idea of what to do to inform the next decision.  For something as fundamentally important to Dublin and Ireland as this concert, as Mr. Aiken has passionately outlined, there is nothing to go on except what Mr. McKenna said that Mr. Keegan said and what Mr. Keegan said.</p><p>  Mr. Keegan in his statement yesterday said, "It is difficult for me to understand how, in the face of real evidence of disquiet among local residents, the promoters would have anticipated no difficulty in securing an event licence for the five concerts."  Then he gave a verbal commitment that the five concerts would be allowed.  Sometimes people will change their minds, but there is a fundamental lack of a proper system of licensing or an overarching document or strategy that can inform both the promoter for that or any other event and the residents as to what would be reasonable or possible.  It could provide a template for conversations as issues such as this arise.  That is something everybody will have to grapple with, although it is debatable whether we will get another opportunity to have something as big as Garth Brooks's five concerts.</p><p>  Mr. Aiken's presentation is very interesting.  It is a timeline or chronology of what happened.  He mentioned that on Wednesday, 5 February, he held a meeting at Croke Park with the Croke Park personnel and the Garda.  Was Dublin City Council represented at that meeting?</p></speech>

The context of this would be that it was still looking at the five concerts, but that there would be additionality or extra conditions attached to the licence to deal with this big ask.</p> <p>Is this how Mr. Aiken understands it?</p></speech>

I did not come away from the meeting thinking we had a problem.  I have been around a long time and I have been in a few situations, but I did not come away from the meeting thinking we had a problem.  If I had thought at any stage that we had a problem I would have flagged it to Garth Brooks.  I never saw this coming.  I thought the problem I would have would be the injunction from the guy running around doing all the interviews.  When I met my lawyers we prepared a legal document to fight that.  I never saw this coming from Dublin City Council.  I have never been refused a licence.  I think the licensing system does work.  I never saw this coming.  It was unprecedented to sell this number of tickets.  I never saw it coming and I do not think it will ever happen again in my lifetime.</p></speech>

We went through the issue of Tuesday, 29 July in great detail because matches will be played in Croke Park on 3 August.  We had to prove in great detail that we could get this massive production out and put all the fencing and barriers back in, relay the pitch and have the place ready for the two quarter-finals on 3 August.  Mr. Downey did not want us to have to work until midnight or 2 a.m.  We spent two hours speaking about it.  On 3 June I still had no inclination there would be a problem with the licence.  Dublin City Council took it right up to the wire.  If I had been told on 3 June there would be a problem I could have done something legally about it.</p></speech>

Having listened to the various submissions yesterday and today things are still do not add up.  I began to think of this event as a movie, "Licensed to Sing", and unfortunately we have an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  Everybody is screwed in this, including Garth Brooks, the ticketholders, Mr. Aiken, the GAA, the community, tourism, Dublin City Council and our reputation.  Everybody seems to be screwed and there are absolutely no winners.</p><p>  In his submission Mr. Duffy stated when the concerts were first announced it defied logic and conventional wisdom.  Thus it went from one to two to three to four and eventually to five concerts and 400,000 people.  Hindsight is 20:20 vision, but perhaps if an element of money or greed did not come into this everybody would have been happy with three concerts, with 200,000 people benefiting from attending them and businesses benefiting from their attendance.  Perhaps it was pushed out a bit and the boat was rocked because of the risky situation which may have been involved in going from three to five concerts. </p><p>  Was Mr. Bob Doyle, Garth Brooks's manager, aware of the potential risk of going from three to five concerts?  Was he prepared to accept that risk?</p></speech>

They have held events in the US where concerts were held over five or six nights in stadiums.  It was not about greed; it was about making history.  This was going to be a fantastic event.  One does get caught up in the moment no matter how good one is in business.  I got caught up in the moment and I thought it would be amazing.  It will never be done again.  When I was selling the tickets Bob Doyle was with me on Grafton Street and he saw the queues the length of Grafton Street.  When we sold out the three shows an interview was immediately broadcast on Newstalk and the queue was the length of the street.  He was on the telephone to Garth Brooks telling him this.  The business was there.  We were not pushing a cart up the hill when selling the fifth show.  We still had demand after selling the fifth show.</p></speech>

I certainly know the five concerts caught the imagination of the music industry throughout the world unlike any other concerts in the entire history of the music industry.  Dublin City Council stated its decision was appropriate, balanced and reasonable.

To take up Senator Coghlan's point, Clones will host its last match of the season on Sunday.  It is a magnificent stadium which gets two or three matches a year.  It is not too far from Mr. Aiken's home.  Perhaps it could all be shifted up there where people would not object.</p><p>  I understand Mr. Duffy is cross on this occasion.  We saw Wexford last Saturday in Thurles.  The GAA will bounce back.  We will return to do all the things we always do and this will be forgotten.</p> <p>That may not be of much consolation to Mr. Aiken.</p><p> The One Direction concerts were held on 23, 24 and 25 May and the follow-up meeting was held nine days afterwards.  When we had the Trinity Ball, it annoyed students who were trying to study for examinations.  If one wants to pick up vibes, one has to do it quicker than nine days afterwards.  Residents say it is over and that they can now get back to what they were doing.  It was a long interval.  I appreciate problems were not encountered during the One Direction concerts, but if one wants to get real feedback, it should be done the day after when both sides will say where they encountered problems.</p><p> On the bogus objections, it seems they numbered 3% of the total.

This meant that there were fans going around for six months with tickets for an event which was subject to licence.  The term "subject to licence" must be qualified.  When the Chairman gets committee members together after the delegates leave, that will be the kernel of the matter.  Let us have proper procedures, as Deputy Noel Harrington stated, as one has in dealing with any other planning application, including notes taken at meetings on progress made.  In my other line of business, one could meet a student during the year and say he or she was doing fairly well, but the student must then do it in a three hour examination, make a submission or a dissertation that meets requirements.  Informal conversations probably should not continue.  The system must be much more formalised in order that concert goers do not go around for six months with tickets in their pockets for an event which is subject to licence.</p><p>  The concerts sector has caused problems.  There were problems in Slane, Fairyhouse, Ratoath and the Phoenix Park, with all-in mud wrestling.  The reality is that residents are nervous about concerts.  I wonder whether there decibel limits limits for concerts.  I was five miles from Marley Park, yet one could hear the noise from it, which infringed on the wider populous.</p><p>  This is the transport committee.  I was asked why there was not greater access by train to Drumcondra Station, one could not get to it from Bray or anywhere else in the south.  The service from Maynooth is hugely popular on match days when significant numbers use the train service, which is good.</p><p>  I have another question for Mr. Duffy.  Was there supposed to be a station at the other end of the stadium?  The Canal End is also near a railway line which was considered in the original planning process.  If one was able to use such services for big events, including football matches and concerts, some of the agitation among residents might be diluted.</p><p>  We will try to see what can be done in the way of measures to prevent a recurrence.  As Mr. O'Boyle stated, it is a pity for everybody concerned and, as Mr. Aiken stated, it should never happen again.</p></speech>

The noise limit is 75 decibels for Croke Park.</p><p>  The other question was related to the station underneath the stand.  It would not be a safe way to take people into or out of the stadium.  One would need to walk at least 200 or 300 yards in order to access a train station.  Therefore, Drumcondra would be by far the best station to use.  A longer platform is needed for it to be effective.</p></speech>

There was even the ridiculous matter of the High Court injunction, when some fellow received &euro;15,000 and did not know from where he had received it.  Perhaps somebody from the North gave it to him and he got a brand new suit.  This was all reported in the newspapers.  It is like an episode from "Father Ted" but with serious consequences for me.  Every newspaper picked up on it.  They reported that 40% of claims were fraudulent.  How am I judged as an Irish citizen, as a Dublin citizen who has been living here for 20 years, on these terms?  What are my rights?  This illegal activity has been ongoing and I have been completely blindsided.</p></speech>

Barrett about noise, an issue which has been covered by Mr. McKenna, we met the environmental health officer about establishing the maximum noise levels.</p><p>  On the other point raised by the Senator on transport, some innovative solutions had been contemplated for this event.  In particular, we surveyed all of the ticket purchases to which we had access via the Ticketmaster system.  We received 12,000 responses and knew the direction from which they would coming and the mode of transport they would use.  This was going to enable us to provide a sophisticated park-and-ride facility to keep them away from the main Croke Park area.  It was also going to allow us to identify car parking spaces along the Luas and DART routes and from where concert goers would be coming along the M1, M2 and M3 into Dublin.  We had all of the data prepared and ready to trigger a plan in that regard.</p></speech>

What I wanted to establish by the end of this meeting, having heard all viewpoints, was whether there was still a window of opportunity.  The delegates are saying there is.  Mr. Aiken has identified one particular solution - creating a legislative route that would allow for a review of the decision that has been made.  Somebody would have to sit independently to decide this and it would be subject to legislation.  While I thought that was the best option from the outset, tomorrow is the final day of the session and it is highly unlikely legislation could be put through both Houses.  I suspect, therefore, that it is a non-runner.</p><p>  There may be an option, subject to legal advice, whereby the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government could use the statutory instrument process because some licensing is provided for in secondary legislation.  Perhaps there is something that might be done in that regard.</p><p>  Mr. McKenna has just answered the question I was going to ask.  For the past couple of days a judicial review has seemed to be the best option, but Mr. Keegan made it clear that the local authority would vigorously contest it.  Perhaps, when the delegates have left, we might have a discussion among ourselves to see how we might be able to advance this option.</p></speech>

I am not saying he knew, but he knew that I would not be able to do so.  I asked him whether he would accept an uncontested judicial review and he said, "No."</p></speech>

It is not the ideal way in which to do business, but, unfortunately, although I hate the phrase, we are where we are.</p></speech>

After all the submissions we have heard, including on various bogus objections, even the residents within the greater area of 1,500 m of Croke Park have now changed their beliefs in this regard.  If we as a committee are to achieve something, I suggest we call on the Minister and Dublin City Council to act today to save the concerts.</p></speech>
