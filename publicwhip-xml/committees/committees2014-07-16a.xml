However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they will be entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise the witnesses that the opening statements they have submitted will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br />I advise the witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery that, at the request of the broadcasting service, they are asked to ensure for the duration of the meeting their mobile telephones are turned off or switched to aeroplane, safe or flight mode.  The meeting is being broadcast live on UPC channel 207.<br />The meeting is about therapy services for children with special needs in an educational setting.  The joint committee in the past considered the issue of education of children with special needs.  A range of interventions for children with special education needs is possible, among which are health and personal social services such as psychological or speech and language therapy services provided by the HSE.  To assist the joint committee in its consideration of this matter, I am pleased to welcome the National Council for Special Education, which is represented by Ms Teresa Griffin, Ms Mary Byrne and Mr. S&eacute; Goulding, and the HSE, which is represented by Mr. Pat Healy and Ms Anne Melly.</p> <p>We were scheduled to have another guest, a principal from St. Joseph's primary school in Fairview, but she is unavailable due to unforeseen circumstances.  I invite Ms Griffin to make the presentation on behalf of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Teresa Griffin" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014071600004#F00200"><p>I thank the committee for its invitation to attend this afternoon.  Mr. S&eacute; Goulding is head of operations for the NCSE and Ms Mary Byrne is head of special education.  The NCSE has a vision of a society where children and adults with special educational needs can achieve their potential.  We all know "it takes a village to raise a child" and for a child with additional needs, the village needs to comprise a family, appropriate schooling and support, if required, from clinical and therapeutic professionals.  These supports include clinical psychology, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and psychiatric support etc.  From the outset, I emphasise that the NCSE is very supportive of the approach being taken under the HSE progressing disability services for children initiative, as well as A Vision for Change.  We welcome the move away from a multiplicity of therapy service providers to the development of regional multidisciplinary teams around the country.  The NCSE is represented on the various national and local groups leading this initiative.  In many places around the State, our special educational needs organisers work well with local HSE disability services to plan and put services in place for students with special educational needs and we work hard to ease anxieties of parents and children in transitioning to and from school.</p><p>  Special education is a key Government priority and the NCSE is very appreciative that the resources we need to provide to schools have continued to be made available to us, despite the very difficult fiscal environment.  We have the ability to respond to growing student enrolments by continuing to allocate additional resource teacher and special needs assistant, SNA, posts in line with need and by establishing special classes and expanding special schools.  When meeting colleagues from the HSE, they advise us of their capacity issues and constraints.  Groups constantly tell us the position around the availability of clinical and therapeutic service continues to be problematic for children, families and schools.  When a child needs clinical or therapeutic intervention and does not receive it, we all know there can be significant repercussions for the child&rsquo;s development and in terms of an ability to access education.</p><p>  It is generally acknowledged that HSE-funded early intervention teams work well in certain areas of the country but I have been told by parental, school and advocacy groups that access to important health services is limited in other parts of the country, with gaps in services and long waiting lists.  The main issues raised include lengthy initial waiting lists, insufficient intervention if it is provided; inadequate support in mainstream school settings; concern that only some students in special classes receive support and others in the same class with equivalent need do not receive such support because of the segregated multiple service providers and concern that some children have to be taken out of school and brought to clinical settings.</p><p>  The difficulty around accessing a diagnosis of disability was one of the reasons the NCSE recommended to the Minister a change in how resource teachers are allocated to mainstream schools.  We felt one cannot base access to additional teaching support on a diagnosis of disability if there is not national consistent access to such a diagnosis.  Parents and schools have told us that they make difficult decisions based on the availability or absence of therapy services.  For example, parents seek to send their child to a special school or a special class where he or she might get therapeutic support even if the child is capable of attending mainstream education, parents refuse to allow their child to leave a special class or special school setting because they might lose their therapy intervention and parents seek professional reports simply to access special school placement so the child can get therapeutic or clinical supports.  Worryingly, mainstream and special schools are encountering severe difficulty in deciding if they can maintain the enrolment of some students who present with challenging behaviour in the absence of clinical supports.  We all agree that none of these scenarios is a good outcome for the child and none is in line with the national policy of supporting inclusive settings.</p><p>  As I stated at the beginning, the NCSE is broadly supportive of the progressing disability services initiative but children are only children for a period.  We have recommended that, pending the full roll-out of the progressing disabilities initiative, children with special educational needs should have early and timely access to sufficient clinical services, which should be provided on a consistent, efficient and equitable basis throughout the country.  This is something that the HSE is also working hard to put in place.  I am very happy to any of the committee's questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Healy" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014071600004#F00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to attend today.  I am joined by my colleague Ms Anne Melly, specialist in disability services.  The committee requested information on the provision of therapy services for children with special needs in educational settings and I will outline the national programme under way to standardise and develop the way in which services for children with disability, including those with autism, are delivered.  I will then deal specifically with issues in the Dublin north and north city area in which St. Joseph&rsquo;s school is located.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive has recognised the overall need to standardise the way in which services for children with disabilities, including those with autism, are delivered.  We are currently engaged in a reconfiguration of our existing therapy resources to multidisciplinary geographical based teams for children as part of the national programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People between zero and 18 years.  The objective of this exercise is to achieve a national unified approach to delivering disability health services so there is a clear path to services for all children, regardless of where they live, what school the go to or the nature of their disability.  There is a national structure to underpin this change management programme with national, regional and local implementation groups in place.  All elements of the implementation structure include multi-stakeholder involvement, including representatives from the Department of Education and Skills and its relevant service strands, including the National Educational Psychology Service and the National Council for Special Education.</p><p>  The vision for service delivery is that every child and its family will have access to required services; there will be equity and consistency across the country; effective teams will work in partnership with parents; resources will be used to the optimum; and health and education will work jointly to achieve best outcomes for children.  The intention is to roll out an integrated care model that will allow children, whatever the nature of their disability, to be seen as locally to their home and school as possible, at primary care level when their needs can be met there and by a network specialist interdisciplinary team if their needs are more complex.  The primary and network teams will be supported as appropriate by specialist support services with a high level of expertise in particular fields.</p><p>  An additional &euro;4 million has been specifically allocated in 2014 to drive implementation of the programme, and this equates to approximately 80 therapy posts.  As the programme is rolled out, it will ensure that the resources available are used to best effect in order to provide health supports and ongoing therapy to all children between zero and 18 in line with their prioritised needs.  In particular and over time, it will mean that all children, regardless of where they live will have equitable access to services based on their needs.</p><p>  Within the Health Service Executive, local services are delivered through integrated service areas, ISAs.  Each of these is at different stages of development across the country and the 2014 plan will see developments across a number of categories.  The local implementation groups in the mid west, Meath, west Cork, Cavan and Monaghan are already well developed and will consolidate implementation of the model, building on progress to date.  The local implementation groups in Kerry, Mayo, Galway, north and south Lee in Cork, Wexford, Kildare and west Wicklow and the midlands are ready to move to the next phase and will begin to fully reconfigure their services in line with the model.  The local implementation groups in Dublin will also see significant progress; Dublin north and Dublin north city on the north side and Dublin south, south east, south west and south central on the south side will finalise the consultation phase with all stakeholders, complete implementation plans and commence reconfiguration towards the new model of service.  The local implementation groups in Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Louth, Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, south Tipperary, north Cork and Wicklow will progress to the consultation phase and will establish a health and education forum, reviewing and amending governance and management structures, service policies and procedures and prepare for reconfiguration in 2015.</p> <p>Turning to the reconfiguration in the Dublin north area, Dublin north and Dublin north city, services to children with disabilities in this area are provided by a variety of service providers, including St. Michael&rsquo;s House, Daughters of Charity, Central Remedial Clinic, St. Paul's hospital and special school, which is linked to the Mater hospital, St. Joseph&rsquo;s School for the Blind, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, HSE early intervention services and Beechpark services for children with autism.<br />While many models of good practice have been developed and implemented to meet the needs of children with disabilities in Dublin north and Dublin north city, access to services and the timeliness of the response to identified needs has been largely determined by whether a child resides in an area where there is a service provider with a level of resources which enables a speedy and appropriate response.  Access to ASD services for children with normal IQ or mild intellectual disability has been determined by whether the child attends a class supported by Beechpark services.<br />With regard to autism-specific services and complex needs, Beechpark services and St. Paul's hospital and special school are autism-specific services, but the remaining service providers are also involved in meeting the needs of children with autism when the presenting need is less complex or where the primary disability is intellectual or physical or sensory.  Beechpark services are primarily targeted at providing appropriate multidisciplinary supports to children in Dublin north and Dublin north city who attend special ASD-specific classes that have been developed in special and mainstream schools.<br />With the multiplicity of service providers involved and the diversity of children&rsquo;s needs, ranging from mild intellectual disability to much more complex needs involving multiple disabilities, issues have been identified regarding the need to have very clear identified care pathways for all children requiring health and personal social services.  Evidence would suggest that there is greater clarity with regard to access where needs are clear and diagnosis is straightforward.  However, the pathway for children presenting with complex needs has not been as clear, and gaps have been identified.  In this context, some children diagnosed with ASD have had difficulty accessing a service and transitioning from one service to another.<br />In response to the many challenges emerging regarding the reconfiguration of multidisciplinary services in these areas, a dedicated senior manager has been assigned by the HSE to manage the reconfiguration programme.  An implementation group comprising all stakeholders - including all service providers, representatives from the education sector and parents - is in place and work is actively progressing to attend to the realignment and reconfiguration of the service delivery system in line with the agreed policy direction.  This work involves considerable system changes and it has been recognised that during the period of implementation additional resources will be required to address waiting lists and service pressures.  In this context an additional five posts were approved in 2013 to enhance the service response for children with ASD, and these posts are currently being recruited. <b></b>More important, a further 21 posts have been sanctioned in 2014.  This additional resource will enable the commencement of an enhanced service response for those children presenting with complex needs, including ASD, in this area.<br /><b></b>The HSE and the Department of Health jointly commissioned the NDA to carry out research into the practice of assessment of need.  The findings of the report produced on the national programme for children aged 0 to 18 years highlighted that where the Health Service Executive has configured disability services for children into geographically integrated teams, the statutory assessment of need process worked better and in a more streamlined way.  There was also less emphasis on using the assessment process to develop diagnoses in order to meet the specific entry requirements of individual services.  Accelerating the reconfiguration into geographically integrated teams would be very important, therefore, in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the statutory assessment of need process.<br />I am happy to answer any questions from members of the committee.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1154" speakername="Averil Power" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014071600005#G00300"><p>I thank Mr. Healy and Ms Griffin for their opening remarks.  I thank Teresa in particular for being very up-front in her presentation about the impact of this lack of services on children.  It is totally unacceptable that whether a child receives a vital service is dependent on where he or she lives.  This is very unfair to the children concerned.  We know that children with special needs need to receive appropriate interventions as early as possible, yet in some parts of the country this early intervention is non-existent.  In my area of Dublin bay north and in the broader north Dublin area, the waiting list for early intervention - the list to get on a list to be considered for a service - closed in November 2012.  No matter how serious the child's need, he or she cannot even get on a waiting list.  This is a really shocking and very unfair situation.</p><p>  The HSE presentation referred in detail to reconfiguration of services, and we all share its vision as to what services should be provided in an ideal world, but in the meantime, the HSE has been talking about this since 2011.  I have tabled this issue a number of times in the Seanad over the past three years and my colleagues in the D&aacute;il have also raised the issue in that House.  Every time I have raised the issue I have heard the same reply as today - that services are being reconfigured.  That is cold comfort to the children who have been unable to get any service in the meantime.  I support Ms Griffin, who is representing the National Council for Special Education, in her call that in the interim something needs to be done.  I agree that reconfiguration of services should be pursued, but in the meantime the resources need to be available.  It sounds as if this talk of reconfiguration is being used as an excuse for not providing resources and in my view this is very unfair.</p><p>  The principal of St. Joseph's in Fairview planned to speak to the committee today but she is unable to attend due to illness.  I will make some of the points she intended to present.  St. Joseph's is a mainstream school with a number of special classes which were provided on the promise of appropriate health and educational resources.  The educational resources are in place.  Originally, all the children in the special classes were being provided with speech and language and occupational therapy services from Beechpark, but because of cuts imposed in recent years, Beechpark has not taken on any new children.  The current situation was referred to by the National Council for Special Education in that only half the children in the class are receiving a health service, based on an arbitrary decision depending on when they joined the school.  This is very unfair to the children concerned and it has also caused health and safety risks for other students and for the staff because the behaviour of some of these children who are not getting the services they need has deteriorated to the point where a number of serious incidents have occurred when children have become out of control in the classroom and attacked teachers.  The principal rang me one day in tears as a result of the latest incident.  She said she did not want to be forced to expel primary schoolchildren because she wants to be able to look after them and to provide them with the service they need, but she is unable to do so.  She is at the end of her tether as a result of the impact of the lack of services on her children.</p><p>  When will the reconfiguration of services be completed?  In north Dublin, three years on, we are still talking about a consultation process.  In the meantime, children who started three years ago have now missed out during a vital part of their young lives which they will never get back.  I ask the HSE to provide the resources for a service which can then be reconfigured later as needs be to provide a consistent service in all geographical areas in the country.  The ideal situation would be for the health services to be provided on the same basis as educational provision.  The Department of Education and Skills made an arrangement years ago with the Department of Finance to ensure that teachers and special needs assistants would be provided when a special class was initiated.  The Department does not need to renegotiate with the Department of Finance for every new class because that agreement is in place.  This should be the case in the provision of the health service but it is not.  Has the HSE requested it in budget discussions?  Will it look for it?  Does the HSE agree that this would be a better solution to these problems?</p></speech>

I have two questions, which are both directed to Mr. Healy.  He referred in his presentation to the 80 new therapy posts approved for funding in 2014.  I understand there has been a delay in advertising those positions and they have not been filled as of today.  I ask Mr. Healy to clarify the position.  I ask him to explain the basis for the allocation of these posts around the State.  Has the HSE made any attempt to ascertain the number of therapy posts needed to ensure that the disability network teams will be fully staffed?</p> <p>What body, if any, measures the outcomes or consequences for children who are not getting the necessary level of therapeutic interventions in an educational context?  Apart from the impact on the individual, there is a long-term economic cost of failing to assist children at an early age to reach their potentials.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014071600006#H00200"><p>I welcome the NCSE and HSE guests.  Which existing therapy services are included in the new reconfiguration?  Can the HSE give us an overview of the pressures in different parts of the country?  There are different operations in various regions.  What are the waiting lists for the various therapy services?  Are they much longer in some areas than others?  Are young people being seen earlier in some areas, and do the waiting lists extend to more than a year in other areas?  Are there caps on the number of psychological assessments and other services a school can get?  My information is that the number of children a school can send forward to see an educational psychologist is limited.  As a result, schools must choose between children, which is not a position in which any school should be.  Is this case across the country?</p><p>  Could both guests elaborate on the distinction between services available to special schools and mainstream schools?  Parents have told me they felt they had to send their children to special schools because it was the only way they could access support services although the children were capable of being in the mainstream school system.  What services are affected by the distinction between special and mainstream schools?  Could the NCSE elaborate on its experience of the allocation of resource hours?  Its presentation has outlined that it very much depends on when a child is assessed and follows on from assessment.  Could the NCSE give more details on the number of students affected and whether it is different in various parts of the country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Healy" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014071600006#H00300"><p>The reconfiguration of services is a major change programme and we wanted to get it right.  We set out four categories of locations.  The first category is the mid west, where much work has already been done and the model is working well.  It is not getting additional resources this year but is moving on.  We will give some funding to support education and training and to keep the good work going.  The third category is Dublin, where there was clear recognition of the necessity to prioritise and address the challenges.  Category two includes a range of locations across the country where all the preparatory work in terms of consultation with families, schools and educators has been done, the care pathways are ready and we are ready to implement.  The final category is those that have work to do this year but will be ready next year.</p><p>  The prioritisation of the posts is related to need but also to the capacity to implement the reconfigured programme in a sensible and organised way.  We are targeting 21 posts to the north side of Dublin, which will make a significant difference.  The posts are cleared and will be filled on a permanent basis during the rest of the year.  We recognise we need to use the resources we have to target waiting lists.  We will not wait until the posts are there permanently but will use the resource at local level to use capacity between public, private and voluntary in order to address the waiting lists.  We do not want to lose the benefit of the reconfigured model.  The key aspect of it is that, as we roll out the model and apply more resources over time, we will eliminate the non-standardised issue whereby the service depends on the service provider to which one is aligned or whether a special school has resources attached to it, or issues such as the Beechpark issue in Dublin.

There is work ongoing examining how many posts we will require into the future and a workforce planning piece has been done.  The additional resource we have this year is &euro;4 million and we cannot move beyond that.  Our maximum capacity is to implement the 80 posts.  Including the posts that were approved last year and this year, it will be a 20% increase in the north Dublin area, which is significant.  I take the point made by education colleagues that we are not in the same position as them in that we do not have to get approval to proceed every time a special class is developed.  This is not how the funding of the health service has progressed.</p><p>  I have outlined how funding is being allocated this year.</p> <p>The areas where we target funding take into account significant pressures and the capacity to roll out the model in the current year because we need to do it appropriately.  The model does not envisage placing caps on schools.  With regard to making a distinction between mainstream and special schools, the purpose of the new model we are rolling out is to remove all of this inconsistency.</p></speech>

The point has been made in the feedback through education that those associated with a particular service provider or class may get a very good service, but the issue for us is that we must develop a more consistent approach.  The inconsistency which arises by targeting particular special schools or specific providers, as has been done in the past, is not the way to continue.  I referenced the work and research done by the National Disability Authority which supports this.  Where the model is implemented it makes a difference.  I take the point made by members that one must pay attention to today as well as roll out the model, and we are trying to strike a balance, but we do not want to lose the implementation of the model.</p></speech>

We will allocate 21 posts, which will make a significant difference.  These 21 posts, together with the five posts approved last year and other replacement posts, will mean a 20% increase in the resources available.</p><p>  The point made by my education colleagues is correct.  The health system does not have approval to proceed as special classes are developed.  We do not have the resources to match education in the same fashion.  There was acknowledgement that to roll out a reconfiguration of the services additional resources are required, and &euro;4 million was secured by the Minister to give effect to this.  This will go a long way.  We will implement a post specifically focused on developing outcomes associated with the model, which will help to demonstrate the benefit and measure how we progress.</p></speech>

At a meeting with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children I provided analysis of all therapy posts in the system.

A  member of staff there went on maternity leave and was not replaced, and children were left without a service.  This was entirely predictable and there should have automatically been a replacement but this did not happen.  From raising this issue in the Seanad over the past three years I have learned there seems to be a difference between how many people are recruited and how many people are providing a service.  Where do we stand in respect of this?  Mr. Healy stated 21 extra posts have been allocated.  I have been raising this issue for a long time.  For the past two years the Minister has stated a total of &euro;4 million has been allocated, but we have not seen it being spent or seen people in positions.

There is a commitment to utilise the resource to provide education and training to support the local implementation group process and to target local waiting lists while the permanent posts are being put in place using capacity in public, private or voluntary sectors.  We have the challenge of dealing with the employment control framework which operates in the system.  We are funded for a level of resource.  We are covered for a percentage of maternity leave but we do not have approval to go beyond this.  We try to prioritise therapy posts in particular.  We have set out in our operational plan for social care for the year the importance of maintaining therapy services, particularly for children.  In acknowledgement and recognition of the challenges in Dublin, such as Beechpark and autism spectrum disorder services, we prioritised the totality of Dublin during 2014 and we will continue to try to develop this, which is why we have specifically assigned 21 posts to the north of Dublin city.</p></speech>

We included the &euro;4 million funding in our service plan and have approval for it this year.  In January and February this year we announced the intention to spend the money.  We have gone through the process of settling on the allocation of the resource, approval to fill the posts is in place and we will fill them.  An important and positive part of this is we will be able to benefit from the graduates in September.  It is very positive to have the posts ready for them.  We will also target the use of the resource in the current year on waiting lists and on education and training with regard to local implementation groups.</p> <p>It is important to support the consultation and engagement with families.</p></speech>

I do not think we have progressed any further on this than when we started and I find that depressing, given the nature of the issue.  Services have not improved and all we keep hearing is talk of process, though I mean no disrespect to the witnesses.  If the 21 people referred to are recruited by the end of the year I will be the first to congratulate the witnesses.  I am sceptical because I have been told of recruitment for the past three years.  I have with me today replies to questions from different Deputies of various parties that raised the issue in the D&aacute;il and they were all told there is a process in place and people are being recruited.  I am sure Mr. Healy is trying to be helpful and I mean no disrespect to individual witnesses when I say I am sceptical but I get phone calls from school principals who are in tears because of what the children in their schools are enduring.

The issue of the cap on psychological assessments was also raised and I understand the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, has a limit of two assessments for every 100 children in a school.  Its approach tends to look at the whole school and put structures in place on that basis.  I think NEPS assessments are limited as outlined but I will come back to the committee later if I am mistaken.</p><p>  On the different services in mainstream schools and special schools, from an educational point of view, we allocate teaching and special needs assistant, SNA, resources to schools in line with pupil-teacher ratios that are set down for special classes, whether in mainstream schools or special schools.  For example, the standard pupil-teacher ratio in a special class for children with autism is one teacher and two SNAs for every six children but this can increase depending on the children and many special classes have three SNAs.  In other words, staffing of one teacher and two SNAs for every six children is the baseline and individual care needs are also taken into account.</p><p>  It is difficult to measure deficits in the monitoring of outcomes for children because, as our policy advice has said, outcomes are not routinely measured.  We recommend that where additional resources are applied outcomes must be measured because we would like such information.  Through additional services implemented by the Health Service Executive, HSE, in conjunction with voluntary organisations like Atlantic Philanthropies in Limerick and an initiative in Tallaght, we have become aware that where services are put in place 18% of children that need early intervention speech and language therapy will be discharged from the service.  In other words, the service that was put in place saved those children from multiple disadvantages later in life because the early acquisition of language is very important and children who do not acquire language early will be at a significant disadvantage when they start school.</p><p>  The last time we examined the matter of waiting lists was in preparation of our policy advice paper last year.  I think 23% of applications under the assessment of need process were met in the timeframe set down by the HSE, but perhaps the HSE witnesses here can confirm that.  This led to significant delays in children accessing resource teaching hours.  The impact on our services can be seen in the understandable frustration of parents who know they must have a disability diagnosed before additional teaching supports can be accessed.  We allocate resources twice a year and huge frustration builds as deadlines for our assessment and allocation process approach.  The frustration stems from the fact parents are on a waiting list and know if they miss the deadline they must wait another six months for the allocation of resource teachers.</p><p>  The lack of therapeutic services in certain parts of the country sometimes means a recommendation for an SNA service is made where speech therapy is required but the resources are not available.  When we turn down an SNA this also leads to frustration.  If parents are unwilling to allow a child to leave a specialist setting when he or she is suitable for a mainstream setting because of a fear of losing therapy services we must open more special classes.  This is counterproductive in terms of the inclusion setting and it affects our services.</p></speech>

I want to refer to a case that has arisen in the mid-Kerry area, where services are being reconfigured.</p> <p>St. Francis special school in Beaufort has encountered huge difficulties since last autumn in providing occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and physiotherapy to its students.  The experience of the 52 children attending that school has been appalling and very upsetting for their parents.  Many of the children have regressed because of the inadequate level of services.</p><p> I very much welcome the provision of 80 additional posts nationwide, four of which have been allocated to Kerry in recognition of the reconfiguration process that has taken place there.  The fact remains, however, that the reconfiguration has left huge gaps in the service and children have suffered immensely because of it.  Will the delegates indicate whether similar problems have arisen in other counties?  When will we see the full allocation of those 80 posts and what guarantees can be given to children and their families that they will receive the services they require?  Nobody is looking for a luxury service here.  I recently visited a mother whose son struggles to swallow and cough.  The lack of services available to him has led to his regressing so far that he developed a chest infection because he was not able to cough.  That is how fundamental these services are; it is basic stuff, not anything fancy.</p></speech>

I mentioned in my presentation the categorisation we devised, with category one comprising those locations in the mid-west, Meath, west Cork and Cavan-Monaghan where a great deal of progress has been made.  The mid-west is often cited as one of the exemplar sites around which the model was developed, with west Cork being another very early adopter.  The collaboration between schools, service providers and the Department in those areas is excellent.  When we talk about rolling out the naught to 18 model, that is what we are talking about.  Part of the learning from west Cork and other locations in the mid-west and elsewhere was the necessity of having that type of framework in place, with local implementation groups, good consultation with parents and so on.</p><p>  To address Deputy Griffin's question, a similar process to what happened in west Cork was undertaken in Kerry.  The general feedback I have had is that it has worked well, people understood what was being done, there was a great deal of engagement and consultation with the various providers and good linking into schools.  I will look into the situation at St. Francis special school in Beaufort, which I know well from my past role as director of disability services in the south.  I was not aware of any particularly significant problems there, but I will investigate the matter.  The general feedback on the changes has been good.  Indeed, the work done by the National Disability Authority shows that where the new model has been rolled out, it is working better overall.  I take the point, however, that the changes must be handled appropriately and in proper consultation with families.  There is obviously a resource issue at play here in the context of increased levels of need.  I am confident, however, that the model we are rolling out is the best one.  We must address the resource issues as we go on.  I will get back to the Deputy regarding St. Francis special school.</p></speech>

He might not have got around to reading the detailed e-mail I sent him last week setting out the problems at this particular school and elsewhere in mid-Kerry.  The previous Minister, Deputy James Reilly, met with parents and HSE officials in May and was well aware of the problems.  Students at St. Francis special school have had an appalling experience.  My concern is to ensure the HSE is fully aware of the terrible impact on the children in question and to seek assurance that the same thing will not happen elsewhere.  While I appreciate the need for reform and to do more with less, we cannot have that amount of damage being inflicted on the children who depend on these services.  While the objective is to move to a better system in the long term, this type of thing cannot be allowed to happen in the transition period.  I ask that the HSE be vigilant in identifying these types of problems and, where they arise, to rectify them as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

Has there been any progress in that regard or is there a continuing issue with finding suitably qualified people for posts?  Delays in assessments are causing particular problems for students who are transitioning from primary to second level.

I know from experience that there are huge difficulties for teaching staff in having to decide which students will be assessed.  In the particular school I have in mind, there was a class with five students all requiring an assessment and all in receipt of some level of resource hours.  Some were simply being taken out of the class and given whatever additional hours they could be given even though those hours were not necessarily allocated to the individual student.  One student was assessed and diagnosed as having severe dyslexia and dysgraphia and the recommendation in the NEPS report was that the child have an occupational therapy assessment in light of the issues identified with fine motor skills.  The parents discovered, however, that there was an 18-month waiting list for that assessment.  They had the NEPS assessment confirming the child's diagnosis but they were faced with a delay of 18 months before obtaining an additional diagnosis of what they suspected was an underlying condition.  That created huge difficulties for the school because although management knew what needed to be done for this particular child, it could not secure the resources to do it.  Will the new allocation model be able to address those types of scenarios?</p> <p>In this child's case serious consideration was given to whether he should move from mainstream to special school because the resources were there to deal with dyslexia.  The parent wanted to keep him in mainstream school.</p><p> It is an awful predicament for any school or teacher to be in, to be told what is wrong with one&rsquo;s son and that he needs additional tests which are 18 months down the line.  Eventually that parent had the tests done privately.  I believe if one has tests done privately, there is a problem with recognition of the report.  The school said the parent was better off staying in the public system because, although it would take longer, it would carry more weight.  I do not believe that is the case but that was the impression given.  Some parents weigh up whether to get it done privately or to hang on to do it in the public system if that will carry more weight.  This causes huge problems.</p></speech>

We recommended that time be taken to ensure further consultation.  We consulted quite widely and went back to various groups about our model.  It is a change and that is difficult to manage.  We did not want a model that would send a shock through the system and cause a great deal of upset and concern.  We recommended that the Minister take time to consult further with the various educational partners to make sure that when or if the model was introduced, there would be broad consensus behind it.  The last thing anybody wants, especially parents, and the children, is deficiency in the resourcing model.  For our model to work it is important that everybody work together to ensure it is put into place as quickly and smoothly as possible, which would reduce anxiety among parents and students.</p><p>  That is one of the reasons for recommending change, to ensure that resources would be available in the school, based on the educational profile of each school to help a child who everybody knew had difficulties.  We are not saying that children do not need to be assessed.  We believe absolutely that it is appropriate for children to be assessed but that is to inform the teaching and learning rather than just to drive the diagnosis of disability.  We accept recommendations from appropriately qualified people for the allocation of resources.  If one has a private diagnosis and it meets the appropriate criteria, for example, for autism, we accept that and allocate resources.</p></speech>

That is obviously not the case but it is the perception that there will be questions about the qualifications of the private assessor and whether that report will be accepted.  All of those issues can be addressed easily by relaying information.</p></speech>

The diagnosis is the least important part.  The schools should focus on the strategies to develop language skills and contribute to the individual education plan, IEP, as opposed to having a label and allocation and assuming that it is a case of happy days afterwards.</p></speech>

There are usually several parent representatives in the local implementation groups.  Where it works well it seems to have a very beneficial impact.  It overcomes the type of difficulties Deputy Griffin spoke about.  That is why we are trying to develop it.  Equally, it is a good feedback process.  If we start to roll it out and it does not work as well as we thought it would, we can get feedback and respond.  We want to make sure we do that right.</p></speech>

Historically, at primary level, children who had dyslexia or a mild or borderline general learning disability had the supports within the school.  The children did not need assessments, which was causing a bottleneck in the transition from primary to post-primary.  The Department changed the way of allocating services at post-primary level to mirror what was happening at primary level.  That should address the bottleneck.  There is still a requirement for an-up-to-date assessment of behaviour but it might not be necessary for a child with autism.</p></speech>

I was very impressed with the proposed new model.  I attended the briefing by the NCSC at the Department of Education and Skills.  It is a very positive step.  I spent several years dealing with those challenges in the classroom from the parents&rsquo;, the administrative and the teaching points of view.  It is very welcome and I look forward to its adoption.</p><p>  The collaboration between the HSE and CoAction in west Cork leads to the good work there.  One of my children uses that service and we are blown away by the level of service and the therapies available, especially speech and language, occupational, and all the four main therapies.  I do not want to make my colleagues jealous by boasting about this wonderful service. </p> <p>To give credit where credit is due, it is exceptional and parents are very appreciative.  I do not believe they realise how lucky they are in west Cork.  They believe the standard there is the standard across the board.</p><p> What are we doing to measure outcomes in the area of early intervention?  The amount of therapy my little two and a half year old girl is receiving is impressive.  My hope is that when she goes to primary school, there will not be the same draw on resources.  How far have we proceeded in measuring the outcomes?  I would like to know the NCSE perspective.  Perhaps the HSE is measuring also.</p></speech>

There was widespread consultation with parents of the children involved.  Everyone was happy to move forward with the reconfiguration process but, unfortunately, what people got was certainly not what they were told they would get during the consultation process.  Obviously, there is no point in having a consultation process and informing parents of the proposed outcome if it is not going to be followed through.</p><p>  When the problems first arose in Kerry, there was not a good system of feedback and parents did not feel empowered to highlight the problems and try to work through them.  I am thankful that in the past two months, there has been a process in place to allow for a regular meeting with representatives of the HSE to address the problems that arise.</p><p>  From the Kerry experience, one of the main problems is that when somebody goes out sick, nobody replaces him.  It is a huge problem.  If the driver of a train to Kerry is sick, somebody else replaces him and drives the train.  However, if one member of staff is not able to provide a therapy service for a child with special needs who desperately needs it, that child must go without.  That is not acceptable at all.  Will it be addressed?  Will we actually see flexibility in the system so that, rather than shutting off services, a replacement member of staff will be able to do the job that is necessary at the front line?</p></speech>

We are going to do it at national level this year.  It will be assigned specifically with a role in the development of outcomes for the programme for those between zero and 18.  Obviously, we will be working with colleagues on the wider agenda concerning outcomes overall but we want to focus specifically on the rolling out of the aforementioned programme.</p><p>  Deputy Griffin and Senator Power referred to leave.  Within the health service, we are limited by the employment control framework.  We have some flexibility, which is limited by resources.  There is a certain amount of cover possible, which often relates to maternity leave or sick leave, but if one goes beyond what is resourced, there is just no funding to cover.  There have been gaps in some of our services when there was a high proportion of leave, for whatever reason.  We have tried to come up with innovative ways of trying to deal with the problem locally, including through using clinics and reorganising how we operate.  However, the employment control framework and the necessity to live within fixed resources bring challenges.</p><p>  As I said to Senator Power, we have absolutely prioritised the therapy posts for filling, particularly those being talked about at this meeting.  Given the importance of therapy posts, we are trying to maximise the resources we have for the very reasons suggested by the Deputy and in recognition of trying to roll out the programme.  At the same time, however, there is a significant challenge in terms of health resources.  The employment control framework applies and we must live within it.</p></speech>

This was because of the scale of numbers and the fact that other parts of the country were regarded as more attractive.  These areas had more candidates.  Once one went below a particular threshold, it was more difficult to encourage people to come in one's direction.  We try to develop creative ways to attract staff.  Challenges can arise, but, broadly, we are training, through the universities, etc.  The important thing is to have the posts into which to put the graduates.</p></speech>

Why have there been such different rates of progress in the reconfiguration around the country?  Have there been particular problems?  It is stated the plans of the local implementation group are already well developed and are being consolidated in the mid-west, Meath and some parts of Cork.  Deputy Daly pointed out that the services are working very well in some parts of Cork.  I look forward to similar circumstances in north Dublin.  In some areas, staff are just finishing the consultation.  This is not only in north Dublin, but also in Dublin's north inner city and in south, south east, south west and south central Dublin.  The same applies in Donegal and Roscommon.  Do particular local issues arise?  Are there difficulties getting people to the table and reaching an agreement?  Why are some places already delivering services while others are still at the talking phase?</p></speech>

An important benefit of having a post like my own, as national director of social care, is that it brings a specific focus to the area of disability in the elderly.  What we are now able to do, and what we have done in the social care operational plan for the year, is bring a specific focus to this, give it the priority it requires and start to roll it out in a consistent, measured way.  Of course there are resource issues, which we have talked about.  It is necessary to put in place the appropriate process.  We need to put in place the appropriate policy procedures and guidance.  One needs to have consultation locally.  The type of discussion we have had needs to be engaged in, and that is what we are now doing.  I regard this as very positive.  I am positive about the future in regard to rolling out a consistent model across the country.</p><p>  There will, of course, be an issue of resources.  The positive aspect of this is that there has been an allocation of &euro;4 million this year.  We are saying clearly we are going to drive that out and ensure we do the recruitment.  As I stated, we must target waiting list initiatives and so forth in the meantime.  We do not have the benefit of the kind of arrangement the education sector has whereby once a need for a class has been identified, a dedicated and agreed resource can be obtained.  We are not in that space.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. James Claffey, policy and communications officer, Irish Rural Link, IRL; Ms Michelle Murphy, policy research analyst, Social Justice Ireland, SJI; Mr. Michael Harty, chairman, Home and Community Care Ireland, HCCI; Mr. Robin Hanan, director, European Anti-Poverty Network, Ireland, EAPN; Ms Caroline Fahey, social policy development officer, Society of St. Vincent de Paul, SVP ; Ms Yvonne O'Sullivan, advocacy and policy officer, Free Legal Aid Centres, FLAC, before the committee today.</p><p>  The format of the meeting will be a round-table discussion on social protection based on the pre-budget submissions received from the organisations present today.  The witnesses will make their opening statements in the following order: Irish Rural Link, Social Justice Ireland, Home and Community Care Ireland, European Anti-Poverty Network, Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Free Legal Aid Centres.</p> <p>A question and answer session with the members will then ensue and, given the time constraints and to ensure we have a constructive debate, I must insist that all opening statements are kept to a maximum of three minutes.  Witnesses have already been advised by the committee secretariat that I will stop them if they go over their time limit.  Also, each member is entitled to ask questions only once, and the relevant witnesses can then respond.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile telephones must be switched off as they interfere with the communications equipment and the broadcasting of these meetings.<br />With regard to the formalities of today's meeting, I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br />I now ask Mr. Claffey to commence his opening statement on the pre-budget submissions, and the other witnesses can follow in the sequence I have outlined.</p></speech>

Irish Rural Link has fully accepted the gravity of the crisis facing the Government but believes rural communities have borne a disproportionate weight of recent budgetary decisions including carbon taxes, community sector cutbacks and reduced regional investment.</p><p>  We welcome the Government&rsquo;s success in maintaining the steady improvement of Ireland&rsquo;s finances and in particular its work in restructuring the huge national debt.  </p><p>  We also urge the Government to recognise the huge sacrifices being made by people because of the austerity now in place for five years, and strongly recommend that this budget stimulates the economy so that employment can begin to increase and families can lessen the hardship.</p><p>  We believe that under the IMF-EU-ECB bailout the Government has choices.  We note that the IMF representatives clearly stated that the Government must not unduly disadvantage people who are vulnerable or communities that are struggling to maintain structures necessary to be sustainable.  It is also noteworthy that the IMF has made it clear that austerity as it is implemented affecting the most vulnerable is not a sustainable policy in terms of restoring the national economy.</p><p>  Rural people still cannot access a rural transport service or take advantage of free travel entitlements.  Much the same can be said about amenities such as libraries and swimming pools.  The potential for rural school amalgamations with no consideration of the community impacts or the cost of transport, and the possibility of further Garda station closures, is worrying for most rural communities.</p><p>  In the past year, families in rural areas are experiencing a raft of financial hardships in terms of care based services, rising fuel costs, cuts to school transport, and Garda station and post office closures.  The downturn has also affected families' access to reasonable financial services.  That is highlighted by the disappearance of bank branches and the increased tightening of regulations governing credit unions.  The latter experience is forcing many families in extreme poverty to depend on moneylenders, whose charges are punitive.</p><p>  The lack of any functioning overall strategy to inform Government policy on rural development is completely disadvantaging rural communities.  The demise of the White Paper on Rural Development, coupled with the ending of the national spatial strategy, has meant that there is no overarching strategy that can inform all Departments on rural policies.  National policies are then rolled out without any analysis of the unintended consequences for rural areas.</p><p>  While Irish Rural Link welcomes the launch of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, report, we still await its implementation but we regard the appointment of the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, as a positive step towards the implementation of its recommendations.</p></speech>

Social Justice Ireland is an independent think tank and justice advocacy organisation that advances the lives of the people in communities through providing independent social analysis and effective policy development to create a sustainable future for every member of society and for society as a whole.</p><p>  To date, the burden has fallen hardest on those who could least afford to carry it, namely, those who are very far removed from the banking and speculative gambles that were at the root of Ireland's economic crash.  The focus of Social Justice Ireland's budget proposals, therefore, is on shifting the balance towards an emphasis on additional taxation measures via the creation of a fair taxation system and reducing the focus on cuts to public expenditure.</p><p>  Our policy briefing, Budget Choices, sets out three scenarios in terms of reducing the budget deficit, but I will focus on our core proposal of a reduction of borrowing by &euro;1 billion in budget 2015 to meet the deficit target.  This is due to a number of factors including redefinitions of GDP, higher growth, the growth in employment, and subsequent increases in taxation revenues and expenditure saving, among other areas.  Page 4 of Budget Choices contains the full details of our adjustment.</p><p>  The Government has choices as it decides what to include, and what to exclude, in budget 2015.  It is important that this is publicly acknowledged and considered prior to and during the decision-making process for budget 2015 as these decisions will have a very significant impact on people throughout the State.  Government choices should ensure that budget 2015 is fiscally sound, that it improves tax equity, protects the vulnerable, improves governance, and makes decisions that are sustainable.  </p><p>  There is an urgent need to reverse the regressive nature of the budgets introduced by the current Government since 2011.  This requires that special care be taken to protect the vulnerable.  It requires that those who currently have the most and who benefit the most from our economic system contribute the most.</p><p>  Our key proposals for budget 2015 are that the Government should dramatically increase funding for social housing; make a significant investment in the broadband infrastructure in rural areas; increase funding for adult literacy; increase funding for disability services; introduce a universal State pension; make tax credits refundable to address Ireland's working poor problem; increase the PAYE tax credit by &euro;5 per week; and increase core social welfare payments by &euro;5 per week.</p><p>  To finance its debt reduction, the Government should introduce a minimum effective corporate tax rate of 6%; make tax reliefs available only at the standard rate; and introduce a financial transactions tax.  A budget oriented along those lines would be fiscally sound.  It would prevent any further erosion of the social infrastructure, provide much needed investment, and begin the process of making the taxation system more equitable.  It would be fair, good for the economy, good for the vulnerable, and good for Ireland.</p></speech>

HCCI's primary objective is to promote the highest professional standards of care in the home and client choice, in a cost effective manner.  Providing care to over 8,500 clients in their own homes throughout Ireland, the HCCI is playing an important role in the development of the home care sector &ndash; an integral part of the Government&rsquo;s stated policy of developing the primary care sector.<br />In light of Ireland&rsquo;s rapidly expanding population of those over the age of 65, recent pressure on home care budgets, lack of regulation, questions over the quality of care provision, and the shortage of funds due to an artificial division of what is seen as separate services for older people, HCCI calls on the Government to, first, amalgamate budgets for care of older persons<b></b>to ensure that people are directed to the appropriate level of care and that people can stay in their homes for as long as possible with potential savings of &euro;69 million in 2015 alone; second, establish more open and transparent commissioning of home care services<b></b>not provided directly by the HSE, with an end to section 39 allocated funding, through a national tender to achieve a further savings of &euro;48 million in 2015; third, safeguard jobs and maintain home care as an affordable option for all, including those in need of care 24 hours a day, seven days a week; fourth, reform social welfare regulations to incentivise people to take on work in the home care sector; fifth, we call on the Government to double the existing &euro;50,000 ceiling for tax relief for home care; and sixth, extend the IT 47 definition of incapacitation to include home care requirements as a result of old age or infirmity.</p> <p> HCCI is aware of the difficult economic climate and the clamour for funds from all sectors of society and wishes to be a constructive partner to Government.  We have devoted considerable resources to compiling a business case for the future of home care and to identify savings that could be accrued through the more efficient use of existing funds.  We call on the Government to use budget 2015 to explore these options to ensure sufficient resources to look after our ageing demographic, while also seizing the opportunity to stimulate employment with the potential for up to 8,000 new jobs by incentivising people who wish to work in the home care sector.  I look forward to answering any questions in the question and answer session to follow.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.116" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robin Hanan" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014071600004#C00200"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to put our point of view.  We take as a starting point what is becoming accepted across the political spectrum, which is the statement in the new statement of Government priorities that the ongoing programme of economic repair will be accompanied by an equal emphasis on social recovery.  We want to address how that needs to be done in a way that particularly addresses the position of people experiencing poverty.  Our members are both national and local community organisations and they represent people affected by poverty and work with them on the ground.  They report increased deprivation and hardship, which is difficult to convey in figures or in a short presentation.  However, the CSO figures show that according to the deprivation indicator, which used to be considered a basic measure of those living right on the bottom line and unable to afford basic essentials, the numbers experiencing deprivation have doubled to a quarter of the population, including more than a third of children, and the number of people at work who are experiencing deprivation -for example, they are unable to afford to heat the house adequately or afford clothing and shoes - more than doubled between 2008 and 2012, which are the most recent figures.</p><p>  We need to examine every aspect of the budget to see how it can address ongoing poverty.  People experiencing poverty have been hit by a triple whammy of job losses and reduction in quality of work, with much more casual work and more conditions at work on the one hand; cuts in services as a result of the recession and the decisions taken; and cuts in eligibility for welfare, which have hit many people hard.  They have made it harder for people to take up work.</p><p>  We need to go back to the national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, of almost 20 years ago, which is still Government policy, to carry out poverty impact assessments on every aspect of Government policy.  At its best, poverty proofing was a relatively secretive system and quite tokenistic.  We argue in our submission in more detail than I have time for in this presentation that it is important to open up this process.  We would encourage Ministers to come to committees such as this, as they are required to under NAPS, and present the impact of each important decision in the budget process for better for worse on poverty and to argue their case.  No one is trying to constrain government decision-making but we need at least to have a clear public debate on the impact on poverty.  It needs to be comprehensive.  It is not good enough for Departments to say, for example, the issue of direct provision for asylum seekers is outside the scope of poverty proofing or aspects of taxation policy do not need to be fully assessed.  We need a public and open process.</p><p>  The rest of the submission goes into more detail about our proposals on welfare levels and maintaining the basic level of welfare, proposals to restore some of the cuts in eligibility over the past number of years and making it easier for people to access quality work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.117" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline Fahy" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014071600004#C00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation.  Our 11,000 members in the Society of St. Vincent de Paul are seeing at first hand the impact of the economic crisis and the austerity programme that has followed.  Calls for help to our regional offices have increased by more than 100% since 2009 and we are spending more money than ever helping individuals and families in need.  We are spending more than &euro;80 million per annum, which is up from &euro;52 million in 2008.  In 2012, we spent more than &euro;22 million on food and cash assistance and more than &euro;11 million helping households with their energy costs.  Help with fuel and energy costs is up by almost 200% since 2008, demonstrating the impact of austerity and deprivation on households across the country.</p><p>  The reason for the increase in our spend is the impact of austerity has been most strongly felt by people with the lowest income and least resources and the cumulative impact of the cuts to incomes and services over the past number of years has resulted in a huge negative impact on people's ability to cope.  The increased cost of living is eroding the real value of incomes whether they are from social welfare or employment.  Our colleagues in the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice have found that the costs of a minimum essential standard of living, which is based on needs, not wants, increased by more than 3% between 2008 and 2013, which is much faster than the rate of general inflation.</p><p>  The cost of energy heating for the home has increased by an average of 25% since 2009 but supports such as the fuel allowance have been reduced.  The largest group requesting help from us is families with children, in particularly those heading by a person parenting on his or her own.  Research carried out by our colleagues in Social Justice Ireland has found that a one-parent family that is out of work has experienced the largest reduction in income of any group in the country.  The next worst affected group is a couple with earnings of &euro;200,000 a year.</p><p>  There has been a great deal of discussion about Ireland's recovery and we welcome the progress that has been made but our members are not seeing that reality in people's pockets and lives.  People continue to struggle on a daily basis to afford basics such as food, fuel and education costs.  This year we have titled our pre-budget submission, Planning for the Right Kind of Recovery.  The right kind of recovery would bring us towards a nation where caring for each other, our children, older people and people with disabilities is valued and supported, where individuals, families and communities can participate fully in society and where an adequately resourced State and a strong economy, employment and business environment supports the type of society in which we wish to live.</p><p>  We are asking Government to announce a budget for 2015 that tackles poverty, social exclusion and unemployment, provides supports to people in jobless households to make the move from welfare into employment and invests in our children and young people.  We set out 33 priorities in our submission based on the needs of those we assist.  These are things we have to ask for because of what we are seeing on the ground.  If these policy recommendations were implemented, it would put us on the road towards the right kind of recovery.</p><p>  Our key priority in tackling poverty and social exclusion is to ensure social welfare payments, tied income supports and secondary benefits are adjusted to reflect the increased cost of living.  We must also ensure any changes to income tax, the Universal Social Charge or other taxes benefit those on low incomes rather than those on higher incomes.</p><p>  We would like the changes to the one-parent family payment reversed to tackle unemployment and provide opportunities for jobless households.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.118" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Yvonne O'Sullivan" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014071600004#C00400"><p>I thank the committee for inviting FLAC to make a presentation on its pre-budget submission.  The Oireachtas and its standing committees play a vital role in overseeing the Government&rsquo;s compliance with its international human rights law and the State's obligations and this is also applies to the budgetary process.  The State has duties, freely entered into, to immediately provide protection of a minimum core of human rights in key areas of life.  These are at the heart of our concern regarding budget 2015.  FLAC is currently co-ordinating a shadow report, which will reflect evidence of how the State is meeting its economic, social and cultural rights obligations on the ground.  In light of that, our submission focuses on how best to protect vulnerable groups by ensuring the State adheres to such standards.  FLAC believes this would produce a budget that allocates resources in a way that is proportionate, transparent and fair.</p><p>  I will summarise our proposals for the budget.  The Government should provide a basic level of subsistence - in other words, a social protection floor - that would allow all persons to live their lives with dignity.  The Government should carry out impact assessments of budget proposals before decisions are made and not after, as is currently the practice.  The Government should ensure more transparency, accountability and participation in the budget process by using a human rights framework.  This also includes greater participation and input from stakeholders, including groups directly affected by the decisions as well as valuable expertise as in that of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  The Government should make budgets that are democratically and openly debated and discussed in the Oireachtas with adequate time and that are based on up to date, understandable legislative material.  The Government should reduce expenditure on social protection through greater efficiencies rather than cutting payments to vulnerable groups.</p> <p>Systemic reforms in the appeals process such as improving decision-making at first instance could yield savings.  Here, too, FLAC remains concerned that decision-making must meet basic human rights standards of fair procedure and transparency.  The Government should also alleviate concerns about the recovery of overpayments by respecting the right to a minimum income.  The Department is able to unilaterally recover up to 15% of a basic social welfare payment which means that the State could put a person at risk of dropping below its own basic minimum income limit of &euro;186 per week.  FLAC recommends implementation of a robust appeals procedure and clear guidelines on how a person's circumstances should be taken into account in assessing his or her capacity to repay the amount of the overpayment.</p><p> The Government should reinstate and put on a statutory footing The Lough credit union repayment scheme.  This was broadly a successful initiative that assisted vulnerable MABS clients without bank accounts to access credit.  Its termination was a retrograde step and should be reversed.</p><p> In summary, the Government has legal obligations in the operation and functions of all public bodies and Departments to uphold the right of every person in the State to a life of dignity.  FLAC recommends a human rights approach to budgetary decisions and the process of budgeting which would help the State to meets its commitments.</p><p> I thank the committee.

The reason this meeting is taking place before the summer recess is the budget cycle has been changed, with the budget now being presented in October instead of December.  Another significant aspect this year is that, having exited the bailout programme, Ireland, like other member states in the eurozone, has country-specific recommendations.  I invite the delegates to bear in mind these recommendations when responding to questions.  Questions will be grouped.  If that is agreeable, I encourage members to keep their questions brief and delegates to reply coherently.  I will begin with Mr. Claffey.  I am very interested to hear Irish Rural Link's views on the rural fuel poverty strategy and how it would work.</p></speech>

Greater numbers are suffering as a result of the reductions in the fuel allowance.  In our view, revenue from the carbon tax should be ring-fenced and a proportion allocated to deal with this problem.

The strategy needs to ensure more fuel is provided and that funds will be provided for insulation in order that heat can be retained in the house.  This is most important for the well-being and protection of the elderly, the houses of many of whom are 50 or 60 years old and do not meet standard regulations.</p></speech>

We have done some modelling.  I refer to a number of reports, the one that is quoted most is the PriceWaterhouseCoopers' report, but it does not necessarily reflect the majority of corporations in Ireland that pay corporation tax.  Following some modelling we find that some corporations pay tax at a rate between 0% and 3% and 3% and 6%, while others pay at a rate between 6% and 9% and 9% and 12%.  We are saying that if a minimum effective corporation tax rate were to be implemented, significant revenue could be generated.  We are saying the minimum effective rate should be 6% because the majority of Irish companies pay at between 9% and 12.5% because they are not all exporting.</p></speech>

This does not affect the 12.5% headline rate, but there is an opportunity for us to take the lead and address some of the issues being considered internationally.  With regard to the CSRs, country-specific recommendations, on behalf of Social Justice Ireland, I can say we are very worried about recommendation No. 1.  While we welcome the emphasis placed on broadening the tax base, we are very concerned about the statement on making the expenditure ceilings more binding and removing statutory discretion because this would prevent the investments required in the other CSRs such as providing access to quality child care, improved training and all the measures needed to address the issue of jobless households and poverty.  If the recommendation on binding expenditure ceilings is implemented, it will not be possible to invest to address the other problems identified.</p></speech>

The Minister has stated in the D&aacute;il that approximately 33% to 40% of people in residential care do not necessarily need to be there.  The figure of &euro;69 million in savings comes from making more funds available for home care services and moving people out of residential care back into the community and home, which is where they would prefer to be and which would result in significant savings for the Government.  Studies show that approximately 4.5% of the over-65s are in residential care, about 30% to 40% above the figure for our European peers.  In ring-fencing funds under the fair deal scheme we are actually creating an artificial demand for residential care places and pushing people towards that form of care, rather than doing what the Minister suggests and let the money follow the patient.  We advocate that people should be assessed and offered a certain level of support but letting them choose whether it should be provided through residential care, community care or home care services.  In our view, there would be a significant movement of people from residential care to home care settings which would bring consequential savings.</p></speech>

However, we are finding that in the more complex cases in which people need to be cared at home for up to seven hours a day, the ceiling of &euro;50,000 does not cover them.  Once again, families are making the calculation and deciding that they would be better off in moving their relative into a residential care setting.</p> <p>Upping the ceiling would allow people to access more complex and acute care at home.</p></speech>

I was that soldier once and it had a very adverse impact.  If one gets only one or two hours of work every day, amounting to 16 hours over the course of a week, which is two day's work, how can that be modelled?  If somebody earns minimum wage and works eight or six hours over a week, it probably equates to a day's wages.  Somebody doing part-time teaching, as I was, probably earns three times the industrial hourly wage.  How can we ensure creating an allowance for an hour does not adversely impact people on low wages?  People earning high wages can also work part-time hours.</p></speech>

In discussions, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection raised questions about this.  Our main concern is that people who might be able to access part-time work, move on to full-time work and, eventually, off the welfare system, are hitting a welfare trap not just because the existing system is too restrictive in terms of the number of days worked, but because it has been made more restrictive, particularly in the budget before last.  The Minister raised a concern that there is a danger that employers would take advantage of the situation by employing people for an hour per day or very short lengths of time, leaving the Government to make up the difference.  This is largely the situation, and people are often forced outside the regular economy, to take up work under the counter, so to speak, or forced out of work completely.</p><p>  To make this work, we would need stronger regulation of the zero-hours contracts and short-term work, which a number of Ministers have raised over recent years.  We would need to ensure the existing income limits are paralleled with a change in the number of hours.  We have this in a separate presentation which we can send to the committee.  The reality of modern working, particularly in the service economy, is that more people are working a few hours scattered over a full week.</p></speech>

We are particularly concerned about vulnerable young people who leave school early and for whom there is not much available.  We deal with the effects of it when they become people of working age with low incomes or no employment.  The Department of Social Protection is introducing an internship scheme for those particularly disadvantaged young people.  While we support it in theory, one of the issues with internship schemes is that people on low incomes find it more difficult to take those up and benefit from them.</p><p>  We want young people under 26 years to have the back-to-education allowance paid at the rate of &euro;188 per week to meet the cost of education, because it has been taken away.  Such a measure would support young people financially, particularly those who are very disadvantaged, because money is a major barrier.  People with a very low literacy level, below FETAC level 3, might not have many opportunities to improve their literacy in an intensive way so they can move on to FETAC level 4.

One of the difficulties my colleagues in the field talk about is the people at or below FETAC level 3.  A certain degree of flexibility is required for this client group because their first experience of education was not positive and dealing with the structure of the system is very difficult for them.

Even an overpayment of &euro;30,000 could be reconciled with a payment of &euro;10 to &euro;20 per week.  The proposal indicates that this does not seem to be the experience.  Is Ms O'Sullivan saying the Department tries to get back the greatest portion of the money in the shortest period of time and does not consider people's day-to-day living experiences?</p></speech>

We are having issues and concerns around the appeals process within recovery, the lack of transparency, and the fact that the information does not formally state that if an overpayment arises, one has a right to appeal.  It states that one can report that the amount is incorrect but does not clearly leave a window open-----</p></speech>

The legislation is very clear and it is a forensic examination.  The error is on one side of the table or another.</p> <p>It is either that the person has not provided sufficient information for whatever reason - there might be a change in family circumstances, somebody has returned to work and the overpayment has been created - or else the person has provided every reasonable piece of information that was required and the mistake was made by the Department.  If it can be proved that the error was on the part of the Department, the sum, regardless of the amount, is eliminated.</p></speech>

A person is not able to challenge the amount up to that 15% whereby the Department can take back the money.  It is unknown how the Department weighs a person's other expenses, which might be a debt or they might have a large family.  How are general living expenses taken into consideration by the Department?  There are also many cases at present which date back ten or 20 years, so having that evidence would be great-----</p></speech>

I will start with the pre-budget document from Social Justice Ireland.  There has been debate for some time about refundable tax credits.  It is included in Social Justice Ireland's proposal to deal with what it generally calls the working poor.  That is an accurate description of a cohort of people in Ireland today.  The proposal would cost approximately &euro;140 million.  Will Ms Murphy explain how these tax credits would work in practice and who would benefit from this system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.170" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Michelle Murphy" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014071600007#F01100"><p>We published a study on this in 2010, and I am sure some of the members are familiar with it.  The basis of it is that some people earn an income that is not high enough for them to gain the full value of their tax credits.  The proposal is to make the two main tax credits refundable.  The burden would not be on the employer as they would be refunded to the person from the Revenue Commissioners.  It would benefit approximately 113,000 individuals in the State.  The average repayment is between &euro;46 and &euro;50 per week, so it is approximately &euro;1,000 per year.  This is all detailed in the report, which is on our website.</p><p>  It would make the tax system equitable, in that everybody would be treated in the same manner and everybody would get the full value of their tax credits.  The high earners get the full value of their tax credits.  The reality is that 16% of people living in poverty have a job and they clearly are not getting the full value of their tax credits.  For a very small sum of money, &euro;140 million per annum, it would make a huge difference to the livelihoods of approximately 113,000 people.  It would also be easy to implement, because it would not be necessary to create a new administrative process.  The employer would not have to do anything.  The State would do it.</p></speech>

However, taking the refund into account, it provides an extra incentive to work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.174" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Michelle Murphy" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014071600007#F01500"><p>Yes, it incentivises employment over welfare because it would widen the gap between pay and welfare rates.  It also makes our tax and welfare system more appropriate to the 21st century.  It benefits people on low incomes and makes our tax system fairer and more equitable.  It also takes into consideration that many precarious forms of employment are on very low pay and people often do not have a choice whether to take these jobs, so at least everybody is treated fairly by the tax system under this proposal.</p><p>  If this proposal were implemented, any further tax changes to be implemented in terms of income tax could be done through the tax credit system so that everybody would benefit in the same way, as opposed to changing bands and rates in which everybody does not benefit in the same way.  The current discussion about changing the higher rate, for example, would result in the gain going to the highest earners.  It does not go to those on low incomes.  Even changing the standard rate band would only benefit those people who are at that rate and above it, that is, earning over &euro;32,800 per year.  There is no benefit to people earning less than that, and there is a huge cohort of people in the country who earn less than that.  Implementing refundable tax credits would benefit those on very low incomes and it would also reform the tax system so that any future changes in income tax could be done through the tax credit system.</p></speech>

Ms Murphy has identified one avenue for dealing with that.  Another issue is the area of secondary benefits.  The rent supplement, in particular, appears to be the main barrier.  Holding on to that if one gets work is a problem.  The medical card is another issue.  When one adds them all up, one would have to be earning a very good salary for it to be worthwhile.</p></speech>

The majority of people who are on the live register are not entitled to rent supplement and those secondary benefits.  In the case of the people who are, especially people with families, we must examine a way of tapering those benefits so that one tapers their withdrawal in terms of the income level.  It is a huge cost to a person if they take up a low-paying job and all of those benefits are withdrawn.  One must think of the other costs they have.  It is not just their earnings but the other people who are dependent on them.  Obviously, a more tapered withdrawal system would be of huge benefit.  There is progress now in terms of the housing assistance payment and changes to the rent supplement system so it is to be hoped we should see some progress in that regard and that should make a difference as well.</p></speech>

Will he give his view on the level of broadband provision in rural areas in general?  He says what is required is an investment strategy to deliver fibre-based broadband to the last 500,000 rural homes.  Is that the number of homes in Ireland that do not have fibre-optic broadband at present?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.178" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Claffey" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014071600007#F01900"><p>That is our estimate, but we have found out in recent weeks that the figure could be significantly higher.  Broadband service in some areas is 1 Mb and 2 Mb, and in some cases it is non-existent.  If fibre-optic broadband was delivered, it would be of huge benefit not only to the quality of life for residents in rural areas but also in terms of investment and business.  If broadband was brought up to the level that exists in major towns and cities, there could be the creation of 10,000 jobs through the creative economy.  It would encourage people to work from home and to run online businesses.</p></speech>

However, the Government has various programmes for rolling out broadband in rural areas.  Is Mr. Claffey saying that is not making an impact and is not making inroads into that deficit?</p></speech>

There is a target set down for the end of 2016 that every home in the country will have fibre-optic broadband.  We would encourage the Government to meet this deadline under whatever circumstances.  This will drive the rural economy, which has been in decline in recent years.</p></speech>

We regularly hear from the Government that the priority is to allow people to stay in their home for as long as possible due to the cost of long-stay nursing home facilities and so forth and the cost of having people in acute hospitals.  The experience on the ground appears to be quite different, certainly from my point of view as a practising politician.  One is often contacted by families who wish to keep a loved one at home, but they face barrier after barrier.  They find it difficult to get sufficient support from the State through the HSE to keep the person at home.  What is the practical experience of the members of HCCI at present in dealing with that issue?  What are the main changes Mr. Harty would make?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.182" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr.Michael Harty" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014071600007#F02300"><p>There is no doubt that it is an issue.  We encounter people on a daily basis who are in need of care.  They might be in hospital and need to be discharged.  What is happening is that they are being encouraged to apply for the fair deal scheme and, as an afterthought, perhaps for a home care package.</p> <p>In fact, one of my members told me a story recently about a 90 year old aunt of theirs in Wexford.  She had lived by herself for many years but had to go into hospital for an operation and was encouraged to apply for the fair deal scheme.  She said that she preferred to continue living at home and that she wanted to apply for the home care package scheme.  None the less, she was granted access to the fair deal scheme at a cost of some &euro;1,000 a week to the State whereas her first preference was home care, three or four hours a day, which would have cost &euro;200 to &euro;250 per week.  That lady is at present in residential care.</p><p> We have to be cognisant of the fact we are still living in difficult economic times and we have to spend our money more wisely.  One of the best ways of spending money wisely is by promoting client choice.  Who better to decide how money should be spent than the patients themselves?</p></speech>

I accept some people are higher dependency than others and perhaps, eventually, have to be in a long-stay facility.  Has Mr. Harty the numbers to back up what he is saying?</p></speech>

Roughly, it is between &euro;800 and &euro;1,000 a week for residential care, depending on location in the country, whereas, for a person of medium or low dependency, the cost of home care would be between &euro;200 and &euro;300 per week.  It is over double the cost but, not only that, people generally do not want to be in residential care.  It is rare in politics that politicians give people what they want and save money at the same time, but that is the case with home care.</p></speech>

People have a statutory right to residential care through the fair deal nursing home scheme but they do not have a right to home care.  What we have been calling for is regulation of standards in the sector underpinned by legislation to give people a statutory right to home care.  Obviously, given the times we are living in, it is something the Department of Finance does not want to look at.  That is certainly a major part of the problem.  It is a very short-sighted view.  By giving people a right to home care, we will save more money in the long term.</p></speech>

I believe we would all agree in principle with that.  The question is how it would work in practice and to what extent it would slow down and make more bureaucratic the decision-making process.  Ultimately, the Government and the Legislature have to make decisions.  How would this poverty proofing work in practice?  How much work would have to go into proofing individual budgetary decisions in the social welfare area, for example?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.189" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robin Hanan" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014071600008#G00700"><p>There are different levels of poverty proofing.  When the poverty proofing system was introduced first in the national anti-poverty strategy in 1997, there was originally very tight co-ordination by the Department of the Taoiseach to ensure all Government memoranda and most of the main items in the budget, through what was then a single Department of Finance, included statements on their impact.  The level of assessment depended on the nature of the proposal.  Therefore, a proposal for the introduction of a new scheme included a certain amount of subjective data and a certain amount of economic modelling.  At the moment, the Department of Social Protection is rolling out a new supplementary social impact assessment, using the SWITCH model, and some of that information will be used<i>post hoc</i>to look at the impact of tax and welfare decisions in the round in the budget.  I am sure the committee is aware of this as the Department will have made presentations to it about the impact.<br />There are a number of problems with this, however.  First, the new model only looks at the overall impact of the entire budget and does not look at the contribution of different elements.  Second, where it identifies groups that are particularly disadvantaged, there is no feedback or no mention in the next budget of what compensatory measures will be taken to take that into account.  Last year and the year before, for example, as one would expect, young unemployed people and lone parents were identified in this regard.<br />The model that was originally developed in Ireland in the 1990s has been held up as a model across Europe, and effective poverty proofing can include its combination of the objective and the subjective.  However, the objective data is relatively easily available now through mechanisms such as the SWITCH model, economic modelling and the assessment of taxation.  We are told some of this is already happening in terms of dialogue between different Departments, but none of this is part of the public or political debate about the introduction of new measures, changes to measures and so on.  While we would not argue that a Minister for Finance should be required by law simply not to introduce a measure which might have an impact on poverty, we would say that this information should be out there very clearly as part of the public debate around the budget in order that compensatory measures can be taken.<br />The way the scheme was originally designed was to identify the impact, positive or negative, of particular measures on people experiencing poverty.  With a change in social welfare entitlement, it is relatively easy to assess in advance in the broad sense what the impact of that is likely to be and also to look at compensatory measures.  If there are environmental cases for introducing a particular type of utilities charge, we need to look at what are the compensating measures in the tax or welfare systems to ensure it does not have an impact on poverty.  To take just one example, we are talking about information but we are also talking about using that information as part of the public debate.  As I said, in the past we have had quite a strong data collection system around poverty proofing and the national anti-poverty strategy, but none of that came out in the political debate, in the public debate or in practical policy-making.  It became a box-ticking exercise or simply a matter of monitoring changes when it was already too late.</p></speech>

With regard to Ms Fahy's work with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, what role does personal debt play in the whole situation?  Obviously, many people who rely on support from the St. Vincent de Paul are experiencing unemployment and are in very low income households, but not all I suspect, and many would have very high mortgages, credit union loans, credit cards and so forth.  To what extent is Ms Fahy meeting people who, because of their determination to pay the mortgage and pay other forms of debt, find they simply have no money to pay the energy bills, groceries and so on?</p><p>  On the issue of the social welfare appeals office, Ms O'Sullivan highlighted the very high number of appeals, which reached 53,000 live cases last year, the highest since the office was founded in 1990.  She said the success rate on appeal, at 55%, was an indicator of poor standards of decision-making in the first instance.  I did not realise the success rate was that high in the social welfare appeals office.  Surely having such a high rate of success through appeals is providing an incentive to people who get refused at the first hurdle to appeal, and this is just clogging up the system.</p></speech>

People may prioritise loans from, for example, moneylenders over and above paying for their food and utilities, and they will come to us for help with those.  It often does not emerge until after a few visits, having looked at a person's income and outgoings, that we find there is a grey area, which is often the debt people are trying to pay off.  Our colleagues in the Vincentian Partnership have found that the majority of people on a social welfare payment and many of those in low-paid work do not have enough income for a minimum essential standard of living, so there is a gap between the money they are taking in and what they need.  Again, that results in debt.</p><p>  Those who would traditionally never have expected to go to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for help are often those who have lost businesses or lost employment and who have debt left over as part of that.  People really do want to keep a roof over their heads.</p> <p>That would often be their main concern.</p><p> One of the issues that arises in respect of, for example, utility debt is where people do not have a say - in terms of the accommodation in which they live - in using prepay meters in order to pay off their debts by &euro;2, &euro;3 or &euro;10 per week.  Individuals are almost being coerced into taking on repayment plans for energy debt which lead to them not having enough money to manage the remainder of their household expenses.  Again, such plans can fall apart, the utility companies will not be paid and people's energy supplies will be placed at risk.  As a result, they end up coming to us for assistance.  Debt is one of those issues we need to consider addressing in a more comprehensive fashion.</p></speech>

It is especially so when one considers the long delays that exist within the process.  Those 55% of appellants were entitled to payments prior to entering the appeals process but they were obliged to wait six to nine months to have them restored.  Some individuals were obliged to wait even longer and this reflects what is stated in both the annual report and parliamentary questions with regard to the average processing time.  Obviously, some people are obliged to wait a lot longer for their appeals to be heard in circumstances where they are entitled to payment in the first instance.  It comes down to the initial decision made by the deciding officer, a poor standard of decision making and the lack of compulsory accredited training for front-line staff, deciding officers and designated staff within the Department and its offices.  When the law changes and new payment criteria are introduced as a result - the habitual residence condition is one example in this regard - a training course will eventually be developed but, again, this is voluntary.  This means that members of staff make the decision as to whether they want to learn how new criteria are going to affect people's payments.  They are not obliged to attend such training course.  As a result, the level of decision making is highly inconsistent and this is reflected by the figures contained in the annual report.</p></speech>

They contain a wealth of information and statistics and are presented in a very understandable fashion.</p><p>  Irish Rural Link's submission contains a number of interesting proposals.  I wish to focus, however, on the issue of a stimulus for villages and towns.  The submission refers to the closure of Garda stations, post offices and banks.

We are targeting towns on which the economic crisis has had the greatest impact by trying to stimulate residents to come up with ideas and seeing if these can be translated to national level.  In certain towns we have studied, there have been huge increases in employment in, for example, the creative economy.  We are of the view that it is necessary to discover the kind of skills that are available in a particular area and the demand that exists there.  By doing this, it would be possible to target individual towns and villages in the context of driving forward or stimulating that economy.</p></speech>

The need for such a Minister of State was highlighted in the CEDRA report.

For many elderly people, their telephones represent a lifeline to their family and friends.  We held two seminars on rural isolation this year, one in Donegal and the other in Ennis, and this issue was raised numerous times.  As stated earlier, it links to the issue of home security, Garda stations and the fact the elderly individuals' telephones are connected to security systems.  What was done last year has not only affected these people's ability to communicate with their families, it has also had an impact on their sense of security within their homes.  They cannot connect and do not feel safe as a result.  In addition, it is no longer possible for them to have their security systems in place.</p></speech>

The elderly individual in question was affected by the cut to the telephone allowance but has accessed a 24-7 alarm service from the FOLD Ireland housing association.  I understand FOLD Ireland has written to all of its customers in the Twenty-six Counties to indicate that while up to now it believed the service to be VAT exempt, this is actually not the case.  As a result, the cost of providing the service is going to increase by 21%.  Should services of this nature, which are made available to elderly and vulnerable people in rural areas, be exempted from VAT?</p></speech>

The suggestion is made that the private sector could deliver home-care packages for 30% less than the public sector.

We have no problem with direct State provision of care by the HSE.  We are of the view that this is important but we also believe that the funding in respect of it - at present, approximately 70% of the total amount available - should not be at the level it is now.  We are of the view that any other funding which is available should be allocated in respect of open, transparent and accountable procurement services.  In the main, I refer here to the section 39 funds that are allocated to home help organisations.  Many internal audits carried out by the HSE have highlighted some serious inefficiencies and poor management within those organisations.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, there is no regulation whatsoever within the home care sector.  We are regulated from the point of view that in the context of any work we do on behalf of the HSE through the home-care package scheme, we must adhere to internal HSE standards.  Our members also have their own internal standards.  Before any organisation becomes a member of the HCCI, it must undergo an independent audit by an independent third party in order to ensure it reaches those standards.  One of the big issues within the sector is the fact that there is no regulation.</p></speech>

We are saying not that the work should be given to private organisations but that it should be given to organisations that are efficient and fully accountable and so on.  It is important we remain conscious of how home help organisations grew up, with many having been set up by religious orders, local community groups and the forerunner to the HSE in the 1970s.</p></speech>

The courts have rightly enforced on the HSE that it end the exploitation of its home care workers through the use of zero-hour contracts, which followed on from a successful campaign by SIPTU in that regard.  In my view, HSE home care workers are no longer being exploited.  Are the 6,000 Home and Community Care Ireland, HCCI, staff still being exploited through the use of zero-hour contracts in an effort to keep down costs or has the company ceased that practice?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.211" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Harty" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014071600010#J00300"><p>That is an interesting point.  First, I should clarify that the court decision was in relation only to HSE directly employed home help staff and not home help staff employed by section 39 agencies, who do not have guaranteed hours.  The HCCI is in favour of moving away from these so-called zero-hour contracts.  The biggest issue we face going forward is the sourcing of quality home care workers.  As evident from our demographics, demand in the sector is going one way.  Our concern is from where in the future we will get suitably qualified carers to meet this demand.</p><p>  It is easy for the HSE, as the provider of funding, to guarantee hours to its workers.  The problem with zero-hour contracts is one of funding and the structure of that funding.  With more visibility around the care we are being asked to provide and more access to funds we could also move in that direction.  In comparing private providers with the HSE one is comparing apples with oranges.  The HSE can reserve hours for its staff to ensure that they are doing their seven to ten hours and so on.  We cannot do that.</p></speech>

However, they are exploitative to workers.  That is the reason the High Court ruled against the HSE.  This is wrong.  I welcome that Mr. Harty has acknowledged that he would like to move away from that practice.  However, in terms of his suggestions to the committee in regard to how savings can be made, in my view it is in the area of zero-hour contracts that savings could be made.</p></speech>

However, zero-hour contracts are also used by section 39 funded home help organisations.  There is a general perception that private providers pay low wages.  Private providers tend to structure wages based on the complexity of the cases in respect of which they provide care.  In some cases, private providers pay up to &euro;16 per hour.</p></speech>

The European Anti-Poverty Network Ireland proposal sets out short and long-term objectives.  We see it as being really important that this year's budget, as we come out of recession, lays out not only what needs to be done next year but a longer term programme for building a more social inclusive society.  In this regard, we are proposing a five-year transition towards a minimum income level, namely, the lowest level of non-contributory welfare payments which would bring everyone within that minimum essential standard of living.  Of course, this has implications for all other benefits because to maintain that standard without increasing poverty traps - and rid ourselves of current poverty traps - one needs to look at ways through which other more conditional benefits are retained.  We spoke earlier about the rent supplement scheme and the fact that its withdrawal on a progressive basis rather than slowly as people move back into work and so on is leading to the creation of poverty traps.  The sudden withdrawal of rent supplement is a serious disincentive to people returning to work.</p><p>  In regard to the term "minimum income" as part of debates across Europe on how to build a social element into the two pack, six pack and fiscal regulations to which the chairman referred earlier, we are trying to find a common basis of what is required to live a dignified life in any country across Europe.  In terms of the figure suggested for the first year, we see this as being a first step as part of a five-year programme.</p></speech>

Reference was made in the presentation to water poverty and the introduction next year of water charges disproportionately hitting low income groups.  Reference was also made to the introduction of measures to protect low income households from water poverty.  In Ms Fahy's view, at what point should the cut-off be set and how would the society's proposal in this regard be rolled out?</p></speech>

We have been calling for publication of the ESRI report on affordability and consumption.  Without information on how much a household is likely to consume and its impact on affordability it is hard for us suggest what people earning under a particular income or families of a particular size should pay.  We cannot put a figure on that.  What we are asking for is more information on the consumption and affordability issue.  The figures floating around in terms of what the Government needs to take in by way of water charges, what Irish Water needs to invest in infrastructure and what it is proposed households will pay do not appear to add up.  This leads us to believe water charges will increase significantly over the next couple of years, which again will impact hugely on people on low incomes.</p><p>  We welcome the reference in the statement of Government priorities to the household benefits package being used to compensate some households.  We are also seeking compensation for the many other households on the same level of income who will not benefit from that. </p></speech>

The shadow report is based on a process of engagement and consultation with civil society across the country.  It is hoped that the first draft of the report will be available in the next few weeks, with the final report compiled and sent to the relevant committee by the end of September.  As I understand it, 1 October is the official deadline.  While a date for the final examination has not been set it will most likely take place in May 2015.</p><p>  On equality budgeting, FLAC favours a human rights approach to budgeting.</p> <p>We are a human rights organisation seeking access to justice for all.  Equality is definitely part of this.  We held an event last year in conjunction with the equality budgeting campaign so many budgeting elements overlap in these concepts.  We believe the framework of human rights law already exists and only needs to be used and implemented in the budgetary process.  The process needs to be more open, transparent and participative.  We feel impact assessments are necessary to ensure better decisions are made and see that a particular group in society is not affected disproportionately by budget cuts.  We hope all Departments will carry out social impact assessments, as the Department of Social Protection currently does.  Unfortunately the Department of Social Protection does this after the budget, more as a statement than as a process.</p></speech>

Refundable tax credits present a reverse option because they mean less income for the State from tax.  Have the criteria for refundable tax credits that were published by the witnesses some years ago changed?  Do the witnesses still believe they should apply only to people over 23 years of age?

We will look at new data in terms of the number of people at work and then re-examine the criteria.  The tax gap was highlighted and if we were a low tax economy, as defined by EUROSTAT an extra &euro;4.7 billion to &euro;5 billion extra per year could be reaped.  On the refundable tax credit proposal, a research and development, R&amp;D, tax credit with a payable element is open to corporations at the moment.  If corporations do not pay enough corporation tax they get a cash refund from the State and, at present, this accounts for 42%, or &euro;112 million, of the total cost of the R&amp;D tax credit.  We are making cash payments to companies that cannot claim their full credit but we are not providing refunds to very low income workers.</p></speech>

An earnings disregard was put in place to allow people to earn a certain amount from employment and keep a certain amount of the one-parent family payment but this has been eroded.  It will be more difficult for lone-parents who have made the move from social welfare payments to employment because their incomes are falling every year due to the changes.</p></speech>

We tabled a parliamentary question on this last year to see what happens when a person loses the one-parent family payment.  At the start of this month around 5,000 lone parents lost the one-parent family payment because of the age of their youngest child. A lone parent in employment earning net &euro;200 per week has lost &euro;70 per week because of the change.  The worst part is a person who earns a low income from employment will be worse off than a person who earns a bit more.  The sum of &euro;70 per week is not insignificant and would probably cover a part-time child care place.  These changes undermine the Government's priority of supporting people.</p></speech>

This minimum effective rate would take into account the various loopholes and write-offs companies can use.  There is a variety of reports with a variety of figures.  One will have a certain lobby group claiming it pays a certain proportion of tax.  We have European Commission and OECD investigations into this issue, as well as some modelling by us.  We argue that an effective rate of 6% would bring in up to &euro;1 billion.  What really needs to be done is the creation of an evidential base by the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.  One could then look at the rates paid and the benefits the companies were getting through various loopholes which are being examined in the BEPS, base erosion and profit shifting, process.  One can also look at the other benefits these companies get through having an educated workforce and infrastructural provision through office blocks from NAMA at knock-down rates.  We are providing a lot for these companies.</p><p>  Those on the lowest incomes have actually lost the most throughout the crisis.  Our position has always been that those who benefit most from our economic system should contribute the most.  A minimum effective rate of 6% does not seem to be untoward that the corporate sector would be expected to pay.</p></speech>

In Scotland, when the budget is being drafted, alongside it is the equality impact assessment which is publicly debated in its advisory grouping dedicated to equality budgeting in the Scottish Parliament.  It is such a closed process here that any step toward opening it up would be very welcome.</p></speech>

Our annual report shows 27,500 people accessed our services last year.  Many of these were complex legal queries, not just about family law issues but also about debt and family law and social protection and family law.  They are putting undue pressure on people and leading to mental illness and financial hardship.</p><p>  Our submission looks at the budgetary process and how it could be improved.

The main categories are food and energy costs.  I will cite two priorities, the first of which is tackling the housing crisis.  It is unacceptable that families must stay in hotels.  Our members are exercised about this problem and it is difficult to know how to help a homeless family being housed in a hotel for an extended period.  There has been a failure to provide social housing; affordability problems are arising in the private rented sector, while the poor quality of housing is an issue, in that a house can be difficult to heat, leading to greater energy bills and more pressure on people.  In a broad sense, the housing issue needs to be tackled.</p><p>  There have been extra charges and an increase in the cost of living for people in work and those in receipt of social welfare payments, but this fact has not been reflected in social welfare payments and secondary benefits.  Low paid work is taxed more than it ever was.</p></speech>

Many people are in work that is more insecure, lasts for fewer hours and affords them less protection from unemployment.  Among our members, there has been a crunch due to service cuts across the board, including in education, and reduced incomes, which affects what people can buy.</p><p>  It is difficult to choose just two priorities among the complex of measures that need to be taken, but one is a five year programme to increase the minimum social welfare payment to meet the minimum essential living standards in order that people can live with dignity.  This would be linked with a tapered withdrawal of secondary benefits as people return to work, thereby removing some poverty and employment traps.  The availability of social housing is well recognised in public debate as being a crisis issue.  However, there has been no investment to provide the answers.</p></speech>

Of the two priorities we want to see included in the budget, one is an end to the ring-fencing of funds for one form of care over another, as this has created an artificial demand for residential care.  Let us assess people and allow them to decide whether the money should be spent on home care or residential care.  We would also like to see an end to section 39 funding in the home care sector.

Various internal HSE audit reports have shown considerable wastage in that regard.  It is a bad way of commissioning home care services.  They should be commissioned in a more transparent and accountable manner so as to ensure the companies providing the best service in the most efficient manner are getting the funds with a view to meeting the ever increasing demand for home care services.</p></speech>

The social infrastructure has also been eroded across the country.</p><p>  My first recommendation is to implement our two proposals on social housing which are contained in our budget choices document.  My second recommendation is to implement a minimum effective corporation tax rate of 6%.</p></speech>

Between 2006 and 2011, unemployment levels in rural areas increased by 192% compared with a figure of 114% in urban areas.  At 10%, people in these areas are also twice at risk of poverty compared with their urban counterparts.  Rural areas have been under a major burden in the past five years owing to increased carbon taxes and so on.  According to a study we conducted with the Vincentian Partnership, people in rural areas are spending &euro;100 more per week just to live.</p></speech>

In terms of two priorities for the budget, we would like to see the establishment of a committee focused on job creation in rural areas, regional demands and the skills available in each region, with a view to driving local economies.  To turn two into one, the coverage of fibre broadband in such areas should be extended.</p><p>  A second priority is education.  The cost of education for third level students from rural areas should be analysed, particularly the issue of affordability for low income families.  According to a credit union survey, one in four students has taken out a loan to attend college.</p></speech>

To a certain extent, there is a reasonable level of transport infrastructure, thanks to the provision of improved roads; therefore, there is access to the areas in question.  However, we need to ensure financial systems are in place if people are to be helped in creating businesses.  Broadband is also necessary, if they are to develop.  As we know, Internet sales have been a major part of most companies' business.  There is considerable potential in the creative economy.

It is often forgotten that there is an increasing number of repossessions of local authority housing.  Without tackling the housing issue it will be extremely difficult to tackle problems such as unemployment and so on.  How can someone get a job if he or she does not have appropriate accommodation?  For those who do manage to hang onto their tenancy the problem is the quality of the housing.  Another problem we see is landlords who are not keen on taking tenants on rent supplement when there are many other people with a deposit and first and second month&rsquo;s rent in their hand.  Incentives could be put in place for landlords in the private rental sector to take those more vulnerable tenants and bring the accommodation up to minimum standards of energy efficiency.</p></speech>

While I agree with much of it, I am concerned that SJI includes the &euro;500 million to be garnered from water charges in its budget arithmetic.  This will be very controversial, not just for SJI but for many as they frame their pre-budget submissions.  It may not surprise the witnesses to hear that I am completely against water charges.  To those concerned with human rights budgeting and so on, access to water is the most basic human right.  To charge for it and make it accessible only to those who can afford to pay infringes that right.  I am a little surprised that SJI includes it in its budget arithmetic and does not seek to raise revenue elsewhere because it is regressive.  I would like to hear comments on that point. </p></speech>

We included it because the Government will include it in its budget arithmetic.  We also included the carry-over of taxation.  The expenditure carry over was not available when we were compiling this document.  We made a very detailed submission approximately two years ago when water charges were being discussed, in this very room, on the number of litres that should be free to different households.  The ESRI paper has not yet been published.  We are very unsure of how this charge will work.  One could add in the extra &euro;500 million as coming from a minimum effective rate of corporate tax.  Government, however, asks everybody to submit proposals in light of the budgetary deficit target it has to meet and of what it will include and exclude.  That is why we included the water charges in our costings.  We did it also to show that a budget adjustment of &euro;2 billion will not be needed.  There could be one of zero, as we have outlined.</p></speech>

It could be a feature of next year too, if people make submissions on the right to accessible and clean water.  That is definitely a human right.  We do not focus only on that within our budget.  We take a wider view of all economic, social and cultural rights.  It is a double burden, especially if a person relies on the State for his or her income.  We ask that there be a minimum core of the right to health, housing and education.  That is the main component.</p></speech>

With all due respect to everybody in the room, the fiscal compact will put paid to any economic, social and cultural rights if there are binding expenditure ceilings and taxation cannot be raised above a certain level, and any extra tax revenue has to be used to pay the debt.

If there was a line one could not cross that prevented water being used to generate revenue because people must have it, governments would have to find the money elsewhere, through corporate tax, financial transaction tax or tax on high incomes.  Perhaps SJI does not wish to state its position on this but does it think access to water is a human right that should be free of charge?</p></speech>

We are not against the imposition of water charges but we are against charges on the basic supply of water and the level should be set reasonably high, taking into account all the problems of building design, families and so on.  It must be structured in a progressive way, which the current water tax proposals are not.  We are quite happy with the principle of charging for excessive use of water but the principle of the right to a basic supply of water and to other utilities, which many of our members in other European countries have battled for, is also a very important human right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-16a.309" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014071600014#N01500"><p>Even when these allowances are given initially they tend to disappear.  That has been the experience.</p> <p>There is a big danger of opening the door to a punitive tax.</p><p> I shall ask three or four questions and hope to get one reply from each of the relevant people.  A minimum effective corporate tax rate is something that we have championed quite significantly, and figures of 6% and 9% have been put forward.  I would like to hear comments and the amounts sought by the witnesses.  The rate is a big area of dispute; 6% has been proposed.  Judging by my calculations on the basic figures provided by the Revenue Commissioners, out of a total of &euro;70 billion, the generation of &euro;4 billion equates to a rate of 6%.  Therefore, a minimum effective rate would not raise revenue unless it is increased to at least 9%, or as high as 12%.  What figures were used to calculate a 6% rate?  </p><p> I am glad every organisation has underlined the importance of housing, but there was signification variation in their submissions on housing.  How much do they think the extra investment should be?  Social Justice Ireland suggested &euro;250 million to create approximately 2,500 houses, Threshold suggested &euro;1 billion to create 10,000 houses, and Focus Ireland suggested &euro;500 million to create 5,000 houses.  I think we need the higher figure just to begin to make a dent in this issue.  I would like to hear comments from the groups on the matter.</p><p> Some of the housing groups are pushing for REITs, or real estate investment trusts, to increase investment in housing.  I fundamentally disagree with a REIT because it would incentivise speculation in property again.  It would not incentivise investment in new housing but in the purchase of existing buildings.</p></speech>

However, I ask the witnesses to make some quick comments on housing.</p><p>  The next topic is rural links.  Do the witnesses think planning issues, particularly planning permission for multiple discount stores, have an impact on small towns and villages?  D&uacute;n Laoghaire is on the edge of Dublin but it has too many large supermarkets and discount stores, which have drained the life out of the town and village centre and thus affected small businesses.  Do the witnesses think large multiples and discount stores threaten village and rural life?</p></speech>

It has also had a massive impact on small and medium-sized businesses, with an 81% closure rate.  In contrast, jobs are created and life has been made easier for people living in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  We cannot disagree with an investment that will create jobs, as we have a high rate of unemployment.  As we said, jobs are our biggest focus.</p></speech>

I am not that long out of college and I studied this situation as part of my thesis.

Assuming the aggregate effective rate is 6%, for example, that means one has to look at the spread of aggregate rates from 0% to 3%, 3% to 6%, 6% to 9% and 9% to 12%.  We based our calculations on those rates and we looked at issues such as reductions in management, expenditure, capital allowance and all of these other things that companies claim before they pay their tax, and we came up with the figure of &euro;1 billion.</p><p>  In terms of social housing, we gave a figure of &euro;250 million, which is the tip of the iceberg.  We would also like to see our other proposal implemented.  I refer to an agency taking control of the local authority housing stock and using it as collateral to borrow off the books in order to raise the billions of euro required to address the social housing crisis.</p></speech>

Some people have talked about it in positive terms while others are concerned about whether it will work, given that landlords seem to be moving away from rent support systems.</p></speech>

We sought a longer-term plan because we want to tackle the housing waiting list and ensure that people on very low incomes, plus the bottom 30% of earners, can access housing because their income may not be sufficient to purchase a home.  These people need to have to have something a bit better than the private rental sector and everything that goes with it.</p><p>  We are broadly in favour of the introduction of HAP because it is better than rent supplement in terms of allowing people to take up employment while not losing everything straight away in terms of housing support.  As with rent supplement, we are concerned that landlords will not necessarily take on HAP tenants.  Plus, HAP does not do anything to increase the State's housing stock, which is the big issue.  The problem is that the building of social housing has stopped and we must now deal with the results.  The private sector has a role to play in the provision of housing to low-income households, but we cannot rely on it because the sector has completely failed.  These are our concerns.</p></speech>

Recently in the Seanad we found that out of the first 5,000 houses offered by NAMA to local authorities, only 1,000 were taken up.  It seems amazing that four fifths of housing that exists has not been taken.  When the then Minister of State with responsibility for this area, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, was in the Department, there was an amazingly slow turnover of local authority houses - so much so that some of them were vandalised - but money was voted and provided to speed up the process.  Do the witnesses wish to make observations on those two aspects of the housing scene?</p></speech>

It is not enough to house people in accommodation that might not be appropriate, because it means one is only kicking the can down the road.  I do not know enough about the NAMA issue to respond, but the take-up figure is very low.  We need to look at increasing the State's stock in order to tackle the 90,000 households on the waiting list.</p></speech>

It will cost the best part of &euro;100 million for the two schemes - the over-70s, regardless of income, and children under six, regardless of their families' income.  That means that the rich get richer, yet we still give them medical cards.  What would the witnesses have done with &euro;100 million?  I am an endangered species in the Seanad because when I argued for poverty alleviation it did not have an impact on the vote.</p></speech>

Given the pressures on our health services at the moment, I do not see how either children under six or the over-70s could be provided with such cards within the health service budget.  With that &euro;100 million, it would be possible to introduce refundable tax credits, which would benefit 113,000 low-income workers.</p><p> The chapter on housing in our socioeconomic review deals with NAMA and social housing.  Approximately 1,900 properties have been deemed suitable.  That is the issue.  Those properties have to be evaluated and deemed suitable for social housing.  Almost 300 more are being evaluated.  Contracts have been signed on some and transactions are being completed.  It is a time-consuming process.  It is not that housing associations do not want to take up these properties, but they have to be evaluated and deemed suitable.  It is then necessary to go through the process of signing a contract, completing the transaction and preparing the unit for release.</p></speech>

We tried to establish the price of water and the generous free allowance.  There should be some consumer representation, and some people wanted the local authorities that had been performing that job up to now just to have representation.</p><p>  I believe the meters will cost &euro;600 million.  In the UK, only a third to 40% of premises are metered.  Why do we need meters if we know some people's consumption will be tiny, with only one person living in the house?  Also, the fact that 40% of treated water goes to waste was being attributed to the consumers rather than to the engineers.  I believe it was Ben Dunne who said that a person who owned a shop from which 40% of the stock was disappearing would not blame the customers but would investigate what was happening.</p><p>  Many unsatisfactory things have happened with regard to water.  We have heard a projected charge of &euro;240 per household.  Is that the number Ms Fahy is working on?  We did not do it well, and that is the collective responsibility of everybody.  The principle Dr. Hannon mentioned is sound, but we went all around the houses to do it.  What would Ms Fahy recommend at this late stage?  The Commission for Energy Regulation is looking at it.  I do not know if anybody has made submissions.  We still do not know what we will be putting before the public.  What would the witnesses recommend?</p></speech>

The ESRI report on affordability has not been published, which leaves us in the dark.  As I said earlier, we have tried to look at it.  If a household is to be charged &euro;240, if Irish Water needs to invest a certain amount in the infrastructure and if the Government is going to gather &euro;500 million from it, those figures do not add up.  This leads to the likelihood that people will end up paying more than &euro;240, and it is not-----</p></speech>

Representatives of Social Justice Ireland appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht when I chaired that committee.  We produced a very substantive report on the future of Irish Water.  Much of the discussion at that time broke into two areas.  There was the universal allowance system that Dr. Hannon mentioned earlier - I am putting aside the people who were saying there could be no water charges and just referring to the debate around the structuring of it, so there was the issue of inability to pay rather than refusal to pay - and the other school of thought was that, as opposed to a universal allowance, a more structured, targeted, focused approach should be taken on a PPS basis.  I remember this because I wrote the recommendation to move to a PPS-based system to ensure that we targeted the people most in need.  Rather than having a universal allowance, the idea was to target the allowance.  Has the thinking of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul evolved around that area, particularly with regard to the PPS, or is it very much where it was two years ago?  I put the same question to Social Justice Ireland on the allowance system.  Are the witnesses advocating for a universal allowance system or a targeted approach?</p></speech>

It must have books that balance at the end of the year and must comply with the requirements of the regulator.  For me to say there is a universal allowance there is akin to saying, "Let's go to Doheny and Nesbitt when we finish here at 5 o'clock and every second pint is free, but the first pint will cost a tenner."  This is what happens when one operates a structure such as this.  There is a very serious flaw with universality, which gives the same benefit to the people who can afford to pay without any difficulty as to those who can only afford to pay less.</p></speech>

Part of our proposal on water charges was a universal allowance.  The other part of our proposal was a tapered charging system, because that is the only way to avoid a situation, for example, in which people moving into low-paid employment lose all of their benefits.  Without the studies that have been done, it is very difficult, as Ms Fahy mentioned, even to make submissions to the Commission for Energy Regulation.  At the time we proposed a tapered system of charges.  Ireland might have difficulty in terms of economic, social and cultural rights if it did not also provide a universal allowance.  We firmly back the concept of universality, accompanied by a tapered charging system.  It is very difficult to analyse it if we do not have the information.</p></speech>

I believe Ms Fahy said these were quite popular guys in their local communities.  The Seanad passed legislation on friendly societies which went to the D&aacute;il and has not come back yet.  The view on friendly societies in legislation was more or less dismissive: no new ones could be founded and those that did not already have loan funds would not be allowed to set up loan funds.  We looked at the Public Service Friendly Society.  There is a big movement in the UK also.  I suppose it is analogous to credit unions.  Our point was that it seemed a strange part of the financial system to shut down or curtail the growth of, because it was the one part that did not go on the rocks.  Has the Society of St. Vincent de Paul made any submissions?  Would they help people in their financial needs, as they seem to do in the UK quite successfully?</p></speech>

In addition, people have reported that they are happy with such things as doorstep credit, which is what a moneylender provides when bringing money to the house and collecting it from the house.  In the UK they found that even when a doorstep credit service is provided on a non-profit basis, without too much paperwork and things like that - just to wash its face, if one likes - the interest rate is still quite high because of issues such as non-payment of loans that have to be built into it when working with people on a low income.</p><p>  The key point is that there has to be some way for people on low incomes to access affordable credit, because they need it to make ends meet, and we would not like to see anybody ruled out of accessing that.  Despite the high levels of customer satisfaction which many financial services would like to have, the issue with moneylenders is just cost.  We have made submissions to the credit unions about returning to that base of working in local communities with people on low incomes to try to encourage them to save.  Sometimes the Society of St. Vincent de Paul will match the amount people are saving in the credit union to try to get people to have a bit of a buffer.</p> <p>However, they also need access to credit.</p></speech>

It was a satisfactory meeting in the sense that we were assured that the current licensing arrangements in this country are not attractive to Wonga because they are quite tight in comparison with those applying in some jurisdictions.  The main concern is to avoid a situation here like what is happening in Britain, with these companies setting up on the high street and offering payday and one-week lending.  Fortunately, the interest rates being applied by them are not obtainable in this country.  The way the system works here is that a company applies for a licence to charge a particular interest rate, and no licence has ever been granted allowing for rates in excess of 450% or thereabouts.  I understand Wonga and companies like it charge rates of 2,500% to 4,500%.</p></speech>

Founded in 1971, the institute&rsquo;s main aim is to promote the highest professional standards among members at all times.  As we stated in the submission, IPAV believes that a properly functioning housing and mortgage market is essential for a properly functioning economy and a stable society.  Most observers, including ourselves, believe that the industry is now beginning to experience a modest improvement, although there are signs of many tiers beginning to emerge.  Central to making the market stable and sustainable is a proper and adequate supply of new housing, and that should be the Government&rsquo;s main priority for the property industry.  Incentives to purchase are of little use if there is not an adequate supply.  The Forf&aacute;s report on Ireland&rsquo;s construction sector and Construction 2020<i></i>both offer a number of worthwhile ideas and aims, but we believe now is the time for more immediate and concrete measures to be taken. <br />I will highlight a few of those measures.  I believe strongly in the need for the creation of a national property authority.  That should consist of representatives of all the relevant stakeholders and would advise the Minister and Government of the day.  The lack of such advice was a prime cause of the property boom and bust, and immediate steps should be taken to ensure that never happens again.  It is important to have a body of such experts on hand to identify and address problems and provide advice and guidelines to policy makers.<br /><b></b>Demand for housing is at an all time high in Dublin&rsquo;s inner city yet it is estimated that between the canals there are approximately 155 acres of land and some 300 vacant sites that could be used for building residential and commercial property.  While NAMA and others have announced plans to restart various programmes, the introduction of a vacant site levy in budget 2015 would propel this drive to increase the supply of housing in areas where it is most needed.<br /><b></b>Regarding NAMA property sales, NAMA is currently selling off large numbers of apartments in huge tranches.  While this might have been understandable in the early days of the property downturn, IPAV believes it now makes sense to sell these units individually or in small lots.  That would have the double advantage of securing more money per unit for the Exchequer and give young people and investors the opportunity to buy directly from NAMA, thereby cutting out the middleman, which is generally some foreign investment vehicle looking to make a quick profit.<br />The planning process clearly needs to be more flexible, notably with regard to getting the construction sector moving again.  Most young couples like to buy houses eventually rather than apartments in Ireland and it seems logical that many of the planning permissions previously granted for apartments must be converted to housing.  IPAV believes a fast-track approach should be developed for all local authorities.  We can look to the planning process in greater London where planning applications have to be validated inside 14 days, with a further 30 days for planning.<br />Regarding universal mortgage insurance, some measures are clearly needed to help first-time buyers get on the property ladder.  Mortgage lenders are currently under pressure to rebuild profitability and reduce the size of their balance sheets.  Hence there is no incentive to engage in high loan to value, LTV, lending.  IPAV believes the creation of a universal mortgage insurance model would provide an incentive for such lenders to engage in high level LTV loans and to provide relatively low interest loans to borrowers.  This model already operates in many other countries, including the United Kingdom, and we believe the Government should give it a high priority in the October budget.<br />With regard to renting directly, the rent a room scheme has been reasonably successful but it needs to be extended.  Currently, if a property owner earns &euro;10,100 or more in gross income, the whole amount of income is taxed.  It would make far better sense if only the excess above &euro;10,100 was liable for tax.  I thank the members for listening and I will be happy to take questions later.</p></speech>

As the Simon Communities in Ireland, Focus Ireland and Threshold are working to tackle homelessness and the housing crisis, we have agreed to share our time to be more informative and useful but also to avoid repetition for the members.  I will set the scene briefly, examine some of the solutions and then hand over to Mr. Mike Allen from Focus Ireland and Mr. Bob Jordan from Threshold.</p><p>  As everybody is aware, we are in the middle of a homelessness and housing crisis.  More people are at risk of homelessness, more people are becoming homeless, and more people than ever are turning to services for support.  The Simon Communities of Ireland has reported a 24% increase in the number of people turning to our services in our most recent annual report, and the numbers continue to grow.  There are approximately 90,000 households on the social housing waiting lists.  Rents have increased by about 9% nationally and at different amounts in terms of urban centres; it is about 14% in Dublin.  The number of properties available to rent has declined sharply to just under 6,000 properties on 1 May this year.  Rent supplement levels are proving insufficient to meet the cost of many rental properties.</p><p>  With this lack of available social housing and barriers preventing people accessing houses in the private rental sector, it has become much more difficult for people to secure affordable and appropriate accommodation.  That is not just causing homelessness.  It is also preventing people leaving homelessness, with people who are homeless effectively trapped in emergency accommodation for far longer than is appropriate.</p><p>  Cutbacks to funding for housing support, health services, probation and welfare, education and training, etc., have knock-on effects that contribute to homelessness.  That combination of factors can trigger homelessness in the first place but can also prevent people moving out of homelessness because they do not have the necessary support.</p><p>  It is clear that austerity budget measures are having the biggest impact on the people who are the most vulnerable.  A significant policy shift is required to address the growing social housing and income adequacy needs.  The reliance on the private sector to provide social housing only has demonstrably failed.  We need sustainable investment in social housing and a large provision in the private rented sector.  That needs vision, decisiveness, political will and commitment on the part of practitioners and providers to deliver quality social housing but it also needs to be resourced.</p><p>  It is in this context that the Government has committed to ending long-term homelessness and rough sleeping by 2016 using a housing-led approach.  Housing-led approaches are extremely effective in addressing and ending homelessness for good.  That is Government policy, and we wholeheartedly support this approach, but housing-led approaches are also predicated on the availability of support appropriate to each person's needs.  That might be support to live independently with regard to cookery skills, budgeting and tackling loneliness and isolation but for some people it also means helping them to address mental health issues, physical health issues, and drug and alcohol issues.  </p><p>  Resources must allow for the diversity of needs but also the fluctuation in needs.  For example, if somebody reaches a mental health crisis it is vitally important that the level and intensity of support can be increased just for that period to help them get through the crisis and remain in their tenancy.  The level of support can then roll down once the crisis has ended.  It is clear that ending homelessness requires more than just housing, but housing is a central piece of this jigsaw and remains the single greatest barrier to implementing a housing-led approach.</p><p> The Government must reappraise the upfront investment required to generate the flow of accommodation that, along with support, will enable people who have been homeless to take up sustainable housing options.  Responses must be nationally driven but locally delivered to ensure people can remain in their communities where they have family and support networks.  This is especially important when people run into difficulties, be it housing or income difficulties.</p><p>  We need to find more options and better, more sustainable ways to house people in the longer term.  Critical to that is preventing people becoming homeless, and then supporting people to make the smooth transition out of emergency accommodation to independent living.  Crucial elements to achieving this are income adequacy, housing, rent supplement, and health and social care supports.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department of Social Protection and the Health Service Executive, along with other Government Departments, play a vital role in ensuring access to housing, social welfare, and the critical support services that offer the most effective means both of preventing homelessness but also supporting people to move out of homelessness.</p><p>  To address this housing and homeless crisis, we urgently need access to housing and access to support in housing, but also action to prevent homelessness and the recurrence of homelessness.  We urge the members to support us in our call to ensure that the Government takes on these issues in budget 2015.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the opportunity to put forward our views on the forthcoming budget.  The Government's national policy on homeless, and that of the previous Government, is probably the best policy that has ever been developed and is outstanding at European level.  Unfortunately, the reality on the ground is completely different.  We have the best policy and some of the worst outcomes we have ever faced.  The reason for that paradox is the failure by successive Governments for several decades to address the question of supplying housing at an affordable rate for people on low incomes, as is the decline of social housing.</p> <p>As Ms Randall eloquently pointed out, homelessness is more than an absence of housing.  Nothing that homelessness organisations do to help people re-enter housing can achieve anything unless there is a supply of homes for people to move into.</p><p> In a crisis, there are a number of steps to be taken immediately that would not normally be taken.  They have disadvantages one would not wish for but they are required in emergencies.  I will mention one in a moment.  First, we need to say something about the long-term solutions.  While they are long-term solutions, they need to be implemented now.  The primary long-term solution that needs to be put in place is a major investment in social housing.  The reason for the problems we are facing, most dramatically in respect of families becoming homeless, is that we have ceased to provide affordable accommodation for families or to subsidise their accommodation in the way we used to.  We have always failed in this regard with single people, particularly single men but also single women.  As a nation, we always had a very good track record of ensuring families were protected but we no longer do.  While there are some reports that family homelessness is declining, our experience on the ground indicates 39 families were recognised or registered as homeless in Dublin last month, June, representing an increase on previous months.  There is a continuing acceleration.</p><p> The investment in social housing needs to be very substantial.  At this stage, everybody recognises it needs to be through an SPV and should not affect Government debt.  There is a sense that we have sorted out the economics and mathematics and that it is now time for the Government to move on and actually deliver.  It is worth saying that the shift in the Cabinet is in some ways welcome.  What we were told initially, which was that there was to be Minister with responsibility for housing, was very welcome.  However, it is deeply confusing that, a few days after that statement, a Minister of State responsible for housing was appointed who is not a member of the Cabinet.  Now there are two individuals responsible for housing, one of whom is a member of the Cabinet and the other of whom is not.  The division of responsibilities seems to be such that one is responsible for social housing.  What is the other responsible for?  Is it other people's housing, real housing or the construction industry?  We do not need confusion at this point; we need the Government to do what it said it was going to do, namely, treat this matter as a high priority, move on energetically and provide clarity.  We are saying &euro;0.5 billion needs to be invested in social housing this year to deliver 3,000 homes.  This needs to rise to &euro;1 billion per year in subsequent years.  We are saying &euro;0.5 billion at present because that is all the system is capable of absorbing in the first year.</p><p> My final point is on the immediate actions that need to be implemented.  Threshold will deal with some of them.  The main one to which I want to refer concerns tax reform in the private rental sector.  There are many things that need to be done in that sector, and they need to be done urgently.  At present, we are addressing the need to get people into homes in the private rental sector through rent subsidy.  There is reluctance among some landlords to accept that, and there is a shortage of housing.  We propose that there be a number of tax reliefs for landlords who accept people who are currently on the homeless list.  This would create an incentive for them to take people from this category.  It would save the State money in that people would no longer have to be kept in emergency accommodation, and it would be socially beneficial.  This should be achieved in a tax-neutral way through the adjustment of other tax reliefs.</p></speech>

To some extent, the private rental sector has been used as a solution or alternative to social housing in the past decade.  Unfortunately, we are now in circumstances in which the sector itself is in crisis and creating problems.</p><p>  It is worth reminding ourselves that one in five families in Ireland lives in the private rental sector.  It is not the Cinderella of housing anymore.  It is not a waiting-room for home ownership but a place where people are putting down roots.  Ten years ago, we decided people would have security in the private rental sector for up to four years.  That is quite basic security.  It is being undermined at present by rocketing rents.  This really means people are being economically evicted from their homes.  Unfortunately, it is not only single people who are ending up homeless but also families with children.</p><p>  Let me focus on what we regard as three solutions, to be implemented in the period before the social housing supply really comes on stream.  Rent supplement is a problem.  The rent supplement budget has been cut quite significantly over the past couple of years.  On the question of whether rent supplement limits are too high or low, we know they do not control the market.  They do not represent the real rents because up to 50% of people coming to us in receipt of rent supplement are paying top-ups.  People are not protected by the limits.  In other words, if one's landlord decides to increase one's rent above the limit, one is not protected by the law.  That can happen and the PRTB will stand over a rent review.</p><p>  In the forthcoming budget, rent supplement limits need to be increased.  We need to protect the budget.  Obviously, that needs to be done in a targeted way, particularly in urban centres, bearing in mind the most vulnerable household types.  Much rigidity has crept into the system over recent years during the period of austerity.  The staff who are meeting people at risk of homelessness and who work for the State need to have greater flexibility to give people more rent supplement where they need it to remain in their homes.  Obviously, savings are being made in the rent supplement scheme.  The pertinent figure has reduced from approximately &euro;0.5 billion to &euro;344 million this year.  This is partly attributable to improvements in the economy and people getting jobs.  Any savings that are made in the rent supplement system for that reason should be ring-fenced to provide flexibility for others who need the support.  The money should not go back into the main coffers.</p><p>  We would like to see the housing assistance payment rolled out as soon as possible because it deals with some of the flaws in the rent supplement system, particularly in terms of direct payments to landlords, verifying the standard of the property, and one's opportunity to take up work while still getting some help with housing costs.  We support the housing assistance payment as a measure because, to some extent, it offers some of the benefits of being in local authority housing to people who are currently in the private rental sector.</p><p>  The big argument that has been put forward against increasing rent supplement limits is that the State should not be chasing the market.  The State is either in the market paying market rents or it tries to control market rents.  Therefore, the issue of rent control is on the table.  It is certainly a practice we believe needs to be introduced to protect people in their homes.  People are facing rent increases of 30% to 50%.  Clearly, welfare payments are not increasing to that extent, nor are salaries.  We need to have protectable rent increases.  Thus, when people enter a tenancy and pay the market rent, they will know the rent increases they will face.  We believe this arrangement should be introduced.</p><p>  Countries that have or which we refer to as having a much better private rental sector, including Germany, the Netherlands and France, are all considering rent control measures at present.  There is a study taking place in Camden on rent control.  This is an issue across the table in Europe.  Most people would agree that Ireland's property market is in a much worse state than that in many of the other countries that are introducing rent controls.</p><p>  I was very pleased that this committee launched a report last week on the mortgage arrears resolution process.  Within that, there are two recommendations on the buy-to-let sector.  One is that where receivers are appointed to buy-to-let properties, both the letter and spirit of the residential tenancies legislation should be applied.  In other words, people's rights should be upheld in terms of notice periods, getting back their deposit, repairs, etc.  People's conditions in their property should not deteriorate.  I ask the committee to support what we believe needs to be done to operationalise what I propose.  This involves an amendment to the residential tenancies legislation stipulating receivers must step into the shoes of the landlord.  In other words, they must take on all the responsibilities for the landlord.  This must be explicit in the legislation.</p></speech>

I welcome the delegates again.  The reason we are meeting at this time of year, when we should be winding down for the summer, is because the budget is now in October.  I very much appreciate the adjustment the delegates made to their schedules in submitting proposals at this time of the year.  In the past, they might only have been considering the outline draft at this time.</p><p>  Despite the massive economic crisis and the collapse of the massive housing bubble, and irrespective of trends in Germany and other countries where large numbers rent their homes, we may operate on the assumption that Ireland will continue to be a home-purchasing nation.  All indicators demonstrate that.  As we now move into a new space, I am struck by the difficulty that rents in the private sector are increasing quite quickly.  Whether rents are chasing the market is a debate for another day, but we know for a fact that there is an increase.  Perhaps there are two reasons, the first of which is that, with the legacy of the housing bubble, there has not been appropriate construction of purchasable houses for the past 18 months to two years.</p> <p>A legacy of coming out of a housing bubble has been a lack of appropriate construction of purchasable houses for 18 months to two years.  That tends to push people out who should be buying but are not.  That group is stuck in there significantly.  Mr. Davitt indicated his concern about the issue of loan-to-value difficulties as we see the property market begin to escalate in some areas again.  Why did rent-to-buy not take off over the last couple of years?</p></speech>

At the start of the recession, the scheme was put forward by many builders on the basis that people would buy a property having rented it for so many years.  There was an agreed rent for the time.  What many people found was that the price of the property went down during the term they were renting it.  At that time, when the three or four years moved on, they could buy properties cheaper than they had agreed to buy one at in the rent-to-buy scheme.  That is what they did.  Even though some people were tied into contracts, they could not and did not complete them.  They bought other, cheaper properties.</p></speech>

However, if someone was renting in 2009 and paying &euro;15,000 per year, it made more sense to keep doing that due to the fact that depreciation in the value of properties of &euro;300,000 was running faster than that.  One would be out of pocket &euro;30,000 by buying the building as opposed to renting it.  Up to 2011 and 2012, perhaps, that continued to be the case.  However, rent-to-buy would have been a very attractive option around 2011 and 2012.  One would have seen that the market was bottoming out and that even if one was to take a temporary hit, it would come back in the future.</p></speech>

They are owned by people who for different reasons are landbanking the sites and not doing anything with them.  This is happening when buildings and sites in Dublin are very scarce, and it would be good to get them back into production and to start building.  We are hoping the site levy will do that.</p></speech>

There is a shortage of large commercial buildings in the city centre also.  We hope this will make people use their sites to ensure that someone who buys a site will buy it to build on rather than to leave.  If someone buys a property and its value goes up by 5% or 10%, only one person is making money.  However, if the property is sold to a builder, the builder will build and many people will be able to take advantage of the site.  In the event that the sites are brought back into production and being built on, speculators will not buy such sites as are offered for sale as they know there will be a levy where they fail to build or decide to build within a year, depending on the size of the levy.  I did a presentation for the Lord Mayor of Dublin some time ago and a builder in attendance recommended the size of the levy should be between 20% and 50%.  That is probably a bit high and a great deal more than the Lord Mayor was considering.  However, 3% or 5% will automatically mean people will not buy the sites.  Builders will get to buy the properties at lower prices.</p></speech>

There is a great deal to be offered in those terms as it deals with many things the derelict site stuff does not deal with.  In the United States of America, this has been quite effective and had a secondary benefit where a property is in dispute between a bank, an owner and an organisation like NAMA.  As soon as the levy starts to be applied, one finds out very quickly who actually owns the property.  As it happened in the USA, it acted in some situations like a compulsory purchase as the levy became so cumulative on a compound basis over a number of years that the state ended up grabbing it like a derelict site for nothing.  We should look at that as it has a pro-activity to it and operates in the national interest.</p></speech>

They are brownfield or greenfield sites which can be built on very quickly.  House prices go up because of site values.  The only difference in the cost of building between Dublin and a place like Sligo or Longford is the site value.  If sites in Dublin are very expensive and increasing all the time due to demand and speculators get into the market, the cost of the house at the end will go up.  If speculators are not involved in sales and it is only builders, site values will be kept at the right price.</p></speech>

In the midst of the catastrophe and as legacy issues play out, is there an opportunity for two things to happen which are not being looked at?  The Irish private residential market has involved an individual owning two or three properties in a dispersed mode - a flat, a house and something bought recently; one mortgage-free, another negative equity and the other performing as it was bought at the right time.  How many private rental properties are there?</p></speech>

Properties could be institutionalised and put into long-term pension funds.  The active side of the loan could be put into something more structured and the legacy debt dealt with through a pension fund.  If the approach was taken of an institutionalised, private rented sector, could we have standards applied, uniformity across the market and a rent structure if not rent control?  I would be interested in the comments of all witnesses on whether there is an opportunity for that to happen.</p></speech>

The private rented sector internationally tends to be very fragmented.  Up to 80% of landlords in Ireland have one or two properties.  It is a real cottage industry.  The main reasons institutional investment is looked at are increasingly professional management practices and increased scale.  A further consideration is that where the State is using the sector for schemes like RAS, HAP or long-term leasing, one of the bugbears of local authorities is having to deal with so many individual landlords.  Where a landlord owns one property, the local authority must come up with contracts for that and then deal with the next landlord.  It is very hard to scale up these schemes.  The opportunities are there.  Pension funds are looking at the private sector.  In Ireland, rents fell from peak by 20% to 30% whereas property prices fell 50% to 60%.  On balance, it is not a bad bet.  There is better information on the rate of return in the private rented sector while ultimately, REITS have looked more at the corporate side of things.</p></speech>

We have spent a huge amount of energy and money, in terms of experts, and came out with nothing.  There is a fundamental problem with this proposition for social housing because it is one thing to make the investment but somebody has to pay it back.  The nature of social housing is that it needs to be subsidised because the tenants do not have the capacity or income to pay the full cost.  The State does not have the capacity to repay the money and it has made it clear that it cannot rise to that challenge.</p><p> In regard to the way in which the Chairman characterised the matter, in the sense that existing housing stock in the private rental sector might be taken over in that way, I do not think that is likely to happen.  People would be looking at new housing stock.  In respect of existing housing stock, we should consider a number of mechanisms, including in particular social rental agencies.  The Chairman will be familiar with a pilot project that Focus Ireland, Simon and Threshold have developed in Cork, in which a body acts as an intermediary to take responsibility for letting the property away from the private landlord and ensures that the landlord gets all the rent and that the property is handed back afterwards.  That seems to be a more likely option in the Irish context and a small landlord might feel comfortable in such a situation because he or she knows the investment is being looked after and can see it as he or she walks home in the evening.</p></speech>

In terms of social rental agencies, the Cork rental project has been very successful and this model has also proven its success in other European countries.  The implementation plan for the State's response to homelessness allows for the development of a social rental agency but it is a Dublin only initiative.  We are concerned about the potential for an urban centred response to these issues.  Clearly, these problems are more acute and visible in Dublin but they are also impacting on areas outside of Dublin.  We argue that the agency should be national in focus.</p></speech>

It is now possible for an agent acting on behalf of the State to control the release of land to the market, as opposed to what occurred with developers in the past.  Is this something the witnesses have considered in terms of ending up with sustainable provision of housing?  If Ireland continues to be a home buying nation, every other aspect remains contingent on that irrespective of whether it is the right or the wrong option.  Is it possible that NAMA is in a situation to implement aspects of the Kenny report without the constitutional difficulties?</p></speech>

The land should be released.  When we built 93,000 houses in 2006, approximately 6,000 or 7,000 of them were for social housing.  Last year we built 8,500 houses, of which 750 were for social housing.  The percentages were the same, however.  My concern is that a substantial amount of new supply should be ring-fenced for social housing purposes and to deliver on the social dividend to which Mr. Allen refers.</p></speech>

This demonstrates the painfully slow rate of progress that has been made on an issue we have been discussing for quite some time.  We are probably watching the wind-down of NAMA as we speak, even though that is not the best outcome.  In terms of the quantity of land suitable for social housing needs, have the agencies investigated how many units of social housing could be accommodated?  The focus on NAMA has been on the number of units under its control and whether they could be handed over to the local authorities for social housing but it has also been involved in innovative ways of providing finance to developers to manage its assets.  If it has a half-built construction site, it provides vendor finance at very low rates.  It is acceptable to it to make a return of 2% on its financing in order to finish a development or to build roads to enhance it.  NAMA can be used in a way that not only provides land but also finances the construction or refurbishment of housing stock to meet social housing needs.  Has this potential been investigated by the agencies?</p></speech>

An audit of the units held by NAMA found that approximately 4,000 could be used for social housing purposes.  The local authorities have indicated a willingness to take approximately 2,000 of these units because they do not want over concentrations of social housing.  A similar process could be used to audit the lands owned by NAMA to determine what can be used.  We have not done such an audit.</p></speech>

The one example with which I am familiar in terms of completing estates involves 40 units in Clare Hall which are about to be provided to a housing association, with support from Focus Ireland, to accommodate families currently occupying emergency accommodation.  This is a very welcome development but it is on a scale inappropriate to the nature of the problem.</p> <p>It is not a social dividend.  All are being transferred at the commercial price after all other commercial avenues have been followed.  A social dividend would move them from the arm of the State that NAMA represents to public use without pushing the approved housing bodies into debt in order to achieve this.</p></speech>

It was a sop to the Opposition to be able to say NAMA would be used for the social good.  The Houses of the Oireachtas set up NAMA and will dismantle it when it believes its time is up.  We can actually change the priorities of NAMA if we want to do so, given the fact that everybody has come to the conclusion that we have a housing crisis, including a social housing crisis.  Could we amend the legislation to allow NAMA to be used to deal with this issue?  We are dealing with budgetary issues, but NAMA is an off-balance sheet vehicle.  If it spends money on social housing, it is not accounted for in our deficit ratios.</p></speech>

If it does not work and the Oireachtas wants the law to be different, it has to change it.  If we are not going to get a social dividend under the current legislation and the Oireachtas, or public representatives, want a public dividend, as they should, the Oireachtas should change the law urgently.</p></speech>

Part of the process is recommended.  I do not have an update on where it is at.  We are all involved and engaged in the national homelessness consultative committee and the cross-departmental team on homelessness.  It is something we can bring back to that forum, that is, we should look at NAMA lands aso.  This is something we, in Simon, have not considered to date, but it is something at which we should look.  In terms of a social dividend, we should push and enforce it.  Whether it was popped in at the last minute as a sop, we should push it and try to leverage something for the public, particularly if we are in the wind-down days of NAMA.</p></speech>

The three organisations represented here and the Society of St Vincent de Paul came together and made a submission.  We were very concerned that Part 5 would be watered down.  It is fundamental in delivering social housing that Part 5 be retained.  Clearly, in the delivery of social housing, it was extremely frustrating and officious and got a bad name because of some of the delays.  All of this needs to be sorted out, but the fundamental idea that there should be a public return in the building of housing is something that needs to be maintained and delivered effectively.</p></speech>

I am not against tax incentives, but the Irish way of dealing with things is that if there is a problem, we throw a tax incentive at it to see if it will work.  This is not a good way to deal with the issue.  On the tax incentives identified such as capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax and company tax, will this have the benefit of dealing with the issue because I presume - correct me if I am wrong - this has to be focused and concentrated and that somebody buying a house where I live cannot apply?  There should be a need identified in a particular area.  The facilities and resources should be available for somebody who is in a vulnerable position.  The assistance needs to be targeted.  The properties being bought and sold could be few and far between; therefore, the tax incentive would not work.  My initial view is that this is a distraction from the real problem, that is, suggesting a tax incentive will sort out the issue.</p></speech>

I agree that in general throwing a tax relief at the problem is not good economic or social policy.  What we have is a person whose income is insufficient to pay the market rent.  Therefore, the State needs to provide a subsidy.  Currently, it provides that subsidy through a cash payment - rent supplement - but it is not working for a number of reasons.  We suggest another form of subsidy through tax relief.  It needs to be seen in that context.  It is different from subsidising a person on a low income in terms of his or her inability to purchase a good, in this case a roof over his or her head at market rents.  It is not what we consider to be a long-term solution, but we will have two years or, if we are lucky, many more, given that there is simply not enough social housing which is subsidised in a more effective way available.  It needs to be very closely linked with other programmes such as Sl&iacute; and so on in order that we would not have someone going in and failing in that tenancy.  There are tenancy sustainment systems which have to be linked to be effective.  To be given one, one has to be on the homeless list.  There has to be the involvement of the local authority, which would trigger these support systems.</p></speech>

This is all about throwing out different ideas to examine them.  My party examines all options.  On the rent-a-room scheme, I am not sure how successfully it is working.  Perhaps the IPAV might enlighten us.  The proposal suggests anything above the &euro;10,000 limit should be liable for tax.  If one looks at one room, one is talking about a weekly rent of approximately &euro;200.  One would have to be above that figure not to be able to avail of the tax exemption.  If one had two rooms, that could present a problem if the rent was anything above &euro;100.  One would not be able to avail of the scheme.  A concern I have is that this would allow people to increase the rent and still avail of the tax exemption.</p></speech>

This insurance is to mitigate against high lending.  It is taken by a private insurance company on the basis that if somebody seeks a high loan to value mortgage a percentage is taken by the insurance company.  Based on figures from a report launched this morning, between 2001 and 2011 the largest mortgage insurer in Ireland had approximately 70,000 high loan to value ratio loans with some of the main lenders.  More than &euro;70 million in claims have been paid to lenders to date.  These 70,000 loans represent approximately 5.5% of the overall residential mortgages taken out in Ireland during the period.  If one extrapolates the figures and looks at the basis of a universal mortgage scheme, which is what we are discussing, it could reduce by approximately &euro;300 million the liability of these mortgages on a long-term basis.  If any percentage over 75% exists in Ireland today, and assuming one in three mortgages go bad or default at some point, it could reduce this by a further &euro;1.7 billion over the life of those mortgages.  This has many advantages, including the cost of capital to the banks, because they would not have high loan to value ratios of 95%, as opposed to what they would have if there was no insurance to buy it.</p></speech>

What should be the appropriate loan to value ratio for a mortgage?  It is probably the basis for a wider debate.  Should it be 95% regardless of who insures it?  This is the real question.</p><p>  I wish to touch on several other major issues identified in one of the presentations.  Serious concerns have been raised about the capacity of the case-by-case approach to deal with the systemic problem of rent supplement levels.  The discretion of deciding officers, which has existed since the mid-1970s, was noted.  The witnesses are not clear about what additional benefits the new policy announced might offer in responding to a systemic problem with regard to inadequate rent supplement levels.  Will the witnesses speak about this and what needs to be done if it is the case?</p><p>  Another point, on which I had not picked up, is the issue of young people becoming homeless and I ask for details on the percentage involved.  Between 50% and 75% of the &euro;100 a week they can receive in social welfare would need to go on emergency accommodation.  A call has been made to allow them to avail of the full over-26 rate of social welfare provision.</p></speech>

We welcome the initiative, which Threshold immediately operates and on which Simon and Focus Ireland co-operate.  Anything being done to try to stem the tide is welcome.  Systemically, rent supplement levels are just not high enough for families and others, particularly in Dublin but also in other cities and towns.  It is like a boat has sunk and everybody is drowning but we are asking them one by one whether they are all right.  We know they are not all right because they are all drowning.  We need a system to lift rent supplements overall.  This is not to attack the system, which is an attempt to do something useful, but to recognise its limitations.  It is a systemic problem and we all agree and have stated there needs to be an increase in rent supplement.  Community welfare officers have discretion to vary it and it is regrettable that additional protocols need to be put in place to achieve this end.  However, sometimes one needs to do things which are regrettable if one wants to prevent people from becoming homeless.</p><p>  With regard to young people on the half rate, I cannot provide exact figures because it is difficult to keep track of it, but since it was first introduced all of the homeless services throughout the country began to see young people.  Young people who grew up in care are protected and get the full rate if they are unemployed.  The policy relies on the notion that if one gets into trouble one can return to someone in the family.  The small number of young people who do not have a care background but do not have a home to return to are locked into homeless accommodation.  There needs to be a system or protocol whereby community welfare officers link to the homeless service to help people get a higher income, move out of homelessness and be supported into a home.  We have been speaking to the Department of Social Protection about this for more than two years and I am very frustrated about the failure to get a response.</p></speech>

There has been an impasse with the Department of Social Protection; their representatives have discretion to go above the rent limits but they do not do so even where people are clearly at risk of homelessness.  The protocol moves this up the decision-making hierarchy in the Department of Social Protection and makes the Department make a decision.  The service is only available in Dublin, which is an issue, but since it was established the freephone line has received 1,200 calls and dealt with 460 families at risk of homelessness, all of whom are still in their homes.  In many cases Threshold has salvaged the tenancies and kept people in case.  We have referred cases to the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  We have also referred approximately 55 people to the protocol.  It has only been up and running for several weeks.  Of the 55 people 20 have been approved and receive an amount above the rent limit.  The deadlock has been broken.  It is not ideal because this flexibility should exist throughout the system but I hope it will lead to a loosening up of the system across the board.</p></speech>

With regard to the housing market generally, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, stated in its 2004 report that up to one third of all Irish people would require assistance with their housing in the future, either through the provision of social housing, assisted purchase or another format.  In its most recent report this year it reiterated this point.  We cannot depend on the market to provide housing for at least one third of Irish people and this is the bottom line.</p><p>  Given that we are dealing with pre-budget submissions, as opposed to this being a general chit chat on housing, this discussion is on exactly what the asks are.  My questions will be based on a three-pronged approach and I would like all of the witnesses to focus on it.  My first question is with regard to what can be done in the short term.  We acknowledge there is a crisis, so what are the most important measures to deal with it as it stands?  I accept we are speaking about fingers in the dyke, but in the opinion of the witnesses what measures must be included in the next budget to stem the crisis?</p></speech>

It recommended that the budgets for social protection, health, the HSE and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government be increased to 2013 levels.</p> <p>We recommend that two of the budgets be brought up to 2013 levels, but without a shadow of a doubt the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government budget must be increased in light of the problems, particularly homelessness.</p><p> Before coming here, I was chatting to colleagues and there must be investment of &euro;250,000 or more in social housing.  While we must move on in terms of having some output, which will take two years, some of our focus is on what we can do with the existing social housing provision.  We recommend an wider inventory of voids and some of it could be liaising with approved bodies or the voluntary sector regarding taking some of them on if the local authorities do not have the funding or resources to do so, and examining allocations and transfers.  We should seek a mechanism to ensure people who are most vulnerable, and the homeless in particular, are prioritised.</p></speech>

Although there has been enormous reluctance in this country to consider it, we have recommended it in our pre-budget submission.  It should happen.  It would allow some kind of rent certainty for tenants and service users.  A study on it is under way and we recommend that it be fast tracked.</p></speech>

The people at the bottom of the heap - those who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless - need a greater share of the existing housing supply, which means people who are slightly less vulnerable will be squeezed.  We need to face this situation by giving people the tools to price themselves into what is primarily a private market.  This means giving them enough money in rent supplement and improving the delivery of rent supplement to make it less unattractive to landlords, and the tax relief idea is part of it.  We also need to ensure the very substantial amount of empty social housing is rapidly made available to people, primarily to this group.</p><p>  We probably need to consider the local authorities offering housing that is smaller than desired.  It is unacceptable to tell a person he or she has to sleep on the street or in an unsuitable shelter for a long period of time because the local authority housing is not good enough, because the person would not make the same choice.  Over the next two years, we must do things we would not wish to do in order to make short-term housing available to people.  We do not need to build more shelters and create an institutional system based on the assumption that families and individuals will have to live in unsuitable and unsustainable emergency accommodation for years.  That is where much of the thinking is going.</p></speech>

They are a very blunt instrument covering wide geographical areas.  There is plenty of information available on localised rents so it can be targeted at particularly high-demand areas.  The issue of chasing the market is real, and rent supplement limits must be reviewed in parallel with introducing rent controls.  The model we have put forward is that people pay open market rents at the beginning, but that their security would be protected, as it is in the legislation.  This means they would face predictable rent increases over at least a four-year period.</p><p>  The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, report stated that we needed 200,000 social housing units by the end of 2012.  Given that we have only 150,000 units, we need to catch up.  The average annual need for housing in Ireland is approximately 25,000 units  We need approximately one third of those for social housing purposes.  Our submission stated that 6,000 were needed and it needs to happen soon.  Regarding immediate measures using the existing supply, we need to bring voids into use as quickly as possible.  This is a bugbear for everybody.  As discussed previously, up to 2,000 NAMA units could be used for social housing and we should fast-track them.  The housing assistance payment, HAP, should be introduced because the rent supplement system was designed in 1977 and is out of date with the modern private rental market and needs to be overhauled-----</p></speech>

I will have to explain myself.  I love the area.  My point is that in 2003, Threshold produced a report that stated that only one third of landlords were willing to take rent supplement tenants.  This is not a short-term problem but has been with us for a long time.  If we are going to depend on the market to supply housing to people in need - which I disagree with in principle - we must ensure they do not get the crud at the bottom of the market but good quality properties.  Could Mr. Jordan expand on how the tax system could be brought into play to bring about better quality housing for people in need?</p></speech>

The issue has been that a certain type of landlord has specialised in the rent supplement market, and these are not always the most desirable landlords but those with houses of flats and bedsits.  Now that the market has changed, landlords have turned away from rent supplement because of how the scheme has been administered.  To some extent, the Department of Social Protection has asked tenants to break the law and break their leases.  It annoys people in Threshold that the Department of Social Protection asks tenants to provide leases in order to prove that they have bona fide tenancies, although one does not need a lease to live in the private rented sector.</p> <p>However, the Department then turns around later and tells them to break the lease in order to seek a rental reduction with the landlord.  This is what has alienated landlords from the rent supplement scheme - good landlords in many respects - who were willing to take that payment.  Unfortunately, if we are to attract them back into dealing with State social housing supports, we cannot merely increase rents to chase the market but also must provide some incentive, for a limited time perhaps or to keep it under review, to attract them in for social housing purposes.  They are in it to make a profit and are not operating on behalf of the State.</p></speech>

However, I refer to some lessons learned on administration problems and landlords' frustration.  As we have a big problem with encouraging landlords back, this is very important.  While we all have been working with the Departments involved, it is really important that this is acknowledged in the course of the development of the new scheme.</p></speech>

Were the remit of such bodies to be expanded, might there be a role for them in cross-subsidising their activities?  In other words, they could have their social remit while at the same time being able to provide housing into the private sector or in other words, cross-subsidising their social housing provision with private rented provision.</p></speech>

One should think through the consequences within the sector of doing this, in that a not-for-profit organisation engaging in profitable market activity must do a great deal of thinking about how it sets its wage levels, its governance levels and a range of similar issues.  If private landlords are a cottage industry, so too are approved housing bodies in Ireland.  They are doing excellent work on a voluntary basis and to place such an expectation on them without thinking through seriously the governance and regulatory issues would be somewhat premature.  While we must think through these matters, in principle it is a good way to progress, once one makes sure the bodies stay true to their ethos.</p></speech>

Do the witnesses have views on whether this is because the construction industry had a strong political say in the past or because it was bailed out repeatedly?

It is something that is mystifying.  If one is looking at a survey, most auctioneers would look at a survey of three-bedroom properties, because they are to be found throughout the country, be it in Sligo, Dublin, Galway, Mullingar or wherever.  The price, value and cost to build such a property in 2006 would be anything from &euro;70 to &euro;100 per square foot.  That price has not changed today.  Moreover, this is not due to wages in total but to the actual cost of the products one uses, which appear not to have reduced at all.  That building cost is there and it remains quite high.  I acknowledge that much of the value and price of property in 2006 was way above builders' profit on top of the actual cost of building houses.  At present however, if for example one takes a three-bedroom semi-detached house in Longford, for which one might get &euro;60,000 or &euro;70,000, there is no way in which a builder could build one of those houses for that sort of money.  Until such time as builders can build properties and get a reasonable amount of money for what they build, such properties will not be built.  Consequently, what will happen one day is that when the existing stock of property runs out, the property market will move on quite rapidly and its price will move considerably.</p></speech>

One could be looking at an increased price of many percentage points if the old stock that people are buying at a particular figure runs out and if that figure is not close to the cost of building them.  One could sell a three-bedroom semi-detached house for &euro;70,000 throughout the country - I do not refer to the city - because there is a many-tiered market in the country.  Even towns on their own-----</p></speech>

We have houses in Roscommon and my research on this matter shows that back in 2006 and 2007, we were building 60% more houses than actually were required by the market.  Moreover, we also were building them in the wrong places.  In cities such as Cork, Limerick and Dublin, there is no vacant build such as exists elsewhere and what is needed is for such vacant build to come into the market.  However, I believe Senator Barrett's point concerns the scenario in which we were to return to prudential lending and to apply what Mr. Davitt was saying about loan-to-value and all the rest.  Incidentally, I understand his model because I looked at it quite extensively.  This was done by Genworth in Canada, where a property bubble was avoided because they triangulated the purchasing of houses.  The insurance company would not allow one to buy a house that was overvalued by a bank because it would be underwriting it.</p></speech>

It does not matter whether one is living in Leitrim, Cork, Dublin, Donegal or anywhere else.  One simply takes the national industrial wage and applies it to that area in the country.  The committee heard disputes on figures yesterday, when IBEC and others appeared before the joint committee, stating the national industrial wage is either &euro;36,000 or &euro;42,000.  Let us split the difference and make it &euro;40,000.  Prudential lending practices will state that four times the national industrial wage will be &euro;160,000.  If one operates on the basis of a loan-to-value rate of 90% and all the rest, along with prudential loans of perhaps three or four times one's income with a partner contributing, this means that a standard three-bedroom house for an entry couple must be somewhere around &euro;160,000.  However, Mr. Davitt is suggesting the existing business model in the construction industry cannot build a house for &euro;160,000.  There is something radically wrong if prudential lending suggests such a figure but the industry is unable to produce the product at or below that figure.</p></speech>

They can produce three-bedroom semi-detached houses in most parts of the country, depending on the value and price of the site because that is where it all starts, as well as levies imposed by the county councils to go with it.  Before one begins to build, one obviously must buy the site and must put in place levies and everything else.  However, even at that, I believe one can build such houses for between &euro;100,000 and &euro;120,000.  The Chairman is correct in that it is a case of supply and demand.  It is not in the interests of auctioneers that the price of property runs up because we must sell the property whether it is high or low.  That is our job and we are not-----</p></speech>

My response to is to ask how can there be a potential bubble, if one maintains prudential lending practices?  This bottle I have to hand can be worth as anybody is willing to pay for it.  However, were the bank to tell me it can only give me three times my income to buy this bottle, so doing would contain the market.  Consequently, how can we have a property bubble if the banks do what they should have been doing over the last couple of years?</p></speech>

I actually am saying the opposite, which is that when supply of the property that currently is available has all gone, people must then adjust to a situation of reality, in which builders must build properties at a price at which they can afford to build them.  If I sell a three-bedroom semi-detached property today in Roscommon for instance and I get &euro;80,000 for it but if a builder down the road cannot build a house for less than &euro;120,000, the next house to be sold after the last house is sold at &euro;80,000 will be priced at &euro;120,000.  This is not a property bubble but is a property price that is matched to the price for which the builders actually are building the properties.  While people talk about property bubble in Dublin, it is not a property bubble but is a property spike.  This property spike exists obviously because of supply and demand and the money is available at present.  I believe a property bubble will only come into place when it is all being done on finance.</p></speech>

The cost of a site is there and we could easily stretch out these costs, have a look at them and see where they are.  However, I can tell the Senator that amazingly, the cost of building the houses has not changed.  Nobody can understand why the costs have not changed because if one takes one particular component, such as for instance laying blocks, people who were building a block house in the good times in 2006 could have been paying between &euro;1.10 and &euro;1.15 to build a block and are now probably paying &euro;0.60.</p> <p>The wages have come down to a certain degree but the actual cost of building the houses has not come down greatly.  It should have come down to match but it has not done that and we are aware of that fact.  </p></speech>

We have the numbers.  A total of 5,000 were offered and only about 1,000 were taken up.  My impression of NAMA is that it is there to keep asset prices up to make banks look better.  If the prices had fallen, we would not have this problem.  I have paid enough for banks already without having a property price still distorted by the fact that NAMA will not put them on the market and when it does, the local authorities will not take them.</p></speech>

If there are many properties in Roscommon and they have to be sold at &euro;30,000 or &euro;50,000, there is a value for those properties and we believe there are people out there to buy them.  Until such time as those properties are put on the market, the property market will never get to a level where it is an actual property market we are looking at.  At the moment, NAMA and the banks are holding off so many properties and we hear about all these buy-to-let properties that are not being put up for sale because they are afraid they will flood the market.  We do not believe as auctioneers that this will flood the market.  We believe that those properties would be sold if they were put on the market.  They should be put there and sold and after that, we should see where the property market is in building properties and rebuilding new properties to see where we go from there.  We do not see any point in agencies like NAMA holding these properties and NAMA selling massive amounts of properties to international buyers who, in turn, will sell them to Irish people two or three years down the line and inflate the price of the properties.  We do not see any reason for that.  We believe the properties are there for Irish people to own and should be sold to Irish people.  I am sorry for using the example of Roscommon but if somebody was to buy a house there for &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 because that is the market price today, so be it.  That is what should happen and they should be able to buy it at that price.  Auctioneers are not into running up the price of properties.  We are into selling them.  That is the only way we get paid.</p></speech>

That process is quite non-transparent so it is quite hard to give an answer.  From the extent to which we are able to see what is going on, a number of those units are being offered.  For example, we have had a lot of State investment to move away from having large concentrations of social housing in one place and to create multi-use and mixed communities.  A number of the units that were being offered around the country were right beside or adjacent to existing areas of concentrated social housing or were built to a standard which the local authorities thought was suitable for selling to the private market but if which, if they were in their ownership, would result in extremely high maintenance costs.  Both those decisions by local authorities to turn those down, to the extent that they are true and I do not know whether they explain the whole thing or not, are perfectly rational decisions.  It is reasonable that local authorities should not be taking into public ownership large tranches of poorly built housing right beside existing high levels of social deprivation because we would be building problems for the future.  While we want a clearer and faster process, I would be wary about putting pressure on local authorities higgledy piggledy just to accept these units.</p><p>  Due to the fact that there is some development, partly through NAMA, of half-finished estates and so on, areas where local authorities were previously turning down units for social housing because of the high density of social housing use are now beginning to pick up in terms of owner-occupiers so if the local authorities take them up, they would be mixed tenure areas.  That is opening up opportunities for some of these units which were correctly turned down before but which might be worth revisiting.  I think that the Department has asked that they be revisited.  </p></speech>

That is fine.  Compared to living in Salthill, one can live in Tuam and visit Salthill with the money one has saved.  Why is Longford regarded as Siberia?  All the NAMA houses are in the wrong place.  Those commuting distances from Longford to the M50 would not be large compared to those in London so I would like to see that supply opened up just to see what the market price is.  It might suit people to work around the M50 and to commute to a house with a far lower price than to opt for join in the prices in Dublin which have appreciated by 24% in the past 12 months.  How do we get that supply into the market?</p></speech>

As better properties become available, the council can obviously get out of those properties, sell them and move on to better properties because the housing need the Senator is talking about is there at the moment.  If councils get into the market and buy these properties right now, there is nothing stopping them from selling them in four or five years time and getting into better properties as they are built.  It is the ideal solution.<br />Longford and Edgeworthstown have rail lines so they are towns with trains which many country towns do not have.  I know this because I am from around there myself.  I live in Mullingar so I know the area quite well.  We are all trying to get trains to go here, there and everywhere.  We all believe the train is the way to travel.  I travel by train myself and find it is very good.  Property prices in some areas on the south side of Dublin have probably gone up by as much as 40% in the past two years.  We see people like Ronan Lyons talking about this on the basis of what they see on websites.  Auctioneers can tell one what is actually happening in the marketplace.  What is happening in the marketplace is far higher than what Mr. Lyons, <i>daft.ie</i>and <i>myhome.ie</i>are talking about.  In Edgeworthstown alone, one could have bought a three-bedroomed semi-detached house for &euro;40,000 in January 2014.  One could have bought one in bad condition that was possibly rented for quite a while for &euro;25,000.  Today, that house that was worth &euro;25,000 would cost someone &euro;50,000 and the house priced at &euro;40,000 would probably cost one &euro;60,000.  In Edgeworthstown, which is one of the Siberias spoken about by the Senator, if one looks at the value of these houses, the price of property has gone up by 100%.  I know 100% on a very small amount of money does not seem an awful lot but 100% in Dublin when one is looking at the price of properties that go up by 20% or 30% seems an awful lot.  That is all we look at because it is in the capital but one looks throughout the country, one will see property prices in different places that have gone up considerably because they went down an awful lot.  Why do county councils and people who are in the market-----</p></speech>

I know there is pressure on it to sell off a lot.  I am against that from a taxpayer's point of view.  Mr. Allen was quite right.  Why should local authorities increase social deprivation and ghettoisation in, for example, Tallaght by taking on an awful lot of stuff that is wrongly sited?  As he said, houses were built in the wrong places.  Things must find their own level.  Like Mr. Allen, I would be on the side of the councils in that respect.

If we lived in an ideal world, county councils would buy when properties were cheap and release them on to the markets when they were expensive.  The difficulty is that because county councils' borrowing is on the State books and the State is limited in what it can borrow, it is not in a position to do that.  I do not think we should be talking as if local authorities have all this freedom when they do not.</p></speech>

It also agreed to the processes relating to the establishment of the commission as defined in the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 on this matter, including the bringing of a resolution before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p>  In 2010 the partner of Ronan MacLochlainn, Ms Gr&aacute;inne Nic Gibb, took a case against Ireland under the European Convention on Human Rights alleging a failure on the part of the State to carry out an effective official investigation into this fatal shooting in accordance with the terms of Article 2 of the convention.  During friendly settlement negotiations on the case, a commission of investigation was proposed as a means of ensuring the State&rsquo;s compliance with the convention in this matter.  The settlement negotiations did not reach a satisfactory conclusion.  Instead, in a unilateral declaration which was submitted to the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, under Article 62(A) of the convention, Ireland admitted to a technical breach of the convention in this instance and, by way of a remedy, offered to conduct a commission of investigation into the fatal shooting.  In return, the court was asked to strike out the case.  In its decision of 25 March 2014 the court struck out the case on the basis that a commission of investigation would meet Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the convention in this matter.  Having regard to the outcome of the case and with the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I proposed to the Government that a commission be established.  The Government has agreed to this proposal.</p> <p>I emphasise that, without prejudice to the work of the commission of investigation, its establishment relates to a failure of process on the part of the State in this fatal shooting.<br />The draft order specifies that as Minister for Justice and Equality, I am the Minister responsible for overseeing administrative matters relating to the establishment of the commission, receiving its reports and performing any other function given to the Minister under the Act.  It also authorises me to set the commission&rsquo;s terms of reference.  I have arranged for the terms of reference to be provided for the members of the committee.  As provided for in section 5(2) of the 2004 Act, the terms of reference will be published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>.<br />I am also authorised by the draft order to appoint the member or members of the commission of investigation.  I will nominate a senior counsel to act as the sole member of the commission and inquire into the following matters: the circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of Ronan MacLochlainn on 1 May 1998 in Ashford, County Wicklow; and all relevant Garda matters, including the policies, practices and procedure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the planning and control of the operation which led to the fatal shooting and the training provided for personnel detailed for the Garda operation concerned.  The terms of reference provide that the commission shall keep Ms Gr&aacute;inne Nic Gibb, applicant in the case to the ECHR, involved in the investigation to the extent necessary to safeguard her legitimate interests.<br />The conduct of the commission of investigation is a matter for the sole member appointed to run it.  Essentially, the task of the commission is to decide whether the use of force by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this instance was proportionate.  It is envisaged that the commission will report in six months.  Based on this timeframe and excluding third party costs, the overall cost of the commission of investigation is estimated to be &euro;350,000.  In accordance with the provisions of the 2004 Act, following consultation with the commission and the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I will have guidelines prepared on the payment of legal costs and other expenses to persons who become involved with the commission.<br />Arising from the outcome of the case to the ECHR, it is necessary to proceed to establish a commission of investigation into this fatal shooting.  In accordance with the provision in section 3(2) of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, the approval of both Houses for the draft order is required.  Accordingly, I would be grateful for the support of the committee for the resolution before it.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the Minister's remark about not wishing to prejudice the proceedings, is it possible for her to indicate the outcome the commission of investigation is seeking in terms of the effective investigation into the shooting of Mr. MacLochlainn in 1998?  Specifically, will the investigation be looking into whether wrongdoing took place or is the purpose of this investigation simply to establish the facts?  Is there a question of wrongdoing on the part of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in carrying out their duties on the day?</p></speech>

The establishment of the commission meets our international obligations.  The internal investigations of the three bodies I referred to were deemed to be unacceptable.  A commitment was given in respect of the establishment of the commission of investigation to ensure we had a remedy.  The key issue relates to whether the use of force by the State was proportionate.  Deputy McGrath asked the same question.  That is the primary issue under consideration by the commission.</p></speech>

I thank them for forwarding their presentation which has been circulated, as has the report itself.<br />By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br />I invite the Ombudsman to make his presentation.</p></speech>

I will make some brief introductory remarks after which we can get into discussion.</p><p>  The Office of the Ombudsman has two jobs.  One is to investigate complaints and to try to find redress for individuals.  The other is to try to promote improvement in public services.  This report fits very much into the latter.  It was not a report designed to hold individual hospitals to account.  It is a report produced in conjunction with the Irish Hospice Foundation to try to highlight ways in which services for people at the end of their lives could be improved in our public hospitals and elsewhere in the health service.</p><p>  The report tries to do that by deriving its power from the stories of the people who came to us either with their complaints or their loved ones who came to us to complain on their behalf.  It is intended, if one likes, to try to promote better services in the future for people who are reaching the end of their lives and put forward some simple propositions as to how services could be improved.  Although there are many themes, the single biggest theme that comes across is the importance of good communication so that patients and their family members understand what is going on.  They need to understand the role of the clinicians and what is likely to happen.  They need to get the support they need at what is a very difficult stage.</p><p>  Fundamentally the report tries to illustrate the circumstances around a death being managed well - where people understand what is happening, where they have access to privacy which they need and where they have access to the support they need.  One cannot get over the grief that is associated with a death, but we can ensure that people do not go on being troubled and upset by the nature of what happened around the process of dying.  We cannot take away the grief, but we can make things as good as possible to ensure the person is comfortable, that they are without pain, that their loved ones are with them, that they have access to whatever support they might need by way of religious rights and that the whole process is handled with dignity.</p><p>  That is all I want to say by way of introduction.  The report and my comments stand for themselves.</p></speech>

As he said, this is a somewhat unusual report for us.  We spend a considerable amount of time talking about accountability and effectively trying to find someone to blame.  It is quite refreshing to have a report that does not take that approach and rather assembles the stories and finds some common themes, as the Ombudsman has done very adequately.  In Ireland, the area of death is one we are not great at and we are learning to be better at it.</p><p>  The Irish Hospice Foundation does extraordinary work in its own right.  I pay tribute to it and to Ms Angela Edgehill who is a terrific director.  Having a programme on television was really useful and I am sure the Office of the Ombudsman got extraordinary feedback from that.  The more we talk about the problems associated with death, the more likely we are to create an environment in hospitals where that becomes the expected thing and becomes a natural part of how we are without having to write out long recommendations.  However, having said that, we need to put come protocols in place.  I have read the report carefully.  I am sure the Ombudsman is aware that the Joint Committee on Health and Children launched a report today, which is obviously very valuable.  We are all singing from the same hymn sheet here, but the more often we talk about it and the more people we involve, the greater the possibility of broadening the reach of the message, which is very important.</p><p>  Does the Ombudsman have a view on how to engineer a change in hospitals?  One of the recommendations in the other report was to have a person who is responsible.  It takes much more than just having a person, does it not?  The Office of the Ombudsman has the opportunity to look closely at all those stories that people sent in, many of them very painful.  They opened up their hearts, albeit they did not start out thinking they would end up in a report such as this.  I am sure they are very grateful that this is what happened.</p><p>  What does the Ombudsman believe can be done?  While I have commended the publication of the report, I am concerned that because it does not point fingers and highlight what is wrong, it may have the capacity to gather dust.  When I wrote to the Chairman asking for the Ombudsman to be invited to appear before the committee, I believe I used that expression - I certainly did so when talking on radio about it.  I do not want that to happen.  Given the painful experiences people have shared with the Office of the Ombudsman, I do not want people to say, "That was a good idea, but we could not take it further".  It is a challenge for the Office of the Ombudsman and for us as a committee to know how we can help to be part of the process.</p> <p>We are making a start by engaging in the discussion.  As the Ombudsman sees it, what steps should be taken by members and his office to keep the momentum going?  I have a particular concern about the guidelines on resuscitation.  The request not to resuscitate clearly presents a very complex issue.  Partners' and families' rights and so on also present very difficult issues.  It is a particular issue that could cause many difficulties and clearly has.</p></speech>

From my perspective, leadership at a clinical and an administrative level within the health services is where the fundamental change needs to happen.  It needs to happen in a way that attends to the culture on individual wards in hospitals.  There are issues about physical infrastructure that can be put in place in order that people have a separate space in the time leading up to the death and also to be with their loved one after death.  There are elements which can be put in place and one can recommend that every acute hospital put them in place, but more of these elements relate to the culture of care on the ward and the way clinicians are trained in the initial training and also as they go forward.  The advantage of the hospice friendly hospital programme being in place is that one can point to a template for how to things well.  The report should lend impetus to that piece of work, on which we will continue to work with the Irish Hospice Foundation.  I too commend it for its work on this issue and also for the work it has done, as the Senator says, to bring the issue to the attention of many more individuals, clinicians and managers.  Hospitals need to have a strategy in place on how they deal with end of life cases.  In terms of a follow-up, we have in a sense commended a template to it.  We have put forward examples of how not to do things, but we can see what complaints are coming in and look at whether hospitals are implementing best practice set out both in this report and the report of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and the work of the Irish Hospice Foundation.  </p><p>  There is a strange ambiguity about Irish attitudes to death.  The traditions around it made it much more real and personal.  The majority of people now die in hospital and the numbers are striking.  Each day 35 people die in an acute hospital in Ireland and this, in a sense, has moved it out of communities and away from people's experience to something that happens elsewhere.  It is particularly important that it be dealt with well.  In that sense, we will continue to work with the Irish Hospice Foundation.  We will also work with the HSE to ensure it is driving the issue forward.  We will support the recommendations that there be a strategy and an individual responsible for the strategy in place in each acute hospital setting.  We will then monitor change through the number of complaints received.  If we continue to receive complaints, that will give us much more leverage to actually say it is not good enough and that the hospital should have been implementing the findings and that we want it to do so as a consequence of the investigation or examination we have undertaken.</p></speech>

Because they were generally dealt with at examination stage, the recommendations would have been agreed to.  This was not instead of giving individuals the redress they wanted, but very many of them came to the office, saying their primary motivation was to ensure that what they had experienced would not be experienced by anyone else.  In a sense, what we have done is deal with the second stage; we have not just resolved the issue with the individual hospital but also tried to drive the learning more widely across health services.</p></speech>

T&aacute;imid an-bhu&iacute;och gur th&aacute;inig siad isteach.  I thank the Office of the Ombudsman for the report.  It is interesting for members to come at it from a different angle.  Is Mr. Tyndall telling us that, in one sense, the report is a benchmark and that the Office of the Ombudsman is laying down the baseline for future data that will be the benchmark the office will use in measuring improvements in this area?  </p><p>  Has there been a change in the trend of complaints when one looks at complaints made a number of years back, or has it been similar?  Is there any sense that part of the problem is that clinicians and staff are under such pressure that the way in which they handle an issue is not intentional but the result of not having thought things through and that if they had more space and time, they could do this?  </p><p>  Mr. Tyndall referred to 35 people a day dying in acute hospitals.  Is that an increasing trend in the past couple of years?  How many complaints point to a lack of services to allow people to die in peace at home with the support of their loved ones?  Have cultural issue comes into play?  I have been at a number of funerals in the past year or so, one of which was the funeral of an African child and I was quite taken by the difference in the way that they mourned their children.  It was a very sad  ceremony and very different from the traditional Irish wake.  I am aware also that the Muslim community has a very different way of dealing with death.  Perhaps as a nation we have been slow to take on these cultural differences.</p><p>  The Office of the Ombudsman has instigated a report on a good death.  Is Mr. Tyndall thinking of producing similar reports on issues about which he has received a number of complaints on a theme?  We have mentioned the issue of direct provision accommodaton and prison services which are not necessarily under the ambit of the Ombudsman; therefore, he cannot conduct a specific investigation, but would he consider producing a similar report because there has been a series of similar complaints?</p></speech>

There is no question but that we will be producing more themed reports.  It is a good way of generalising what has been learned.  It sits alongside the casebook, the first of which is due to be brought out in the autumn.  The question is how do we ensure we do not keep repeating the same mistakes.  There is no question in my mind that staff in the health service are working under extreme pressure.  People will say they are struggling to find time to do the job well.  That said, the issues around palliative care and so are non-negotiable.  Should people be in pain because staff are too busy?  Should they not have access to adequate food and water?  Should they not be treated with dignity and respect?</p> <p>Ultimately, it is for me as Ombudsman to say that regardless of whether these things were caused - as they may have been in a small number of instances - by resource pressures, much of the time they are caused by the failure of leadership to create positive cultures around care.  I will continue to highlight them.  In a sense, there is a line over which one must not stray.  Whether an issue arises because of resource pressures, individual failure of leadership and management or a failure of training it is still for me to highlight it.  Ms McNally will speak to the committee about trends and compliance.</p></speech>

Approximately 10% of the complaints received by the office relate to health and social care.  While many of the complaints received relate to the HSE, they related more to monetary than other matters.  That 10% compares with 50% in other jurisdictions such as Wales.  As such, the number of complaints received in this regard is small.  A large percentage of those complaints down through the years would have related to end of life care.  While only a relatively small number of complaints are received the fact that the same complaint continues to be made highlights that this is a constant issue.</p><p>  In regard to the question about numbers, the Irish Hospice Foundation is the most appropriate organisation to answer them.  The statistic of 35, or 43%, of people dying every day in hospital arises from the Irish Hospice Foundation's audit of end of life care.  I understand there is an intention to repeat that audit.  </p><p>  On whether it is our intention to do similar reports, as stated by the Ombudsman as this issue had been a regular theme over a number of years it was dear to his heart that this report be done first.  There are other themes emerging which the Ombudsman is committed to examining.  Obviously, we have limited resources and as such we cannot do everything at once.  We would hope to undertake a number of similar reports in the next couple of years. </p></speech>

However, resources are an issue.  It is possible to deliver good palliative and nursing care to people in their own homes but this requires services which are sufficiently well resourced.  There are excellent examples of this but there needs to be more.</p></speech>

I am on record as saying, as is my predecessor, that some of the most vulnerable people in our communities do not have access to proper independent redress.  This must be a matter of concern for this committee and people in general.  I believe this needs to change and I will continue to make the case for change in this area.  Where people are denied their rights because they are not citizens of a particular country and are, because of this, living in circumstances over which they have very little influence, this is where the demand for independent redress should be highest.  It is unusual across Europe for people in these circumstances not to have access to the national ombudsman.  I do not believe that is right and it should change.  My views on that are unambiguous.</p><p>  On cultural diversity, I am conscious of the issues around cultural diversity, including the different traditions of dealing with death in terms of mourning, burial and so on.  This has not featured particularly in the complaints to my office.  However, it is an issue we would be alert to.  The complaints we receive relate more to the increased numbers of people dying in hospital as to opposed to elsewhere.  One of the most remarked upon features of hospitals is the age profile of their populations.  Very high proportions of people in hospital are in their eighties and increasing proportions of people in hospitals have dementia and other conditions associated with ageing.  A consequence of this is that the demands placed on clinical and nursing staff in particular are very different from what they were in the past.  I am not convinced that in producing our nursing and clinical staff for the future we have reflected the changes in the nature of the job they will be asked to do in our acute hospitals.  I intend to have conversations around this with the bodies responsible for clinical staff in the health service.  It is important I have conversations with them as a matter of course but these are areas I will want to explore with them.  </p><p>  In a sense, this report also gives me the basis for a conversation with those who are committed to producing our future doctors and nurses around the issues that need to feature more in training than was necessarily the case in the past.</p></speech>

A number of the nursing homes already come within my jurisdiction because of the fact that they receive State funding.  I am pleased at the moves to extend my jurisdiction in this field.  In my view, regardless of who is paying, people need to have access to redress.</p></speech>

This report has been circulated to medical and nursing schools.  We want to maximise learning from the report.  The Ombudsman has spoken at events for student and qualified nurses.  I recall that at one such event a nurse stood up and said in relation to a story which the Ombudsman told that it had made the hair stand up on the back of her neck.  It is the power of the story versus a piece of theory or a standard.  We would hope that schools and hospitals will use some of the stories in this report to make the hair stand up on the back of the neck of staff and thus make them aware of how easily things can go wrong and the effort that is required to provide a really good, dignified service at the end of life.</p></speech>

It confronts people with the consequences of their practice.  People do not set out to provide a poor service.  Often what happens is the result of staff being busy and under pressure.  To some extent, to provide this type of service day-in and day-out one has to detach oneself from emotion.  It is helpful, therefore, to remind people from time to time about how patients and their families feel about what is happening.  The more we can encourage this, the better.</p></speech>

During a previous interaction between the committee and the Ombudsman, he raised with us the need to ensure that all public services, whether delivered by a private or public company, come under the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman, which is an issue that arises not only in Ireland but throughout Europe.  It is an issue on which the committee would like to work further in the autumn with the Ombudsman.  It is a key issue.  I commend the Ombudsman on his endeavours in that respect.</p></speech>

I hope it will have the intended effect of bringing about a guaranteed minimum service or standard.</p> <p>Ms McNally raised the point of why there are not many complaints.  Some of this relates to the Irish approach to death, as has been noted, and if somebody dies, people may not want to resurrect issues surrounding the death or dwell on the matter so they move on.  I have found that people often do not want to make a complaint because they do not want an incident to reflect badly on other staff.  A person may wish to complain about nurses on a night shift or a doctor but could feel the complaint would reflect on the entire team helping a loved one.  There may be a case for family meetings to be held within a very short timeframe.  I have experienced every part of the hospital service in the past year so I could tell the committee much more than some of the doctors in hospitals near me.</p><p> I have been made aware that sometimes there is a failure by the hospital - although it may not be the hospital's fault - to share information with a family because the person being treated wants to put on a brave face and will not allow medical staff to share the issues with the family.  They may say they are not doing badly or they are not in pain.  They may not want help.  That can lead to conflict as an adult is entitled to privacy and information.  If somebody is to care for a person at home and take on that responsibility, I do not know how we can get to grips with conflicts that can arise, as the carers should be entitled to information as well.  If a patient, whether it is a mother or brother, is going home, a carer must be informed as to whether he or she could be violent, for example, or wake in the night screaming.  One would not be aware of such behaviour if one is just visiting a patient in hospital for an hour or 30 minutes.  A person making arrangements for home care may not know the consequences of particular medication or bouts of lucidity mixed with anger.  We must consider how physicians and nursing staff can share information in such scenarios so a family taking on care in the last weeks or months of a person's life can understand the full consequences of what is being taken on.</p><p> It is good that we are talking about this issue and moving in a specific direction.  It may make it easier for patients in future to avoid just putting on a brave face and asking to be brought home.</p></speech>

Families in such cases feel medical staff are keeping knowledge from them but, as the Deputy describes, the loved one has decided to do that.  It is difficult because once a person is capable of making decisions, a doctor must respect it.  That can make life very difficult.</p><p>  Where a person is going home, there are issues about people preparing themselves to care for that loved one.  The carer may not know the precise nature of the condition or the impact of medication, and these are difficult issues.  Sometimes there is not a straightforward and right answer and the hope is people will feel a little more confident in allowing clinicians to share the requirements with family and some of the conversation around these issues.  I again commend the Irish Hospice Foundation on the work it did with RTE on developing the programme.  Perhaps we need to get better at speaking about these issues.  I hope the contribution of our office will help the debate move forward and make people feel more comfortable.  When there are happy family events on the horizon, one can understand people choosing to minimise the fact that their life is limited because of a fear of detracting from the happiness of family events.  That is very understandable.</p></speech>

If the hospital cannot say much to the family, it should at least ensure there is some support in the community, with a public health nurse or community psychiatric nurse calling out to see how things are going or offer support.  After a few weeks there may be a greater willingness to share so those support services are important.  There have been unfortunate episodes where the hospital forgot to send a referral letter, etc., so such issues are critical.</p></speech>

Ultimately, it should be a clinical decision and there should be full communication with the patient and the family if requested.  It would be preferable for that to happen.  People do not understand that it takes pressure from both the individual and the family if there is a realisation that the decision would be primarily clinical.  There is the possibility that people would feel disengaged from the process as a consequence and there is a need to improve guidance.  It is a difficult area and sometimes it is clear that to be involved in very invasive efforts to save a person's life is not appropriate when practically there is no prospect of extending the life or where quality of life would be significantly damaged by the condition and intervention.  Explaining this to individuals and ensuring not only that guidance is right, but that communication is appropriate, can be challenging.  There is more work to be done.</p></speech>

While a complex dynamic of fast-moving events ultimately came into play, how two concerts became five can be explained by one observation: the informed music industry opinion of the artist's appeal, based on entirely reasonable assumptions, was simply overwhelmed by what can only be called an extraordinary and utterly unpredictable social phenomenon.  Let me explain.  Garth Brooks in recent years had played only occasional concerts in the USA, had not toured abroad for many years, had not been in Ireland since 1997, and had not released newly recorded material since 2001.  Two concerts, catering for 160,000 people, seemed perfectly adequate, particularly as the same artist had drawn a total of 140,000 fans on his last appearance in Ireland.  These reasonable assumptions were, however, rendered redundant by the truly astonishing demand for tickets.  This was simply a case where a public reaction utterly defied logic and conventional wisdom.  Within two hours, three concerts had sold out and an incredible total of 240,000 tickets were sold.  What had simply been a concert became a national event; what had simply been a night out became an unmissable national celebration.  There may be something particularly and exuberantly Irish in the way people suddenly became aware that they were creating, and would be participating in, what would be the great Irish celebratory experience of the summer of 2014.  An irresistible social force took over, and suddenly five concerts had sold out and 400,000 tickets had been sold.</p><p>  When Aiken Promotions, aware of what was happening after three concerts had instantly sold out, approached Croke Park seeking two extra nights, we had concerns about the impact on the local community of a larger than usual number of concerts taking place on successive evenings.  These concerns, however, were allayed somewhat by several factors.  One, there was to be a two-month gap between the One Direction concerts and those of Garth Brooks.  Two, the Brooks audience would be easily managed and very unlikely to be troublesome.  Three, concert licences in Dublin have never been declined; moreover, Croke Park concerts are run to the absolute highest standards.  Indeed, Dublin City Council told us that the One Direction concerts were run as close as it is possible to get to a textbook standard.  Four, Croke Park has never run more than three concerts on consecutive nights since its redevelopment in 1993 and did not host any concerts in 2013, and this would be a one-off national event over five nights that would never be repeated.  Finally, in agreeing to the request from Aiken Promotions for two extra concerts in Croke Park, the GAA was conscious of its own tradition of making the stadium available for important events of national significance, be it the Special Olympics, soccer and rugby internationals, the Eucharistic Congress or a possible Rugby World Cup in Ireland.</p><p>  Of course the GAA was set to make extra money from the extra concerts.  That is exactly the point: it was extra money, bonus revenue that we had not allowed for in our budgets and that we were not dependent upon.  We were content with two concerts, while a third was already a bonus.  In any case, concerts or no concerts, the GAA will drive on with its plans for 2014.</p><p>  I would also like to clear up some confusion that exists in the public mind about the number of concerts permitted in Croke Park.  Croke Park has planning permission for three concerts per annum.  This is in-perpetuity permission.  If we wish to hold additional events catering for more than 5,000 people, we must apply for a special events licence.  The Garth Brooks concerts were such events.  The mechanism of special events licensing is the most common approach employed in Dublin, and Croke Park's use of this mechanism is not unusual.  For example, concerts in Marlay Park, the Phoenix Park and the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, as well as the St. Patrick's Day Parade, etc., are all licensed.  We have successfully applied for special events licences in the past and have never been refused by Dublin City Council.  Legally, there is no limit to the number of special event licences we may apply for.</p><p>  I would like to turn now to the issue of Croke Park's neighbours and to the GAA's relationship with these residents.  In his mediator's report on the long-term management of concerts in Croke Park, Kieran Mulvey noted the lack of trust expressed by residents' representatives in Croke Park.  On the one hand, I accept that we need to work harder to change that negative perception where it exists.  On the other hand, there are two unpalatable facts that must be faced: first, not all of those who objected most vociferously to the concerts even live in the area adjacent to Croke Park, and, second, many of the objections lodged with Dublin City Council were fraudulent.  In addition, it has to be recognised, and it is now clear, that the majority of residents in the area were not opposed to the staging of five concerts.</p><p>  It is important, too, that everyone be aware of the very positive elements of the relationship we have developed with the Croke Park residents, notably through our community gain initiatives.  The GAA spent &euro;1.5 million to provide a community centre on Distillery Road, and we employ a full-time community and public relations officer to liaise with local residents.  We established the Croke Park community fund in 2008, through which the GAA donates &euro;100,000 every year to the community located within 1.5 km of Croke Park.  Since 2008 we have allocated over &euro;500,000 to local community initiatives, groups, charities, and individual streets and associations.  This year alone, the GAA has funded 22 local groups, covering street committees, local sports and cultural groups, local charities and day-care centres.  Under our youth community gain initiatives, the GAA subsidises the participation every year of children from the area in the Croke Park community GAA C&uacute;l camps.  This summer, over 200 local children participated in the camp.  We also run a weekly computer coding class in Croke Park for children from the community; these are free of charge and are well attended every week.  The GAA also distributes match tickets to local residents.  Elsewhere, in a composting and recycling initiative, 15 tonnes of Croke Park compost was given free to local community gardens and homes in 2014.  Finally, every Christmas the GAA organises and funds a Christmas party for senior citizens from the local community; the 2013 party was attended by 650 local people.</p><p>  These facts, I hope, give an indication of how seriously the GAA takes its relationship with the local Croke Park community and how it strives to treat this community with respect and consideration.  These same principles informed our engagement with this community over the Garth Brooks concerts.  We were genuinely concerned about the impact on the local community of a larger-than-usual number of concerts taking place on successive evenings.  The GAA, therefore, in conjunction with Aiken Promotions, undertook an extensive and vigorous consultation process with the local community so as to better understand, address and resolve local concerns relating to access, parking, cleaning and any possible anti-social behaviour arising from the concerts.  This consultation process had four distinct stages: we held a local residents' meeting on 12 February; we held two meetings, on 18 February and 11 March, with local public representatives; in the first half of March, we sent out a survey questionnaire to 27,000 households living within 1.5 km of Croke Park; and at the end of March, we ran a community information sharing forum at which we communicated the results of this survey to local residents.  At this meeting, we gave a draft events plan for the concerts to local residents, and management personnel from Croke Park and Aiken Promotions discussed this with residents.  The feedback we received from residents through this process was recorded, reviewed and used where possible in the drafting of a hugely comprehensive event-management plan that was ultimately submitted to Dublin City Council as part of the licence application.</p><p>  It is fair to say that Croke Park has a reputation for running well-organised and safe events.</p> <p>It has developed a close working relationship with Dublin City Council in the successful staging of these events.  A spirit of honest exchange and mutual trust has characterised the relationship between Croke Park and senior Dublin City Council officials and this approach has ensured all concerns are adequately dealt with in finalised event management plans for major events.</p><p> The planning for the Garth Brooks concerts followed the protocols established by previous events held in Croke Park.  As part of this process, it is customary to hold formal and informal discussions with statutory agencies and Dublin City Council to review event-specific issues and agree a joint strategy for addressing these issues before committing to an event management plan.  During our discussions with Dublin City Council the impact of five shows on local residents was always raised.  During both informal and formal discussions the council stressed heavily the need for what it called additionality in our licence application, in other words, the need to do things that had not been done before in the staging of such events, for example, in the quality and extent of the arrangements.  I stress the vital point that at no stage was there ever even a hint that a licence would not be granted for all five concerts.  Prior to the submission of the draft event management plan for the concerts and the application for an event licence, the Croke Park stadium director, Mr. Peter McKenna, received a telephone call from Mr. Owen Keegan, chief executive of Dublin City Council, who was returning a call made by Mr. McKenna to Mr. Keegan.  In their telephone conversation Mr. Keegan advised Mr. McKenna that Dublin City Council would support a licence application for all five concerts.  Mr. Keegan asked Mr. McKenna to make the decision making process as easy as possible for Dublin City Council.  Mr. McKenna assured Mr. Keegan that he and his team would work closely with Mr. Keegan's colleague, Mr. John Downey, in making a complete and comprehensive submission.  Mr. McKenna also assured Mr. Keegan that he would ensure the One Direction concerts would be held in an exemplary manner.  All further liaison with Dublin City Council after that conversation was with Mr. Downey.</p><p> As preparations for the Garth Brooks concerts continued, the One Direction concerts held in Croke Park on 23, 24 and 25 May were used to trial additional event management measures, as follows.  A residents-based community team was deployed to monitor the cordon area with the primary function of assisting fellow residents.  Additional garda&iacute; were deployed to support Dublin street parking services in order to enforce legal parking.  A co-ordinated public transport and parking information campaign was run in conjunction with Dublin City Council and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A 24 hour community freefone hotline was staffed by members of the community team during the concert period.  An additional community litter team was deployed to support the Dublin City Council cleaning operation.  These new measures were hugely successful and only three complaints were lodged with Dublin City Council over the three nights of the concerts, a low figure that is unprecedented in the running of major events running in the city.  Some 240,000 people attended over three nights.</p><p> After the One Direction concerts, Croke Park and Aiken Promotions met Dublin City Council on 3 June to address some concerns raised about the originally submitted works schedule.  An amended works schedule was presented and accepted, detailing a five event schedule.  To stress how clear was the understanding that a licence for all five concerts would be granted, Dublin City Council officials, in informal discussions prior to a decision on the licence application being announced, expressed the hope the Mulvey report would be released before a decision on the licence was made public in order that it would be clear to residents that there was a longer term plan in place for the management of concerts in Croke Park.</p><p> I acknowledge that Croke Park values its positive working relationship with Dublin City Council.  The joint approach to additional measures was clearly visible in the success of the One Direction concerts and the collaboration between Croke Park and Dublin City Council in general event planning leads to important attention to detail and a joint commitment to getting things right.  However, I am obliged to emphasise that all of our contact with Dublin City Council on the Garth Brooks concerts led us to believe we would be granted a licence for all five concerts.  At no stage was Croke Park alerted to the need to prepare contingency plans for a smaller number of concerts.  It would have been crucial for Croke Park to have been alerted to prepare such contingency plans.  Members can imagine, for example, the huge scale of the security operation necessary to deal with even a small percentage of the 160,000 fans who might attempt to gain access to shows for which they had no ticket.  Such contingency plans would have required a multi-agency approach.</p><p> I would like to touch on a small number of other issues relating to the ultimate refusal to grant a licence for the five concerts.  On Thursday, 3 July, I heard about the decision to grant a licence for only three concerts from a friend of mine shortly before I was contacted by Mr. Owen Keegan at 9.15 a.m.  I told him of my shock at the decision and called him back about an hour later to ask him not to sign off on the decision to grant a licence for only three concerts to give us time to consider the ramifications of the decision.  He said the decision had already been made and signed off on and could not be appealed.  Despite our excellent record in running concerts at Croke Park, despite Dublin City Council's praise for our running of the One Direction concerts, despite the quality of the submission and the total commitment to formulating the licence application according to the letter of the law, and despite a long-standing relationship with Dublin City Council, apparently, we did not even deserve the courtesy of being allowed to consider and, possibly, address the grounds for the refusal to grant a licence for five concerts.</p><p> I would like to address some of the points made by Mr. Owen Keegan, chief executive of Dublin City Council, in his written submission yesterday to the committee.  Dublin City Council refused the application for five concerts for three reasons.  The first reason offered is that five concerts over five evenings would be "unprecedented for Croke Park".  We agree that it would be unprecedented, but how does the notion of something being "unprecedented" automatically disqualify it?  Should the licence application not have been considered on its own merits, regardless of whether something had happened in the past?  The lack of a precedent seems to be an excessively conservative and unprogressive reason to invoke.  One wonders how transformation and improvement in society would ever occur if we allowed our decisions to be dictated only by the way we did things in the past.  In any case, establishing a precedent does not tie one's hands for the future.  Saying "Yes" today does not mean that we cannot say "No" tomorrow.  One simply decides on the merits of things as they occur, as we believe should have been the case in this instance.</p><p> The second reason offered for the refusal of the licence for five concerts was that the Garth Brooks and One Direction concerts together would, for Dublin City Council, have represented "an over-intensification of use" of Croke Park.  This is an argument that is employed rather selectively.  We did not hear anything about over-intensification of the use of Croke Park during the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road when Croke Park was needed to host international soccer and rugby internationals which were, of course, in addition to Croke Park's own schedule of match days and concerts.  Should the IRFU's application to host either the 2023 or 2027 Rugby World Cup in Ireland be successful, Croke Park will be required for a total of seven matches, again in addition to Croke Park's own schedule of match days, plus its quota of three concerts.  Is there anyone here who seriously imagines that an argument about over-intensification of use of Croke Park will be allowed to interfere with these seven rugby World Cup matches in Croke Park?  I think there is not.</p><p> The final reason offered for the refusal of the licence for five concerts was that it would have led to "an unacceptable level of disruption" for local residents and some businesses.  I have already addressed in detail Croke Park's excellent record in the staging of concerts, Dublin City Council's recognition of the textbook running of the One Direction concerts, the extra measures put in place - trialled at the One Direction concerts - to manage the Garth Brooks concerts and our complete willingness to comply with Dublin City Council's request for additionality in the management of the event.</p> <p>It would appear, however, that Dublin City Council was swayed by the submissions it received that objected to the holding of five concerts.  Here we arrive at the most disturbing aspect of the entire business because Mr. Keegan acknowledged that: "Dublin City Council was contacted by a number of individuals stating that they had not made submissions/observations on this licence application."  Clearly, these fraudulent submissions objected to the five concert application.  Mr. Keegan further stated that: "11 such instances came to the attention of the Council.  The matter was referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for their attention on 12 June 2014."  Eleven fraudulent submissions is bad enough.  How do we know that this was the full extent of the fraudulent submissions?  Mr. Keegan implied that Dublin City Council only became aware of such fraud when people whose names had been falsely used contacted them.  It is not unreasonable to assume there may have been many more fraudulent submissions, given what was quite clearly an orchestrated campaign to prevent a licence for five concerts, through fair means or foul.</p><p> Given that Dublin City Council was clearly influenced by the vociferous campaign waged by a small minority to block the concerts, a campaign waged heavily in national media and of which Dublin City Council was clearly aware, as its submission yesterday acknowledged, and given that there was incontrovertible evidence of fraudulent submissions objecting to the granting of five licences, surely Dublin City Council should have been alerted to the fact that its own licensing process was being seriously manipulated and distorted by people opposed to the five concerts.  Alerted to this fraud a full three weeks before reaching the decision to grant a licence for three concerts only, Dublin City Council should have taken the time to cast a more rigorously sceptical eye on the nature and extent of the opposition to the five concerts and perhaps reached a different decision.  It is in this light that, in a written submission of 4,000 words, Dublin City Council's offering of a mere 34 words on the impact of the manipulation of its licensing process, is surprising to say the least.  Even more disconcerting is the verdict reached by Dublin City Council in the 34 words: "Accordingly, while it is disturbing that so many submissions may now be called into question, it does not, in the opinion of the City Council, interfere with the integrity of the decision arrived at."  If Dublin City Council itself admits that "so many submissions may now be called in to question", how can it conclude that this does not interfere with the integrity of its decision?  Surely that is exactly what the fraudulent submissions did to the integrity of its decision.  What more conclusive and damning proof could there be that the integrity of Dublin City Council's decision had been undermined by the submissions process being manipulated and distorted in the unique goal of persuading Dublin City Council not to grant a licence for five concerts?</p><p> My final comment in response to Dublin City Council's written submission relates to the matter of the major economic loss to the country due to the decision not to grant a licence for five concerts.  Again, Dublin City Council offered only a few very brief sentences in its submission on this question and seemed to imply that potential economic benefits are simply not a consideration in its decision-making where concert licence applications are concerned.  However, Dublin City Council said that potential benefits are "not central" in its decision-making.  That does not seem to say that economic benefits are not considered at all, only that Dublin City Council does not seem to consider them very important when considering licence applications.  If only it had done so on this occasion.</p><p> I will conclude with these comments.  I reiterate that the GAA fully accepts the recommendations made by the mediator, Kieran Mulvey, on the future staging of concerts in Croke Park.  We cannot say fairer than that.  The GAA wants a strong, mutually respectful and mutually beneficial relationship with Croke Park residents, a relationship that has been made difficult in the past as there has not been one coherent group representing residents with which we could engage.</p><p> Finally, the bigger issues raised by this affair need to be seriously addressed.  Listeners to these remarks will gather that Croke Park feels let down by the process.  More than that, the country has been let down.  I do not think it unreasonable to claim that the people of Ireland, and those abroad who have followed this affair, find the decision to refuse a licence for five concerts incomprehensible. They are right.  It is incomprehensible.</p><p> Let us consider the reality of what we all knew when the licence application for five concerts was submitted.  It meant 400,000 people - 330,000 of our citizens and 70,000 tourists from abroad - had paid a substantial sum of money to buy tickets for the concerts, flights and book hotels.  These people were set to present the country with the undreamed-of gift of a massive economic uplift.  We all knew this but what did we do?  We said "No" and in so doing we turned our backs on an enormous financial windfall, and denied a vast number of people the pleasure of enjoying a great social and cultural occasion.  Moreover, we made a decision that can be considered undemocratic because the wishes of a truly enormous number of people were ignored.</p><p> Dublin City Council tells us that the decision reached was "appropriate, balanced and reasonable".  Was that the case for the 400,000 people who had bought tickets and looked forward to the concerts?  We had the opportunity to grant ourselves a joyful celebration and to enjoy a unique national, social and cultural experience that we would have fondly remembered for years.  We have now lost all of this and, as is the way of these things, we only realise the enormity of what we lost when it is too late to do anything about it.  How could we have so lost sight of the bigger picture?  How could we have lost sight of the people's decision to have a national celebration and their willingness to pour money into the economy?  How could we have become so side-tracked as to commit such a self-inflicted wound on the country?</p></speech>

Aiken Promotions has promoted shows all over Ireland for 53 years.  Throughout this time, we have operated to the highest standards in terms of business practice and the planning and staging of events.</p><p>  In late December 2013 I concluded a deal with Bob Doyle, Garth Brooks' manager, and also with Peter McKenna of Croke Park for two shows on 25 and 26 July 2014.  On 20 January 2014, Garth visited Croke Park to announce that he was returning after 17 years, and would come out of retirement and film his comeback special - a live concert broadcast from Croke Park in Dublin.  There was widespread coverage of the press conference nationally and worldwide.  It became apparent there was going to be huge demand for tickets because people started queuing as soon as the press conference took place.  I spoke again with Bob Doyle and Peter McKenna and told them that there definitely could be a third show, we should have it ready to cope with demand if the first two shows sold out.  Tickets went on sale at 9 a.m. on 30 January.  The three shows sold out in two hours with thousands of people still queuing at outlets and thousands of people online trying to purchase tickets.</p><p>  After tickets went on sale, the media coverage was extensive and focused on the desperation of fans queuing for tickets all over Ireland.  It also highlighted some technical difficulties which meant some people could not get tickets in some areas.  Plus, there were reports that tickets were starting to exchange hands for hugely inflated prices.  I had further conversations with Bob Doyle and also with Peter McKenna.  In direct response to the demand, we agreed to do one more show and possibly a fifth one.</p><p>  On 1 February, our event controller called the Dublin city manager to inform him of the plans for additional shows and he expressed appreciation for the courtesy of letting him know.  On 3 February the fourth show was announced.  On Wednesday, 5 February, a meeting was held at Croke Park which was attended by Aiken Promotions, Croke Park and the Garda to discuss the Garth Brooks event, including the potential impact on the community and how it might be addressed.</p><p>  On 6 February, tickets were released for the fourth show and again it was an instant sell-out.  I spoke again to Bob Doyle and again to Peter McKenna and it was agreed to release the fifth show for sale which sold out immediately.</p><p>  On Wednesday, 12 February, a meeting was held with Dublin City Council.  I was accompanied by the event controller and the licensing and safety officer for Aiken Promotions.  Attending the meeting from the council was the city manager, the executive manager and the licensing officer.  The meeting was constructive.</p> <p>Dublin City Council did inform us that it would be a big ask to do five consecutive days at Croke Park and that it would be looking for additionality to the standard arrangements to address the impact on the local community.  We also discussed the timeframe for submitting the licence application and the potential benefits to the city.</p><p> On 12 February, a meeting chaired by a community representative was held with local residents where a number of objections were raised, not all of which related to the Garth Brooks concerts.  The meeting was attended by Aiken Promotions who were on hand to respond to specific inquiries regarding the Garth Brooks event. </p><p> On 18 February, Aiken Promotions and Croke Park met with local politicians where a number of concerns were discussed along with some constructive proposals.  On 11 March, a second meeting took place between Aiken Promotions, Croke Park and the political representatives for the local area.  On 21 March, Aiken Promotions and Croke Park met with garda&iacute; to discuss the event.</p><p> On 29 March, an open day was held at Croke Park for local residents.  At this, the plans were available for inspection as well as a rolling PowerPoint presentation summarising the main points of the event.  Croke Park and Aiken Promotions representatives were available to answer questions and record comments.</p><p> On 3 April, I met with Bob Doyle and the rest of the Garth Brooks team in Nashville.  They made a general inquiry about the status of the licence.  I relayed to them that Peter McKenna had spoken to the city manager and he had been told that we would get the licence for the five shows.</p><p> On 17 April, the licence application was submitted to Dublin City Council, 14 weeks before the event.  It has been wrongly reported that we left this to the last minute to submit to Dublin City Council.  This was in fact submitted four weeks in advance of the current requirement which is ten weeks before an event. </p><p> On 13 May, Aiken Promotions met with Dublin Fire Brigade to review proposals in the licence application.</p><p> On 3 June, there was a meeting attended by Dublin City Council, Croke Park and Aiken Promotions to explain in great detail the schedule for removing all the production after the fifth show on Tuesday, 29 July, and returning Croke Park fit for purpose for the matches due to take place on Sunday, 3 August.  A schedule was agreed within the permitted working hours of 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.  Given that we were actively discussing the fifth show in such detail with Dublin City Council, surely this would have been an ideal opportunity for the council to raise objections or flag that this show was problematic.</p><p> On 5 June, Aiken Promotions attended a meeting with Dublin City Council regarding sound management.  No major concerns were expressed about the capability of Aiken Promotions to achieve compliance.  On 10 June, Aiken Promotions attended a meeting with the HSE to discuss the draft medical plan for the event.  That same day, we also attended a meeting at Store Street Garda Station regarding traffic management, at which a number of proposals were tabled by Aiken Promotions and appeared to be well received by all present.</p><p> On 16 June, the first statutory agencies meeting took place at Croke Park with contributions from all attending parties, including Dublin City Council, the Garda, the fire authority, the HSE and the venue.  On 23 June, the second statutory agencies' meeting took place at Croke Park with all relevant parties attending, including Dublin City Council.</p><p> On 2 July, at approximately 10.30 p.m., I received a call from my event controller to say that the city manager had phoned him to say they were only granting a licence for three concerts at Croke Park, the first three dates.  I immediately informed Bob Doyle of this development and his response was that it would not be acceptable as they had committed to doing five nights.  I relayed this position to the event controller who passed the message back to the city manager.  Shortly after, the city manager made contact again with a firm offer to grant the licence for four shows.  I again immediately relayed this to Bob Doyle who then brought Garth himself on to the phone to be updated on the situation.  Garth Brooks responded in the early hours of Thursday morning, 3 July, that he had agreed to do five shows and was committed to playing all five nights.  Garth treats his fans equally and fairly and, therefore, could not treat 160,000 people who had bought tickets for the fourth and fifth shows differently from the fans who had bought tickets for the first three nights, so his position would have to be that it was five shows or nothing.  I relayed this response back to the event controller who asked that Garth's position be considered by the council and a view on this conveyed back to us before 1 p.m. that day.</p><p> At 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 3 July - ahead of the 1 p.m. time discussed - the licence was issued by Dublin City Council for three shows only.  I immediately contacted Bob Doyle to advise him of the situation as, first, the licence had been issued publicly at an earlier time than expected; and, second, it was immediately being picked up on the newswires that permission had only been granted for three shows.  Since then, we have explored every option open to us with no success.  This is not a touring show.  The stage and production have been custom built for Croke Park and on such a scale that it simply could not be relocated to another venue.</p><p> On Wednesday, 9 July, I met with a senior civil servant to discuss the issues.  He suggested that I speak to the city manager.  During that meeting, in desperation to resolve the issue and without due consideration or any consultation with Garth Brooks, I put forward a number of different suggestions to see what options, if any, the council would be willing to review, or if the matter was closed from all angles.  This included doing five concerts as originally planned, possibly doing earlier shows on the Monday and Tuesday, and also the issue of possibly doing matin&eacute;es on Saturday and Sunday.  The matin&eacute;es on Saturday and Sunday was the only option that the city manager responded positively to.</p><p> On review, it was quickly evident that the option of doing matin&eacute;es on the Saturday and Sunday was neither desirable because of the safety and logistical implications, nor possible within the terms of the licence.  Despite this, as this option had been made public by the city manager and because of his encouraging response to consider a revision to the licence application, I did inform Garth Brooks who immediately rejected this on practical grounds - that is, he could not do five high-intensity performances over three days.  Also, a matin&eacute;e show would not provide the same experience one would get at night in terms of the production, in particular the benefits of the custom-built video and lighting rigs that had been specially designed for this event.</p><p> Over the following days, I engaged with the same senior civil servant and a range of other intermediaries to find a solution.  One of the suggestions was an uncontested judicial review based on the council agreeing to consider additional information.  I met with the city manager and the executive manager on Monday, 14 July to discuss the option of a judicial review but we failed to get their support.</p><p> There was an additional offer put forward by Dublin City Council to look at granting a licence for new dates in October to replace the fourth and fifth shows.  To follow the current licensing process, the application would be presented as a joint venture with Dublin City Council, as this only requires submission five weeks before event, rather than the ten weeks standard.  I ask the committee to note that it was impossible for Garth to accept this proposal as he was committed to a world tour which is due to start in Chicago on 4 September.  He was also already scheduled to perform elsewhere on the dates suggested.  Therefore, I had to confirm to Garth Brooks that evening that we could not secure any more than three shows in July.  As a result, Garth Brooks issued his own personal statement.  Aiken Promotions then issued a notice cancelling the shows.  Hindsight is a wonderful thing but I feel that an event which any city in the world would have been proud to host should have been viewed with an informed strategic eye and encouraged, not dismissed.</p><p> There are a few things I would like to emphasise.  The licensing system is what it is.  I followed the same process that I have followed for years in Dublin, as well as other counties around Ireland.  It is a well established custom and practice to sell tickets subject to licence.  I must state clearly that, by custom and practice, any residual impacts of a concert on an environment are dealt with through the conditions attached to the licence.  Our focus throughout all formal and informal contacts with Dublin City Council and all statutory agencies was to deliver above and beyond the standard requirements and practices to ease the impact of five concerts in recognition of the unique circumstances of this event.  There was never a discussion on the number of shows being reduced, only on the impact that the five nights would have.</p><p> I accept the procedure and that the elements of the process were correctly followed, but I feel that the decision-making process was not reasonable, balanced or fair, and that the decision was wrong.  I am fully aware that in the licence application process for concerts there is no recourse for review or appeal against the licence issued by Dublin City Council.  However, this has been an extremely frustrating position to be left in during the last few weeks considering the events that have come to light, specifically that some of the objections lodged to the council are being investigated as fraud.</p></speech>

I will be going to members of the committee shortly.  I ask them to keep their contributions to four minutes and I will try to do the same myself.  I have a question for Mr. McKenna on the phone call to Mr. Keegan.  Mr. McKenna's statement this morning clearly states that verbal assurances were given by the city manager that five concerts would be supported by Dublin City Council.  That is at odds with and in total contradiction of what was said to us here yesterday.  Does Mr. McKenna have any other evidence to confirm his assertion in this regard?  The public will ask who they are supposed to believe.  Perhaps Mr. McKenna could take that point first, which is the big question.</p></speech>

This telephone conversation happened very early on in the process.  I think Owen Keegan would have been aware of the concerts from Jim Clark who rang him on Saturday, 1 February.  After that I wanted to get a reassurance and heads-up myself as to where we stood on the concert application for all five licences.  I rang Owen Keegan, but he was not there; he was away from the office.  A couple of days later he phoned back.  I remember it well because I was conducting a meeting in my office with one of my senior staff.  We talked about it and he said the city would be very supportive of the five concerts.  He wanted us to make the process easy for him.  He said: "Make One Direction happen well and put all the additionality you can into the applications."</p> <p>We said we could guarantee we would put our best foot forward.  We finished the call and I was ecstatic to share that with the individual in the office.  From then on I was certain we would get five licences.  We did much work on the One Direction concerts and brought additionality to the process.  There were 20 or 30 meetings from February because we were engaging on One Direction at the same time and there was no suggestion that the applications might fail.  I was so confident I went on holidays when the decision was made and would not have done this had I doubts.</p><p> It may sound dramatic but I would swear an affidavit based on what I have told this committee.  That is how certain I am of the contents of the telephone conversation.</p></speech>

Are c&uacute;l camps free for the children?  The Christmas party was mentioned and I know it is funded.  Are tickets for matches free?  What sort of matches are involved?  Are tickets for finals free?</p><p>  Garth Brooks was originally to perform in two concerts.  Can Mr. Aiken explain why he was later unwilling to perform fewer than five?

We regard 27,000 houses as being in the environs of Croke Park as that constitutes a radius of 1.5 km.  There is no single group with which we can deal and a small group, consisting of some people from the area and some from outside, was very opposed to these concerts.  That group was the only voice that was heard.  We were concerned by the fact that in recent weeks other residents emerged who wanted the concerts to proceed.</p><p>  The thing we would do differently in future and the biggest challenge is to engage with a coherent residents' group on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

I believe it emerged in recent weeks that the vast majority of people in the area had no problem with the concerts proceeding.  The difficulty is those who shout loudest and those who take to the airwaves are heard.  This makes it difficult for us.  As Kieran Mulvey said in his report that a coherent group is needed to express the voice of the residents.  We would be very happy to engage with such a group in future and had such a group partaken in this matter the outcome would have been different.  The big concern we had related to the number of fraudulent submissions and the full story on this has not been told.</p></speech>

I did not foresee that it would grow to five shows as that is unprecedented.  I have never seen such a thing in my time as a promoter and it would have been the biggest ever live event in Ireland.  It would have been the equivalent of Michael Jackson's eight nights in London, Bruce Springsteen's ten nights at Giants Stadium, New York, and Roger Waters's five nights in Argentina.  This was our big moment.  When we sold tickets for five concerts we built a five-show event.  The idea was to film the show on three of the nights and make a documentary.  It was going to be massive and that is how it grew.</p></speech>

If we take anything from this as legislators, we must ask how a situation was allowed to develop where 400,000 tickets were sold in advance of the granting of a licence.  It is not the fault of the witnesses as this is the system in which they must operate and I suspect we may have to consult them on another occasion on developing a legislative approach to this issue.  At minimum, we must develop an appeals process because An Bord Plean&aacute;la usually acts as final arbiter in general planning issues relating to buildings and so on.  No such system exists in cases such as this.</p><p>  The Chairman has addressed Mr. Duffy's point on Mr. McKenna.  Mr. Aiken spoke of the expectation that the five concerts would be granted permission.  I am flabbergasted, frankly, that Mr. McKenna can make his statement as strongly as he does.  When compared to the evidence yesterday from Mr. Keegan, there is a direct conflict and I do not know how it can be resolved.  This committee is not undertaking an investigation but the conflict must be aired.  Mr. McKenna is prepared to swear an affidavit, which is welcome, and Mr. Keegan has further questions to answer on this.</p><p>  Yesterday, explaining how he reached the decision, Mr. Keegan covered the points raised by Mr. Duffy on unprecedented over-intensification and unacceptable levels of disruption.  We probed him on this matter and he said he was prepared to allow four concerts.  I still do not understand how four concerts, in addition to the earlier three concerts by One Direction, could have been acceptable, though unprecedented, and was not deemed over-intensification of use and an unacceptable level of disruption.  Somehow the fifth concert was the straw that broke the camel's back.  I do not accept this and when pressed on this issue yesterday Mr. Keegan made a slip by saying something had to be given to the residents.  In other words, Dublin City Council had to be seen as doing something in response to the concerns raised by residents.  I put it to him that had the promoters sought six or seven concerts the council might have granted permission for five on the basis he outlined and deemed it acceptable.  He countered this.</p><p>  On the issue of residents and objections, I have some sympathy for Dublin City Council as the process for lodging objections is not as detailed as it is for construction projects because there is no fee.  The issue of how to deal with the situation now has been raised.  Mr. Aiken said he spoke to a senior civil servant and Mr. Keegan yesterday mentioned having met a senior civil servant but I do not know whether the same person is in question.</p> <p>Have the witnesses come up with any potential solution that could get us past this?  The Government has refused to take a legislative approach.  The witnesses considered a judicial review and Mr. Keegan made it very clear to us yesterday that he was prepared to gamble ratepayers' money to challenge it aggressively.  What is the legal advice on whether it might have been successful?  As a ratepayer, Mr. Duffy must feel aggrieved at the decision.  Many ratepayers have contacted us, such as hotels, restaurants and the business community, who are flabbergasted by it.</p></speech>

While it was a major issue and a blow to us, we had not budgeted for the concerts.  The GAA feels bad for the 400,000 people.  Everybody in this room knows people who had planned to come home or hold family celebrations, and the sheer disappointment of these people is the worst part of it.  It would have been fantastic to have been part of these concerts.  It would have been a national celebration and the loss of that is the worst of it.  The GAA is not the loser.  The money is irrelevant.  We feel a sense of loss for the 400,000 people, particularly the 70,000 who were coming from abroad, the many Irish people who were coming home for their holidays around the concerts.  They are the real losers.</p><p>  With a little flexibility, this could easily have been avoided, notwithstanding the fact that the legislative frameworks applied.  All along, we thought there would be five concerts, and at some point it was reduced to three.  Had the council approached us and said it was thinking of reducing the number from five to three, Aiken Promotions and we would have asked what we needed to do to reassure the council, and would have done whatever it would have taken, for the 400,000 people.  However, we were not given the opportunity.  The news came out of the blue, the decision was taken, it was signed off and there was no appeal.  The end was very abrupt.</p></speech>

Could Mr. Duffy talk about the legacy issue of the handball situation, which seems to be the centre of most of the aggravation, particularly regarding those who reside outside the area and have succeeded in promoting a campaign of objections to the GAA's activities?  The Mulvey report and intervention was an effort to get to the bottom of that.</p></speech>

When Mr. Mulvey tried to examine the long-term staging of concerts in Croke Park, we asked him to mediate on the handball centre issue.  One Friday night, Mr. McKenna and I sat down, under Mr. Mulvey's chairmanship, with representatives of the handball centre.  We were there until midnight-----</p></speech>

We were all delighted that we had solved the problem on the basis that we would go ahead and build a new centre on the Croke Villas site and include a bar there for the use of local residents.  Mr. Mulvey thought we had an agreement.  Unfortunately, one of the key handball people had not been at the meeting, as he had been in Belfast on the same day dealing with issues around the redevelopment of Casement Park.  The handball group subsequently told us we did not have an agreement.  We had given in to most of their requests because we wanted to resolve the problem, which had existed for a long time and was annoying a small number of local residents.  While we did not physically shake hands, we felt we had an agreement, and two weeks later the handball group told us it would not accept it.  While this is part of the problem, we went more than half way to resolving it and Mr. Mulvey would be very happy to verify the process and tell the committee the GAA did everything possible to resolve it as part of the process around the concerts.</p></speech>

Regarding the conversation with Mr. Keegan, it has turned into a case of "he said, she said".  I could not believe the amount of interest in the concert and the unprecedented amount of attention it has received.  I cannot believe the number of e-mails I have received and people who have come to me, as a legislator, asking me to intervene.  As Deputy Dooley said, it is down to a few people.  Yesterday I raised the issue of how Marlay Park has been able to have so many concerts, some of which I recently attended, which cause major disruption.  The response was that the residents get along with the council and there is no issue with the promoters.  This is the main issue that needs to be dealt with.  The report has been published and it is to be hoped we can do something to establish some sort of appeals process.  The fact that concert tickets can be sold without a licence having been issued is a serious issue we, as legislators, must address.  I thank the witnesses for their presentation.</p></speech>

What a mess and what a lost opportunity.  The evidence is disturbing because they are saying that matters between Croke Park and Dublin City Council were fine until this bad man came along and upset the apple cart, insisting on enforcing legislation, as he sees it.  It is a bad place to be.  Although I was not here for the meeting with Mr. Keegan, I read the presentation he made and it does not reflect what has been told to the committee today.  We need to get to the bottom of it.  Croke Park has not had a series of events or concerts stopped by such a problem before.  Have there been any near misses where it almost happened?</p></speech>

There were issues about the U2 concerts in 2009.  It was not about the planning permission but about the overnight works to bring a colossal stage in and out, which could only be done overnight.  This issue caused much concern in the area.  We have never been refused an event licence, nor, to my knowledge, has anybody in Dublin.  That is the real shock.</p></speech>

Mr. Downey, in his submission, would probably say the One Direction concert was probably run in the best and most exemplary way of running a concert in the city.  We employed a number of camogie ladies, because young people were coming.  We had a paediatric accident and emergency station on site.  We sold no alcohol.  We provided meeting points for parents to collect their children and had bus collection points.  We did everything to make it one of the great events in the city and we pride ourselves, in writing the handbook for this, that what we do in Croke Park is exemplary.</p></speech>

There is a legal element and there is also the understanding with the residents around Croke Park.  The legal issue is that Croke Park can run three special events in a year without a licence.  It must apply for a licence for any more than three.  This has happened previously.  I accept that because of the timescales involved the promoters must sell tickets before the due process is completed.</p></speech>

The real point here, as P&aacute;raic Duffy said, is that 400,000 people have been discommoded and disappointed.  A total of 70,000 of them were coming from abroad, which is half the number that came here for The Gathering.  There are other aspects.  Caterers have had to cancel &euro;1.5 million worth of purchasing of Irish food and beverages, which would have been there for the five days.  A total of 10,000 people were due to be engaged casually within Croke Park over that period.  That was a casual wage bill of &euro;1 million.  The Government was going to net &euro;3 million on VAT on tickets, merchandising and food and beverages.  All of that has just been wiped.</p></speech>

There were to be 520 backstage passes over the four events for access all areas.  Normally, it would be 50 or 60.  That shows the number of people he was bringing with him.  P&aacute;raic Duffy and Peter McKenna referred to the 400,000 people but the person I feel most sorry for is Garth Brooks, given the effort he put into this and what he was going to do.  People will never see a show like this again, regardless of what happens in the future in technology and so forth.  They will never see the show that he intended to put on.  He was putting everything into this.  It was his comeback special.  The press referred to how it was all five or nothing and so forth but if he was motivated by money, he would have done the three shows and recouped something.  What he did was right.  I told him it was five shows and he could not leave 160,000 people not seeing the show.</p></speech>

The problem is that Croke Park is busy every weekend up to the end of September.  Dublin City Council said it could give me another two shows or perhaps three.  It talks about over-intensification but there is something on every weekend, starting this weekend, up to the All-Ireland Football Final, and there could be a replay after that.  The dates it offered were in the middle of October.  Then there is the talk about intensification.  Garth Brooks starts the world tour on 4 September - this was the comeback special - and it will continue for two or three years.</p></speech>

We have received two very interesting presentations.  We heard Mr. Keegan's presentation yesterday.  To say that there are differences is to put it mildly.  The critical one is Mr. McKenna's regarding the telephone call during which he was assured that the five concerts would be looked on favourably.  It was a telephone conversation, so it was an oral commitment, possibly.  This is an issue I raised yesterday with Mr. Keegan.  If I intended to build an extension to my house on the Beara Peninsula in west Cork I would have the option of going through a pre-planning consultation, and there would be minutes of that.  All the issues would be written down and, like them or lump them, one would have a fair idea of what to do to inform the next decision.  For something as fundamentally important to Dublin and Ireland as this concert, as Mr. Aiken has passionately outlined, there is nothing to go on except what Mr. McKenna said that Mr. Keegan said and what Mr. Keegan said.</p><p>  Mr. Keegan in his statement yesterday said, "It is difficult for me to understand how, in the face of real evidence of disquiet among local residents, the promoters would have anticipated no difficulty in securing an event licence for the five concerts."  Then he gave a verbal commitment that the five concerts would be allowed.  Sometimes people will change their minds, but there is a fundamental lack of a proper system of licensing or an overarching document or strategy that can inform both the promoter for that or any other event and the residents as to what would be reasonable or possible.  It could provide a template for conversations as issues such as this arise.  That is something everybody will have to grapple with, although it is debatable whether we will get another opportunity to have something as big as Garth Brooks's five concerts.</p><p>  Mr. Aiken's presentation is very interesting.  It is a timeline or chronology of what happened.  He mentioned that on Wednesday, 5 February, he held a meeting at Croke Park with the Croke Park personnel and the Garda.  Was Dublin City Council represented at that meeting?</p></speech>

The context of this would be that it was still looking at the five concerts, but that there would be additionality or extra conditions attached to the licence to deal with this big ask.</p> <p>Is this how Mr. Aiken understands it?</p></speech>

I did not come away from the meeting thinking we had a problem.  I have been around a long time and I have been in a few situations, but I did not come away from the meeting thinking we had a problem.  If I had thought at any stage that we had a problem I would have flagged it to Garth Brooks.  I never saw this coming.  I thought the problem I would have would be the injunction from the guy running around doing all the interviews.  When I met my lawyers we prepared a legal document to fight that.  I never saw this coming from Dublin City Council.  I have never been refused a licence.  I think the licensing system does work.  I never saw this coming.  It was unprecedented to sell this number of tickets.  I never saw it coming and I do not think it will ever happen again in my lifetime.</p></speech>

We went through the issue of Tuesday, 29 July in great detail because matches will be played in Croke Park on 3 August.  We had to prove in great detail that we could get this massive production out and put all the fencing and barriers back in, relay the pitch and have the place ready for the two quarter-finals on 3 August.  Mr. Downey did not want us to have to work until midnight or 2 a.m.  We spent two hours speaking about it.  On 3 June I still had no inclination there would be a problem with the licence.  Dublin City Council took it right up to the wire.  If I had been told on 3 June there would be a problem I could have done something legally about it.</p></speech>

Having listened to the various submissions yesterday and today things are still do not add up.  I began to think of this event as a movie, "Licensed to Sing", and unfortunately we have an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  Everybody is screwed in this, including Garth Brooks, the ticketholders, Mr. Aiken, the GAA, the community, tourism, Dublin City Council and our reputation.  Everybody seems to be screwed and there are absolutely no winners.</p><p>  In his submission Mr. Duffy stated when the concerts were first announced it defied logic and conventional wisdom.  Thus it went from one to two to three to four and eventually to five concerts and 400,000 people.  Hindsight is 20:20 vision, but perhaps if an element of money or greed did not come into this everybody would have been happy with three concerts, with 200,000 people benefiting from attending them and businesses benefiting from their attendance.  Perhaps it was pushed out a bit and the boat was rocked because of the risky situation which may have been involved in going from three to five concerts. </p><p>  Was Mr. Bob Doyle, Garth Brooks's manager, aware of the potential risk of going from three to five concerts?  Was he prepared to accept that risk?</p></speech>

They have held events in the US where concerts were held over five or six nights in stadiums.  It was not about greed; it was about making history.  This was going to be a fantastic event.  One does get caught up in the moment no matter how good one is in business.  I got caught up in the moment and I thought it would be amazing.  It will never be done again.  When I was selling the tickets Bob Doyle was with me on Grafton Street and he saw the queues the length of Grafton Street.  When we sold out the three shows an interview was immediately broadcast on Newstalk and the queue was the length of the street.  He was on the telephone to Garth Brooks telling him this.  The business was there.  We were not pushing a cart up the hill when selling the fifth show.  We still had demand after selling the fifth show.</p></speech>

I certainly know the five concerts caught the imagination of the music industry throughout the world unlike any other concerts in the entire history of the music industry.

To take up Senator Coghlan's point, Clones will host its last match of the season on Sunday.  It is a magnificent stadium which gets two or three matches a year.  It is not too far from Mr. Aiken's home.  Perhaps it could all be shifted up there where people would not object.</p><p>  I understand Mr. Duffy is cross on this occasion.  We saw Wexford last Saturday in Thurles.  The GAA will bounce back.  We will return to do all the things we always do and this will be forgotten.</p> <p>That may not be of much consolation to Mr. Aiken.</p><p> The One Direction concerts were held on 23, 24 and 25 May and the follow-up meeting was held nine days afterwards.  When we had the Trinity Ball, it annoyed students who were trying to study for examinations.  If one wants to pick up vibes, one has to do it quicker than nine days afterwards.  Residents say it is over and that they can now get back to what they were doing.  It was a long interval.  I appreciate problems were not encountered during the One Direction concerts, but if one wants to get real feedback, it should be done the day after when both sides will say where they encountered problems.</p><p> On the bogus objections, it seems they numbered 3% of the total.  There were 384 observations received, of which 11 were fraudulent.</p></speech>

This meant that there were fans going around for six months with tickets for an event which was subject to licence.  The term "subject to licence" must be qualified.  When the Chairman gets committee members together after the delegates leave, that will be the kernel of the matter.  Let us have proper procedures, as Deputy Noel Harrington stated, as one has in dealing with any other planning application, including notes taken at meetings on progress made.  In my other line of business, one could meet a student during the year and say he or she was doing fairly well, but the student must then do it in a three hour examination, make a submission or a dissertation that meets requirements.  Informal conversations probably should not continue.  The system must be much more formalised in order that concert goers do not go around for six months with tickets in their pockets for an event which is subject to licence.</p><p>  The concerts sector has caused problems.  There were problems in Slane, Fairyhouse, Ratoath and the Phoenix Park, with all-in mud wrestling.  The reality is that residents are nervous about concerts.  I wonder whether there decibel limits limits for concerts.  I was five miles from Marley Park, yet one could hear the noise from it, which infringed on the wider populous.</p><p>  This is the transport committee.  I was asked why there was not greater access by train to Drumcondra Station, one could not get to it from Bray or anywhere else in the south.  The service from Maynooth is hugely popular on match days when significant numbers use the train service, which is good.</p><p>  I have another question for Mr. Duffy.  Was there supposed to be a station at the other end of the stadium?  The Canal End is also near a railway line which was considered in the original planning process.  If one was able to use such services for big events, including football matches and concerts, some of the agitation among residents might be diluted.</p><p>  We will try to see what can be done in the way of measures to prevent a recurrence.  As Mr. O'Boyle stated, it is a pity for everybody concerned and, as Mr. Aiken stated, it should never happen again.</p></speech>

The noise limit is 75 decibels for Croke Park.</p><p>  The other question was related to the station underneath the stand.  It would not be a safe way to take people into or out of the stadium.  One would need to walk at least 200 or 300 yards in order to access a train station.  Therefore, Drumcondra would be by far the best station to use.  A longer platform is needed for it to be effective.</p></speech>

There was even the ridiculous matter of the High Court injunction, when some fellow received &euro;15,000 and did not know from where he had received it.  Perhaps somebody from the North gave it to him and he got a brand new suit.  This was all reported in the newspapers.  It is like an episode from "Father Ted" but with serious consequences for me.  Every newspaper picked up on it.  They reported that 40% of claims were fraudulent.  How am I judged as an Irish citizen, as a Dublin citizen who has been living here for 20 years, on these terms?  What are my rights?  This illegal activity has been ongoing and I have been completely blindsided.</p></speech>

Barrett about noise, an issue which has been covered by Mr. McKenna, we met the environmental health officer about establishing the maximum noise levels.</p><p>  On the other point raised by the Senator on transport, some innovative solutions had been contemplated for this event.  In particular, we surveyed all of the ticket purchases to which we had access via the Ticketmaster system.  We received 12,000 responses and knew the direction from which they would coming and the mode of transport they would use.  This was going to enable us to provide a sophisticated park-and-ride facility to keep them away from the main Croke Park area.  It was also going to allow us to identify car parking spaces along the Luas and DART routes and from where concert goers would be coming along the M1, M2 and M3 into Dublin.  We had all of the data prepared and ready to trigger a plan in that regard.</p></speech>

What I wanted to establish by the end of this meeting, having heard all viewpoints, was whether there was still a window of opportunity.  The delegates are saying there is.  Mr. Aiken has identified one particular solution - creating a legislative route that would allow for a review of the decision that has been made.  Somebody would have to sit independently to decide this and it would be subject to legislation.  While I thought that was the best option from the outset, tomorrow is the final day of the session and it is highly unlikely legislation could be put through both Houses.  I suspect, therefore, that it is a non-runner.</p><p>  There may be an option, subject to legal advice, whereby the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government could use the statutory instrument process because some licensing is provided for in secondary legislation.  Perhaps there is something that might be done in that regard.</p><p>  Mr. McKenna has just answered the question I was going to ask.  For the past couple of days a judicial review has seemed to be the best option, but Mr. Keegan made it clear that the local authority would vigorously contest it.  Perhaps, when the delegates have left, we might have a discussion among ourselves to see how we might be able to advance this option.</p></speech>
