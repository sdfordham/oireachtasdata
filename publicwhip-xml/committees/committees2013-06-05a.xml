The purpose of the meeting is to consider the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Bill 2013.  The Bill was referred to the select committee by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 23 May 2013.  Is it agreed that we try to conclude the Bill tonight?  Rather than putting a timeframe on it, we can check in later, but I am anxious to conclude it this evening if possible.</p><p>  I remind members we are in public session and all telephones must be switched off.  I also remind members that while there may have been some confusion with regard to the committee schedule, this meeting is being televised.  Does the Minister wish to make a comment before we commence?</p></speech>

I have been reflecting on this since the Bill was published.  As the Bill is drafted, this process is anchored in a section dealing with the impeachment of other constitutional officeholders.  It should be a unique section and not in with everybody else.  We will mirror the constitutional provisions in the new section.  There will be many technical amendments but that is the import of it.</p></speech>

The section deals with various records and storage facilities.  The Minister has often spoken about IT and cloud computing in the Department.  I wish to have it confirmed that cloud computing, wherever it is and in whatever jurisdiction in the universe it operates, is covered by the Bill.</p></speech>

Since cloud computing might be overtaken in a year or two, we have a definition which is future proofed by defining "electronic device" in section 2 to include any device which includes any electrical, digital, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, biometric or photonic means or other forms of related technology or any combination of any forms of technology to store or transmit data.  I am told this is as comprehensive as we can get.</p></speech>

The current Government has an overwhelming majority.  On this committee, the Opposition is outnumbered two to one.  There is no basis for presuming that any committee of inquiry established under this legislation would not follow the same membership procedures as have been forced on the current Oireachtas by the Government.  I accept that this committee's composition is a result of the Parliament's composition.  It is possible that the referendum on the Seanad will be accepted, thereby removing a counterbalance.  Often, there is a greater proportion of non-Government Members in the Seanad.</p><p>  There should be equal numbers of Government and Opposition members on committees of inquiry.  Memberships should not be weighted.  By definition, the Government has a majority.  It would be a poor start.  Does the Minister understand the gist of what I am saying?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-05a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="17:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22013060500004#E01400"><p>I understand the Deputy's intention.  He made the same point when discussing the heads of the Bill and on Second Stage.  There is always a much more democratic perspective when one is on the other side of the House.  That rush of blood normally does not migrate to this side when one is in the majority.</p><p>  In constructing this Bill, I considered the point that is being made.  We are not constructing a normal committee.  Section 16 confers on a committee of the House or on the Houses the power to issue guidelines in respect of the procedures of Part 2 inquiries.  Section 16(2) outlines the types of guideline that may be included for the purpose of the consideration to be taken into account in promoting the objectives of fair procedures.  Section 16(2)(<i>g</i>) provides that they may include guidelines, to the extent practicable, relating to achieving a balance between committee members as regards their respective political affiliations.</p><p>  The principle underlying the Bill is, in so far as possible, to confer on the House as opposed to the Executive the autonomy to regulate and manage the conduct of inquiries.  This is one such instance in which the House has significant pointers to make to the Bill under the guidelines.</p><p>  I do not consider that the Whip system should not apply to Part 2 inquiries.  When we set up what was to have been the inquiry committee had the referendum been passed, it had an Opposition Chairman.  I am referring to the petitions committee.  Obviously, that committee has been overtaken by events and the decision of the people.</p><p>  We should not be prescriptive in law as regards this matter.  We must take account of the democratic structure of the D&aacute;il.  However, robust guidelines should be made to ensure that fair procedures, including the prevention of an overwhelming balance one way or another, should apply to these types of inquiry.  As I have repeatedly stated regarding Part 2 inquiries, when one weighs evidence objectively and asks questions of witnesses without coming to conclusions, the Whip system should not apply.</p><p>  I do not intend to accept the amendment, but I have gone a fair distance in trying to incorporate Deputy Fleming's intent in the content of the Bill.</p></speech>

The Oireachtas will do what the Oireachtas does, namely, go by its membership.  It will claim that, had the primary legislation intended equal numbers, it would have included such a provision instead of remaining silent on the matter.  The Oireachtas will conclude that no such requirement was intended and will not provide equality.</p><p>  Under the legislation that fell with the referendum, there was to be an Opposition Chairman.</p></speech>

It was not for that committee to conduct an inquiry.  In fact, it was forbidden to conduct inquiries.  It was the regulator of inquiries.</p></speech>

The House's long-established practice is for the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts to be a Member of the Opposition, including former Deputy Jim Mitchell and other distinguished Deputies.  It is probably the only committee to have stood the test of time.  I have been a member of it a couple of times.  Only once in its history since the Constitution was implemented has there been a vote on who would be the Chairman.</p></speech>

The Committee of Public Accounts is a good model.  I do not know whether legislation sets it out, but the fact that the Opposition chairs the committee probably helps it quite a bit.  With no disrespect to this committee's Chairman, who is his own man, Government members can often come under pressure from Ministers.  It is less likely that Ministers would be able to have a word in an Opposition Chairman's ear.  This Bill would benefit from making it a statutory requirement for the Chairman to be a Member of the Opposition and it would look better in terms of independence.  If the decision is just left to the Houses, they will not do it.</p></speech>

The Oireachtas is controlled by the Cabinet.  At committee level, that control can be micro.  For example, when the finance committee was sending an invitation to Professor Patrick Honohan, Deputy Mathews tried to get the wording of a sentence changed.  The matter was forced to a vote and the Whip was applied.</p><p>  Regardless of which Government is in power, this amendment will obtain for the next number of D&aacute;ileanna.  A Government would concede something under this amendment as it would have more Members than the Opposition, yet a committee of inquiry's membership would be 50:50.  The public would see that the committee could not be controlled by a Government.  In matters such as this, one should not ask how the current Government would use a committee such as the ones in question, but how a mischievous Government would use it.</p> <p>There is much merit in Deputy Fleming's suggestion and it would give comfort to the public that the process is as "unpoliticised" as one can get in the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

Doing the sums, the ratio in the House is approximately 69:31.  There was a discussion earlier about trying to create a special committee.  I am not too sure of the observation that a chair from the Opposition would be more impartial and the issue is subjective.  Nevertheless, there is an issue of proportionality.  Could it be a consideration as we move to Report Stage, given that we have a certain ratio, that in a given circumstance the ratio cannot be less than 60:40 if the proportionality of Government and Opposition is more skewed?</p></speech>

There is almost a view that the Government side is, by definition, "partial" and the Opposition, by definition, is "impartial".  I can assure the Deputies that this is not my experience of 30 years in the House.  There can be very partial and partisan Opposition members with a political agenda, and that does not necessarily lead to objective inquiry.  We can all identify with that.</p><p>  If there is a large number of Deputies, they should be represented with proportionality as they would be enthusiastic in their involvement.  The rules of the House already give a disproportionate platform to the Opposition although I know members of the Opposition might disagree with that.  With any opening debate, all the Opposition spokespersons would contribute before the second Government speaker.  Many backbenchers would be frozen out of debate and do not have a profile.  As an Independent Deputy, Deputy Donnelly can demand a fair degree of time in the D&aacute;il and much more than a Government backbencher.</p><p>  I am a passionate supporter of Parliament and we want to empower it in the reform agenda we are bringing forward.  It must be a proportionate response as Parliament is the Chamber of the elected representative of the people.  If 69% of the benches are taken up with Government Members, it is what the people decided at the last time of asking, so the fact must be in some way manifest.  I do not accept just the general principle that the public would have more comfort in the Opposition, as Deputy Donnelly mentioned, whether those members either chaired or had a majority on the committee.</p><p>  Having said that, it is important that the House sets guidelines, perhaps along the lines suggested by the Chairman, so that there would be decent proportionality in any significant inquiry where all groupings may be required to be represented, for example.  That is a matter for the House, and I would like to have a much more active Committee on Procedure and Privileges to set out rules and guidelines.  We are putting a requirement in the legislation to formulate rules and guidelines.  As part of a reform agenda and if people determine we must have a unicameral system, there should be a much more robust D&aacute;il system and a better resourced committee system.  We must have such issues on the agenda.</p></speech>

The Minister has indicated that if we have a unicameral Parliament, the committees must be better resourced.  If we save money by eliminating the Seanad, there are already plans in place to spend more money on running the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

That will require a change in mindset.  There is an enormous volume of work undertaken at committee level that does not get a line anywhere but something abusive uttered in the plenary session would garner a headline.  I do not have a simple solution to get attention for the grinding work of committee that often goes unreported.  We must ensure that Deputies get some profile or they will not spend endless hours in a committee.  As I have stated, I worked on a justice committee fad&oacute; that dealt with a number of pieces of legislation, with one criminal justice Bill taking months on end to get through.  We were endlessly in committee and three of the Opposition spokespersons and the Whip of the committee lost their seats.</p></speech>

We are not suggesting that the Opposition gets more representation; I support Deputy Fleming's suggestion of parity.  The public would have more faith in a committee balanced at 50:50 only because they would know that the Whip cannot be imposed.  The Whip has been imposed by this and the last Government.  I imagine people being called to give evidence to the committee, particularly if they are political opponents of a Government.  I am talking in this case about potential future Governments.</p><p>  The question is whether the process is open to abuse and under current legislation, it is open to abuse.  A mischievous Government controlling the House could have the House determine that there should be an inquiry controlled by the Government.  The Taoiseach could make the decision and the Whip would be imposed.  The House would determine terms of reference and the type of inquiry, and that would again be controlled by the Cabinet.  The committee would do the work and it could make findings that would impugn a person's good name.  That committee could be controlled, under current legislation, by the Cabinet.  The entire process can be controlled by a Government, and people will not have faith in it.  It is open to abuse, and one safeguard would be a 50:50 rule.</p></speech>

I know the explanatory memorandum has no legal standing but what I read there is not what I understood when I read the legislation.  My understanding is that an inquiry can only make findings against a current Member and cannot investigate former Members of the Oireachtas.  It can issue adverse findings on current Members or people accountable to the Oireachtas.</p> <p>Let us take the example of a person who is a member of the current Government or a Member of the Oireachtas into whom an inquiry is going on for a number of years.  The person feels that a very adverse finding is coming down the track and resigns his or her D&aacute;il seat.  As the person is no longer a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the committee, despite having conducted an investigation for a number of years, cannot issue any adverse findings because that individual is no longer a Member of the current D&aacute;il.  My amendment provides that a committee conducting an inquiry established under this Act may conduct an inquiry into the conduct of a Member or former Member who was a Member of the House on the date of the commencement of that inquiry.  That will prevent the situation arising whereby a person resigns his or her seat during the course of an inquiry and thus gets away scot free in terms of any adverse findings.  </p><p> I hope the Minister understands the point I am trying to make.  There is a lacuna in this Bill at present.  The assumption would be that an inquiry could be conducted into Members of the current D&aacute;il but that is not the case if the person resigns before the report of the inquiry is issued.  The amendment is a valid closing-off of a potential loophole in the legislation as it stands.   It would be a terrible waste of a committee's time if, having spent two years investigating particular actions by a Member or Members of the D&aacute;il, the night before the committee issues its report the said Member or Members resign and no adverse findings can be issued.</p></speech>

First, after the lack of success of the constitutional amendment we proposed last year, everything we are now doing must be anchored in constitutional authority.  Article 15.10 of the Constitution, from which section 9 inquiries derive their constitutional authority, only regulates the running of the Houses and only applies to Members of the Houses.  The advice I have been given is that to try to conduct an inquiry into somebody who is not a Member of the House, even if that occurs through resignation, is <i>ultra vires</i>.  We have no constitutional authority to do that, no more than we have of any other citizen who is not a Member of the Houses.</p><p>  Second, during the conduct of an inquiry, the evidence will be heard in public and people will draw their own conclusions if somebody resigns before a report is issued.  In fairness, we do not have a great tradition in this country of resigning from these Houses.  In that context, it would be a fair achievement in itself if somebody, on foot of an inquiry of the House, felt compelled to resign.  However, we do not have the constitutional authority to pursue them beyond membership of the Houses.</p></speech>

Otherwise, all the work will be set to nought.  The Minister is arguing that there would be a victory of sorts if the person resigns his or her D&aacute;il seat-----</p></speech>

The Minister will probably explain to me now how the legislation is not as it appears and that it does not do what it says on the tin, so to speak.  However, when I read this legislation, I see numerous new committees being set up.  I read them all into the record on Second Stage and counted at least half a dozen.  At least six committees are referred to in this legislation which can be set up depending on the nature of the inquiry.  There will be a committee to examine the issue, another to set the terms of reference and another to advise on procedures, while another will be set up under the Part 10 procedures, and so forth.  A whole range of committees must be established before an inquiry can get up and running.  Taking the legislation at face value, there are too many committees being set up.  My amendment provides that no new Oireachtas committee shall be established under this Act other than a committee of inquiry.  There are enough committees in existence as it is and we should not be setting up a raft of new ones.  Even if such committees only sit a few times, on a temporary basis, there must be a better way of doing business than what is proposed here.  During the Second Stage debate, the Minister told me that the Bill is not as it looks but I can only go by what it says on the tin.  The tin says, as is clear from the legislation, that a raft of extra committees will be established.  I believe these are unnecessary and we should not be doing this.  I am also worried about the associated costs of setting up new committees, in terms of procedures, staffing and so forth.</p></speech>

It certainly is not the intention that one would need a separate committee to carry out each function.  For example, all of the functions set out in Parts 10 and 11, relating to private papers, confidential communications, official documents and so forth, would all be done, I would imagine, by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  We must state, in the legislation, that such a function must be assigned to a committee.  In terms of the actual amendment, I believe it is bad law for a Minister to propose to a committee, in statute, that no Oireachtas committee can be established.  That is a matter for the Oireachtas to determine.  That should not be done in statute.</p><p>  It is not my intention that the functions to which the Bill refers would require the setting up of new committees.

There is no reference to a new committee.  The functions must be assigned to a committee of the House.  It is for the Oireachtas to determine how many committees will be involved and to dissolve or create new committees, as it sees fit.  Under the Constitution, the House is master of itself.</p></speech>

When we initially looked at these matters and considered the Abbeylara judgment, that was one of the key concerns.  Obviously, the failure of the referendum meant that additional powers required by the Oireachtas are not available.  In that context, I ask the Minister to give some reassurance to the committee that the provision to allow for findings of fact is firmly couched within the current constitutional provisions.  It was very clear that when the question was put to the people in the referendum, they were not minded to expand the powers of the Oireachtas in respect of inquiries.</p> <p>The Abbeylara judgment made clear that making findings of fact is not without problems for the Oireachtas.  I have raised this issue with the Minister before and I still have lingering concerns about the legislation.</p></speech>

The witnesses are called and the evidence presented is reported.  We must remain within the confines of the Abbeylara judgment.  We cannot find adverse facts against somebody who is not constitutionally amenable to the Oireachtas.  The view is that this is as far as we can go.  I think the provisions of the section are constitutionally robust.</p></speech>

These relate to the legislative function.  In essence the findings that would be permissible under this section would be systems issues as opposed to findings against an individual.  The findings that could be made in a section 7 inquiry are that certain functions do not operate well.</p></speech>

Sections 6 to 10, inclusive, provide for five separate types of inquiry.  However, the Minister stated the banking inquiry would not fit neatly into any of the five types and would be a hybrid inquiry with elements of section 6 and section 7 inquiries.  Why is the Minister defining the five separate types of inquiry in a way that does not fit the first task the Government would like the Oireachtas to conduct?</p></speech>

I am now thinking out loud.  I said there would probably be two parts to the inquiry.  First, we inquire into what happened.  Since one cannot make adjudicatory decisions on the conduct of an individual, that will be an "inquire, record, report"-type inquiry.  I believe there is a possibility - but this depends on the view of the Oireachtas - of a legislative follow-on to inform what further legislation is required on foot of the proceedings and the evidence that was adduced before the committee.  It is a matter for the Oireachtas to determine the nature, scope and sections that will apply to any inquiry.  It is my view that a banking inquiry will be well encompassed in both.  I believe such an inquiry would be partially under the "inquire, record, report" model and partially under the legislative reform model.  That would be the anchor of the constitutionality of the inquiry.</p></speech>

The process is to find out what is constitutionally permissible.  Each of the sections outlines the legal advice, the external legal advice and all the discussion we have had on what is constitutionally permissible in the types of inquiry laid out in the Bill.  It is not legally permissible to have a real hybrid that does a bit of both.  If one is to have an inquiry limited to recording and reporting evidence, one would have to conclude it and report on it and then embark on the next bit of it.  Legally, one cannot intersperse the two types of inquiry because one has to have a constitutional grounding for each bit of it.</p></speech>

This group of amendments allows for the creation of a distinct provision in the Bill relating to the impeachment of the President pursuant to Article 12.10 of the Constitution.  The amendment does not alter the approach in the Bill with regard to the types of statutory inquiry that may be conducted.  They merely reposition and expand on the provisions dealing with an inquiry under Article 12.10 of the Constitution in light of the detailed and specific procedures that are outlined in that Article.  I consider it preferable to reflect these procedures fully in the text of the Bill.  The approach adopted aims to mirror the constitutional provisions.  Unlike the impeachment processes for other constitutional officeholders, which are not prescribed, the impeachment process for the President is set out.  I want to capture that in a standalone section and mirror what is in the Constitution.</p></speech>

I recall the public commentary and angst at the time of the referendum.  There was a sense that committees could become Star Chambers or a facility for a witch hunt against a Member of either House.  The scenario around the judgment in the case of Ivor Callely was very fresh in people's minds.</p> <p>On this section of the legislation, will the Minister take this opportunity to set out the types of safeguard and the checks and balances that exist within the provision in respect of fair procedures for Members of the Oireachtas, specifically safeguards against anything that could be, whether by design or accident, a Star Chamber or a witch hunt?</p></speech>

I have said publicly that there was a reluctance among people to vote to give additional powers to committees.  They looked at the way some witnesses had been treated and said, "Hmm, I don't want to give additional powers to the Oireachtas in that regard".  When this Bill was published I said there would be some element of proofing, by us, so that as an Oireachtas we are capable of holding fair procedures, and this is mirrored in every section.  Constitutional rights are in no way diminished because a person is either a Member of the House or an officeholder.  Fair procedures are afforded to every citizen under the Constitution and that will continue to be the case.  I have laid out how there might be safeguards against bias by Members.  Similarly to all citizens, every Member of the House will have full rights to vindicate his or her own good name and rights.</p></speech>

I accept there are provisions in the legislation with regard to bias, which strike me as fairly robust.  However, there is a particular concern about politicians investigating each other and, whether by accident or design, using this process as a means of political one-upmanship rather than as a robust procedure to investigate a legitimate matter.</p></speech>

What is to stop somebody under investigation from going to the High Court to seek an injunction?  Section 9 inquiries specifically allow for findings that impugn a good name.

Under the Constitution, Members of the House and officeholders are made accountable to the House, so there is a constitutional anchoring for that.  The Deputy asked what will stop people from going to the High Court.  Thankfully, nothing.  Any citizen, in regard to any issue, can go and look for a judicial review, but we are very confident there is a constitutional safeguard for the rights of the Oireachtas to hold such inquiries.</p><p>  If I may, I will respond to Deputy McDonald on two points.  We need to be clear, when we say we have to avoid the perception of bias, that there is an expectation that although Members of the Oireachtas have strong and robust views on policy issues, they will not be debarred having expressed those strong policy views.  What is being discussed here is a situation in which a person who is going to be a witness or whose good name is at stake - obviously, we will not make conclusions on this - would be cross-examined or made amenable to a committee member who is demonstrably biased towards that person, or who has drawn conclusions in advance of an inquiry into any matter.  Who will make that determination?  In much of the legislation's provisions the Oireachtas will make the first determination, but of course it will ultimately be for any individual who feels the conclusion made is not satisfactory to test it in the courts.  The criterion we have set out in the Bill is the conclusion a fair-minded person would come to in regard to the bias or otherwise of an individual Member.  That is the process we have set out.</p></speech>

To me, this is the most serious flaw in the legislation, which has many good points.  The context is that the Minister has suggested I do not appreciate how little control Cabinet holds over Government Deputies and Senators.  I do not have his 30 years in the Oireachtas but I have read political scientists who agree we have the most centralised control in the developed democratic world in terms of Cabinet control.  It is the opinion of independent experts that the Irish Cabinet is the most controlling Cabinet in the developed world.</p></speech>

For example, the Technical Group cannot speak on the Order of Business.  We asked for a single word to be changed in Standing Orders but we cannot have this done and, as we saw, Deputy Catherine Murphy was ejected from the Chamber last week for trying to make a point.  The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is meant to be completely independent but neither Sinn F&eacute;in nor the Technical Group has any representation on it, even though it has 11 members.  I was refused permission even to address it on a particular issue.  In addition, there are guillotines all the time, as in the fiasco of last week.  In my view, there is considerable Cabinet control over both Government Deputies and the House.</p><p>  The reason this is relevant is that the amendment seeks to reduce the number of votes to a quarter of Members of the House, although I do not really care if the figure is a quarter or a third.</p> <p>We know from the Library and Research Service that in seven or eight EU member states the equivalent number is between one fifth and one third.  The legislation implicitly provides for half of Members.  It does not specify 50% but it states there must be a vote of the House, which implicitly means 50% plus.  Germany specifies one quarter, so I went with one quarter in my amendment.  I am not stuck on one quarter and I do not believe it matters because the amendment will not be accepted anyway, but based on what I have seen, I do not believe this legislation would be used to investigate a sitting member of Cabinet, because the Cabinet will apply the Whip, which it does to every vote and every proposed amendment if we press it to a vote.  Therefore, I believe this is a reasonable amendment which is in line with good practice throughout Europe and which gets over the public perception, regardless of whether the Minister agrees with me, about Cabinet control of the Oireachtas.</p><p> Let us play this out.  The Government has one Taoiseach - in no way do I attribute this to our current Taoiseach, but previous Taoisigh I have seen were capable of abusing it.  The position relates back to the 50% figure for committees and it echoes Deputy Fleming's point.  The Government applies a Whip.  The sitting Cabinet members are essentially immune from this legislation because it requires a majority vote in the House.  They can, however, use it against an Opposition leader, for example.  They control the terms of reference, the inquiry, the committee and the report because they can vote through anything they want.  The point of the amendment is to make it at least possible, or easier, for the House, even where the Government is trying to apply a Whip, to investigate a sitting Cabinet member.</p></speech>

I have never seen an inquiry set up other than into a member of the current or a former Government.  I have never seen an inquiry set up into a member of the Opposition.  I understand what Deputy Donnelly is saying, but let us reflect on it.  Political circumstances often dictate when a Government must put one of its own out to be examined.  I have yet to see it occur in the opposite direction.  Deputy Donnelly may say it is counterintuitive but that is what has always happened.</p></speech>

Any committee report that requires a vote to get over the line is diminished.  I have never been involved in a committee process, either in Opposition or in Government, in which we have voted something through.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the position.  It is not that there are recommendations as such, but a statement of fact.  One cannot vote on whether something is a matter of fact.

He pointed out that in other jurisdictions one does not need the 50%-plus-one rule within the process.  Whether it is 25% or one third, the point is that, as currently structured, for an inquiry to be completed a majority vote must be achieved.  I assume the concern that has triggered these amendments is that one could have matters entirely worthy of inquiry and consideration which would hit the bar because of that requirement.  Will the Minister explain why he is so fixed on the 50%-plus-one figure?  What is the problem with a 25% threshold, for example?</p></speech>

I remember when I and Deputy Fleming were on a committee that he chaired.  There were diverging views on a particular recommendation, which was to do with the personal public service number registration system.  Everyone had strong views on it but they were not views of the same bent.  In that case the committee's recommendation noted that there was no unanimous position among the committee members and that was reflected in the report.  As soon as any committee makes a vote on any recommendation, the report is invalid.  That is my view in terms of someone chairing the process.  It would be madness for anyone acting as chairman and steering any inquiry to force a vote, because as soon as that vote is called the work put in by the committee members is over and has no standing.</p></speech>

I was referring to the 50:50 set-up in the committee.  This amendment refers specifically to the vote in the House to set up an inquiry.  I take the point on the previous amendment.  This amendment specifically relates to a government being able to use its majority.  I am not having a go at this Government in any way.  I am referring to a government using its majority to block something that a sizable portion of the Oireachtas deems worthy of doing.

Let me explain it.  Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 are essentially parallel rules.  Section 11 deals with a proposal for an inquiry by a committee.  That is dealt with in amendment No. 13.  Section 12 deals with a proposal for an inquiry by the House.  Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 provide for the application of the same rule, that a vote of one quarter of the House is sufficient to propose an inquiry.</p> <p>Similarly, if a committee is doing it, rather than the House, which is possible under the legislation, it is simply the same rule.  That is not a vote for findings because I agree with the Minister that would be preposterous.  It concerns the establishment of an inquiry.</p></speech>

I recognise that it is not the practice to make available the advice of the Attorney General but there are circumstances in which it would be extremely helpful not least to those of us in opposition as we try to grapple with complex and potentially very contentious issues within, for instance, this legislation.</p> <p>The Minister and his Department are clearly satisfied with the advice they have received.  I would feel more assured in dealing with all Stages, particularly Committee Stage, if we had sight of that legislation.  In exceptional circumstances the Government might consider accommodating Opposition Deputies with the legal advice to which it has access through the Office of the Attorney General.  The Minister recognised my substantive and important point, namely, that we cannot afford to get this legislation wrong.  I make that point in a spirit of co-operation.</p></speech>

I recheck any point raised.  We would not propose anything that had not been stamped by the Attorney General.  Any legislation comes with a stamped copy which shows that it is, on the advice of the Office of the Attorney General, constitutional.  We would not propose it otherwise.  By long-standing practice, it is not the norm to give the formal advice of the Attorney General to the Cabinet to anyone else.  As the Deputy knows, constitutionally the Attorney General has two roles - to be the law officer to the Government and give formal advice, particularly on constitutional matters, to the Cabinet, and to protect the citizen in terms of constitutionality.  No Attorney General is the legal adviser to the Oireachtas; it has its own legal advice available to it.</p></speech>

The Minister has clarified that these questions have been put to the Attorney General.</p></speech>

I made the point that it would be helpful when we are asked to scrutinise legislation such as this, particularly given that, as the Minister correctly said, the Attorney General fulfils a dual role and there is an onus on all of us to ensure the constitutionality, as best we can, of the laws we enact.</p></speech>

The first line of section 16 refers to the committee and there is a definition of &quot;committee&quot; in the section.  Perhaps the Minister or somebody else can send a message to the parliamentary draughtspersons.  There is a definition in the middle of page 27.  Definitions should be at the beginning of the section.  We should all be able to read and understand them.  It might be standard practice for definitions to crop up at the end of sections, but if that is the case it is a bad practice.</p><p>  The section states the House can draw up its procedures and guidelines in regard to any committee.  Section 16(2)(<i>b</i>) states that guidelines drawn under the section may include guidelines relating to &quot;any distinction that may be drawn between procedures applicable to all witnesses and those against whom allegations are made&quot;.  I ask the Minister to explain that.  An inquiry might be set up to investigate allegations in respect of an individual, but as it progresses it might move on to investigate persons who have questions to answer about a particular issue, whereas others simply provide evidence.  Where is the distinction drawn between a witness and a person against whom an allegation is made?  If that is to be done when guidelines are established, it sounds as if somebody has already made some preliminary assessment against a person before an inquiry commences.</p></speech>

I take his point on definitions.</p><p>  In terms of his general point, this is a catch-all set of guidelines.  We will not be prescriptive about every eventuality.  On the particular question raised by the Deputy on subsection (2)(<i>b</i>), there will be occasions when a scoping exercise will be done, whether it is a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, a report from another committee of the House, an existing committee finding, a report of the Ombudsman-----</p></speech>

Somebody in that report might require more robust protections if there were to be a formal inquiry, such as the right to attend all sessions, cross-examine and so on, but the panoply of legal rights will not be distributed in the same way to everybody.  If somebody is a casual witness he or she should not be allowed to bring in lawyers, for example, because costs will be involved.  It will be a matter for the Houses, when they are considering an inquiry such as this, to ensure they can discriminate between witnesses and persons against whom allegations are made.</p></speech>

Subsection (3) provides that the House may, by resolution, remove a committee member from a committee for contravening a direction given to him or her pursuant to the section or who has otherwise contravened a requirement of the Bill.  Subsection (6) of section 17 provides that the removal of committee members shall not in any way invalidate the proceedings of a Part 2 inquiry up to the point of such a removal.</p><p>  Section 18 of the Bill deals with perceptions of bias.  It provides in subsection (3) that a committee member shall recuse him- or herself from the Part 2 inquiry by reason of his or her connection with any matter in the subject of the inquiry or by his or her utterances on that subject matter.  Under subsection (4), where the member fails to recuse him- or herself, the member may be removed from the committee in accordance with the rules and Standing Orders of the House.  Subsection (5) of section 18 provides that the removal of a committee member shall not in any way invalidate the proceedings of a Part 2 inquiry up to the point of removal.</p><p>  The purpose of these amendments is to clarify the wording of sections 17(6) and 18(5) of the Bill.  The wording of these two subsections in the published Bill states that the removal of a member for contravening the bias provisions or not complying with direction &quot;shall not in any way invalidate the proceedings&quot;<i>. </i> I have been advised that the wording might be interpreted as suggesting that the proceedings will not be invalidated even if that member's prior conduct might give rise to genuine doubts about the fairness of the proceedings up to that point.  I hope I am being clear.  In essence, if somebody is removed in the middle of inquiry we want it to proceed unless, objectively, the person has been so contaminated that it would not be fair for the inquiry to proceed.  I am advised that the phrasing in the published Bill might mean that we would not be able to stop an inquiry.  The new phrasing gives clarity in providing that an inquiry may proceed unless, objectively, the proceedings have been completely contaminated by the utterances of the member.</p></speech>

When we previously discussed the section I said we would be a bit like a jury in the event of a member standing down, whereby a reserve juror who is familiar with the evidence would be available.  A person who has had no involvement cannot step in to an inquiry that has been in place for 18 months.  The Bill deals with a member's having to step down for whatever reason, and the fact that that would not invalidate the inquiry.  How many members could stand down before the work of the committee would be invalidated?  If an inquiry took place during a D&aacute;il term, one could easily find two members are promoted to Minister of State roles.  There could be a bereavement or Opposition roles could change.</p> <p>A committee could start with ten people and by year three, five of them might be gone for a variety of reasons.  Some form of a quorum should be required from among the original members of the committee to ensure they are in place at the conclusion of the hearings and for the issuing of a report.  In theory, this provision could allow for a complete change in the committee membership before the hearings have concluded with the result that people who have not sat through any of the evidence would issue the final report.  I do not see anything in the legislation to guard against this possibility.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, the complication arises when it is an inquiry into a Member of the Oireachtas.  That is where, in my view, it gets a bit messy.  We operate within an adversarial system and there are all sorts of things said in the cut and thrust of political debate.  How can the Minister assure us that this sense of institutional or party political bias is adequately catered for in the provisions?  Arguably, in the minds of reasonable people, politicians investigating another politician in and of itself would perhaps sound alarm bells.  I have raised this concern before.</p></speech>

Constitutionally, Members of the House are made accountable to the House and not to any external person.  For example, for utterances in the House they cannot be hauled before the courts or held to account elsewhere.  Therefore, they must be held to account here.  The Bill establishes the rules and procedures to ensure this is done in a fair way.  The full panoply of normal constitutional rights has been determined repeatedly by the courts in some of the cases we have mentioned, such as the case of former Senator Callely and others.  There are many recitals where this robust set of privileges and rights accrue to everyone.  I am confident that this will happen.</p><p>  As Deputy Fleming has repeatedly said, it is much more likely that the person who will be inquired into will be a Member on the Government side rather than on the Opposition side.  That will be the case if custom and practice teaches us anything.</p></speech>

I am interested in finding out who makes the call.  Is it the chairman of the committee of inquiry?  For example, who suggests that a certain member may need to step away, based on the provisions in section 18?  I agree with section 18, by the way; I am just curious as to how it will work in reality.</p></speech>

If the committee is established with a member who carries a perception of bias, a witness or a person subject to the inquiry will have access to the courts to vindicate his or her good name.  Once the inquiry is established, a role is afforded to the chairman of the committee to maintain the procedures that will be laid down in this Act, to maintain the procedures of the House and to give directions to a member where he or she oversteps the mark.  These directions must be legally complied with.  Ultimately, a person can be removed who repeatedly refuses to either comply with legitimate directions from the chair or who has compromised themselves objectively and that will be a matter for the committee to determine.</p></speech>

How does it work?  For example, what is the procedure if one of the parties - it does not matter from which side - proposes a person who should not be on the committee because of bias?  Who makes the call to say that this person is not suitable and that the party needs to propose someone else?</p></speech>

It will be a matter for the House itself to determine.  I imagine that people will look at the composition of a committee.  For instance, as with the jury system, if a person is of the view that the proposed member might not be objectively impartial and would put any finding of the committee or the work of the committee at risk of challenge in the courts, this would be determined by the Oireachtas.  I presume there would be a discussion with the person in the first instance.  If the person wished to proceed, then there would be a decision of the House.  If the decision of the House is that the person is not biased but some third party is of the view that bias exists, then it will be a decision for the courts.</p></speech>

I refer to section 17(4) which states: "The House may by resolution remove a committee member from, or add a member of the House to, the committee in accordance with the rules and standing orders of the House."  This is a matter on which the House will have to seize itself.  The normal way in which a committee is constructed is that the numbers are fixed and then each party is asked to nominate people to it.  I imagine that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges might be the forum where this would be determined.  However, I do not think we need to be prescriptive in the Bill other than to say in section 17(4) that this is a matter for the House.</p></speech>

In the event of the House being dissolved at the end, or close to the end, of its normal term, or suddenly if the Government of the day lost its majority or some of those in government were not to remain in government, the work of a committee, which could have spent considerable time, energy and resources conducting an inquiry during the term of that Government would be lost and such work could not be reactivated by an incoming Government in terms of the resumption of that work.  Only the work that would have been included in an interim report would be protected for future reference.  An incoming Government could rely on the work of a previous interim report, if one had been done, but the work conducted after the issuing of an interim report, having regard to all the time, energy and resources involved, up the time of the collapse of a D&aacute;il would be lost.  In this amendment I seek to protect the taxpayer and the integrity of these committees and not to bring the process into public ridicule in that a committee could have spent 12 months inquiring into a matter and all that work would be down the drain, even though many people may have made a great deal of money from it.  I propose the insertion of this provision to protect the work of a committee by requiring it to complete three monthly interim reports.  They need not be fact-finding rather they could be progress reports.  Such a measure would protect the work done every three months to ensure that it would not be lost in the event of the sudden dissolution of a D&aacute;il.  It would protect the taxpayers' interests and the integrity of the committee process.   </p></speech>

He will note from the section that I have provided that "the House may, at any time before it is given the finals report request the committee to give it interim reports in writing in accordance with rules and standing orders".  Therefore, it is for the House to determine in this respect.  I do not want to be prescriptive and require that this be done every three months because a committee could be dealing with a module the duration of which could continue for six months or for six weeks.  The committee should be able to feed in the information as it determines and the House would have the right to respond in that respect.  Obviously if there is a natural termination, a date will be fixed before the natural termination.  I presume the Deputy's concern in this respect would only arise in the event of there being a sudden termination of the D&aacute;il.  This matter is best left to the House.  If I were to require this to be done every three months, a committee could be in the middle of a process and it would be an onerous task, or a disruptive requirement, for it to give a interim report before the end of the process.  It would be better to leave it to committee to determine when interim reports should be made.  Provision is contained in the section for the submission of interim reports.</p></speech>

The only point I would make and I will not labour it is that a committee could be dealing with a module, the duration of which could extend for  six or eight months, and there is nothing to prevent it from deciding at the end of 90 days work to log the work that has done, put it in writing and lodge it as an interim report and that could then be superseded by a report at the end of the module.</p></speech>

The focus in relation to the recoupment of legal costs is on persons whose good name is at issue rather than other witnesses.  The Oireachtas commission does not have a role in relation to the quantum of legal costs under the Bill.  It does not make that decision.  In accordance with section 48, a party who is due legal costs will apply to the Oireachtas commission for an adjudication on such costs by the parliamentary legal costs adjudicator.  That adjudicator is somebody drawn from a panel of legal costs accountants willing to act as parliamentary cost adjudicators under section 41.</p> <p>This panel will be drawn up by the Minister and the process therefore is independent of the Oireachtas commission.  The parliamentary legal costs adjudicator has similar powers to the Taxing Master in the courts under section 42 of the Bill.  In essence, a person whose good name is being impugned and who wishes to apply for costs will apply to the Oireachtas commission, which will refer the matter to the legal costs adjudicator.  The legal costs adjudicator is that person drawn from a professional panel of legal cost accountants drawn up by me as Minister.  Section 44(4) provides that a person may apply to the committee for a determination as to whether he or she is a person whose good name is likely to be at issue in the inquiry.  This will enable people to make a preliminary assessment as to whether he or she is likely to be entitled to recoup expenses or costs.</p></speech>

At the outset, I agree with the Minister that the provision of legal costs should be limited and that costs should not be provided to everyone.  However, I wish to walk through this process just to be satisfied that it cannot be used in a mischievous manner.  For instance, one gets word that one is being summoned and one thinks one's good name may be impugned in the process.  Does one write to the Oireachtas commission at that point to state one's good name may be impugned and therefore, one needs counsel and would like the commission essentially to state whether it intends to pay for it?</p></speech>

First, one should remember the scoping in this regard will be done by the committee.  It will meet in advance and is likely to determine the list of witnesses.

First, the committee will determine that one is to be legally represented.  The decision on the amount to be paid will be made at the end of the inquiry and the person so represented will apply to the commission in the first instance.

These amendments are consequent on the insertion of the new section 15, again as a result of the acceptance of amendment No. 18.  Amendment No. 26 allows for the insertion of a reference to a section 15 inquiry.  It ensures that the Oireachtas commission will be empowered, in appropriate circumstances, to request a person to pay Part 2 inquiry legal costs, which arose after section 15 applied and once a committee had been selected to conduct a section 15 inquiry but before the inquiry had commenced.  Amendment No. 27 allows for the insertion of the same reference to a section 15 inquiry regarding a direction by the Oireachtas commission to pay Part 2 inquiry expenses.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for the clarification regarding section 44.  My concern is that the Oireachtas commission is not representative of the House.  There is no representation for Sinn F&eacute;in or the Technical Group.  The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission has 11 members of whom one is non-political, two each are from Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party and six are from Fine Gael.  My dealings in trying to get a reasonable hearing on an issue from the commission were utterly unsatisfactory.  Therefore, I do not believe the commission to be a suitable body to make such judgments.  Specifically, this matter pertains to the threat of legal costs and the commission will be empowered in this regard.  Incidentally, I believe someone must make such determinations and have no problem with the mechanism.  I believe this is fair enough for those who have not been co-operating properly.  However, I do not believe the commission is representative.  In amendment No. 25, I provided for an independent judicial panel and I included that because I did not know what else to put in.  The point is that I am not satisfied with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission doing this because this is a serious threat for any group to be able to use.  It can state that while one has incurred quarter of a million euro in senior counsel fees, it has now decided one was non-co-operative with the inquiry and therefore, one will be obliged to pay the fees oneself.  This is my concern and I do not know what is the right answer.  I used "independent judicial panel" as a sort of holding phrase but this is my concern.</p></speech>

I will explain.  It is not actually essential to the legislation but it is a vehicle that I wanted to use.  As the members will know, a private Bill is a Bill promoted for the particular interest or benefit of a person or which interferes with the private property of a person, otherwise than in the interests of the public generally or as a matter of public policy.  Normal Bills are not private because they have general application and are a matter of general public policy.  Private Bills, which are rare enough in the Houses, have a particular focus.  Examples of recent private Bills dealt with include The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (Charters Amendment) Act 2003 &ndash; the original charter set up by an Act of Parliament needed to be amended &ndash; and The Trinity College Dublin (Charters and Letters Patent Amendment) Act 2000.</p><p>  A petitioner of a private Bill means a person who submits to the House or committee a petition opposing the private Bill or a provision in the Bill.  Subsection (4) provides that a petitioner who owns an interest in land and who opposes a private Bill which proposed the acquisition of all or part of that interest shall not be liable to pay legal costs to the promoter under this section.  This subsection is based on section 2 of the Parliamentary Costs Act 1865, as applied by section 5 of the Private Bills Costs Act 1924.</p><p>  I am proposing to delete the word &quot;land&quot; in the original legislation and replace it with the word &quot;property&quot;.  The word &quot;land&quot; is taken directly from the 1865 Act.  However, I am concerned that the word &quot;land&quot; may be unduly narrow in today's context.  To bring the wording up to date, I would like to broaden the scope of this provision to encompass &quot;property&quot; generally, as opposed to &ldquo;land&rdquo;.  The amendment is to improve the mechanism with regard to the bringing of private Bills before the House.</p></speech>

It is the second of two tabled by him.  Unfortunately, he cannot be here.  The Deputy is trying to ensure that committees of inquiry can appoint investigators to assist in the gathering of evidence.  In going through the Bill, he could not find anything that would allow them to do that.  He has said the amendment is lifted from the Standards in Public Office Act 2001.  He has modelled it on that Act's wording.  He is chairman of the Members' interests committee.  They cannot appoint investigators.  The Deputy believes this is hindering that committee in investigating complaints.</p></speech>

A committee of inquiry may engage outside expertise to do the scoping work I referred to or to assist it in the preparation of its work.  The Committee of Public Accounts, for example, engaged outside legal experts last year in preparing its report on a possible banking inquiry.  It is not necessary to provide specifically for this in the Bill.  I note that Deputy Donnelly is not proposing any particularly strong statutory powers for inquiry officers.  Under the proposed amendment, a person may decline to answer any questions asked or refuse a request to produce a document.  This is in the amendment tabled.</p><p>  The second observation I would make is that one of the very positive features of the Oireachtas inquiry model, as opposed to a tribunal or a commission of investigation, is that its proceedings will mostly be conducted in public and will probably be televised.  This is a very important aspect of the democratic process where Members of the Oireachtas are seen to be conducting such work.  This, however, does not preclude a scoping exercise, be it by the Ombudsman, the Comptroller and Auditor General or an expert appointed by a committee.</p></speech>

He is probably making a distinction between expert help and an inquiry.  The proposed subsection (4) states: &ldquo;An inquiry officer may request the production by a person of any document in the possession or control of the person that the officer considers relevant to his or her inquiry.&rdquo;  That is obviously a specific power over and above an expert review or input.  I imagine that the Deputy is keen to ensure that the committee of inquiry will be able to appoint a person to expedite proceedings.</p></speech>

He or she may even ask questions directly of witnesses that appear before the committee.  One can have an expert resident in that case.  With a view to being as neutral as possible, let us assume that the balloons of a balloon manufacturing company are bursting and upsetting children all over the country, resulting in our having an investigation.  I am trying not to mention any subject that might not come before us so I thought of something as remote as I could.  I do not want to create dilemmas further down the line.  If a committee, in making its proposal to refer a matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, were to carry out a scoping exercise, what would the position be?  The terms of reference, resource requirements and timeframe of an inquiry would have to be agreed by the Houses.  Is there a facility in the legislation, as presented, such that proposals made to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges would allow for the inclusion of an expert or other resources?</p><p>  With a view to being as neutral as possible, let us assume that the balloons of a balloon manufacturing company are bursting and upsetting children all over the country, resulting in our having an investigation.

For example, I was a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  It was felt that in drawing up the report concerning the constitutional amendment on children, each party and political group on the committee should have legal advice available to it.  The Oireachtas paid for a legal adviser to be available to each group.  There is therefore ample scope for that.  It goes back to the point I made earlier, which Deputy Sean Fleming picked up on.  My view is that we need to have a much better resourced committee system which, as a matter of routine, would have access to a panel of experts.</p><p>  The Chairman referred to the Comptroller and Auditor General, who has a constitutional role which is prescribed under Article 33 and is prohibited from being a Member of either House.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is circumscribed in what he can do.</p></speech>

Let us take the banking inquiry, for example.  There are probably an awful lot of documents that would be useful for the committee to see.  To help expedite that sort of inquiry, Deputy Pringle is suggesting that, rather than having the committee meet in a group of nine or 15 members who try to figure out the required documentation, one could appoint an expert investigator who knows what is needed.  In addition, that investigator would have the power vested in them by the committee to demand documentation from the banks involved.  I will withdraw the amendment, but the Minister might consider that point.</p></speech>

Basically, therefore, we do not need legislation.  We can expand Standing Orders to accommodate the committee.</p></speech>

Obviously, an expert hired by a committee could not do so.  Perhaps the Minister could consider that point to see if it would be useful for Oireachtas inquiries.</p></speech>

The Standing Order states that a select committee is empowered to send for persons, papers and records, and may report its opinions and observations together with the minutes of evidence taken before the D&aacute;il and also make a special report on that.  Therefore, the committee actually has that power.  The person working for the committee is subservient to the committee, not superior to it.  As I understand it, any instructions for pulling in documentation would be on behalf of the committee, not on behalf of the appointed person.</p></speech>

I do not think one can franchise the work of the Oireachtas itself.  Looking at the amendment, subsection (6) refers to a person being interviewed pursuant to subsection (2) who may decline to answer any question or refuse a request by the inquiry to produce any document, and may terminate the interview at any time.  Also, a person to whom a request is made may refuse to comply with the request.  While one is giving power, one is actually taking the power back so the person is being given a very limited scope.</p></speech>

It is not saying that the Government should waive Cabinet confidentiality, or that Cabinet confidentiality should not exist.  It is just giving the committee power to make such a request.  This amendment does no more than allow the committee to write a letter to the Secretary General to the Government asking the Government to waive Cabinet confidentiality.  The Government can choose not to do so and the Attorney General can say it is not allowed.  However, I believe that for a committee not to be able to ask this question would show it in a very weak light.  If a government chooses not to provide information, that decision should be part of the committee's proceedings.  It is important that the Government should be able to assist a committee in matters that are being inquired into.<br /> I would like a response to that first point, which I will develop subsequently when I hear the Minister's reply.</p></speech>

It might be useful, particularly for matters such as the banking inquiry, to be able to access Cabinet materials.  I suppose the Attorney General would have an opinion on this, but we are certainly coming close to the constitutional article on this issue.  Article 28.4.3&deg; states:<blockquote><br />The confidentiality of discussions at meetings of the Government shall be respected in all circumstances save only where the High Court determines that disclosure should be made in respect of a particular matter - iin the interests of the administration of justice by a Court, or<br />ii by virtue of an overriding public interest, pursuant to an application in that behalf by a tribunal appointed by the Government or a Minister of the Government on the authority of the Houses of the Oireachtas to inquire into a matter stated by them to be of public importance.</blockquote>  The latter provision is the relevant one here.  There is an issue where the High Court may need to determine it, but my reading of this Article as a lay person is that where the Houses of the Oireachtas have deemed an inquiry is in the public interest - which, hopefully, any of these committees would be - Cabinet or Government confidentiality would be waived.</p></speech>

Article 28.4.3&deg; was inserted in the Constitution following the judgment of the Supreme Court in the Attorney General <i>v</i>. Hamilton case, deriving the principle of Cabinet confidentiality from the general principle of collective responsibility in Article 28.4.2&deg;.  Up to that point, there was an absolute prohibition on giving any information on discussions or papers at Cabinet.</p> <p>The purpose of the amendment was to establish exceptions to the absolute principle identified in the Supreme Court judgment to allow for disclosure of Cabinet discussions in the two instances referred to, rightly, by Deputy Donnelly.  This is a constitutional issue and it is not open to us to vary or amend the provision.  The High Court can only make a determination in a case where it is in the interests of the administration of justice by a court.  Obviously, this does not meet that criterion.  The High Court can also make a determination by virtue of the overriding public interest pursuant to an application in that behalf by a tribunal appointed by the Government or a Minister of the Government.  This will not be a tribunal so appointed and we would need to amend the Constitution to capture what the Deputy intends.  That is the formal advice I have.</p></speech>

Let us say there was a proposal to investigate an issue relating to a particular disability and to ask what the policy thinking was and what Cabinet consideration was given.  What is the constitutional position with regard to calling in the Minister for health who was in office at the material time to discuss the Cabinet or departmental thinking?

There is no issue with going through all the policy issues and what was done in a Department in relation to such matters.  There would not be an issue either with regard to the issues the Chairman mentions.  What is protected is Cabinet documentation and Cabinet discussions.  It is an important principle upon which we should not trample readily.  The Cabinet must be free to discuss.  As the Constitution provides that the decisions of Cabinet are the collective decisions of every member, the fact that one trenchantly opposed something at Cabinet cannot be exposed subsequently.  It should not be exposed subsequently because the Cabinet decision is one's own decision unless one resigns.  That allows for the robustness of real Cabinet debate, which is why the protection is there.  There will be no impediment, however, to conducting the type of inquiry referred to by the Chairman as a result of that particular rule.</p></speech>

It refers to discussions only and not to papers.  We are very clear that the amendment to the Constitution set out in Article 28.4.3&deg; refers to the confidentiality of discussions and does not protect papers to the same extent.  There is an exception where there is an application by a tribunal appointed by the Government or a Minister of the Government on the authority of the Oireachtas.  It does not cover inquiries, but it covers tribunals.  We are saying before we start that an inquiry carried out under the legislation will have fewer powers than a tribunal, by definition.</p></speech>

It deals with Cabinet confidentiality but what I mean to get at is the legal privilege normally claimed in respect of the Attorney General's advice.  That cannot be discussed now and I will come back to it on Report Stage.  I am thinking of a specific case.  I looked with disquiet at an aspect of the draft report of the Moriarty tribunal into the mobile phone licence.  At that tribunal, Ministers, including John Bruton, Deputies Hogan and Quinn and others, gave evidence.  I am a bit scathing of civil servants on this - the permanent government, as I call them.  The permanent government had no problem with all politicians being hung out to dry.  When the draft report was produced and certain public officials did not come out in a good light on foot of a bit of criticism, the permanent government managed to get the elected Government to waive the legal privilege of the Attorney General's advice as set out in the Nesbitt opinion.  That was covered extensively.  The purpose was to allow the officials who were not coming out in a good light in the draft report to say they were following the Nesbitt opinion, which was privileged legal advice.  They would not have dreamed of asking the Government to waive legal privilege in respect of the Attorney General's advice had it been to protect a member of the Government.  Once it was affecting a member of the permanent, unelected Government, they were very quickly able to get the elected Government to waive the legal privilege.</p><p>  I want the same procedures to be available, at a minimum, in respect of tribunals of inquiry that we saw exercised before the Moriarty tribunal.  It will not conflict with anything here.  I will be coming back with a refined amendment dealing with the waiving of privilege in respect of the legal advice from the Attorney General, as we saw happen in the interests of protecting public servants.</p></speech>

We are dealing with the nub of the referendum that was not passed last year.  This is the type of issue that orbits around that.  I return to the earlier hypothetical situation of the investigation of an issue concerning a particular disability by an Oireachtas committee, which would ask questions of the Minister of the day.  Departmental decisions of the Minister and Cabinet decisions reflective of the issue will have been made.  Would it be admissible to ask a Minister what information was available to him in the making of a decision?  That is not a question of Cabinet confidentiality as I understand it.  If the information available to the Minister ends up before the Cabinet, does it become subject to Cabinet confidentiality?</p></speech>

Therefore, the question is why this section is in here.  As I read the constitutional section, it refers to the High Court determining that disclosure should be made by virtue of an overriding public interest pursuant to an application on that behalf by a tribunal appointed by a Government or a Minister of the Government on the authority of the Houses of the Oireachtas to inquire into matters stated by them to be of public importance.  One can read that in two different ways.  One can read it as pursuant to an application from a tribunal appointed by either a Government or a Minister of Government on the authority of the Houses of the Oireachtas or as pursuant to an application from the tribunal or a Minister of the Government.

It concerns the points we have been talking about, namely, confidentiality and waiving legal advice.  I have a difficulty with subsection (1)(<i>d</i>), which states that a person shall not attend if the evidence or document could, if given to the committee, reasonably be expected to adversely affect the security of the State to be prejudicial to the State in its relations with other states.  The bank guarantee had major implications.  When one is part of the eurozone, any decision one makes about banks in the eurozone has implications for our relations with other states.  I believe this section is wrong because, by including that provision, it could close down an inquiry into anything concerning any bank, or it could close down any inquiry that has an impact on matters relating to other states.  I am making my point quite clear.</p><p>  Could the Minister explain his argument regarding subsection (1)(<i>f</i>), under which the committee cannot seek information for the purpose of accessing the liability of a person to pay tax, such as the property tax?  If somebody owes money due to an outstanding accident and emergency bill, why can we not know about it?

I am concerned about the provision allowing a person to refuse to give evidence or supply information if he or she believes it impacts on section 68(1)(<i>d</i>) or (<i>e</i>).  If the person refuses, the committee shall, if necessary, adjourn proceedings.  The person can get a letter from a Minister to back up his or her point and the committee is stopped in its tracks.  Under paragraph (<i>b</i>), the same can happen in respect of a Garda inquiry if the DPP or the Commissioner issues a letter.  There is no mechanism for appeal by the committee to the Minister.  We have seen this on two occasions recently in the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Minister advises us this provision replicates those of previous Acts.  I am worried about that because I have seen the previous Acts being abused on two occasions this year.  One one occasion when a Secretary General did not want to speak about the Dublin Docklands Development Authority she simply sent a letter backed by the Minister and we were stopped in our tracks.  On another occasion, we were investigating a case of over-expenditure on an office for the Probation Service in north Dublin and a dispute with a landlord.  The Chief State Solicitor was due to appear before the committee but was not happy to discuss the issue even though it had been in a public forum since the Comptroller and Auditor General had issued a report on it last September.  The night before she was to appear before the committee she commenced legal proceedings and then told us she could not discuss the issue on that basis.  She contrived to frustrate the committee.</p></speech>

Fortunately, the Secretary General of the Department, who was present, took a slightly more balanced view of the matter and we got some information.  I have seen this type of provision being abused by officials of the State, thereby preventing the Committee of Public Accounts from doing its legitimate work.  If this section replicates the existing powers, the same thing can happen.  A committee could be 18 months into an inquiry when a Secretary General decides he or she does not want to co-operate and gets a Minister to sign a letter in order to close the inquiry.  I am not happy with this section.</p></speech>

There are clear separations of power and if somebody is in the midst of legal proceedings, we cannot conduct a parallel investigation.  The issue arising is whether the exercise of that power is to be reviewed.  I will reflect on that issue between now and Report Stage.</p></speech>

For the future, for committees such as those we are discussing, it is very important.  I appreciate it is long-standing, and presumably legal, practice that State employees do not give opinions at committees on Government policy.</p> <p>I see why this is the case but, specific to committees of inquiry, an interesting case can be made to waive this and allow them give opinion.  I am sure it applies to many, but I have in mind in particular the banking inquiry.  It would be very useful, in the public interest and in the interest of the Oireachtas, for us to be able to ask State employees for their opinion on the policy that was being pursued at the time.</p></speech>

It permits a civil servant to give evidence for the purpose of establishing facts and giving the committee a factual account of a matter.  Deputy Donnelly wants to go further and allow civil servants give their views on policy.  Civil servants are not accountable for policy.  If one is sitting with a group of civil servants one might get a variety of contradictory or countervailing views.  Bluntly, and with all due respect to senior civil servants, their policy views do not matter because they are not elected.  The only person whose policy view matters is the relevant Minister whose policy can be implemented and who is accountable to the House for this policy position.  I remember a former colleague of Deputy Fleming's was very strong in this regard.  There was a view that if one did not implement a civil servant's policy platform one was somehow at fault.  Civil servants are entitled to a viewpoint and to have robust discussion, and this strong policy debate should properly happen in a ministerial office and in a Department, but ultimately a Minister decides and is accountable for this decision.  It is hit and miss.  One could have three different assistant secretaries with different views on an issue but it does not matter.  What is important is that they are required and enabled to give a factual account of matters and give evidence on how policy was formulated, but not give their view on policy.</p></speech>

To give the banking inquiry as an example, some State employees were present and had expert opinion and inside opinion.  A committee of inquiry might call an expert and ask his or her opinion and it would be argued his or her opinion matters.  I understand what the Minister stated but I see no downside to a committee of inquiry being able to ask for the opinion of a State employee.  I fully accept that this would not be about holding State employees accountable for this policy, which is the crux of what the Minister stated, as the Government of the time would be held accountable.</p></speech>

A Department does not have two heads so one cannot have a Minister with one view and somebody else in the Department with a different view.  I accept this and it makes for common sense.  If an inquiry is being held and we accept civil servants cannot comment on the policy, how can they help the committee in its consideration of what went on?  Surely they would have put various policy options.  They may not have agreed with the options, and they may not have reflected their individual positions, but they may have tabled them as being worth considering.  For me it would be important to know what was presented to the Minister by way of options and not which was the favourite option of a civil servant.  I would like to see how they provide information.  It comes back to the paper trail.  Depending on its nature, some of this information is obtainable under the freedom of information legislation.  There is nothing wrong with the public seeing the documents sent to a Minister in the run-up to a budget outlining various approaches that could be considered.  This would help us, and not just the elected Government, understand the preparedness of senior State officials at the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.  If it transpired they had no options to offer the Government at a key point it would be an observation in its own right, or if they tabled several options, some of which were valid but were ignored, it would give us a better understanding of how the system operated.</p></speech>

I understand the concern the Minister has with regard to witnesses coming before an inquiry who are shut down and unable to give full information.  The clarification is with regard to where this factual account of options ends and where an expression of opinion as to whether the right or wrong option was selected begins.  This is the issue.</p></speech>

A civil servant, a member of the Permanent Defence Force or a garda may, if asked by a committee, gave a factual account of a matter, including evidence of anything said or communicated by any person during the course of events of which an account has been given.  In essence, what informed the decision, which is what we really want to know, is fully available, and this includes the options.  All that is prohibited is for a civil servant to state what his or her preferred view was or that the Minister was quite wrong.  Information on all the background to the decision-making - who submitted evidence, who was present and what options were discussed - is perfectly available.</p></speech>

One can disaggregate all that went into it and cross-examine the Minister on how he or she came to the conclusion when he or she had various other options, but one cannot ask a civil servant what he or she thought of it because it would fundamentally sunder the normal relationship between the Civil Service and the Government of the day, which is one of our strengths of democracy.  I have served in Administrations where the immediately preceding Administration had a completely different policy, and I will give a small example of this.  In 1993 I became Minister for Health.  Within a month I deregulated condoms and repealed the daft legislation requiring a doctor's prescription.  One month earlier, the official departmental line in answer to parliamentary questions had been to provide robust reasons one could not possibly have access to a condom without a doctor's certificate; one month later, the official policy was different and all of the replies to parliamentary questions and official utterances were in line with the new policy.  This is what we need.  Policy is determined democratically by the elected Government on the vote of the people and not by civil servants.</p></speech>

Lots of banks, for example, are companies and, in that context, how strong is this section?  Perhaps the issue is dealt with in other sections of the legislation, but the references to banks and corporate organisations in the Bill seem to be very light, in terms of sanctions.  A fine of &euro;500,000 for an individual is very serious but for one of the major banks, a fine of that magnitude might represent 33 minutes worth of interest on a loan account.  It is not very severe.  I would suggest body corporates should be dealt with far more seriously than individuals because for many big businesses &euro;500,000 is a drop in the ocean.</p><p>  The DIRT inquiry uncovered the biggest tax fraud in the history of the State by AIB, involving deliberate falsification of customer account information.  AIB bank ended up paying almost &euro;100 million in unpaid DIRT but it used its corporate power to prevent Revenue from pursuing it for interest and penalties, which Revenue was entitled to do, by threatening to go to court and all the way to Europe, if necessary.  In that way, Revenue faced the prospect of years of legal battles with no guarantee that it would get the money in the end.  AIB ended up getting away with paying a relatively small amount in interest and penalties.  If a company is before a committee of inquiry which is guilty of tax fraud to the tune of millions, potentially, a fine of &euro;500,000 is buttons.  I ask the Minister to consider this.  A fine of that level is of no consequence to many large businesses.

I would say, for example, that a bank should lose its licence for five years.  If a person is going to go to jail for five years for falling foul of this legislation, he or she is being taken out of commission, so to speak.  A body corporate should suffer similar consequences and forfeit its tax clearance, its licence or some such for the same period of time, in lieu of going to jail.  A body corporate cannot be sent to jail.  There should not be one rule for the small people and another for the big guys.</p></speech>

Deputy Fleming is talking about two different things.  These penalties are for obstructing a proper inquiry.  They are not penalties for being a tax defaulter, for example.  There is tax law in place to deal with tax defaulters and tax defaulters must be prosecuted through the courts in the normal way.  The penalties and the creation of offences here refer only to the obstruction of the work of the Oireachtas in conducting inquiries.  The penalties for corporate bodies parallel the individual penalties.  Section 120 provides that "if the offence is attributable to any wilful neglect, of a person who was a director, manager, secretary or other officer of the body corporate, or a person purporting to act in that capacity, that person, as well as the body corporate, is guilty of an offence and may be proceeded against and punished as if he or she were guilty of the first-mentioned offence".  The directors, secretary or officers of a corporate body would be acted upon if that corporate body wilfully gave wrong evidence or obstructed the work of the committee in the way we have outlined in the Bill.  If there was a consequent discovery of tax fraud or any other criminal activity, that would be pursued in the normal way by the DPP.</p></speech>

We will proceed with item No. 9 on today's agenda, the third review by the Information Commissioner of reports on section 32 non-disclosure provisions under the Freedom of Information Act 1997.  I welcome the Information Commissioner, Ms Emily O'Reilly, who is accompanied by Mr. Stephen Rafferty.  The meeting will proceed with Ms O'Reilly making some opening remarks and we will follow up with a question-and-answer session.</p><p>  I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against a person or persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official in such as way as to make him or her identifiable.  Having said that, I call on Ms Emily O'Reilly to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-05a.670" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013060500003#K00400"><p>I am grateful for the invitation to meet the committee this afternoon to present my opinions and conclusions on the reports prepared by the various Ministers under section 32(3) of the Freedom of Information Act.  Before I comment on the contents of the report that I have submitted to the committee, there are several matters I wish to bring to the committee's attention.</p> <p>First, the FOI Act requires the first reports of the Ministers to have been submitted to the committee within 12 months of the commencement of the Act and for subsequent reports to be submitted every five years thereafter.  Ministers are also required to provide my office with copies of the reports.  In keeping with the prescribed five-year cycle, the current review was due to have been carried out in 2009.  However, by the end of 2009, only nine such reports had been submitted.  The final outstanding report was submitted, by the Department of Finance, on 29 February 2012.  Section 32 is a very important provision because it subordinates the access provisions of the FOI Act to all non-disclosure provisions in other statutes, apart from those included in the third schedule to the FOI Act.  I stated in my annual report for 2012 that many new non-disclosure provisions had been introduced since the FOI Act became law in 1997.  Indeed, Departments are reporting approximately 230 enactments containing non-disclosure provisions, of which approximately 50% have became law since 1 January 1998.  I noted in my report that this means as many non-disclosure provisions have been introduced since 1997 as were introduced in the preceding 75 years.  In my view, this highlights the importance of ensuring that reviews under section 32 are conducted in a timely fashion as required by the FOI Act.  On a related matter, I ask the committee to bear in mind that the reports of the various Departments do not necessarily capture all of the non-disclosure provisions currently in existence, given that nine of the reports are more than three years old at this stage.</p><p> The second general comment I would like to make relates to my experience of having presented my previous report to the then Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service in 2006.  While my views on the matter are already on the public record, I believe it is worth repeating that I was disappointed that, of the 36 secrecy clauses from a total of 150 identified where I disagreed with the relevant Minister as to whether the secrecy provision should be made subservient to the FOI Act, the committee's recommendation was to support the relevant Minister in every case.  I was disappointed in particular that the committee gave no explanation of any kind, or any explanation in its report, as to why it opted for one set of recommendations over another.  I have decided to make this comment here today, if for no other reason than to highlight the importance I attach to the review process this committee is undertaking and to urge it to bear in mind that section 32(2) of the FOI Act requires that in conducting the review, the committee should have regard to the provisions, purpose and spirit of the FOI Act.</p><p> As the committee can appreciate, my report is rather long and technical and I do not propose in the course of this presentation to go through it in detail.  I will confine myself to some general observations on the approach I have taken.  Naturally, if the committee has any questions on specific provisions mentioned in the report, I will be happy to deal with them.</p><p> As a general proposition, I take the view that all of the secrecy provisions should be subject to FOI except where there is a very clear case for exclusion.  It is important to note that the FOI Act does not apply at all to certain records held by public bodies.  For example, the Act does not apply to non-administrative records held by the offices of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General.  Furthermore, Part III of the Act has specific exemptions to protect records for various reasons, whether by virtue of their coming within a specified class or to protect against certain specified harms likely to arise were the records released.  The FOI Act is not there to do harm, as I have said on many occasions, and, in my view, the current safeguards in the Act are generally sufficiently robust to protect all of the important interests of the State.</p><p> I would also like to draw the committee's attention to my views on those statutory provisions deriving from EU law.  It has been argued that where non-disclosure provisions do no more than implement EU law, it is not appropriate to include any of them in the Third Schedule.  My view is that, by and large, such non-disclosure provisions should be included in the Third Schedule, where the protections and exemptions of the FOI Act can be applied, unless the source EU directive explicitly prohibits disclosure in any circumstance.  It is also important to bear in mind that a confidentiality provision does not equate to a non-disclosure provision.</p><p> This leads me to my final comment.  The committee will note some instances in my report in which I question whether certain provisions can be regarded as prohibiting access under FOI given that the provisions apply "save as otherwise provided by law".  I take the view that such provisions do not constitute absolute prohibitions of the type envisaged by section 32(1) of the FOI Act to support the refusal of access to information under the FOI Act.  If the committee agrees, it may wish to consider recommending the inclusion of such provisions in the Third Schedule to remove any doubts on the matter.  That concludes my opening address and I am happy to deal with any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

Before commencing, however, I would like to bring Ms O'Reilly back to her reference to her previous engagement with this committee in 2006.  She expresses some disappointment with that meeting.  Could she elaborate on that?  It was before my time in the House and certainly before I became Chairman of this committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-05a.673" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013060500004#L00300"><p>I actually had an excellent engagement with the committee at the time when Deputy Fleming was Chairman.   We thrashed out many matters.  Whatever happened and whatever interactions and concerns there were outside the committee room, I believe the Whip was applied - maybe for the first time in this committee - and when the report came out it amounted to a single paragraph.  The rest was annexes and so on with the Departments' reports.  If I recall correctly, the paragraph stated "In every instance where the Information Commissioner disagrees with the Minister or vice versa we support the Minister".  Clearly, that was disappointing, particularly in light of the excellent engagement we had.</p><p>  If I may refer to particular conversations, we discussed, for example, section 53 of the Education Act, which is still there and trumps the FOI Act in respect of a citizen's or individual's access rights to inspection reports on schools.  I took the view that citizens, parents and families and anybody who wished to see these should have a right to do so.  Subsequently, there was quite a brouhaha about access to these school inspection reports and they are now freely available on the website of the Department of Education and Skills.  Just before I came out here I looked them up and counted over 2,000 inspection reports that are freely available, yet an individual has no statutory right to see them under FOI.  That was one particular issue that arose.  As the saying goes, that was then, and I hope we will have a good engagement today and perhaps a different outcome.</p></speech>

Forgetting about the disagreement with the Minister, are those ratios still the same?  Does Ms O'Reilly's concerns about those 36 secrecy clauses still exist, or has the ratio changed?</p></speech>

I am not making a party political point here but, as the Chairman knows, there has been a rethink about FOI.  We expect quite a progressive new Bill to go through by the end of the year so in a way we are in limbo.  I am not saying the Departments do not still hold these views but am pointing out that most of the reports arguing for the retention of the secrecy clauses were compiled quite a few years ago.</p></speech>

I ask her to explain the last paragraph on page 1 of her presentation more slowly because it is complicated.  Section 32 is a very important provision because it subordinates the access provisions to the FOI Act to all non-disclosure provisions in other statute, apart from those included in the Third Schedule to the FOI Act.  I ask her to break that down in steps for me.  Ms O'Reilly will probably appreciate that the majority of people do not know what is in the Third Schedule to the FOI Act.  She might discuss those points.  The presentation refers to non-disclosure provisions in the Third Schedule and that Departments recommend the non-disclosure provisions which should be included in the Third Schedule.</p></speech>

Under the Act if any of those provisions is included in the Third Schedule it means that, in effect, the FOI Act trumps them.  The non-disclosure provisions are still in place but are referenced in regard to the exemptions and permissions within the Act.  If a non-disclosure provision is included in the Third Schedule it is possible that records may still be released by reference to the FOI Act.  For example, they might be released in the public interest or under a number of provisions within the FOI Act.  If they are not included in the Third Schedule, that is it.</p></speech>

For example, if the non-disclosure provision in regard to inspection reports under section 53 of the Education Act are included in the Third Schedule it means they can be released by reference to the FOI Act, as opposed to simply saying that they are not included, therefore nothing can be released.  Some of the non-disclosure provisions in regard to financial bodies such as NAMA, the National Pensions Reserve Fund and other agencies should be included in the Third Schedule in order that records can be released in regard to the provisions of the FOI Act.</p></speech>

It was complicated and we had trouble drafting a report.  I ask Ms Reilly to comment on, for the benefit of everyone else, any of the Departments mentioned.  Page 34 refers to the Department of Health and says 24 non-disclosure provisions are already included in the Third Schedule.  The Department has them, Ms O'Reilly is happy with them and that is the end of that.  Page 35 says the Department recommends that the following non-disclosure provisions should be included in the Third Schedule.  It is happy that they should now be included.</p></speech>

The top of page 36 refers to the  European Communities (Active Implantable Medical Devices) (Amendment) Regulations 2009.  The Department wants to exclude it but Ms O'Reilly disagrees and wants to include it.  I will not go into the specifics, but I ask Ms O'Reilly to comment on it in order that we understand what we are doing.  There are three Schedules for most Departments but we are only interested in one.</p></speech>

The Department of Health made the point, with which I agree, that the confidential nature of the information relating to claimants supports exclusion from the Third Schedule.</p></speech>

Page 1 has an appendix of all Government Departments.  I counted approximately 100 items in those Schedules to be included.  Ms O'Reilly agrees with the Department's recommendation to exclude 48 items and disagreed with it on 52 items.  It is a 50-50 split.  The Chairman referred to a 36-50 split.  The only point at issue today are the 52 cases on which Ms O'Reilly disagrees with the Department.  She agrees with those in the Schedule and those included by the Department.  She also agrees with those which the Department said should be excluded. </p><p>  The only matter at issue is where Ms O'Reilly disagrees with the Department trying to exclude them.  The issue is complicated.  A Schedule on page 34 may not be relevant.  I referred to the Department of Health because it is a prominent Department.  I will refer to some cases and ask for Ms O'Reilly's observations.  She might comment on cases where she disagrees with the Department, such as the Dentists Act 1985, the Nurses Act 1985, the official control of foodstuffs regulation and section 30 of the Health Act 2004.  She may not have the details of those cases, but I ask her to give us a flavour of why the Department does not want them included.  That is the nub of our discussion. </p></speech>

The Department said the non-disclosure provision should remain.  It anticipates new legislation.  The point I made when I dealt with this the last time was that fitness to practise inquiries have a major public interest element.  If particular interests need to be protected I would argue they are sufficiently protected within the FOI Act.  It is as simple as that.</p></speech>

There is a note on page 39 about the Dentists and Nurses Acts and the Department expressed concern regarding information on fitness to practise.  She said privacy issues and individual personal interests are already well covered, but the Department is afraid to let her adjudicate on it.</p></speech>

Certainly, there are interests that needs to be protected, but the public interest also needs to be protected.  Certain areas are obviously sensitive for practitioners and people going before them.  In a lot of areas dealt with in the report the various Departments want black and white certainty.  They want to know certain things will not be released under any circumstances.  There is sometimes a reluctance to trust in the ability of someone like me or anybody else to make a call that is genuinely in the public interest and does not do harm. </p><p>  In my introduction I said that the FOI Act is not there to do harm.  I am mindful of all the interests at stake in any decision I make.  I can honestly say that in the past ten years I have been Information Commissioner no ruling of mine has caused any particular harm.  It is always down to a matter of trust.  The fact that the FOI legislation is being amended and would appear to be more liberal and progressive points to the fact that there is a greater concern for the public interest, possibly arising out of events in the country over the past number of years, and that the private interests of individuals sometimes need to be challenged a little more robustly in regard to the overall public interest at play.</p></speech>

Ms O'Reilly gave the example of the school inspection reports.  These are not included but the Department has published them on its website.  In a way it is better because one does not need to go through the FOI system and the website is more convenient, which is better for everyone.</p></speech>

I refer to the recent news story about the cr&egrave;che inspection reports which can be released under FOI.  However, they were not being put up.  That is probably an argument to be made by politicians rather than the Information Commissioner that these reports should be released as a matter of course, as is the case with reports on nursing homes.</p></speech>

As a Deputy I have experience of seeking information from various bodies.</p><p>The Committee of Public Accounts requests information from bodies which it is investigating and it may only receive a certain amount of the requested information.  However, a journalist making an FOI request will be given more information.  There is an anomaly.  It seems that public officials have greater protection in issuing information under an FOI request.  Various officials in different Departments have advised me to encourage my client to submit a request under FOI and they will release the information.  It seems they need the legal mechanism of an FOI request.</p></speech>

A Government has the right to have non-disclosure provisions.  However, I recommend that there should be a formal mechanism for notifying the Information Commissioner when this is being applied.  Legislation is being passed every week, some of which may include a non-disclosure provision, but the Information Commissioner cannot be expected to read every D&aacute;il debate.</p></speech>

The Act was severely amended in 2003 and I do not think there was an appetite for restricting it any further.  Rightly or wrongly it appeared to me that the method of restricting it was to take bodies out of FOI when they were subsumed into new entities.  In some cases the new bodies were not included in FOI by the introduction of the non-disclosure provisions.</p></speech>

Each member state has a duty to inform anyone from another member state making an FOI request about the state of play as regards transparency and obligations in that state.  The person can then choose whether to send the information.  When European legislation is transposed into Irish law it is then regarded as Irish law and therefore should be subject to the same transparency and data protection obligations applying to everything else.</p></speech>

Ms O'Reilly referred to public interest consideration when she attended committee hearings in the period January to March.  One of the issues that crops up in some of our recommendations and in her report is the issue of the public interest test, to determine exactly what is in the public interest.  For example, I refer to the issue of Bus &Eacute;ireann and passenger numbers.  One can argue about whether Bus &Eacute;ireann is a monopoly.  What is the public interest aspect of knowing that information?  Who would conduct the public interest test?  Sections of the report refer to the body itself undertaking the test while the committee recommended a co-ordinated public interest test undertaken by Ms O'Reilly's agency or some other body.</p></speech>

If there is a public interest override to a particular exemption, for example, one might find that certain records contain confidential information but nonetheless the exemption includes a public interest override so it is necessary to strike a balance between the various public interests in play.  The body has an obligation to carry this out at the first stage and my office has an obligation to carry it out when it is being reviewed.</p><p>  I refer to a particular case in the recent past in the Supreme Court.  It might be a little strong to say that the case redefined the public interest.  My office never invented a particular public interest but the wording used in the judgment was that it had to be a recognised public interest.  In other words, it had to be an established public interest.  I refer to a particular case where a gentleman was attempting to find some birth information relating to his late mother as he had been put up for adoption.  In that case the court found that there was not an established public interest.</p></speech>

The Supreme Court decided that was a private as opposed to a public interest and that a true public interest has to be inherent in government policy or otherwise by law.  It is not simply a matter of the Information Commissioner importing private interest into the public interest arena.</p></speech>

There are non-disclosure provisions and it will be interesting to see how they play out once those bodies are included under FOI.  The debate is around the definition of the public interest and who calls it.  Presumably certain bodies with a particular expertise, whether in health or finance or managing public funds, will regard themselves as the guardians in those areas.  However, as Information Commissioner I have been entrusted to make those decisions and these can be difficult.  I must have regard to commercial sensitivities or private personal interests.  My office puts a lot of time and thought into this work and in general we get it right.</p></speech>

The committee was broadly in agreement that State-funded bodies should be included.  I refer to the definition of monopoly with regard to commercial semi-state bodies.  Bus &Eacute;ireann pretty much has a monopoly and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has lots of subsidiaries but it is self-funding whereas Bus &Eacute;ireann takes a very large subsidy from the State.</p> <p>That also applies to the banks.  We are moving to a point where perhaps some of them might become private companies.  How does Ms O'Reilly envisage the definitions of a monopoly and a semi-state company working?  I note the suggestion that there would be restricted provision for semi-state companies.  How does she envisage this working, particularly for profitable semi-state companies?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-05a.720" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="12:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013060500007#O00200"><p>There are a number of factors involved and this is something that is being thrashed out as the Bill moves further towards completion.  There is a realisation that, by definition, semi-state companies operate in the commercial world also.  These interests have to be guarded to ensure their competitors will not be given a competitive advantage over them by virtue of the fact that they are not subject to FOI legislation.  This is something that has to be carefully calibrated.  I cannot say where exactly it should come down in terms of percentages and so on.  The amount of public funding is an issue because one of the things that has defined FOI legislation and influenced most of the seminal decisions made in recent years has been that where there is public money involved, there is a public interest in seeing where it goes.  It is a question of balancing the semi-state companies' ability to operate, be competitive and make profits with the public interest in knowing where our money is going.  There have been many conversations around that issue and presumably when the Bill comes back to the committee, that discussion will continue.  It would be difficult to a take slide rule approach to it and say where exactly it should come down.  They need to compete with the private boys who do not have to show anything within the normal rules of disclosure and regulation, which has to be balanced with the fact that there is a great deal of taxpayers' money involved and we need to know where it goes.</p></speech>

Ms O'Reilly might not want to give a figure in that respect, but does she have a view on the matter?</p></speech>

It is a matter of adopting a common sense approach which will be difficult to do.  I do not know whether it is amenable to a one-size-fits-all approach, but I hope a rational means of arriving at a fair decision that respects the public interest will be reached eventually.</p></speech>

I welcome our guests and it is great to have both before the committee.</p><p>  I wish to return to some of Ms O'Reilly's opening comments.  She noted that by the end of 2009 only nine Departments had returned the reports as required under the FOI Act for the purposes of a review.  To what does she attribute the delay by these Departments that returned reports late?  I note the Department of Finance was three years late in returning its report.  How did that come to pass?</p></speech>

It would be wrong of me to suggest reasons and obviously those in the Department will have an opportunity to speak for themselves.  I imagine that events post-2008 diverted attention away from these matters.  I have observed from 2003 onwards and most of my early years as Information Commissioner that there was no great enthusiasm for FOI legislation throughout the public administration and that this seeped through it.  I do not think officials who might have been charged with undertaking these tasks necessarily thought they were going to get into trouble if they were a little late in returning them.  It was the general view of FOI legislation at the time that it was not a priority and, therefore, issues such as producing these reports which I, as Information Commissioner, regard as very important were put on the back burner, but it will be down to the individual Departments involved to comment on this.</p></speech>

I have a sense that it is overly protective and secretive.  Ms O'Reilly, interestingly, instanced the assessments and reports on schools and cr&egrave;ches which were amenable under FOI legislation which should have been in the public domain, yet there has been a reticence within the system to share information.  Does she share that view and has she seen any change in that respect during her time in her role?  Has she seen any progress and, if so, to what degree in the cultural element of sharing information?</p></speech>

It was seen as an instrument of good governance in bringing the citizen closer to the State and it was considered that it would be good for the State.  In the first few years a number of reports were commissioned by various bodies which talked it up, but then things went sour.  A number of decisions were made, either at an initial level or at the level of the Information Commissioner, with which the public administration was not very happy.  When the amending Bill was introduced in 2003, one could track particular decisions to the amendments that had gone through.  For a period throughout most of the early 2000s it was not deemed to be a priority and all of these non-disclosure provisions were introduced without reference to us.  Sometimes people walked in off the street or rang us to tell us certain things were off the FOI radar and we had not been informed of these decisions.</p><p>  What cued change was the crash.  We noticed in our work - public bodies would also have noticed it - that relatively few bodies had been bothered by FOI requests, but suddenly there was a slew and an enormous increase in appetite for accessing public records.  People wanted to know what had caused the crash, the ingredients, as it were, within the public administration, whether they were still there and whether they could be rooted out.  That led during the last general election campaign to much political debate and many political promises of greater transparency.  It was seen, rightly or wrongly, that the absence of transparency and also the absence of an appetite for transparency when everything was going so well had partly contributed to the crash.</p><p>  The new Government made promises in relation to the FOI Act.  The proposals now on the table which are still being worked on are progressive, even as they relate to the initial 1997 Act.  I am on record as having said on a number of occasions that the devil would be in the detail.  For example, I am pleased that it is intended that bodies such as NAMA, the NTMA and the Central Bank will come within the remit of FOI legislation, but to what extent will they come within its remit?  Will non-disclosure provisions still be used to trump FOI requests and in the end will we see records of significant public interest?  There will be big battles ahead in the judging of a particular commercial interest and whether the public interest overrides it.  Any fair assessment of the work this office has done during my time would not show that I have taken a cavalier approach to these issues and there are certain records which broadly people might have considered to be in the public interest that have not been released by me because I take the views of public bodies very seriously.</p></speech>

I raise the subject of justice most particularly because it is one on which the Information Commissioner has spoken previously.  In particular, in respect of immigration, and all matters pertaining to refugees and their status in the State, there is certainly a common conception, not least among refugees, that there is a veil of secrecy and that the system is almost impenetrable.  I ask the Information Commissioner to say a few words on the two items mentioned on page 41 of her report.  Thereafter, she should offer the joint committee a broader commentary on the subject of justice and the basket of issues pertaining to the immigration process, refugees and asylum, as well as her views thereon in respect of transparency, accountability and the availability of information.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-06-05a.731" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="12:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013060500008#P00200"><p>In respect of the Refugee Act, this relates to confidentiality regarding the identity and nationality of people applying for asylum.  The exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act are to be found in sections 26 and 28 and pertain to records given to a public body in confidence and personal information, respectively.  Both sections have public interest overrides which I have been discussing.  I again make the same point that there are sufficient protections in the Freedom of Information Act to deal with that issue.  I follow closely issues on asylum and immigration and in reference to my earlier comments, this is one area in which there is a reluctance to allow anyone else to oversee decisions made about such matters.  I will put it like this: it is a sensitive issue that straddles many important areas of public life, from the welfare of asylum seekers to security issues and all sorts of other things.  I do not wish to speak for the Department and this is simply my assessment based on my experience in the past ten years, but the Department perhaps takes the view that it alone has the knowledge, expertise and awareness of the public interest to be able to make the correct decisions on these matters.  I take the view that any body should be amenable to external oversight.  I refer to the role of the Information Commissioner or rather to that of the Ombudsman and note that most of these matters are outside my remit.  However, in respect of those matters that I can consider, if I am looking at particular decisions, it is not that I would wish to substitute my decision for that of the Department.  I am speaking as the Ombudsman as opposed to the Information Commissioner, but it is more that the role is to make sure the proper procedures were followed; that is what is critical.  Consequently, it is not that I am making a judgment on whether someone should be given asylum or whether a person's family can join him or her or anything like that.  All I would do simply is look at the procedures they are supposed to follow, up to and including whatever human rights obligations they have, and ensure they are followed.</p><p>  The same applies to freedom of information legislation.  Someone must ensure the public interest is safeguarded, both for the sake of people who are citizens of this country and for the safety, security and welfare of people who are coming to our shores for whatever reason.  There have been a number of media reports on these issues in the last while, of which the Deputy may be aware.  There are a lot of concerns about them - I am sure they are shared within the public administration - but there is nothing like transparency for all of us to discern what is real, what is imagined, what is gossip or what is actual and to make decisions based on us all being adults and having access to the information we need to have to make informed decisions about such matters.</p></speech>

Does Ms O'Reilly have a sense that the Department of Justice and Equality, the public administration, is moving towards the position she has outlined?  I refer to the issue of culture.</p></speech>

However, as Ombudsman, I appeared before the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions and spoke about the continued exclusion of asylum and immigration issues even from the amended Bill.  It took decades for immigration issues to go through and I know the Department of Justice and Equality has plans for a new Bill or that such plans are on the stocks or somewhere else which will deal with many of these matters.  At the time I told the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions that when this legislation was passed, its members should take a look at the oversight provisions to ascertain whether it was independent and whether it met the criteria they thought probably should be in place to ensure independent oversight.  I told them that if it was not there, they would need to consider this point because I have stated many times that I am probably alone among ombudsmen in Europe in not having that particular area within my remit.</p><p>  The Chairman might allow Mr. Rafferty to respond on the issue of freedom of information legislation.</p></speech>

I am aware that some very strong voices were heard concerning just how far the amendment Bill would go, but my understanding or certainly my experience has been that many of the arguments have been met head-on.  Again, we will wait to see what is included in the published Bill, but there certainly has been some resistance across public bodies in terms of expansion.</p></speech>

In the previous round of this process there were 150 situations where there was disagreement between the Information Commissioner and the then Government.  From what Ms O'Reilly has stated, I assume she has received a written explanation of the reason the Government of the day or the Department was in disagreement with her with regard to the disclosure of that information.  Is this correct?</p></speech>

However, what I did not get from the joint committee the last time, if this is the Chairman's question, was the reasons it had agreed with one but not the other.</p></speech>

I revert to the issue raised by Deputy Mary Lou McDonald to flag it with Ms O'Reilly because members would like to read her material and there might be no harm in her reading our material also.  In our draft report we are extremely conscious of the concerns about refugee management and the whole asylum seeking process.  One comment that has been made is that this could be a Magdalen laundries story in the making, in that in 20 years' time we will be reading back on how things have happened now.  However, to remind members, the joint committee's draft report on this matter contains five specific recommendations.  One concerns the Reception and Integration Agency and how it functions should come under the freedom of information legislation because many private contractors are operating under its aegis.  As they are performing the food and security operations, their terms of reference and contracts should be brought under the scheme.  In addition, information has been placed before members to the effect that there is no database of how many refugees or asylum seekers have died.  As regards the children or siblings of people who have died here, there are questions about the burial arrangements made and whether such persons are buried here or whether the remains are repatriated to the country of origin.  I do not believe this information is available either, which is upsetting for family members who find they have a relative in Ireland and wish to ascertain where the remains are.</p><p>  We are seeking to have the freedom of information legislation applied to the Garda National Immigration Bureau and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.</p> <p>One must also consider aspects of direct provision systems as covered by the FOI legislation.  I include the supply of goods and services.  Who has the potato contract? Ultimately, it is believed the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner is no longer exempt from the FOI requirements.  This is an area in which this committee is possibly in agreement with the general tone of what was said by the Office of the Information Commissioner.</p></speech>

We interpret the stipulation on disclosure by the body without authorisation or by law as allowing for a right of access under the FOI legislation.  If one were to include the non-disclosure provision in the Third Schedule, it would allow for consideration of the public interest.  If the non-disclosure provision remains outside the legislation, there will be no option for an independent review or for consideration of public interest arguments.</p></speech>

I refer Ms O'Reilly to her opening statement on her last review and the report to the committee in 2006.  I want to tease this out a little.  There is clearly a procedural issue or, to use Deputy McDonald's phrase, a cultural issue.  If there were 150 occasions on which the Office of the Information Commissioner disagreed with the Department's interpretation, it obviously put together a significant body of associated work.  Its representatives appeared before an Oireachtas committee and argued their case.  The commissioner outlined why her office disagreed and the committee, by implication, found her to be incorrect, for want of a kinder phrase, on 150 occasions.  This is not possible.  Is the process flawed?  It must be extremely disheartening for Ms O'Reilly to have come before an Oireachtas committee-----</p></speech>

There is a new spirit in Oireachtas committees in regard to how they view themselves, their role and their powers, particularly <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the Executive.  I have appeared before quite a few committees in recent years and have detected a change.</p><p>  On the Deputy's question, there is obviously a lot of work involved.  My office spent a lot of time doing it.  This is not an issue as it is part of my office's responsibilities.  Equally, the Departments have put in a lot of work.  As I stated and as Deputy Fleming will remember, there was excellent engagement.  Questions were asked and the Department's views were put.  As the Chairman stated, committee members are not bound to agree with me; nor is the Department.  Committee members make up their own minds on these matters.</p><p>  At the time in question, I had a strong feeling that there was agreement on many areas.  I did not expect to achieve agreement in every area but found it a bit strange not to have agreement in any area.  It concerned the mood at the time in regard to FOI.  There was general negativity in regard to the matter.  There was an unwillingness to let go of the levers of control and allow an independent body, set up precisely to carry out effectively, ethically and well the role assigned to it in the legislation, to carry out its functions.  Other obstacles got in the way.  At the time in question, there were members of the committee on all sides who were very unhappy with that.</p> <p>I do not know, as an outsider, precisely what went on, although I know the outcome.  Professionally, it was quite frustrating at the time as one felt that one had been asked to perform a certain job under the law and was doing so to the best of one's ability.  It was as if one had come out on the football pitch to play a game but no one else was playing.  It was frustrating but it was a cultural issue.  In certain areas, however, I felt while the Office of the Information Commissioner and the idea of public transparency lost the battle, they won the war.  For example, because of the brouhaha caused not just by the committee hearing on the school inspection reports but also by certain court cases, the Department of Education and Skills got the message and moved to publish all inspection reports.  What was very instructive about that issue was that certain bodies, including the INTO, were saying it was Armageddon, that the entire education system would collapse and that we would get crude league tables coming out as a result, but none of those harms resulted.  There are almost 3,000 whole-school evaluations available and I challenge anyone to make a league table out of them, crude or otherwise, because the language in them is terribly bland.  "There is a lovely English teacher here.  They do geography very well.  The paint is peeling a little bit but the fences are neatly trimmed."  That is the language.  It is a bit of a hobby horse of mine.</p></speech>

I find it astonishing, in relation to health, for example, that there are 28 issues the Department is seeking to exclude.  Of those, Ms O'Reilly disagrees with the Department on 22.  That works out at approximately 80% of cases in respect of which she has a different view from the Department.  With regard to cultural change, transparency and openness, how can we have a situation in which Ms O'Reilly and the Department sit down with the same legislation and guiding principles on freedom of information and come to different conclusions?</p></speech>

There are other interests at play, I presume.  Members of the medical profession, dentists and pharmaceutical companies all have interests, as is their right.  Perhaps they have certain views and have been able to convince the Department that certain harms would arise.  I know I sound a bit like a broken record at this point but there are sufficient protections within the Freedom of Information Act to prevent all of those harms.  It is the role of all of us, including the Department, the committee and the Office of the Information Commissioner, to look fixedly at the public interest and make our decisions accordingly.  That is not to say that people do not have an absolute right to voice their concerns.  Professional bodies may bring a certain level of expertise and awareness to bear.  Equally, that awareness and expertise can be brought to bear where a decision has to be made on the release of a particular record.</p></speech>

NAMA objected initially to being subject to the freedom of information provisions.  Its chairman, Mr. Frank Daly, made comments in that regard and stated that his view was that NAMA's work was so commercially sensitive and important to the country that its confidentiality must be ensured.  I take the view that the work NAMA is doing is so important that there must be a certain amount of oversight and vision as to what it is doing.  No organisation is perfect and, as such, all organisations can be helped by transparency.  Mr. Rafferty spoke about robust debates which had taken place on NAMA.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform stuck to its guns on NAMA and other bodies and it will be before the committee in that regard.  When the news was announced, I said the devil would be in the detail.  While a body might be included in the regime, it may be that all one is allowed to see is the number of paperclips it gets through in a week.  On the other hand, a body might be included in such a way as to provide an insight into how it works.  This will be difficult as they are the experts, but there are enough individuals in my office and in the superior Courts who have a reasonable grasp of the public interest and can make the correct decisions.  It will be for Oireachtas committees such as this to make a call on how effective the regime is when they see the full flowering and what is coming out or not.</p></speech>

We all interact with Departments all the time.  I know Departments that I find very useful in terms of giving information and Departments, or elements within them, that go to great lengths to ensure one gets nothing.  Perhaps it is not a fair question.  If she is not comfortable answering it that is fine, but I would genuinely be interested in her view.</p></speech>

I try to answer everything put to me.  It tends to be difficult to put it in the context of this or that Department.  The Revenue Commissioners can be remarkably good to deal with and have certainly upped their game with regard to their processes in the past number of years.  Due to the way the Department of Justice and Equality is set up in respect of the protections it is afforded regarding its records under FOI and the fact that key areas are outside the remit of the Ombudsman, that Department tends not to give as many records out simply because it is not legally obliged to do so.  I do not like to keep harping on about it but there is a culture within that Department going back through the history of the State.  Perhaps the Department finds it hard to trust in bodies outside its own culture to make what it would see as the right decisions because we might not be aware of this or that factor.  Obviously, I do not agree with that.</p><p>  We have quite significant issues with the Department of Health concerning the seeking of records and we have ongoing discussions with it.  When it claims that a matter is outside my remit, we try to rebut that but it can be very difficult.  The culture in that Department stems from the pressures it is under, the fact that it is continually fighting on so many fronts and the fact that the health service is formed in a particular way but changes a few years later so the personnel change and so on.  It is like trying to grab on to a moving object.  It never stands still.  </p><p>  In respect of culture, the Departments of Justice and Equality and Health might be the most difficult to deal with.  Most Departments do their best.  There are two different cultures at play.  There is the political culture and the culture of the administration of the Civil Service.  When I reference the fact that 11 of the 15 reports that are here predate this current Administration, I cannot say whether the Administration and administrators still hold to this and are now out of kilter with politicians or whether if they were to do them again, they would have a different view because there is a different political culture.</p></speech>

She has been ignored by the political apparatus.  If I understand matters correctly, none of the 36 recommendations made by her was taken on by the last committee.  This appears to show that she has been ignored by the political establishment.  It has taken three years to get this report from the Department of Finance.  That suggests that she has been ignored by various parts of the administrative establishment as well.  Does her office have sufficient power and sanctions?  I know she cannot sanction politicians but does she have any power to compel Departments like the Department of Finance to provide her with information, which is a statutory requirement, when they continue to ignore her?</p></speech>

Sometimes we get involved in issues with Departments or public bodies and we know it is a long play and that one might get slapped back at the beginning but that over time, one will win the war.  I stated my disappointment at what had happened before in respect of the committee.  There were a few other incidents that took place during the last Administration which could have had a detrimental effect on the ability of my office to work effectively on behalf of the people of this country.  One of them was the Lost at Sea report, which we will certainly not revisit during this meeting.  A committee again split on party political lines, agreed with the Department and that was it.  The fallout from that in terms of conversations in the media and among parliamentarians and political parties and comments I made at the time about the proper relationship and power balance between the Executive, Parliament and committees such as this one fed into a wider debate which informed some of the thinking of many political parties during the election.  As a result of that, we have had a number of major changes.  At last, the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act was passed and the FOI legislation is coming through.  For the first time, I have, as Ombudsman, a dedicated committee, namely, the Oireachtas Committee on Investigations, Oversight and Petitions.  I submit that all this stemmed from the fallout from either the issue I had with this committee or the other ones.  It engaged the political and public mind and, over time, had an excellent result.  </p><p>  Obviously I have had to deal with setbacks, but I used every occasion to name what is going on and to say that it was not a kick at me but a kick at Parliament or the people.  It is down to Parliament, as the custodian of all this, to decide what it is going to do about it.  I play my part and then step back.  It is a matter for others to step up to the plate.  </p></speech>

I would like to address two recommendations.  One relates to NAMA and the other to the credit institutions scheme, both of which relate to the Department of Finance.  Her recommendation is that both institutions are covered by FOI within the protections of the Act.  Can we start with the credit institutions scheme?  I guess I have the same question on each.  I will give her an example in a second but I would like to hear her thoughts on what should be available that is not available.  For example, I imagine she would say that within NAMA, there are some things that should not be publicly available for legitimate reasons of commercial sensitivity.  I will give an example of something with which I am dealing.  It is not possible to find out how much money was guaranteed by the deposit guarantee scheme in September 2008 per institution.  The reason given is commercial sensitivity.  This happened five years ago and was a public guarantee of private funds.  The Department of Finance maintains that this is commercially sensitive, which is absolute nonsense.  Under NAMA-----</p></speech>

If it was appealed to me, obviously I would listen to what the organisation had to say and why it thought the information was commercially sensitive, and would consider the public interest concerns before making a judgment.  In regard to what records would be revealed, when it comes under FOI it will have to produce what are known as section 15 manuals, which give a general glossary of the records it holds, the sort of things it does and the processes it has in place.  This would give an indication of the type of records that could be accessed.  The records could include everything from personnel through procurement to correspondence with Departments, the Revenue Commissioners and people trying to buy property.  Everything is potentially accessible through an FOI request.</p><p>  Perhaps one can stand back to consider the public interest in this.  Clearly the public interest is that NAMA should work and that its processes safeguard the public interest and allow it to make a good commercial fist of its work.  That is not necessarily my concern as Information Commissioner.  I am aware this is an overused term but it is a matter of public trust.  In the years leading up to the crash we trusted people and organisations, whether regulators or banks, to do the right thing but it was only when we saw what happened that we started to question them.  I understand the reluctance of bodies such as NAMA to come under the FOI system or to release too much information given that its work is clearly commercially sensitive but its work is also of public interest.  It must also realise that part of the basis on which it can work well is by enjoying the confidence of the public and, indeed, politicians and committees such as this.  In order to earn our trust, we need to have confidence in it and, therefore, to be able to see a sufficient amount of what it is doing.  I do not know how much money NAMA is dealing with but it is a sizeable amount and given the amount of control it enjoys, the number of individual transactions it takes and judgment calls it makes on a daily basis it is my view that it would be in the public interest to see a little more of its business.  That is not to say as Information Commissioner I would be releasing records incontinently.  I, too, must have regard for the public interest.  Any good organisation or public body that comes to us will argue in the public interest exceptionally well if it writes down all the public interest arguments for disclosure, as well as those for non-disclosure.  That should be done so that I and, in time, the courts can take a particular view.</p><p>  There are three stages before requests come in.  First, organisations come under FOI.  Second, when members see the legislation they will be able to judge for themselves how transparent these bodies are likely to be.  Third, we will see what records they hold in a broad sense.  It is only when the outcomes of the requests are known that we will be able to determine the level of transparency.</p></speech>

In my experience, the Data Protection Commissioner takes a default position with regard to the sensitivity of data.  I imagine there is also a default position in respect of the Information Commissioner that as much information as possible should be public.  I am not making a value judgment; I simply presume that is the beginning position in respect of all information.  Has Ms O'Reilly ever made an observation in respect of information in the public domain that she believed should not be public?</p></speech>

It was suggested to the representatives that if information was publicly available they would not get a scoop.  Certain journalists are known for pursuing freedom of information requests.  They may be tipped off about matters or simply have a good nose.  Our job is not to provide the media with scoops by changing the freedom of information legislation.  We are responsible for allowing the public to achieve better accountability from government and the services it provides.  One of the suggestions we have been considering is that some sort of umbrella structure be put in place for journalists irrespective of whether they are freelance or employed by newspapers.  If we are providing for freedom of information to general citizens, that is fine, but freedom of information requests from journalists have a bottom line, namely, to sell more newspapers.  Should there be a charge for them?</p></speech>

I do not take that into account.  They are applying as journalists but they are also members of the public.  A member of the public could request a particular record as validly as a journalist.  How would one draw a distinction?</p><p>  In regard to the Chairman's first point, if I reflected on the records that I had seen, some of which I did not rule to be suitable for release, I do not recall many that would have tilted the world on its axis.  Much information is kept secret or out of the public gaze for irrelevant reasons or simply for the sake of it.  Public bodies could make life easier for themselves if they took an honest look at their records and asked themselves if there is any genuine reason they could not be put on their websites.  As members will be aware, Sweden traditionally had a liberal regime whereby everything was published.  It has been argued that the public in the UK were better served under that country's equivalent of the Official Secrets Act than the people of Sweden.  So much information was publicly available in Sweden that people assumed there was nothing to find, whereas in the UK it was assumed that lots of interesting information was hidden away and people went searching for it.  Journalists will always do their thing and I do not think they can be put into a separate category from members of the public who, for example, are looking for a particular record based on interests in a community project or their own intellectual pursuits.</p></speech>

A few years ago one Department put all FOI requests online in order that a journalist's FOI requests would be visible to everybody, but there was nothing I could do about this because it was open to the Department to do this.  I am not sure if it is still doing it.</p></speech>

Has the office ever received complaints about the disclosure of personal information such as medical, criminal or banking information or financial transactions in which people might have engaged?</p></speech>

Typically, we might have made decisions or rulings in the past to release information.  We talked about inspection reports.  We would have to consult the third party because we would generally be releasing the information in the public interest, acknowledging there was commercial sensitivity or personal information but that there was a public interest in releasing it.  The third party would have an opportunity to say certain information should not be released for whatever reason.  Generally, unauthorised disclosures of information would be more of a data protection issue.</p></speech>

Certain targets have been met - by the end of this month 25% of unresolved mortgage books have to be put in place.  One of the features is that the banks are engaging on confidentiality clauses with customers.  I do not have a difficulty with this because somebody could avail of a write-down of &euro;25,000 and before it gets out the other door of the bar the figure has become &euro;150,000; therefore, there has to be some restraint on the information.  However, I am concerned about how the Central Bank gains access to that information and its level of oversight to see to it that there is uniformity between the banking institutions.  Has the Information Commissioner given any consideration to this?  It is not so much an FOI issue, but the Central Bank which operates on willowy ground would have access to information.</p></speech>

On the information getting out under FOI legislation, the very strong exemptions in respect of personal information would apply.  If people had issues with bodies having information they should not have, it would clearly come under data protection provisions regarding the unauthorised use of personal information.</p></speech>

There is a recommendation in our draft report also under the heading of professional secrecy provisions as asserted and amended in various Acts since the Central Bank Act 1942.  The correspondence details how somebody went to inquire about a bank's behaviour in such a matter and the bank could not disclose to the complainant whether the matter had been investigated or the outcome of any investigation.  Before Matthew Elderfield's departure he said the Central Bank was engaged in looking at that matter.  There is a FOI context to this issue because if the matter cannot be addressed in the context of FOI legislation, it should be addressed within the revision of the legislation governing the Central Bank.  Does the Information Commissioner find that in the way the Central Bank deals with its own internal information some of the information comes into conflict with her role of ensuring information is available to customers?</p></speech>

The Chairman is telling me about these issues and they speak very much to the public interest and the protection civil liberties.  These matters will be teased out only when people begin to use FOI legislation to access these records.</p></speech>

It is free to access personal information and there is a reduced fee for accessing medical records.  I am not hugely exercised about that fee.  I was hugely exercised about the fee for an appeal to my office because it was a barrier to oversight.  By the time a person got to my office the total fee was &euro;240.  In an ideal regime there would be no fees.  If these discussions are ongoing, it would probably be worth looking at best practice overseas.  The United Kingdom considered bringing in fees four or five years ago and decided not to do so based on the principle that the records belonged to the people, that there should be transparency and that it did not chime well if they had to pay for them.  My major concern was about the fee for an appeal to my office.  There is a strong argument to be made that there should be no fees, but it is down to people here to argue that point.</p></speech>

I thank the Information Commissioner.  I would very much like her thoughts on the fact that in the new insolvency legislation there will be a publicly available list of those who have availed of insolvency deals.  The committee has dealt with this issue.  To my mind, it is a name and shame policy.  We do not know who the bondholders are; we do not know how much was guaranteed, but a person who avails of the legislation will have his or her name and the details on a publicly available site.  In her role does Ms O'Reilly think that is reasonable or should that information be protected?</p></speech>

There will be small people involved in these agreements, as well as the bigger boys and girls.  There is a question of fairness and equity in that regard.  If it came to me as an FOI issue, I would be asking what was the public interest in releasing the details of some couple's or family's insolvency arrangements versus the public's right to see that this was not being abused by individuals.  I cannot give a blanket "yes" or "no" answer.  Intuitively one would say it was not fair to people who were caught because the banks threw too much money at them and they were caught in negative equity.  At another level one might say it was fair because they were in hock for so many millions or billions of euro and it is only fair that we see what happens now.</p> <p>I repeat what I have said several times - it is a matter of balancing of public interests.
